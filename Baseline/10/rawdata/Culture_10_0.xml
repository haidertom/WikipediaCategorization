Geophagia is the practice of eating the earth, including soil and chalk. This practice is neither new nor outdated and can be associated with religious beliefs, medication or as part of a regular diet.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;  This act can expose the consumer to [[Toxic Substances|toxic substances]] and parasites found in the ingested earth.&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;

== Name ==

Calabash chalk is identified by different names such as: calabar stone (English), ''la craie'' or ''argile'' (French), ''mabele'' (Lingala in Congo), ''nzu'' ([[Igbo people|Igbo]] of Nigeria), ''ndom'' (Efik/Ibibio Nigeria) ''eko'' (Bini/Edo Nigeria). In addition it is also known as ''ebumba'', ''poto'' and ''ulo''. &lt;ref name=[1] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt; In [[Ghana]] it is known as ''shilè''.

== Location ==

Calabash chalk is found predominantly in Nigeria and other West African communities. Although this geophagic material is native to Africa, as a result of migration of West African's to other nations, it can also be found in ethnic stores in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States|US]].&lt;ref name=[1] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt; Calabash chalk is also eaten amongst women of African descent in the US state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;

== Composition ==

Calabash chalk is a naturally occurring material composed of fossilized sea shells. However it can also be prepared artificially by combining clay, sand, [[wood ash]] and even salt. By molding and heating this mixture, the calabash chalk is obtained.&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt; It is available as a powder, a molded shape or a block.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;

There are different views concerning the components of calabash chalk, the consensus being that the major component is [[Aluminium silicate|aluminum silicate]] hydroxide. This comes from the [[Kaolinite|kaolin]] clay group, making Al2Si2O5(OH)4 a possible formula for calabash chalk. Aside from aluminum silicate hydroxide, calabash chalk is also known to have very high concentrations of lead. The [[Recommendation (European Union)|European Union recommends]] (Commission Regulation, 2001) the amount of lead in food should not exceed 1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, however the amount of lead contained in calabash chalk has been reported (Codex Committee of Food Additives and Contaminants, 2003) to be between 10–50&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.
In addition, other reports of its composition include: [[Aluminium|aluminum]], persistent organic pollutants, [[silicon]], alpha lindane, [[endrin]], [[endosulfan]] 11, [[arsenic]], and [[chromium]].&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;

== Uses ==

The practice of eating calabash chalk is observed by both sexes and different age groups of people of African descent, for the purpose of pleasure. However, it is prevalent among women, predominantly during [[pregnancy]], who claim it prevents [[vomiting]], over-salivation and [[nausea]].&lt;ref name=[1] /&gt; Calabash chalk is also used to make facial masks and soaps.&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;

== Health risks ==

When geophagical materials are consumed and come in contact with [[Gastric acid|digestive fluids]], they have the potential of releasing clinical or sub-clinical toxic effects on an individual.&lt;ref name=[1] /&gt;
There are several reports regarding the health risks of consuming calabash chalk including; the alteration of the normal concentration of [[hemoglobin]], [[red blood cell]] counts and [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]]. Another possible side effect of eating this geophagia is the alteration of growth rate and de-mineralization in the [[Femur|femur bone]].&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt; Other reports suggest that calabash chalk also causes numerous [[Gastrointestinal disease|gastrointestinal disorders]] such as nausea, [[ulcer]]s and [[gastritis]]. This stems from histomorphological changes that calabash chalk causes to the [[stomach]] and [[oesophagus]].&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;

In fiction, '''continuity''' is consistency of the characteristics of people, plot, objects, and places seen by the reader or viewer over some period of time. It is relevant to several media.

Continuity is particularly a concern in the production of film and television due to the difficulty of rectifying an error in continuity after shooting has wrapped up. It also applies to other art forms, including novels, comics, and [[video games]], though usually on a smaller scale.  It also applies to fiction used by persons, corporations, and governments in the public eye.

Most productions have a [[script supervisor]] on hand whose job is to pay attention to and attempt to maintain continuity across the chaotic and typically non-linear production shoot. This takes the form of a large amount of paperwork, photographs, and attention to and memory of large quantities of detail, some of which is sometimes assembled into the [[Bible (writing)|story bible]] for the production. It usually regards factors both within the scene and often even technical details including meticulous records of camera positioning and equipment settings. The use of a [[Polaroid camera]] was standard but has since been replaced by [[digital camera]]s. All of this is done so that, ideally, all related shots can match, despite perhaps parts being shot thousands of miles and several months apart. It is an inconspicuous job because if done perfectly, no one will ever notice.
 
In comic books, continuity has also come to mean a [[canon (fiction)|set of contiguous events]], sometimes said to be "set in the same [[fictional universe|universe]]."

==Continuity errors==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Futurama]] --&gt;
Most continuity errors are subtle and minor, such as changes in the level of drink in a character's glass or the length of a cigarette, and can be permitted with relative indifference even to the final cut. Others can be more noticeable, such as sudden drastic changes in appearance of a character. Such errors in continuity can ruin the illusion of realism and affect [[suspension of disbelief]].

In cinema, special attention must be paid to continuity because films are rarely shot in the order in which they are presented. The shooting schedule is often dictated by location permit issues. For example, a character may return to [[Times Square]] in New York City several times throughout a movie, but as it is extraordinarily expensive to close off Times Square, those scenes will likely be filmed all at once to reduce permit costs. Weather, the ambience of natural light, cast and crew availability, or any number of other circumstances can also influence a shooting schedule.

=== {{anchor|Attempts to prevent continuity errors in film}} Measures against continuity errors in film ===

Film production companies use various techniques to prevent continuity errors. First would be to film all the shots for a particular scene together, and all shots of consecutive scenes together (if the scenes take place together, with no break between them in the film's timeline). This allows actors to remain in costume, in character, and in the same location (and with the same weather, if shooting on location).

The second major technique is for costume designers, production designers, prop masters, and make-up artists to take instant photographs of actors and sets at the beginning and end of each day's shooting (once made possible by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] cameras, now done with digital cameras and cell phones as well). This allows the various workers to check each day's clothing, set, props, and make-up against a previous day's.

The third is to avoid shooting on location entirely, but instead film everything on a studio set. This allows weather and lighting to be controlled (as the shooting is indoors), and for all clothing and sets to be stored in one place to be hauled out the next day from a secure location.

===Editing errors===
Editing errors can occur when a character in a scene references a scene or incident that has not occurred yet, or of which they should not yet be aware.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

An example of an editing error can be seen in the film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), where a scene of people climbing a slope at the start is seen from below and then replayed from above.

===Visual errors===
Visual errors are instant ''discontinuities'' occurring in visual media such as film and television. Items of clothing change colors, shadows get longer or shorter, items within a scene change place or disappear, etc.

One of the earliest examples of a ''visual error'' appears in [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[1914 in film|1914]] movie ''[[The Property Man]]''. Here, in a supposedly smooth step from one room to another, [[the Tramp]] loses his hat in one room, but it is instantly back on his head as he enters the next room. Rather "loose" plots and a lack of [[continuity editing]] made most early films rife with such errors.

Another example occurs in the [[1998 in film|1998]] film ''[[Waking Ned]]'', when two of the film's characters, Jackie and Michael, are walking through a storm towards Ned's house. The umbrella they are under is black during their conversation as they walk towards the house (filmed from slightly above and to the front), yet after cutting to a lower shot (filmed from behind Jackie), Michael walks onscreen from the right holding an [[umbrella]] that is not black but beige, with a brown band at the rim.

Yet another glaring example of poor continuity occurs in the Disney film ''[[Pete’s Dragon]]'' (filmed in 1976). During the song "Brazzle Dazzle Day" when Lampie (Mickey Rooney), Pete (Sean Marshall), and Nora (Helen Reddy) climb the stairs to the top of the lighthouse, Pete's shirt beneath his overalls is orange. But after descending to the bottom again and coming out of the lighthouse door, his shirt is now grey.

Though visual continuity errors are logically confined to visual media, parallel mistakes can occur in text. In "[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|The Miller's Tale]]" in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', a door is ripped off its hinges only to be slowly closed again in the next scene.

===Plot errors===
{{main|Plot hole}}

A plot error, or a plot hole as it's commonly known, reflects a failure in the consistency of the created fictional world. A character might state he was an only child, yet later mention a sibling. In the TV show ''[[Cheers]]'', Frasier Crane's wife Lilith mentions Frasier's parents are both dead. When the character was spun off into ''[[Frasier]]'', his father became a central character with, in a case of [[retroactive continuity]], the explanation that Frasier was embarrassed about his father's lowbrow attitudes and thus claimed his death. This is a frequent occurrence in sitcoms, where networks may agree to continue a show, but only if a certain character is emphasized, leading other minor characters to written out of the show with no further mention of the character's existence, while the emphasized character (usually a [[breakout character]], as in the case of [[Frasier Crane]]) develops a more complete back story that ignores previous, more simplified back stories.

===Homeric Nod===
{{Wiktionary|Homer nods}}
A '''Homeric nod''' (sometimes heard as 'Even Homer nods') is a continuity error. It has its origins in [[Homer]]ic [[epic poetry|epic]].

The [[proverbial phrase]] for it was coined by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars poetica]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Lines 358-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''... et idem'' &lt;br /&gt; ''indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... and yet I also become annoyed whenever the great Homer [[wikt:nod|nod]]s off.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are numerous continuity errors in Homer that resemble "nods", as for example:

*In ''[[Iliad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Book V Lines 576-579&lt;/ref&gt; [[Menelaos]] kills a minor character, Pylaimenes, in combat; who is later&lt;ref&gt;Book XIII Lines 643-659&lt;/ref&gt; still alive to witness the death of his son.
*In ''Iliad'' 9.165-93 three characters, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoinix]], [[Odysseus]], and [[Telamonian Aias|Aias]] set out on an embassy to [[Achilleus]]; however, at line 182 the poet uses a verb in the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form to indicate that there are only two people going; at lines 185ff. verbs in the [[plural]] form are used, indicating more than two; but another dual verb appears at line 192 ("the two of them came forward").

In modern [[Homeric scholarship]] many of Homer's "nods" are explicable as the consequences of the poem being retold and improvised by generations of oral poets. So in the second case cited above, it is likely that two different versions are being conflated: one version with an embassy of three people, another with just two people.

[[Alexander Pope]] was inclined to give Homeric nods the benefit of the doubt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those oft are Stratagems which Errors seem,&lt;br /&gt;Nor is it Homer Nods, but We that Dream. - ''[[Essay on Criticism]]'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Modern usage====
In his online column, ''Best of The Web Today'', [[James Taranto]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' often used the phrase "Homer Nods" as the title of a retraction or correction.

===Aging discrepancies===
The practice of accelerating the age of a television character (usually a child or teenager) in conflict with the timeline of a series and/or the real-world progression of time is popularly known as [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome]], or SORAS.&lt;ref name="Rising Stars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonight.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3215940&amp;fSectionId=434&amp;fSetId=204 |title=Soaps' rising stars |first=Kim |last=Clayton-Millar |date=April 24, 2006 |work=Tonight |publisher=Independent News &amp; Media |accessdate=December 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children unseen on screen for a time might reappear portrayed by an actor several years older than the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bird |first1=S. Elizabeth |title=The Audience in Everyday Life: Living in a Media World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtkAqUHwtrIC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=%22soap+opera+sudden+aging+syndrome%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IrVYVYSWxl&amp;sig=dKEAjt43NsvvEgea73UF-lIt1zw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V0sjS6SHCIj-nAeZ9JzuCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22soap%20opera%20sudden%20aging%20syndrome%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 12, 2009 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-94259-4 |page=135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually coinciding with a recast, this rapid aging is typically done to open up the character to a wider range of storylines, and to attract younger viewers.&lt;ref name="Rising Stars"/&gt; A recent example of this occurring is in the BBC's ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'' series, in which Mordred is initially played by a young child in Season 4, yet suddenly grows up into his late teens in time for the start of Season 5, with the rest of the characters aging by only three years.

The reverse can also happen. On ''[[Lost (TV Series)]]'', the character of 10-year-old [[Walt Lloyd]] was played by 12-year-old [[Malcolm David Kelley]]. The first few seasons took place over the course of just a few months, but by that point Lloyd looked much older than 10. In his remaining few appearances, special effects were used to make him look younger, or the scene took place years later.

==Deliberate continuity errors==

Sometimes a work of fiction may deliberately employ continuity errors, usually for comedy. For example, the [[Marx Brothers]]' classic film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', at the climax of the film, the camera shows a [[shot (filmmaking)|shot]] of [[Groucho Marx]] speaking a line, followed by a shot of something else happening, followed by another shot of Groucho. Each time, Groucho's hat changes, usually to something more outrageous than before (a [[Napoleon]]ic hat, a [[Prussia]]n hat, etc.).

==Dealing with errors==
When continuity mistakes have been made, explanations are often proposed by either writers or fans to smooth over discrepancies. Fans sometimes make up explanations for such errors that may or may not be integrated into [[canon (fiction)|canon]]; this has come to be colloquially known as ''fanwanking'' (a term originally coined by the author [[Craig Hinton]] to describe excessive use of continuity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=AHistory: An Unauthorized History of the ''Doctor Who'' universe |last=Parkin |first=Lance |authorlink=Lance Parkin  |year=2007 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Mad Norwegian Press]] |location=Des Moines, Iowa |isbn=978-0-9759446-6-0 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often when fans do not agree with one of the events in a story (such as the death of a favorite character), they will choose to ignore the event in question so that their enjoyment of the franchise is not diminished. When the holder of the intellectual property discards all existing continuity and starts from scratch it is known as [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooting]]. Fans call a less extreme literary technique that erases one episode the [[reset button technique|reset button]]. See also [[Canon (fiction)#Fanon|fanon]].

Discrepancies in past continuity are sometimes made deliberately; this is known as [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ning. Retcons are also sometimes used to either correct or cover up a perceived error. These changes may be made either by the same writer who made it, or more commonly by an author that has taken over the creative lead of a corporate owned show or publication.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Not to be confused with the continuance of a reality (continuality).

==Real time programs vs traditional films==
Television programs like ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', in which actors have to appear as if it is the same day for 24 consecutive episodes, have raised public recognition of continuity. However, traditional films have frequently had much of the same sort of the issues to deal with; film shoots may last several months and as scenes are frequently shot out of story sequence, footage shot weeks apart may be edited together as part of the same day's action in the completed film. In some ways, ''24'' presents a simpler situation, as costumes and hairstyles generally should ''not'' change very frequently; in many feature films a range of different hairstyles and costumes must be created, changed, and then recreated exactly, as various scenes are shot.

A '''cross-border language''' or '''trans-border language''' is a language spoken by a population ([[ethnic group]] or [[nation]]) that lives in a geographical area in two or several internationally recognized countries that have common land or maritime borders. Cross-border languages are particularly common in [[Africa]] but are found on all other continents as well.

Examples include German (spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and other neighbouring countries), Catalan (spoken in Spain, Andorra and elsewhere), Hungarian (spoken in most countries bordering Hungary) and Gaelic (spoken in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]).

'''Ethos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|θ|ɒ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|iː|θ|oʊ|s}}) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning "character" that is used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation, or ideology. The Greeks also used this word to refer to the power of music to influence emotions, behaviours, and even morals.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Piero and Taruskin, Richard, "Music in the Western World: A History in Documents" (1984) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Early Greek stories of [[Orpheus]] exhibit this idea in a compelling way. The word's use in [[rhetoric]] is closely based on the Greek terminology used by [[Aristotle]] in his concept of the three artistic proofs or [[modes of persuasion]].

==Etymology and origin==
''Ethos'' ({{lang|grc|ἦθος}}, {{lang|grc|ἔθος}}; ''plurals:'' ''ethe'', {{lang|grc|ἤθη}}; ''ethea'', {{lang|grc|ἤθεα}}) is a Greek word originally meaning "accustomed place" (as in {{lang|grc|ἤθεα ἵππων}} "the habitats of horses", ''[[Iliad]]'' 6.511, 15.268),&lt;ref&gt;Proscurcin Jr., ''Der Begriff Ethos bei Homer.'' (2014) pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt; "custom, habit", equivalent to Latin ''[[mores]]''.

''Ethos'' forms the root of ''ethikos'' ({{lang|grc|ἠθικός}}), meaning "moral, showing moral character".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Book 2 (1103a17)&lt;/ref&gt; As an adjective in the neuter plural form ''ta ethika'' ({{lang|grc|τὰ ἠθικά}}), used for the study of morals, it is the origin of the modern English word ''[[ethics]]''.

==Current usage==
In modern usage, ethos denotes the disposition, character, or fundamental values particular to a specific person, people, corporation, culture, or movement. For example, the poet and critic [[T. S. Eliot]] wrote in 1940 that "the general ethos of the people they have to govern  determines the behaviour of politicians".&lt;ref&gt;T. S. Eliot, ''The idea of a Christian society'' (1940) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the historian [[Orlando Figes]] wrote in 1996 that in Soviet Russia of the 1920s "the ethos of the  [[Communist]] party dominated every aspect of public life".&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Figes, ''A people's tragedy: the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], 1891–1924'' (1996) p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This statement requires further elaboration to be intelligible: When used in the rhetorical tradition, in addition to what motivates the individual, ethos establishes credibility for the individual among the audience, which is essential in a successful attempt at persuasion.--&gt;
Ethos may change in response to new ideas or forces. For example, according to the Jewish historian Afrie Krampf, ideas of economic modernization which were imported into [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 1930s brought about "the abandonment of the agrarian ethos and the reception of...the ethos of rapid development".&lt;ref&gt;Afrie Krampf, "Reception of the Developmental Approach in the Jewish Economic Discourse of Mandatory Palestine, 1934–1938," ''Israel Studies,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 15#2, pp. 80–103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==
{{POV-section|date=January 2016}}
In [[rhetoric]], ethos is one of the three artistic proofs (''pistis'', πίστις) or [[modes of persuasion]] (other principles being ''[[logos#Aristotle.27s rhetorical logos|logos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]'') discussed by [[Aristotle]] in '[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]' as a component of argument. Speakers must establish ethos from the start.  This can involve "moral competence" only; Aristotle however broadens the concept to include [[expertise]] and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ethos Dwells Pervasively'' In: ''The Ethos of Rhetoric.'' (2004) pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woerther, ''L'èthos aristotélicien.'' (2007) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Ethos is limited, in his view, by what the speaker says. Others however contend that a speaker's ethos extends to and is shaped by the overall moral character and history of the speaker—that is, what people think of his or her character before the speech has even begun (cf [[Isocrates]]).

According to [[Aristotle]], there are three categories of ethos:

* ''[[phronesis]]''&amp;nbsp;– useful skills &amp; wisdom
* ''[[Arete (excellence)|arete]]''&amp;nbsp;– virtue, goodwill
* ''[[eunoia]]''&amp;nbsp;– goodwill towards the audience

In a sense, ethos does not belong to the speaker but to the audience. Thus, it is the audience that determines whether a speaker is a high- or a low-ethos speaker. Violations of ethos include:

* The speaker has a direct interest in the outcome of the debate (e.g. a person pleading innocence of a crime);
* The speaker has a vested interest or ulterior motive in the outcome of the debate;
* The speaker has no expertise (e.g. a lawyer giving a speech on space flight is less convincing than an astronaut giving the same speech).

Completely dismissing an argument based on any of the above violations of ethos is an informal fallacy ([[Appeal to motive]]). The argument may indeed be suspect; but is not, in itself, invalid.

===Modern interpretations===
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

For Aristotle, a speaker's ethos was a rhetorical strategy employed by an orator whose purpose was to "inspire trust in his audience" (''Rhetorica'' 1380). ''Ethos'' was therefore achieved through the orator's "good sense, good moral character, and goodwill", and central to Aristotelian virtue ethics was the notion that this "good moral character" was increased in virtuous degree by habit (''Rhetorica'' 1380). Aristotle links virtue, habituation, and ''ethos'' most succinctly in Book II of ''Nichomachean Ethics'': "Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching [...] while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit, whence also its name ''ethike'' is one that is formed by a slight variation from the word ''ethos'' (habit)" (952). Discussing women and rhetoric, scholar Karlyn Kohrs Campbell notes that entering the public sphere was considered an act of moral transgression for females of the nineteenth century: "Women who formed moral reform and abolitionist societies, and who made speeches, held conventions, and published newspapers, entered the public sphere and thereby lost their claims to purity and piety" (13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Man Cannot Speak for Her: Volume I; A Critical Study of Early Feminist Rhetoric|last = Campbell|first = Karlyn Kohrs|publisher = Praeger|year = 1989|isbn = |location = |pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crafting an ethos within such restrictive moral codes, therefore, meant adhering to membership of what Nancy Fraser and Michael Warner have theorized as counterpublics. While Warner contends that members of counterpublics are afforded little opportunity to join the dominant public and therefore exert true agency, Nancy Fraser has problematized Habermas's conception of the public sphere as a dominant "social totality"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Publics and Counterpublics|last = Warner|first = Michael|date = 2002|journal = Public Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; by theorizing "subaltern counterpublics", which function as alternative publics that represent "parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses, which in turn permit them to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs" (67).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of the Actually Existing Democracy|last = Fraser|first = Nancy|date = 1990|journal = Social Text|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though feminist rhetorical theorists have begun to offer more nuanced ways to conceive of ethos, they remain cognizant of how these classical associations have shaped and still do shape women's use of the rhetorical tool. Johanna Schmertz draws on Aristotelian ethos to reinterpret the term alongside feminist theories of subjectivity, writing that, "Instead of following a tradition that, it seems to me, reads ethos somewhat in the manner of an Aristotelian quality proper to the speaker's identity, a quality capable of being deployed as needed to fit a rhetorical situation, I will ask how ethos may be dislodged from identity and read in such a way as to multiply the positions from which women may speak" (83).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Constructing Essences: Ethos and the Postmodern Subject of Feminism|last = Schmertz|first = Johanna|date = 1999|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetorical scholar and professor Kate Ronald's claim that "ethos is the appeal residing in the tension between the speaker's private and public self", (39)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Reexamination of Personal and Public Discourse in Classical Rhetoric|last = Ronald|first = Kate|date = 1990|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; also presents a more postmodern view of ethos that links [[credibility]] and identity. Similarly, Nedra Reynolds and Susan Jarratt echo this view of ethos as a fluid and dynamic set of identifications, arguing that "these split selves are guises, but they are not distortions or lies in the philosopher's sense. Rather they are 'deceptions' in the sophistic sense: recognitions of the ways one is positioned multiply differently" (56).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ethos: New Essays in Rhetorical and Critical Theory|last = Susan|first = Jarratt|publisher = Southern Methodist University Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Dallas|pages = 37–69|last2 = Reynolds|first2 = Nedra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetorical scholar Michael Halloran has argued that the classical understanding of ethos "emphasizes the conventional rather than the idiosyncratic, the public rather than the private" (60). Commenting further on the classical etymology and understanding of ''ethos'', Halloran illuminates the interdependence between ''ethos'' and cultural context by arguing that "To have ethos is to manifest the virtues most valued by the culture to and for which one speaks" (60).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Aristotle's Concept of Ethos, or if not His, Someone Else's|last = Halloran|first = Michael|date = 1982|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While scholars do not all agree on the dominant sphere in which ethos may be crafted, some agree that ethos is formed through the negotiation between private experience and the public, rhetorical act of self-expression. Karen Burke LeFevre's argument in ''Invention as Social Act'' situates this negotiation between the private and the public, writing that ethos "appears in that socially created space, in the 'between', the point of intersection between speaker or writer and listener or reader" (45-46).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invention as a Social Act|last = LeFevre|first = K. B.|publisher = Southern Illinois University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nedra Reynolds, "ethos, like postmodern subjectivity, shifts and changes over time, across texts, and around competing spaces" (336). However, Reynolds additionally discusses how one might clarify the meaning of ethos within rhetoric as expressing inherently communal roots. This stands in direct opposition to what she describes as the claim "that ethos can be faked or 'manipulated'" because individuals would be formed by the values of their culture and not the other way around (336). Rhetorical scholar John Oddo also suggests that ethos is negotiated across a community, and not simply a manifestation of the self (47). In the era of mass-mediated communication, Oddo contends, one's ethos is often created by journalists and dispersed over multiple news texts. With this in mind, Oddo coins the term intertextual ethos, the notion that a public figure's "ethos is constituted within and across a range of mass media voices" (48).

In "Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos", scholar Coretta Pittman notes that race has been generally absent from theories of ethos construction, and that this concept is troubling for black women. Pittman writes, "Unfortunately, in the history of race relations in America, black Americans' ethos ranks low among other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. More often than not, their moral characters have been associated with a criminalized and sexualized ethos in visual and print culture" (43).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos: Harriet Jacobs, Billie Holiday, and Sister Souljah|last = Pittman|first = Corretta|date = 2007|journal = Rhetoric Society Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character in Greek tragedy==
The ways in which characters were constructed is important when considering ethos, or character, in [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, ''Aristotle's Poetics.'' (1998) pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus Taber Murray explains that the depiction of a character was limited by the circumstances under which Greek tragedies were presented. These include the single unchanging scene, necessary use of the chorus, small number of characters limiting interaction, large outdoor theatres, and the use of masks, which all influenced characters to be more formal and simple.&lt;ref name=M534&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray also declares that the inherent characteristics of Greek tragedies are important in the makeup of the characters. One of these is the fact that tragedy characters were nearly always mythical characters. This limited the character, as well as the plot, to the already well-known myth from which the material of the play was taken. The other characteristic is the relatively short length of most Greek plays.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Ancient Theater and Performance Culture'' In: ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Theater.'' (2007) pp. 36 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This limited the scope of the play and characterization, so that the characters were defined by one overriding motivation toward a certain objective from the beginning of the play.&lt;ref name=M546&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Murray clarifies that strict constancy is not always the rule in Greek tragedy characters. To support this, he points out the example of Antigone who, even though she strongly defies Creon in the beginning of the play, begins to doubt her cause and plead for mercy as she is led to her execution.&lt;ref name=M59&gt;Murray (1916), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other aspects of the character element in ancient Greek tragedy are worth noting.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, ''Aristoteles über das Wesen und die Wirkung der Tragödie (Kap. 6)'' In: ''Aristoteles. Poetik.'' (2009) pp. 87 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these, which C. Garton discusses, is the fact that either because of contradictory action or incomplete description, the character cannot be viewed as an individual, or the reader is left confused about the character.&lt;ref name=G247&gt;Garton (1957), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; One method of reconciling this would be to consider these characters to be flat, or type-caste, instead of round. This would mean that most of the information about the character centers around one main quality or viewpoint.&lt;ref name=G2478&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable to the flat character option, the reader could also view the character as a symbol. Examples of this might be the Eumenides as vengeance, or Clytemnestra as symbolizing ancestral curse.&lt;ref name=G248&gt;Garton (1957), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another means of looking at character, according to Tycho von Wilamowitz and Howald, is the idea that characterisation is not important. This idea is maintained by the theory that the play is meant to affect the viewer or reader scene by scene, with attention being only focused on the section at hand. This point of view also holds that the different figures in a play are only characterised by the situation surrounding them, and only enough so that their actions can be understood.&lt;ref name=G2489&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garet makes three more observations about character in Greek tragedy. The first is an abundant variety of types of characters in Greek tragedy. His second observation is that the reader or viewer's need for characters to display a unified identity that is similar to human nature is usually fulfilled. Thirdly, characters in tragedies include incongruities and idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref name=G250&gt;Garton (1957), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect stated by Garet is that tragedy plays are composed of language, character, and action, and the interactions of these three components; these are fused together throughout the play. He explains that action normally determines the major means of characterisation. Another principle he states is the importance of these three components' effect on each other; the important repercussion of this being character's impact on action.&lt;ref name=G2501&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 250–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustus Taber Murray also examines the importance and degree of interaction between plot and character. He does this by discussing Aristotle's statements about plot and character in his Poetics: that plot can exist without character, but character cannot exist without plot, and so character is secondary to plot. Murray maintains that Aristotle did not mean that complicated plot should hold the highest place in a tragedy play. This is because the plot was, more often than not, simple and therefore not a major point of tragic interest. Murray conjectures that people today do not accept Aristotle's statement about character and plot because to modern people, the most memorable things about tragedy plays are often the characters.&lt;ref name=M52&gt;Murray (1916), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Murray does concede that Aristotle is correct in that "[t]here can be no portrayal of character [...] without at least a skeleton outline of plot".&lt;ref name=M53&gt;Murray (1916), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character, or ethos, in pictorial narrative==
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

Ethos, or character, also appears in the visual art of famous or mythological ancient Greek events in murals, on pottery, and sculpture, referred to generally as pictorial narrative. Aristotle even praised the ancient Greek painter Polygnotos because his paintings included characterization. The way in which the subject and his actions are portrayed in visual art can convey the subject's ethical character and through this the work's overall theme, just as effectively as poetry or drama can.&lt;ref name=C11&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This characterisation portrayed men as they ought to be, which is the same as Aristotle's idea of what ethos or character should be in tragedy. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 178) Professor Mark D. Stansbury-O'Donnell states that pictorial narratives often had ethos as its focus, and was therefore concerned with showing the character's moral choices. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 175) David Castriota, agreeing with Stansbury-O'Donnell's statement, says that the main way Aristotle considered poetry and visual arts to be on equal levels was in character representation and its effect on action.&lt;ref name=C10&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Castriota also maintains about Aristotle's opinion that "his interest has to do with the influence that such ethical representation may exert upon the public". Castriota also explains that according to Aristotle, "[t]he activity of these artists is to be judged worthy and useful above all because exposure of their work is beneficial to the [[polis]]".&lt;ref name=C10 /&gt; Accordingly, this was the reason for the representation of character, or ethos, in public paintings and sculptures. In order to portray the character's choice, the pictorial narrative often shows an earlier scene than when the action was committed. Stansbury-O'Donnell gives an example of this in the form of a picture by the ancient Greek artist Exekia which shows the Greek hero Ajax planting his sword in the ground in preparation to commit suicide, instead of the actual suicide scene. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 177.) Additionally, Castriota explains that ancient Greek art expresses the idea that character was the major factor influencing the outcome of the Greeks' conflicts against their enemies. Because of this, "ethos was the essential variable in the equation or analogy between myth and actuality".&lt;ref name=C12&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9705">{{Other uses|In Medias Res (disambiguation)}}
A narrative work beginning '''''in medias res''''' ({{IPA-la|ɪn mɛdiaːs reːs|classical}}&lt;!-- n assimilated to labial of next word --&gt;, lit. "into the middle of things"&lt;!--in+acc (preposition) "into", medias (adjective, acc plural, from medius) "middle", res (noun, acc plural, from res) "things"--&gt;) opens in the midst of the plot (cf. ''[[ab ovo]]'', ''[[ab initio]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/284369/in-medias-res |title= In medias res |publisher= ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |accessdate= July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]] is bypassed and filled in gradually, either through dialogue, [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] or description of past events. For example, ''[[Hamlet]]'' begins after the death of Hamlet's father. Characters make reference to King Hamlet's death without the plot's first establishment of said fact. Since the play focuses on Hamlet and the revenge itself more so than the motivation, Shakespeare utilizes ''in medias res'' to bypass superfluous exposition.

Works that employ ''in medias res'' often, though not always, will subsequently use flashback and [[nonlinear narrative]] for exposition of earlier events in order to fill in the [[backstory]]. For example, in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', we first learn about Odysseus's journey when he is held captive on Calypso's island. We then find out, in Books IX through XII, that the greater part of Odysseus's journey precedes that moment in the narrative. On the other hand, Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' has relatively few flashbacks, although it opens in the thick of the [[Trojan War]].

== First use of the phrase ==
The Roman lyric poet and satirist [[Horace]] (65–8 BC) first used the terms '''''ab ōvō''''' ("from the egg") and '''''in mediās rēs''''' ("into the middle of things") in his ''[[Ars poetica]]'' ("Poetic Arts", c. 13 BC), wherein lines 147&amp;ndash;149 describe the ideal [[epic poetry|epic poet]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Horace |authorlink=Horace  |title=Ars poetica   |url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/horace/arspoet.shtml  |language=Latin |quote=nec '''gemino''' bellum Troianum orditur '''ab ovo'''; / semper ad eventum festinat et '''in medias res''' / [...] auditorem rapit}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Nor does he begin the [[Trojan War]] ''from the egg'',
but always he hurries to the action, and snatches the listener ''into the middle of things''. . . .|}}

The "egg" reference is to the [[mythology|mythological]] origin of the [[Trojan War]] in the birth of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] and [[Clytemnestra]] from the double egg laid by [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] following her seduction by [[Zeus]] in the guise of a [[swan]].

== Literary history ==

Probably originated in [[oral tradition]], the narrative technique of beginning a story ''in medias res'' is a stylistic convention of [[epic poetry]], the exemplars in Western literature being the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' (both 7th century BC), by [[Homer]].&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, Christopher John (2004). ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850''. [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]. p. 319. {{ISBN|1-57958-422-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the technique features in the Indian ''[[Mahābhārata]]'' (c. 8th century BC – c. 4th century AD). 

The [[Classics|classical-era]] poet [[Virgil]] (Publius Vergilius Maro, 70–19 BC) continued this literary narrative technique in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which is part of the Greek literary tradition of imitating [[Homer]].&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt; Later works featuring ''in medias res'' include the stories "[[Sinbad the Sailor]]" and "[[The Three Apples]]" from the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (c. 9th century),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–94|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' (12th century), the Spanish ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'' (c. 14th century), the Italian ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (1320) by [[Dante Alighieri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Danteworlds: A Reader's Guide to the Divine Comedy|last=P. Raffa|first=Guy|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=978-0226702704|location=|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Portuguese ''[[The Lusiads]]'' (1572) by [[Luís Vaz de Camões]], ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'' (1581) by [[Torquato Tasso]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667) by  [[John Milton]], and generally in [[Modernist literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Carol (1984). ''Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy: The Inferno''. Barron's Educational Series. p. 24. {{ISBN|0-7641-9107-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern novelists known to extensively employ ''in medias res'' in conjunction with flashbacks include [[William Faulkner]] and [[Toni Morrison]].

[[Edgar Allan Poe]]’s [[The Tell-Tale Heart]] is written in medias res.

== Cinematic history ==
It is typical for [[film noir]] to begin ''in medias res''; for example, a private detective will enter the plot already in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Philosophy of Film Noir|first = Deborah|last=Knight|editor1-first = Mark T. |editor1-last = Conard |editor2-first = Robert |editor2-last = Porfirio |publisher = University Press of Kentucky |year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-8131-9181-2 |page = 208}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' (1947) opens with the murder of Joseph Samuels. As the police investigate the crime, the story behind the murder is told via flashbacks.&lt;ref name="MayerMcDonnell2007"&gt;
{{cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Film Noir |first1 = Geoff|last1 = Mayer |first2 = Brian |last2 = McDonnell |publisher = ABC-CLIO |year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-313-33306-4|pages = 146, 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dead Reckoning (1947 film)|Dead Reckoning]]'' (1947) opens with [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Rip Murdock on the run and attempting to hide in a Catholic church. Inside, the backstory is told in flashback as Murdock explains his situation to a priest.&lt;ref name="MayerMcDonnell2007" /&gt;

The technique has been used across genres, including dramas such as ''[[Through a Glass Darkly (film)|Through a Glass Darkly]]'' (1961),&lt;ref name="Miller1980"&gt;{{cite book |title = Screenwriting for Narrative Film and Television |first = William Charles |last = Miller |publisher = Hastingshouse/Daytrips |year = 1980 |isbn = 978-0-8038-6773-4 |page = 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[8½]]'' (1963),&lt;ref name="Miller1980" /&gt; ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980), and ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' (2002);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovateus.net/innopedia/what-term-medias-res What is the term, In Medias Res?]&lt;/ref&gt; crime thrillers such as ''[[No Way Out (1987 film)|No Way Out]]'' (1987), ''[[Grievous Bodily Harm]]'' (1988),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = New Australian Cinema |first1 = Brian |last1 = McFarlane |first2 = Geoff |last2 = Mayer |publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1992 |isbn = 978-0-521-38768-2 |page = 100}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995),&lt;ref name="MurfinRay2009" /&gt; and ''[[Kill Bill|Kill Bill Volume 2]]'' (2004);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Remade in Hollywood |first = Kenneth |last = Chan |publisher = Hong Kong University Press |year = 2009 |isbn = 978-962-209-056-9 |page = 147}}&lt;/ref&gt; horror films such as ''[[Firestarter (film)|Firestarter]]'' (1984);&lt;ref name="Muir2007"&gt;{{cite book |title = Horror Films of the 1980s |first = John Kenneth |last = Muir |publisher = McFarland |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-0-7864-2821-2 |pages = 135, 389}}&lt;/ref&gt; action films such as many in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] franchise;&lt;ref name="MurfinRay2009"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Bedford Glossary of Critical and Literary Terms|first1 = Ross C. |last1 = Murfin |first2 = Supryia M. |last2 = Ray |publisher = Bedford/St. Martins |year = 2009 |isbn = 978-0-230-22330-1|page = 245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Donnelly2001"&gt;{{cite book |title = Film Music|first = Kevin J.|last = Donnelly |publisher = Edinburgh University Press|year = 2001 |isbn = 978-0-7486-1288-8 |page = 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comedies such as ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964).&lt;ref name="Miller1980"/&gt;

Many [[war films]], such as ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]'' (1998), also begin ''in medias res'', with the protagonists already actively in combat and no prior domestic scenes leading up to the film's events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = wHeroes of Film, Comics and American Culture |chapter = Ridley Scott's Epics: Gender of Violence |first = Danielle |last = Glassmeyer |editor-first = Lisa M. |editor-last = Detora |publisher = McFarland |year = 2009 |isbn = 978-0-7864-3827-3 |pages = 297–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, adaptations of source material may employ ''in medias res'' while the original version did not. For example, the [[Camelot (film)|film adaptation]] of the stage musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' employed ''in medias res'' while the original Broadway version did not (although revivals of the musical have).{{cn|date=July 2017}} Stanley Kubrick's 1962 [[Lolita (1962 film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[Lolita]]'' begins ''in medias res'' although the novel does not.{{cn|date=July 2017}} [[Herman Wouk]]'s stage adaptation of his own novel ''[[The Caine Mutiny]]'' begins ''in medias res'' as it opens with the court-martial that occupies the final section of the novel, telling the earlier part of the story through flashbacks in court-room testimony.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

{{sociolinguistics|left}}
In [[sociolinguistics]], a '''minoritized language''' is a language that is marginalized, persecuted or banned.&lt;ref name="LSE" &gt;[http://www.farocnse.com/documentos/planificacionLSE.pdf Planificación lingüística de la lengua de los signos español (LSE). Pág 63]&lt;/ref&gt; Language minoritization stems from the desire of large nations to establish a common language for commerce and government, or to establish homogeneity for ideological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hornsby|first=Michael|year=2012|title=The End of Minority Languages? Europe's Regional Languages in Perspective|url=http://www.ecmi.de/fileadmin/downloads/publications/JEMIE/2012/HornsbyAgarin.pdf|journal=Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe|volume=11|pages=88–116|via=ECMI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spo" /&gt; Minoritized languages are typically restricted to a smaller range of [[domain (sociolinguistics)|domains]] than [[dominant languages]], and frequently [[one-way bilingualism]] develops when speakers of minoritized languages learn the dominant language, but not vice versa. Speakers of minoritized languages face various consequences, including reduced educational achievement and [[language shift]] in favor of the dominant language.

==Minority vs. minoritized==
A minoritized language differs from a [[minority language]], which means a language used by a small number of speakers,&lt;ref name="LSE"/&gt; or alternately to a language with lesser numerical or political power in a given context.&lt;ref name=spo&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spolsky |first1=Bernard |last2=Hult |first2=Francis M. |title=The Handbook of Educational Linguistics |date=2010|p=266 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444331042 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8nc6nRRbMSQC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=minoritized+language#v=onepage&amp;q=minoritized%20language&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cases in which a language is minoritized while being spoken by a majority of the population, such as some [[indigenous languages]] during the colonization of Africa, when colonial languages were favored.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061110222938/http://www.uzei.com/Modulos/UsuariosFtp/Conexion/archivos26A.pdf Anna Aguilar-Amat Castillo, Mohammed Pathé Sidibé, Joan Vilarnau Dalmaula.

=="Western language ideology"==
{{further|Linguistic imperialism}}
[[Nancy Dorian]], Kathryn A. Davis, and Prem Phyak have argued that there is a "Western language ideology" which applies [[social Darwinism]] to linguistics. This ideology allegedly idealizes [[monolingualism]], denies the [[benefits of multilingualism]], and disdains [[non-standard language varieties]]. Because such non-standard varieties are labeled deficient, a hierarchy of languages is created.{{efn|The prevailing view among contemporary linguists is that regardless of perceptions that a dialect or language is "better" or "worse" than its counterparts, when dialects and languages are assessed "on purely [[linguistics|linguistic]] grounds, all languages—and all dialects—have equal merit".&lt;ref name="on_language"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/12/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-9-12-99-on-language-dialects.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/F/Fox,%20Margalit|title=The Way We Live Now: 9-12-99: On Language; Dialects|last=Fox|first=Margalit|date=12 September 1999|work=The New York Times|ref=harv|accessdate=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contemporary Linguistics|last1=O'Grady |first1=William|last2=Archibald |first2=John |last3=Aronoff |first3=Mark |last4=Rees-Miller |first4=Janie |publisher=Bedford St. Martin's|year=2001|isbn=9780312247386|location=Boston|ref=harv|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|title=An Introduction to Language and Linguistics|last1=Fasold|first1=Ralph W.|last2=Connor-Linton|first2=Jeff|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-521-84768-1|location=Cambridge|ref=harv|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Some authors have drawn a connection between [[anti-immigration sentiment]], especially [[anti-German sentiment]], and [[English-only education]] in the US.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

In Europe, the process of minoritization, for example of the [[Celtic languages]] in Britain and [[Languages of France|minority languages in France]], was connected to the emergence of [[nationalist]] movements calling for the establishment of [[monolingual]], [[monocultural]] [[nation-states]] in the nineteenth century. The process of minoritization then led to [[language shift]] towards English and French.&lt;ref name=Hinton&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hinton |first1=Leanne |last2=Huss |first2=Leena |last3=Roche |first3=Gerald |title=The Routledge Handbook of Language Revitalization |date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317200857 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5zpODwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT375&amp;lpg=PT375&amp;dq=language+death+%22minoritization%22#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20death%20%22minoritization%22&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of minoritization==
The defining characteristic of minoritization is the existence of a power imbalance between it and the dominant language. One sign that a language is minoritized is if its speakers develop [[one-way bilingualism]]—they learn the [[dominant language]], but speakers of the dominant language do not learn the minoritized language. Another frequent symptom of minoritization is the restriction of the language to a limited range of [[language domains|domains]]. A language excluded from use in government and formal education might only be used at home and social situations. Because of the above, speakers of the minoritized language became a subset of speakers of the dominant language;&lt;ref name=Calaforra&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Calaforra |first1=Guillem |title=Lengua y poder en las situaciones de minorización lingüística |url=http://www.uv.es/calaforr/CursColonia.pdf |publisher=Universidad Jagellónica (Cracovia) |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, all speakers of [[Scottish Gaelic]] are also speakers of English, but most English speakers in Scotland do not speak Gaelic.&lt;ref name=MacAulay1992&gt;{{cite book |last=MacAulay |first=Donald|authorlink=Donald MacAulay |title=The Celtic Languages |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521231275  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3kIq1DYAkMC&amp;pg=PA141|p=141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, speakers of a dominant language can carry out all functions of daily life using their native language.&lt;ref name="Calaforra" /&gt; 

Speakers of the dominant language typically use the greater [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] of the dominant language to prevent speakers of the minoritized language from changing the situation to one more favorable to the minoritized language. They use "[[amnesia (sociology)|amnesia]]" and "[[normalization (sociology)|normalization]]" to confuse the reality with what should be, and therefore legitimize the situation in which some languages are minoritized. For example, many "liberal" criticisms of [[language planning]] for minoritized language communities assert that intervention in favor of minoritized languages is equivalent to the policies that caused the language to become minoritized in the first place, such as linguistic legislation, elitism, exclusion of minoritized languages from formal education, and even [[forced population transfer]].&lt;ref name="Calaforra" /&gt;

==Consequences==
In ''Engaged Language Policy and Practices'', the authors cite three studies that have shown that students' academic achievement suffers if policies are implemented that minoritize their native language. [[Nancy Dorian]] has argued that the "Western language ideology" favoring monolingualism has fostered an "ideology of contempt" for minoritized languages.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Kathryn A.|p=19 |last2=Phyak |first2=Prem |title=Engaged Language Policy and Practices |date=2016 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9781317442493 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nTQlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=%22minoritized%22+invented#v=onepage&amp;q=%22minoritized%22%20invented&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of minoritization can lead to language shift in favor of the dominant language.&lt;ref name="Hinton" /&gt;

==Examples==
* In Spain, minority languages such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Euskera|Basque]] were persecuted during the [[Francoism|dictatorship]] of [[Francisco Franco]], due to a desire to eradicate them. The persecution was somewhat counterproductive, because it actually raised their prestige in [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque country]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aulaintercultural.org/article.php3?id_article=1922 |title=Lenguas en guerra |trans-title=Languages in War |first=Irene |last=Lozano |author-link=Irene Lozano |publisher=Aulaintercultural |language=Spanish |date=28 November 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012230845/http://www.aulaintercultural.org/article.php3?id_article=1922 |archive-date=12 October 2008 |dead-url=yes |access-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Russia, speakers of [[Ös language|Ös]] and [[Tofa language|Tofa]], were, respectively, ridiculed for or banned from speaking the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Languages Die|last=Harrison|first=David K.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0195372069|location=|pages=20–21|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Guarani language]] of [[Paraguay]], although spoken by a majority of nationals, is seen as a clear example of minoritized language, due to the socioeconomic and political prevalence of Spanish. Organisations such as [[Yvy Marãe'ỹ]] are advocating against this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanlorenzomuni.gov.py/application/files/3715/2829/5960/Minuta_que_declara_interes_Cultural_Municipal_el_Seminario_Internacional_de_Traduccion..pdf |title=International Seminar on Translation, Terminology and Minoritized Languages |publisher=Municipality of [[San Lorenzo, Paraguay]] |date=30 May 2018}}{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==

A '''mural''' is any piece of artwork painted or applied directly on a wall, ceiling or other permanent surface. A distinguishing characteristic of mural painting is that the architectural elements of the given space are harmoniously incorporated into the picture.

Some wall paintings are painted on large canvases, which are then attached to the wall (e.g., with [[marouflage]]). Whether these works can be accurately called "murals" is a subject of some controversy in the art world,{{Who|date=August 2014}} but the technique has been in common use since the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Willsdon2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clare A.

==History==
[[File:Meister des Mahâjanaka Jâtaka 001.jpg|thumb|[[Jataka]] tales from the [[Ajanta caves]], 7th century]]
Murals of sorts date to [[Upper Paleolithic]] times such as the paintings in the [[Chauvet Cave]] in [[Ardèche]] department of southern [[France]] (around 30,000 BC). Many ancient murals have been found within [[ancient Egypt]]ian tombs (around 3150&amp;nbsp;BC),&lt;ref&gt;Only after 664 BC are dates secure. See [[Egyptian chronology]] for details.{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/chronology/index.html|title=Chronology|accessdate=2008-03-25|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan palaces]] (Middle period III of the Neopalatial period, 1700–1600 BC) and in [[Pompeii]] (around 100 BC – AD 79).

During the Middle Ages murals were usually executed on dry [[Plasterwork|plaster]] (secco). The huge collection of [[Kerala mural painting]] dating from the 14th century are examples of [[fresco secco]].&lt;ref&gt;Menachery, George (ed.): ''The St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India'', Vol. II, 1973; Menachery, George (ed.): ''Indian Church History Classics, Vol. I, The Nazranies'', Saras, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Pallikalile Chitrabhasangal'|url=http://www.nazraney.com/Pazhama--MAY--13_file.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620235620/http://www.nazraney.com/Pazhama--MAY--13_file.pdf|archivedate=2015-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, circa 1300, the technique of painting of frescos on wet plaster was reintroduced and led to a significant increase in the quality of mural painting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/8526688/Mural_Painting_as_a_Medium_Technique_Representation_and_Liturgy Péter Bokody, ''Mural Painting as a Medium: Technique, Representation and Liturgy'', in ''Image and Christianity: Visual Media in the Middle Ages'', Pannonhalma Abbey, 2014, 136-151]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the term became more well-known with the [[Mexican muralism]] art movement ([[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros|David Siqueiros]] and [[José Clemente Orozco|José Orozco]]). There are many different [[Painting style|styles]] and techniques. The best-known is probably ''[[fresco]]'', which uses water-soluble paints with a damp [[Whitewash|lime wash]], a rapid use of the resulting mixture over a large surface, and often in parts (but with a sense of the whole). The colors lighten as they dry.  The ''[[marouflage]]'' method has also been used for millennia.

Murals today are painted in a variety of ways, using oil or water-based media. The styles can vary from abstract to ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' (a French term for "fool" or "trick the eye"). Initiated by the works of mural artists like [[Graham Rust]] or [[Rainer Maria Latzke]] in the 1980s, [[trompe-l'oeil]] painting has experienced a renaissance in private and public buildings in Europe.
Today, the beauty of a wall mural has become much more widely available with a technique whereby a painting or photographic image is transferred to poster paper or [[canvas]] which is then pasted to a wall surface ''(see [[wallpaper]], [[Frescography]])'' to give the effect of either a hand-painted mural or realistic scene.

==Technique==

[[File:Mari fresco Investiture Zimri Lim 0210.jpg|thumb|right|The 18th-century BC fresco of the ''[[Investiture of Zimrilim]]'' discovered at the [[Royal Palace of Mari|Royal Palace]] of ancient [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in [[Syria]] ]]

In the history of mural several methods have been used:

''[[Fresco|A fresco]]'' painting, from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''affresco'' which derives from the adjective ''fresco'' ("fresh"), describes a method in which the paint is applied on [[plaster]] on walls or ceilings. The ''[[buon fresco]]'' technique consists of painting in [[pigment]] mixed with [[water]] on a thin layer of wet, fresh, [[Mortar (masonry)#Lime mortar|lime mortar]] or [[plaster]]. The pigment is then absorbed by the wet plaster; after a number of hours, the plaster dries and reacts with the air: it is this chemical reaction which fixes the pigment particles in the plaster. After this the painting stays for a long time up to centuries in fresh and brilliant colors.

''[[Fresco-secco]]'' painting is done on dry plaster (''secco'' is "dry" in Italian).  The pigments thus require a binding medium, such as [[egg (food)|egg]] ([[tempera]]), glue or [[oil painting|oil]] to attach the pigment to the wall.

''Mezzo-fresco'' is painted on nearly-dry plaster, and was defined by the sixteenth-century author Ignazio Pozzo as "firm enough not to take a thumb-print" so that the pigment only penetrates slightly into the plaster. By the end of the sixteenth century this had largely displaced the ''buon fresco'' method, and was used by painters such as [[Gianbattista Tiepolo]] or [[Michelangelo]].  This technique had, in reduced form, the advantages of ''a secco'' work.

In [[Greco-Roman]] times, mostly [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] colors applied in a cold state were used.&lt;ref&gt;Selim Augusti. La tecnica dell'antica pittura parietale pompeiana.

[[Tempera]] painting is one of the oldest known methods in mural painting. In tempera, the pigments are bound in an albuminous medium such as [[egg yolk]] or [[egg white]] diluted in water.

In 16th-century Europe, [[oil painting]] on canvas arose as an easier method for mural painting. The advantage was that the artwork could be completed in the artist's studio and later transported to its destination and there attached to the wall or ceiling. Oil paint may be a less satisfactory medium for murals because of its lack of brilliance in colour. Also the pigments are yellowed by the binder or are more easily affected by atmospheric conditions. The canvas itself is more subject to rapid deterioration than a plaster ground.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}
Different muralists tend to become experts in their preferred medium and application, whether that be oil paints, emulsion or acrylic paints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=As used by Eric Cumini Murals|url=http://www.cuminitrompeloeil.com|publisher=Eric Cumini|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied by brush, roller or airbrush/aerosols. Clients will often ask for a particular style and the artist may adjust to the appropriate technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto Mural Painting|url=http://torontomuralists.ca/toronto-mural-painting|work=Technical aspects of mural painting|publisher=Toronto Muralists|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consultation usually leads to a detailed design and layout of the proposed mural with a price quote that the client approves before the muralist starts on the work. The area to be painted can be gridded to match the design allowing the image to be scaled accurately step by step. In some cases the design is projected straight onto the wall and traced with pencil before painting begins. Some muralists will paint directly without any prior sketching, preferring the spontaneous technique.

Once completed the mural can be given coats of varnish or protective acrylic glaze to protect the work from UV rays and surface damage.

In modern, quick form of muralling, young enthusiasts also use POP clay mixed with glue or bond to give desired models on a canvas board. The canvas is later set aside to let the clay dry. Once dried, the canvas and the shape can be painted with your choice of colors and later coated with varnish.

[[File:Comersee Spalier rgb.jpg|thumb|[[Computer aided mural|CAM]] designed [[Frescography]] by Rainer Maria Latzke, digitally printed on canvas]]

As an alternative to a hand-painted or airbrushed mural, digitally printed murals can also be applied to surfaces.  Already existing murals can be photographed and then be reproduced in near-to-original quality.

The disadvantages of pre-fabricated murals and decals are that they are often mass-produced and lack the allure and exclusivity of an original artwork. They are often not fitted to the individual wall sizes of the client and their personal ideas or wishes can not be added to the mural as it progresses. The [[Frescography]] technique, a digital manufacturing method ([[Computer aided mural|CAM]]) invented by [[Rainer Maria Latzke]] addresses some of the personalisation and size restrictions.

Digital techniques are commonly used in advertisements. A "wallscape" is a large advertisement on or attached to the outside wall of a building.  Wallscapes can be painted directly on the wall as a mural, or printed on vinyl and securely attached to the wall in the manner of a [[billboard]]. Although not strictly classed as murals, large scale printed media are often referred to as such. Advertising murals were traditionally painted onto buildings and shops by sign-writers, later as large scale poster [[billboards]].

[[File:SBmural.jpg|thumb|left|The [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]] mural]]
Murals are important in that they bring art into the public sphere. Due to the size, cost, and work involved in creating a mural, muralists must often be commissioned by a sponsor. Often it is the local government or a business, but many murals have been paid for with grants of [[patronage]]. For artists, their work gets a wide audience who otherwise might not set foot in an art gallery.  A city benefits by the beauty of a work of art.

Murals can be a relatively effective tool of social emancipation or achieving a political goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/politically-relevant-street-art-has-long-tradition-latin-america |title= Seizing public space |author= Sebastián Vargas |publisher= D+C, development and cooperation|accessdate= 21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murals have sometimes been created against the law, or have been commissioned by local bars and coffeeshops. Often, the visual effects are an enticement to attract public attention to social issues.
State-sponsored public art expressions, particularly murals, are often used by [[totalitarian]] regimes as a tool of propaganda. However, despite the propagandist character of that works, some of them still have an artistic value.

Murals can have a dramatic impact whether consciously or subconsciously on the attitudes of passers by, when they are added to areas where people live and work. It can also be argued that the presence of large, public murals can add aesthetic improvement to the daily lives of residents or that of employees at a corporate venue.

Other world-famous murals can be found in [[Mexico]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Belfast]], [[Derry]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Cuba]] and in [[India]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100314123543/http://rpmurals.home.att.net/]  They have functioned as an important means of communication for members of socially, ethnically and racially divided communities in times of conflict. They also proved to be an effective tool in establishing a dialogue and hence solving the cleavage in the long run.
The [[India]]n state [[Kerala]] has exclusive [[murals]]. These [[Kerala mural painting]] are on walls of [[Hindu]] [[temples]]. They can be dated from 9th century AD.

The [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]] murals of the [[Maya civilization]] in [[Guatemala]], are the oldest example of this art in [[Mesoamerica]] and are dated at 300 BC.

Many rural towns have begun using murals to create tourist attractions in order to boost economic income. [[Colquitt, Georgia]], is one such town. Colquitt was chosen to host the 2010 Global Mural Conference. The town has more than twelve murals completed, and will host the Conference along with [[Dothan, Alabama]], and [[Blakely, Georgia]]. In the summer of 2010, Colquitt will begin work on their Icon Mural.

The [[Mexican Muralism|Mexican mural]] movement in the 1930s brought a new prominence to murals as a social and political tool. [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Orozco]] and [[David Siqueiros]] were the most famous artists of the movement. Between 1932 and 1940, Rivera also painted murals in  [[San Francisco]], [[Detroit]], and [[New York City]]. In 1933, he completed a famous series of twenty-seven fresco panels entitled ''[[Detroit Industry]]'' on the walls of an inner court at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diego Rivera|url=http://www.abcgallery.com/R/rivera/rivera.html|publisher=Olga's Gallery|accessdate=2007-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[McCarthyism]] of the 1950s, a [[:file:Diego Rivera Mural Sign.jpg|large sign]] was placed in the courtyard defending the artistic merit of the murals while attacking his politics as "detestable."

In 1948, the Colombian government hosted the IX Pan-American Conference to establish the [[Marshall plan]] for the Americas. The director of the OEA and the Colombian government commissioned master [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], to paint a mural in the Colombian congress building to commemorate the event. Martinez decided to make it about the [[Congress of Cúcuta|Cúcuta Congress]], and painted [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]] in front of [[Francisco de Paula Santander|Santander]], making liberals upset; so, due to the murder of Jorge Elieser Gaitan the mobs of el [[bogotazo]] tried to burn the capitol, but the Colombian Army stopped them. Years later, in the 1980s, with liberals in charge of the Congress, they passed a resolution to turn the whole chamber in the Elliptic Room 90 degrees to put the main mural on the side and commissioned [[Alejandro Obregon]] to paint a non-partisan mural in the [[surrealist]] style.

[[Northern Ireland]] contains some of the most famous political murals in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Rapp and Markus Rhomberg: Seeking a Neutral Identity in Northern Ireland´s Political Wall Paintings.

In: Machin, D. (Ed.) Visual Communication Reader. De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times, many murals are non-sectarian, concerning political and social issues such as racism and environmentalism, and many are completely apolitical, depicting children at play and scenes from everyday life. (See [[Northern Irish murals]].)

A not political, but social related mural covers a wall in an old building, once a prison, at the top of a cliff in Bardiyah, in Libya.  It was painted and signed by the artist in April 1942, weeks before his death on the first day of the [[First Battle of El Alamein]].  Known as the [[Bardia Mural]], it was created by English artist, private [[John Frederick Brill]].&lt;ref name=" Commonwealth War Graves Commission"&gt;

In 1961 [[East Germany]] began to erect a wall between East and [[West Berlin]], which became famous as the [[Berlin Wall]]. While on the East Berlin side painting was not allowed, artists painted on the Western side of the Wall from the 80s until the fall of the Wall in 1989.

Many unknown and known artists such as [[Thierry Noir]] and [[Keith Haring]] painted on the Wall, the "World's longest [[canvas]]". The sometimes detailed artwork were often painted over within hours or days. On the Western side the Wall was not protected, so everybody could paint on the Wall. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the Eastern side of the Wall became also a popular "canvas" for many mural and [[graffiti]] artists.
[[Orgosolo]], in [[Sardinia]], is a most important center of [[murals]] [[politics]].

It is also common for mural graffiti be used as a memoir. In the book "Somebody Told Me," [[Rick Bragg]] writes about a series of communities, mainly located in New York, that have walls dedicated to the people who died.&lt;ref&gt;Bragg, Rick. ''Somebody Told Me: The Newspaper Stories of Rick Bragg''. New York: Vintage Books, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; These memorials, both written word and mural style, provide the deceased to be present in the communities in which they lived. Bragg states that the "murals have woven themselves in the fabric of the neighborhoods, and the city." These memorials remind people of the deaths caused by inner city violence.

==Contemporary interior design==

===Traditional===
[[File:Forestmural.jpg|thumb|left|Forest mural by ''One Red Shoe'' in private home, England 2007]]
Many people like to express their individuality by commissioning an artist to paint a mural in their home. This is not an activity exclusively for owners of large houses. A mural artist is only limited by the fee and therefore the time spent on the painting; dictating the level of detail; a simple mural can be added to the smallest of walls.

Private commissions can be for dining rooms, bathrooms, living rooms or, as is often the case- children's bedrooms. A child's room can be transformed into the 'fantasy world' of a [[forest]] or [[racing track]], encouraging imaginative play and an awareness of art.

The current trend for feature walls has increased commissions for muralists in the UK. A large hand-painted mural can be designed on a specific theme, incorporate personal images and elements and may be altered during the course of painting it. The personal interaction between client and muralist is often a unique experience for an individual not usually involved in the arts.

In the 1980s, illusionary wall painting experienced a renaissance in private homes. The reason for this revival in interior design could, in some cases be attributed to the reduction in living space for the individual. Faux architectural features as well as natural scenery and views can have the effect of 'opening out' the walls. Densely built up areas of housing may also contribute to people's feelings of being cut off from nature in its free form. A mural commission of this sort may be an attempt by some people to re-establish a balance with nature.

Commissions of murals in schools, hospitals and retirement homes can achieve a pleasing and welcoming atmosphere in these caring institutions. Murals in other public buildings, such as [[public houses]] are also common.

===Graffiti-style===
[[File:Acehotel-002023.jpg|thumb|right|Mint&amp;Serf at [[Ace Hotel]], New York City]][[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] celebrating personal expression]]
Recently, [[graffiti]] and street art have played a key role in contemporary wall painting. Such graffiti/street artists as [[Keith Haring]], [[Shepard Fairey]], [[Above (artist)|Above]], [[1134nyc|Mint&amp;Serf]], [[Futura 2000]], [[Os Gemeos]], and [[Faile (artist collective)|Faile]] among others have successfully transcended their street art aesthetic beyond the walls of urban landscape and onto walls of private and corporate clients. As graffiti/street art became more mainstream in the late 1990s, youth oriented brands such as Nike and Red Bull, with Wieden Kennedy, have turned to graffiti/street artists to decorate walls of their respective offices. This trend continued through 2000's with graffiti/street art gaining more recognition from art institutions worldwide.

===Ethnic===
[[File:Wall_murals_Rajasthani_motif.jpg |thumb|left|200px|Rajasthani motif mural by Kakshyaachitra, Mumbai 2014]]
Many home owners choose to display the traditional art and culture of their society or events from their history in their homes. Ethnic murals have become an important form of interior decoration. [[Warli painting]] murals are becoming a preferred mode of wall decor in India. Warli painting is an ancient Indian art form in which the tribal people used to depict different phases of their life on the walls of their mud houses.

==Tile==
[[File:Azulejos Parque Eduardo VII-2.jpg|thumb|Panel of glazed tiles by Jorge Colaço (1922) depicting an episode from the battle of [[Aljubarrota]] (1385) between the Portuguese and [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] armies.  A piece of public art in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].]]
Tile murals are murals made out of stone, ceramic, porcelain, glass and or metal tiles that are installed within, or added onto the surface of an existing wall. They are also inlaid into floors. Mural tiles are painted, glazed, sublimation printed (as described below) or more traditionally cut or broken into pieces. Unlike the traditional painted murals described above, tile murals are always made with the use of tiles.

Mosaic murals are made by combining small 1/4" to 2" size pieces of colorful stone, ceramic, or glass tiles which are then laid out to create a picture. Modern day technology has allowed commercial mosaic mural makers to use computer programs to separate photographs into colors that are automatically cut and glued onto sheets of mesh creating precise murals fast and in large quantities.

The azulejo ({{IPA-pt|ɐzuˈleʒu}}, {{IPA-es|aθuˈlexo}}) refers to a typical form of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] or [[Spain|Spanish]] painted, [[tin-glazing|tin-glazed]], [[ceramic]] [[tile]]work. They have become a typical aspect of [[Culture of Portugal|Portuguese culture]], manifesting without interruption during five centuries, the consecutive trends in art.

Azulejos can be found inside and outside [[church (building)|church]]es, [[palace]]s, ordinary houses and even [[railway station]]s or [[subway station]]s.

They were not only used as an [[ornament (architecture)|ornamental art]] form, but also had a specific functional capacity like [[temperature control]] in homes. Many azulejos chronicle major historical and cultural aspects of [[Portuguese history]].

Custom-printed tile murals can be produced using digital images for kitchen splashbacks, wall displays, and flooring. Digital photos and artwork can be resized and printed to accommodate the desired size for the area to be decorated. Custom tile printing uses a variety of techniques including dye sublimation and ceramic-type laser toners. The latter technique can yield fade-resistant custom tiles which are suitable for long term exterior exposure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4162">'''New World Syndrome''' is a set of [[non-communicable disease]]s brought on by consumption of [[junk food]] and a [[sedentary lifestyle]], especially common to [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|the indigenous peoples]] of the "[[New World]]" (i.e. of [[the Americas]]). [[Indigenous peoples of Oceania]] and [[Circumpolar peoples]], and perhaps other populations of [[Asian people|Asiatic]] origin are similarly affected and perhaps genetically predisposed.&lt;ref name="Gracey1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gracey|first=Michael|year=1995|title=New World syndrome in Western Australian aborigines|journal=Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=220–225|issn=0305-1870|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1681.1995.tb01985.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119247811/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], and shortened [[life expectancy|life span]].

==Causes==

New World Syndrome is linked to a change from a [[traditional diet]]  and [[physical exercise|exercise]] to a [[Western diet]] and a sedentary lifestyle. Along with the lack of money. Traditional occupations of indigenous people—such as fishing, farming, and hunting—tended to involve constant activity, whereas modern office jobs do not. The introduction of modern transportation such as automobiles also decreased physical exertion.&lt;ref name="Atlantic2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shell|first=Ellen Ruppel|year=2001|title=New World Syndrome - Spam and turkey tails have turned Micronesians into Macronesians.

An allochtoon born outside the Netherlands (from at least one parent also born outside the Netherlands) was labelled first generation allochtoon, an allochtoon born in the Netherlands was labelled a second generation allochtoon. This definition implied that from third generation onwards people (grandparents from abroad, but parents born in the Netherlands) were considered autochtoon.

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] promoted a [[Good Neighbor policy|"good neighbor" policy]] that sought better relations with Mexico.  In 1935, a [[federal judge]] ruled that three Mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white, as required by federal law.  Mexico protested, and Roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white.  The [[U.S. State Department|State Department]], the Census Bureau, the [[U.S. Labor Department|Labor Department]], and other [[government agencies]] therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of Mexican descent as white.  This policy encouraged the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] in its quest to minimize discrimination by asserting their whiteness.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick D. Lukens, ''A Quiet Victory for Latino Rights: FDR and the Controversy over Whiteness'' (University of Arizona Press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Suzanne Césaire (née Roussi) was born on 11 August 1915 in Poterie, Martinique, to Flore Roussi (née William), a school teacher, and Benoït Roussi, a sugar factory worker.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

She began her education at her local primary school in Rivière-Salée in Martinique (which still had the status of a French colonial territory at that time), before attending a girls’ boarding school in the capital, Fort-de-France. Having completed her secondary education, she went to study literature in Toulouse, France, and then in Paris at the prestigious École normale supérieure from 1936-1938.

==University and marriage to Aimé Césaire==

During her first year as a student in Paris, Suzanne (then still named Roussi) meet [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], who introduced her to [[Aimé Césaire]], a fellow student at the École normale supérieure.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, on 10 July 1937, the couple married at the town hall of the 14th arrondissement in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;http://next.liberation.fr/livres/2009/04/23/suzanne-l-aimee-de-cesaire_554226&lt;/ref&gt; During their studies, the Césaires were both part of the editorial team of the militant journal, ''[[L'Étudiant noir]]''. In 1938 the couple had their first child. The following year they returned to Martinique where they both took up teaching jobs at the Lycée Schoelcher.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to have 6 children together, divorcing in April 1963 after 25 years of marriage.

==Literary career==
Suzanne Césaire wrote in French and published seven essays during her career as a writer. All seven of these essays were published between 1941 and 1945 in the Martiniquan cultural journal ''Tropiques'', of which she was a co-founder and editor along with her husband, Aimé Césaire, and [[René Ménil]], both of whom were notable Martiniquan poets. Her writing explored themes such as Caribbean identity, civilisation, and surrealism.

While her writing remains largely unknown to Anglophone readers, excerpts of her essays “Leo Frobenius and the Problem of Civilisations”, “A Civilisation’s Discontent”, “1943: Surrealism and Us”, and “The Great Camouflage” can be found translated into English in the anthology ''The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean'' (Verso, 1996) edited by Michael Richardson.

Césaire had a particular affinity with surrealism, which she described as “the tightrope of our hope”.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Richardson, The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean (Verso, 1996), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay, “1943: Surrealism and Us”, she called for a Martiniquan surrealism:

“Our surrealism will then deliver it the bread of its depths. Finally those sordid contemporary antinomies of black/white, European/African, civilised/savage will be transcended. The magical power of the mahoulis will be recovered, drawn forth from living sources. Colonial stupidity will be purified in the blue welding flame. Our value as metal, our cutting edge of steel, our amazing communions will be recovered.”&lt;ref&gt;Michael Richardson, The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean (Verso, 1996), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzanne Césaire also developed a close relationship with [[André Breton]] following his visit to Martinique in 1941. She dedicated an essay to him (“André Breton, poet”, 1941) and received a poem dedicated to her in return (“For madame Suzanne Césaire”, 1941).&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Blachère, “Breton et Césaire: Flux et reflux d’une amitié”, Europe, Paris, vol. 76, iss. 832, 1998, pp. 146-159 (p. 153).&lt;/ref&gt; This encounter with André Breton opened the way for her development of [[Afro-Surrealism]]&lt;ref&gt;P. Rosemont, ''Surrealist Women'' (2000) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her writing is often overshadowed by that of her husband, who is the better known of the two. However, in addition to her important literary essays, her role as editor of ''Tropiques'' can be regarded as an equally significant (if often overlooked) contribution to Caribbean literature. ''Tropiques'' was the most influential francophone Caribbean journal of its time and is widely acknowledged for the foundational role it played in the development of Martiniquan literature.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; Césaire played both an intellectual and administrative role in the journal’s success.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; She managed the journal’s relations with the censor — a particularly difficult role given the oppositional stance of ''Tropiques'' towards the war-time Vichy government — as well as taking responsibility for the printing.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual impact she had on the journal is underlined by her essay “The Great Camouflage”, which was the closing article of the final issue.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her substantial written and editorial contribution to the journal, the collected works of ''Tropiques'', published by Jean-Michel Place in 1978, credits Aimé Césaire and René Ménil as the journal’s catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nouvelleseditionsplace.com/produit/tropiques/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tropiques'' published its last issue in September 1945, at the end of World War Two.&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliothequekandinsky.centrepompidou.fr/clientbookline/service/reference.asp?output=PORTAL&amp;INSTANCE=INCIPIO&amp;DOCBASE=CGPP&amp;DOCID=0467910&lt;/ref&gt; With the ending of the journal, Suzanne Césaire stopped writing. The reasons for this are unknown. However, journalist Natalie Levisalles suggests that Suzanne Césaire would have perhaps made different choices if she had not had the responsibilities of mothering 6 children, teaching, and being the wife of an important politician and poet, Aimé Césaire.&lt;ref&gt;http://next.liberation.fr/livres/2009/04/23/suzanne-l-aimee-de-cesaire_554226&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, her first daughter, Ina Césaire, remembers her saying regularly: “yours will be the first generation of women who choose”.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Bounoure, “Suzanne Césaire et la question de la civilisation”, ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, http://www.contretemps.eu/wp-content/uploads/01-160-CT6-SYLLEPSE-126-139-1-6.pdf, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having stopped writing she pursued her career as a teacher, working in Martinique, France, and Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt; She was also an active feminist and participated in the Union des Femmes Françaises.&lt;ref&gt;http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages-celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==

Suzanne Césaire was a pioneer in the search for a distinct Martiniquan literary voice. However, following an early edition of ''Tropiques'', she attacked by some Caribbean writers for aping traditional French styles of poetry, supposedly promoting 'The Happy Antilles' view of the island promoted by French colonialism. However, her essay of 1941, Misère d'une poésie, condemned what she termed "Littérature de hamac. Littérature de sucre et de vanille. Tourisme littéeraire" [Literaure of the hammock, of sugar and vanilla. Literary tourism].[1]
Her encounter with André Breton opened the way for her development of Afro-Surrealism[2], which followed in the footsteps of her use of surrealist concepts to illuminate the colonial dilemma.[3] Her dictum - "La poésie martinique sera cannibale ou ne sera pas" [Cannibal poetry or nothing][4] - was an anti-colonial appropriation of a surrealist trope. Suzanne Césaire's repudiation of simple idealised answers - whether assimilationist, Africanist, or creole - to the situation of colonialism in the Caribbean has proved increasingly influential in later postcolonial studies.[6]
