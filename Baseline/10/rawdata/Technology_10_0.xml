[[3G]] [[mobile telephony]] was relatively slow to be adopted 3Gglobally. In some instances, 3G networks do not use the same radio frequencies as [[2G]] so mobile operators must build entirely new networks and license entirely new frequencies, especially so to achieve high data transmission rates. Other delays were due to the expenses of upgrading transmission hardware, especially for [[UMTS]], whose deployment required the replacement of most broadcast towers. Due to these issues and difficulties with deployment, many carriers were not able to or delayed acquisition of these updated capabilities.

In December 2007, 190 3G networks were operating in 40 countries and 154 [[HSDPA]] networks were operating in 71 countries, according to the Global Mobile Suppliers Association (GSA). In Asia, Europe, Canada and the USA, telecommunication companies use [[W-CDMA]] technology with the support of around 100 terminal designs to operate 3G mobile networks.

Roll-out of 3G networks was delayed in some countries by the enormous costs of additional spectrum licensing fees. (See [[Telecoms crash]].)  The license fees in some European countries were [[Telecoms crash|particularly high]], bolstered by government auctions of a limited number of licenses and [[sealed bid auction]]s, and initial excitement over 3G's potential.

The 3G standard is perhaps well known because of a massive expansion of the mobile communications market post-2G and advances of the consumer mophone. An especially notable development during this time is the [[smartphone]] (for example, the [[iPhone]], and the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] family), combining the abilities of a [[PDA]] with a mobile phone, leading to widespread demand for mobile internet connectivity. 3G has also introduced the term "[[mobile internet|mobile broadband]]" because its speed and capability make it a viable alternative for internet browsing, and USB Modems connecting to 3G networks are becoming increasingly common.

==Africa==
The first African use of 3G technology was a 3G video call made in [[Johannesburg]] on the [[Vodacom]] network in November 2004. The first commercial launch was by Emtel-ltd in Mauritius in 2004. In late March 2006, a 3G service was provided by the new company [[Wana (Telecommunications)|Wana]] in Morocco. In May 2007, [[Safaricom]] launched 3G services in Kenya while later that year Vodacom Tanzania also started providing services. In February 2012 Bharti Airtel Launched a 3.75G Network in selected cities in Kenya with a countrywide rollout planned for later in the year. In Egypt, [[Mobinil]] launched the service in 2008 and in Somaliland, [[Telesom]] started first 3G services on 3 July 2011, to both prepaid and postpaid subscription customers.
Telecommunication networks in Nigeria like Globacom, Etisalat, Airtel and MTN provide 3G services to their numerous customers.

==Asia==
Asia is also using 3G services very well. A lot of companies like [[Dialog Axiata PLC]] Sri Lanka (First to serve 3G Service in South Asia in 2006), [[BSNL]], [[WorldCall]], [[PTCL]], [[Mobilink]], [[Zong Pakistan|Zong]], [[Ufone]], [[Telenor PK]],  [[Maxis Communications|Maxis]], [[Vodafone India|Vodafone]], [[Bharti Airtel|Airtel]], [[Idea Cellular]], [[Aircel]], [[Tata DoCoMo]] and [[Reliance Communications|Reliance]] have released their 3G services.

===Sri Lanka===
Sri Lanka's All Mobile Networks([[Dialog Axiata|Dialog]], [[Mobitel (Sri Lanka)|Mobitel]], [[Etisalat (Sri Lanka)|Etisalat]], [[Hutch Sri Lanka|Hutch]], [[Airtel Lanka|Airtel]],) And CDMA Network Providers (Lankabell, Dialog,Suntel,SLT) Launched 3G Services.

[[Dialog Axiata|Dialog]], [[Mobitel (Sri Lanka)|Mobitel]] launched [[4G LTE]] Services In Sri Lanka.
Not Only ([[Dialog Axiata|Dialog CDMA]], Lankabell CDMA Have [[4G LTE]] Services.
Sri Lanka Telecom Have [[4G LTE]] , FTTX Services..

===Afghanistan===
On March 19, 2012, Etisalat Afghanistan, the fastest growing telecommunications company in the country and part of Etisalat Group, announced the launch of [[3G]] services in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etisalat.af/about-us/press-releases/188-etisalat-launches-3g-services-in-afghanistan&lt;/ref&gt; between 2013-2014 all telecommunications company ( [[Afghan Wireless]], [[Etisalat]], [[Roshan (Telecom)|Roshan]], [[MTN Group|MTN]] and [[Salaam Network]]) provided [[3G]], [[3.5G]] and [[3.75G]] services and they are planning for [[4G]] services in 2016-2017.

===Nepal===
Nepal was one of the first countries in southern Asia to launch 3G services. Nepal's first 3G company was [http://ntc.net.np NTC](Nepal Telecom Corporation) and the second was [https://web.archive.org/web/20100315102454/http://ncell.com.np/ Ncell]. Ncell also covered Mount Everest with 3G. [http://ntc.net.np NTC] provides high speed video calling with other 3G services, as well as post-paid and pre-paid 3G SIM cards.

===Pakistan===
{{main|Pakistani Telecom Spectrum Auction}}
3G and 4G was simultaneously launched in Pakistan on April 23, 2014 through a [[Spectrum auction|SMRA Auction]]. Three out of Five Companies got a 3G licence i.e. [[Ufone]], [[Mobilink]] and [[Telenor]] while [[China Mobile]]'s [[Zong Pakistan|Zong]] got 3G as well as a 4G licence. Whereas fifth company, [[Warid Pakistan]] did not participate in the auction procedure, But they launched 4G LTE services on their existing 2G 1800 MHz spectrum due to Technology neutral terms and became world's first Telecom Company to transform directly from 2G to 4G. With that Pakistan joined the 3G and 4G world.
In the non-mobile sector, Pakistan's biggest telecommunication company [[Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd|PTCL]] launched its 3G network, EVO, in mid-2008 and has since then established itself in this sector. It provides 3G services in 105 cities across Pakistan. [[Omantel]]'s [[WorldCall]] also provides 3G services in 50 cities Pakistan-wide. They provide mobile broadband service via dongles and modems. On 14 August 2010, [[Pakistan]] became the first country in the world to experience EVDO's RevB 3G technology that offers maximum speeds of 9.3 Mbit/s. At present the services of EVO Nitro (brand name) are available in [[Islamabad]], [[Rawalpindi]], [[Lahore]] and [[Karachi]]. The RevA network, with speeds if up to 3.1 Mbit/s is available in over 100 cities of the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/699257/spectrum-auction-live-updates/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
State-run mobile operator [[Teletalk]] [[Bangladesh]] limited and other [[GSM]] operators [[GrameenPhone]], [[Banglalink]],  [[Robi]] and [[Bharti Airtel|Airtel]] already started hi-speed [[3G+]] and [[3.5G]] services using [[UMTS]] with [[HSDPA]] facilities. [[Grameenphone]] has a plan to launch [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] services first time in Bangladesh using [[TD-LTE]] technology.  Currently [[Grameenphone]] owned 10&amp;nbsp;MHz spectrum at 3G auction by [[Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission|BTRC]].[[Robi]] and [[Airtel]]  recently merged, newly merged company has a plan to introduce 4G operation soon. Two other data operators, [[Qubee]] and [[Banglalion]], currently offer 4G [[Wimax]] services in Bangladesh. [[CityCell]] now switched off their operation by government order. [[4G LTE]] services have already begun in Bangladesh through all mobile operators except [[Teletalk]], the state run mobile operator. Bangladesh has a plan to introduce super speed [[5G]] service soon. A test run will be conducted in the country in mid July 2018.

===China===
China announced in May 2008, that the telecoms sector was re-organized and three 3G networks would be allocated so that the largest mobile operator, [[China Mobile]], would retain its GSM customer base. [[China Unicom]] would retain its GSM customer base but relinquish its CDMA2000 customer base, and launch 3G on the globally leading W-CDMA (UMTS) standard. The CDMA2000 customers of China Unicom would go to [[China Telecom]], which would then launch 3G on the CDMA2000 1x EV-DO standard. This meant that China would have all three main cellular technology 3G standards in commercial use. Finally in January 2009, Ministry of industry and Information Technology of China awarded licenses of all three standards: TD-SCDMA to China Mobile, W-CDMA to China Unicom and CDMA2000 to China Telecom. The launch of 3G occurred on 1 October 2009, to coincide with the 60th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China.  By August 2011, China Telecom's 3G subscriber has exceeded 23 million
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2011-08/23/content_13173323.htm|title=China Telecom subscribers reach 110.94m|author=China Daily|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
11 December 2008, India entered the 3G arena with the launch of 3G enabled Mobile and Data services by Government owned Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd [[MTNL]] in [[Delhi]] and later in [[Mumbai]]. MTNL becomes the first 3G Mobile service provider in India. After MTNL, another state operator Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. ([[BSNL]]) launched 3G services on 22 Feb 2009 in [[Chennai]] and [[Kolkata]] and later launched 3G as Nationwide. The  [[3G Spectrum auction India|auction of 3G wireless spectrum]] was announced in April 2010 and 3G Spectrum allocated to all private operators on 1 September 2010.

===North Korea===
North Korea has had a 3G network since 2008, which is called [[Koryolink]], a joint venture between Egyptian company [[Orascom Telecom Holding]] and the state-owned Korea Post and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) is [[North Korea]]'s only 3G Mobile operator, and one of only two mobile companies in the country. According to Orascom quoted in [[BusinessWeek]], the company had 125,661 subscribers in May 2010. The Egyptian company owns 75 percent of Koryolink, and is known to invest in infrastructure for mobile technology in developing nations. It covers [[Pyongyang]], and five additional cities and eight highways and railways. Its only competitor, SunNet, uses GSM technology and suffers from poor call quality and disconnections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/idg/2010-05-13/cell-phone-demand-stays-strong-in-north-korea.html |title=Cell phone demand stays strong in North Korea |publisher=Business Week |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phone numbers on the network are prefixed with +850 (0)192.&lt;ref&gt;[[Telephone numbers in North Korea]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
3G services were made available in the [[Philippines]] on December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physorg.com/news9436.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
3G services were made available in Singapore on October 2007. Widespread adoption of 3G began in January 2009, with the upgrading of phones to [[iPhone 3G]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].

==Europe==
In Europe, mass market commercial 3G services were introduced starting in March 2003 by O2 in the UK and Italy. The [[European Union]] Council suggested that the 3G operators should cover 80% of the European national populations by the end of 2005.

==Canada==
In Canada, [[Bell Mobility]], [[SaskTel]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nortel.com/corporate/news/newsreleases/2005b/06_30_05_sasktel.html{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Telus]] launched a 3G EVDO network in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cellphones.ca/news/post001469/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogers Wireless]] was the first to implement UMTS technology, with HSDPA services in eastern Canada in late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kapica Jack |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/article853485.ece |title=Rogers unveils new wireless network |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2006-11-02 |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing they would miss out on roaming revenue from the [[2010 Olympics|2010 Winter Olympics]], [[Bell Canada|Bell]] and [[Telus]] formed a joint venture and rolled out a shared [[HSDPA]] network using [[Nokia Siemens]] technology. After the [[Advanced Wireless Services|AWS]] spectrum in 2008, new entrants to the Canadian wireless markets including but not limited to [[Mobilicity]], [[Wind Mobile]] and [[Vidéotron]] have deployed their own UMTS networks in Canada using the [[Advanced Wireless Services|AWS]] spectrum.

==Middle East==
In [[Iran]] Rightel won the bid for the third Operator license. Rightel is the first 3G operator in Iran. Rightel has commercially launched in the last months of 2011.

In [[Jordan]], Orange is the first mobile 3G operator.

[[Mobitel (Iraq-Kurdistan)|Mobitel]] [[Iraq]] is the first mobile 3G operator in Iraq. It was launched commercially on February 2007.

MTN [[Syria]] is the first mobile 3G operator in Syria. It was launched commercially on May 2010.

In [[Lebanon]] Ministry of Telecoms launched a test period on September 20, 2011, where 4,000 smart-phone users were selected to enjoy 3G for one month and provide feedback. Currently, the test period is over, MTC Touch and Alfa began rolling out the new 3G services.

[[Saudi Arabia]] has got 4G as well as 3G/HSPA With Zain KSA, Saudi Telecom, and Mobily KSA.

==Turkey==
[[Turkcell]], [[Avea]] and [[Vodafone]] launched their 3G networks commercially on 30 July 2009 at the same time. [[Turkcell]] and [[Vodafone]] launched their 3G service on all provincial centres. Avea launched it on 16 provincial centres. It was after Turkey's monopoly mobile operator Turkcell accepted number portability, mobile operators attended frequency band auction and frequencies for 3G usage distributed around mobile operators. [[Turkcell]] got A band, [[Vodafone]] B and [[Avea]] C. Currently [[Turkcell]] and [[Vodafone]] have 3G networks on most of crowded cities and towns. Turkey has 3.9G networks now.

==New Zealand==
In late 2005, [[Vodafone NZ]] launched their 3G network, followed by [[Spark New Zealand|Spark NZ]]'s XT network in 2008, and newcomer [[2degrees]] using a combination of Vodafone's 3G towers and their own in 2009. [[2degrees]] has since built more towers, and is now self-sufficient in the major cities (Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin) but relies on a roaming agreement with Vodafone to cover the rest of the country. This gives it essentially the same footprint as Vodafone.

A '''digital divide''' is an [[economic inequality|economic]] and [[social inequality]] with regard to access to, use of, or impact of [[information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT).&lt;ref name="NTIA95"&gt;U.S. Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). (1995). ''Falling through the net: A survey of the ''have nots'' in rural and urban America''.

==Definitions and usage==
The term ''digital divide'' describes a gap in terms of access to and usage of [[information and communication technology]]. It was traditionally considered to be a question of having or not having access,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but with a global [[mobile phone]] penetration of over 95%,&lt;ref name="ITU-IndividualsUsingTheInternet"/&gt; it is becoming a relative inequality between those who have more and less bandwidth&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"/&gt; and more or fewer skills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MGraham" /&gt; Conceptualizations of the digital divide have been described as "who, with which characteristics, connects how to what":&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011" /&gt;
* Who is the subject that connects: individuals, organizations, enterprises, schools, hospitals, countries, etc.
* Which characteristics&amp;nbsp;or attributes are distinguished to describe the divide: income, education, age, geographic location, motivation, reason not to use, etc.
* How sophisticated is the usage: mere access, retrieval, interactivity, intensive and extensive in usage, innovative contributions, etc.
* To what does&amp;nbsp;the subject connect: fixed or mobile, Internet or telephone, digital TV, broadband, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ishti.org/2016/10/17/can-online-degrees-reduce-global-inequalities-in-education/ "Digital Divide and Global Inequalities in Education"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Different authors focus on different aspects, which leads to a large variety of definitions of the digital divide. "For example, counting with only 3 different choices of subjects (individuals, organizations, or countries), each with 4 characteristics (age, wealth, geography, sector), distinguishing between 3 levels of digital adoption (access, actual usage and effective adoption), and 6 types of technologies (fixed phone, mobile... Internet...), already results in 3x4x3x6 = 216 different ways to define the digital divide. Each one of them seems equally reasonable and depends on the objective pursued by the analyst".&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011" /&gt;
The "digital divide" is also referred to by a variety of other terms which have similar meanings, though may have a slightly different emphasis: digital inclusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/performance/digital-inclusion |title=Dashboard - Digital inclusion |publisher=GOV.UK |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital participation,&lt;ref&gt;https://digitalparticipation.scot/&lt;/ref&gt; basic digital skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetechpartnership.com/basic-digital-skills/basic-digital-skills-framework/ |title=Tech Partnership Legacy |work=Thetechpartnership.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; media literacy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/media-literacy-research |title=Media literacy |publisher=Ofcom |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and digital accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rouse |first=Margaret |url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/digital-accessibility |title=What is digital accessibility? - Definition from WhatIs.com |work=Whatis.techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Digital Inclusion Alliance, a US-based [[nonprofit organization]], has found the term "digital divide" to be problematic, since there are a multiplicity of divides. Instead, they chosen to use the term "digital inclusion", providing a definition:
Digital Inclusion refers to the activities necessary to ensure that all individuals and communities, including the most disadvantaged, have access to and use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).  This includes 5 elements: 1) affordable, robust broadband internet service; 2) internet-enabled devices that meet the needs of the user; 3) access to digital literacy training; 4) quality technical support; and 5) applications and online content designed to enable and encourage self-sufficiency, participation and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= NDIA |year= 2017 |url= https://www.digitalinclusion.org/definitions/ |accessdate= June 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means of connectivity==

===Infrastructure===
The infrastructure by which individuals, households, businesses, and communities connect to the Internet address the physical mediums that people use to connect to the Internet such as desktop computers, laptops, basic mobile phones or [[smartphones]], iPods or other MP3 players, gaming consoles such as Xbox or PlayStation, electronic book readers, and tablets such as iPads.&lt;ref&gt;Zickuher, Kathryn. 2011.

Traditionally the nature of the divide has been measured in terms of the existing numbers of subscriptions and digital devices. Given the increasing number of such devices, some have concluded that the digital divide among individuals has increasingly been closing as the result of a natural and almost automatic process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Compaine, B.M.

The Digital Divide and What to Do About It. New Economy Handbook, p. 824, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn zickuhr. Who's not online and why? Pew Research Center, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have measured the digital divide not in terms of technological devices, but in terms of the existing bandwidth per individual (in kbit/s per capita).&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/asi.23020 | url = http://martinhilbert.net/TechInfoInequality.pdf | volume=65 | issue = 4 | title=Technological information inequality as an incessantly moving target: The redistribution of information and communication capacities between 1986 and 2010 | year=2013 | journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology | pages=821–835 | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin | year = 2016 | title = The bad news is that the digital access divide is here to stay: Domestically installed bandwidths among 172 countries for 1986–2014 | url = http://www.martinhilbert.net/the-bad-news-is-that-the-digital-access-divide-is-here-to-stay | journal = Telecommunications Policy | volume = 40 | issue = 6| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As shown in the Figure on the side, the digital divide in kbit/s is not monotonically decreasing, but re-opens up with each new innovation. For example, "the massive diffusion of narrow-band Internet and mobile phones during the late 1990s" increased digital inequality, as well as "the initial introduction of broadband DSL and cable modems during 2003–2004 increased levels of inequality".&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"/&gt; This is because a new kind of connectivity is never introduced instantaneously and uniformly to society as a whole at once, but diffuses slowly through social networks. As shown by the Figure, during the mid-2000s, communication capacity was more unequally distributed than during the late 1980s, when only fixed-line phones existed. The most recent increase in digital equality stems from the massive diffusion of the latest digital innovations (i.e. fixed and mobile broadband infrastructures, e.g. [[3G]] and fiber optics [[FTTH]]).&lt;ref&gt;SciDevNet (2014) How mobile phones increased the digital divide; http://www.scidev.net/global/data/scidev-net-at-large/how-mobile-phones-increased-the-digital-divide.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Measurement methodologies of the digital divide, and more specifically an Integrated Iterative Approach General Framework (Integrated Contextual Iterative Approach – ICI) and the digital divide modeling theory under measurement model DDG (Digital Divide Gap) are  used to analyze the gap existing between developed and developing countries, and the gap among the 27 members-states of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;Abdalhakim, Hawaf., (2009). An innovated objective digital divide measure, ''Journal of Communication and Computer'', Volume 6, No.12 (Serial No.61), USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paschalidou, Georgia,  (2011), Digital divide and disparities in the use of new technologies, https://dspace.lib.uom.gr/bitstream/2159/14899/6/PaschalidouGeorgiaMsc2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The bit as the unifying variable ====
[[File:Hilbert DigitalBitsDivide.png|thumb |300px |Fixed-line phone and Internet 2000–2010: subscriptions (top) and kbit/s (bottom) per capita&lt;ref&gt;Figures 11 and 12 in [http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/wtim11/documents/inf/015INF-E.pdf "Mapping the dimensions and characteristics of the world’s technological communication capacity during the period of digitization (1986–2007/2010)"]. Hilbert, Martin. Working paper INF/15-E, International Telecommunications Union. December 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Instead of tracking various kinds of digital divides among fixed and mobile phones, narrow- and broadband Internet, digital TV, etc., it has recently been suggested to simply measure the amount of kbit/s per actor.&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertEquip2010"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/01972241003712199 | volume=26 | issue=3 | title=Information Societies or "ICT Equipment Societies?" Measuring the Digital Information-Processing Capacity of a Society in Bits and Bytes | year=2010 | journal=The Information Society | pages=157–178 | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertMapping2011"&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/wtim11/documents/inf/015INF-E.pdf "Mapping the dimensions and characteristics of the world’s technological communication capacity during the period of digitization"], Martin Hilbert (2011), Presented at the 9th World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Meeting, Mauritius: International Telecommunication Union (ITU); free access to the article can be found here: http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/wtim11/documents/inf/015INF-E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has shown that the digital divide in kbit/s per capita is actually widening in relative terms: "While the average inhabitant of the developed world counted with some 40 kbit/s more than the average member of the information society in developing countries in 2001, this gap grew to over 3 Mbit/s per capita in 2010."&lt;ref name="HilbertMapping2011" /&gt; 

The upper graph of the Figure on the side shows that the divide between developed and developing countries has been diminishing when measured in terms of subscriptions per capita. In 2001, fixed-line telecommunication penetration reached 70% of society in developed [[OECD]] countries and 10% of the developing world. This resulted in a ratio of 7 to 1 (divide in relative terms) or a difference of 60% (divide in measured in absolute terms). During the next decade, fixed-line penetration stayed almost constant in OECD countries (at 70%), while the rest of the world started a catch-up, closing the divide to a ratio of 3.5 to 1. The lower graph shows the divide not in terms of ICT devices, but in terms of kbit/s per inhabitant. While the average member of developed countries counted with 29 kbit/s more than a person in developing countries in 2001, this difference got multiplied by a factor of one thousand (to a difference of 2900 kbit/s). In relative terms, the fixed-line capacity divide was even worse during the introduction of broadband Internet at the middle of the first decade of the 2000s, when the OECD counted with 20 times more capacity per capita than the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality" /&gt; This shows the importance of measuring the divide in terms of kbit/s, and not merely to count devices. The International Telecommunications Union concludes that "the bit becomes a unifying variable enabling comparisons and aggregations across different kinds of communication technologies".&lt;ref name="ITUmeasuring2012"&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/idi/material/2012/MIS2012_without_Annex_4.pdf "Chapter 5: Measuring communication capacity in bits and bytes"], in Measuring the report Information Society 2012; ITU (International Telecommunication Union) (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skills and digital literacy===
However, research shows that the digital divide is more than just an access issue and cannot be alleviated merely by providing the necessary equipment. There are at least three factors at play: information accessibility, information utilization and information receptiveness. More than just accessibility, individuals need to know how to make use of the information and communication tools once they exist within a community.&lt;ref&gt;Mun-cho, K. &amp; Jong-Kil, K. (2001).

Park (Eds.), The human society and the Internet: Internet related socio-economic Issues, First International Conference, Seoul, Korea: Proceedings, Springer, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Information professionals have the ability to help bridge the gap by providing reference and information services to help individuals learn and utilize the technologies to which they do have access, regardless of the economic status of the individual seeking help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aqili | first1 = S. | last2 = Moghaddam | first2 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Bridging the digital divide: The role of librarians and information professionals in the third millennium | journal = Electronic Library | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 226–237 | doi = 10.1108/02640470810864118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location===
Internet connectivity can be utilized at a variety of locations such as homes, offices, schools, libraries, public spaces, Internet cafe and others. There are also varying levels of connectivity in rural, suburban, and urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, Gretchen. 2010. Latinos and Digital Technology, 2010.

==Reasons and correlating variables==

The gap in a digital divide may exist for a number of reasons. Obtaining access to ICTs and using them actively has been linked to a number of demographic and socio-economic characteristics: among them income, education, race, gender, geographic location (urban-rural), age, skills, awareness, political, cultural and psychological attitudes.&lt;ref name="MossbergerRacePlace"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawton|first=Tait|title=15 Years of Chinese Internet Usage in 13 Pretty Graphs|url=http://www.nanjingmarketinggroup.com/blog/15-years-chinese-internet-usage-13-pretty-graphs|work=NanjingMarketingGroup.com|publisher=CNNIC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140422192031/http://www.nanjingmarketinggroup.com/blog/15-years-chinese-internet-usage-13-pretty-graphs|archivedate=April 22, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Wensheng.

As for geographic location, people living in urban centers have more access and show more usage of computer services than those in rural areas. Gender was previously thought to provide an explanation for the digital divide, many thinking ICT were male gendered, but controlled statistical analysis has shown that income, education and employment act as [[confounding variables]] and that women with the same level of income, education and employment actually embrace ICT more than men (see [[ICT4D#Women and ICT4D|Women and ICT4D]]).&lt;ref name="HilbertGend2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Hilbert | first= Martin | title = Digital gender divide or technologically empowered women in developing countries?

For example, the [[Digital Divide in Germany|digital divide in Germany]] is unique because it is not largely due to difference in quality of infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/sw_2007/papers/schleife.pdf|title=Regional Versus. Individual Aspects of the Digital Divide in Germany|last=Schliefe|first=Katrin|date=February 2007|website=|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One telling fact is that "as income rises so does Internet use ...",  strongly suggesting that the digital divide persists at least in part due to income disparities.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, R.E. (2010). Foundations of library and information science. 178-179. New York: Neal-Schuman Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, a digital divide stems from poverty and the economic barriers that limit resources and prevent people from obtaining or otherwise using newer technologies.

In research, while each explanation is examined, others must be controlled in order to eliminate [[interaction effects]] or [[Mediation (statistics)|mediating variables]],&lt;ref name="MossbergerRacePlace"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mossberger | first1 = Karen | last2 = Tolbert | first2 = Carolina J. | last3 = Gilbert | first3 = Michele | year = 2006 | title = Race, Place, and Information Technology (IT) | url = | journal = Urban Affairs Review | volume = 41 | issue = 5| pages = 583–620 | doi=10.1177/1078087405283511}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these explanations are meant to stand as general trends, not direct causes. Each component can be looked at from different angles, which leads to a myriad of ways to look at (or define) the digital divide. For example, measurements for the intensity of usage, such as incidence and frequency, vary by study. Some report usage as access to Internet and ICTs while others report usage as having previously connected to the Internet. Some studies focus on specific technologies, others on a combination (such as [[Infostate]], proposed by [[Orbicom-UNESCO]], the [[Digital Opportunity Index]], or [[ITU]]'s [[ICT Development Index]]). Based on different answers to the questions of who, with which kinds of characteristics, connects how and why, to what there are hundreds of alternatives ways to define the digital divide.&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011"/&gt; "The new consensus recognizes that the key question is not how to connect people to a specific network through a specific device, but how to extend the expected gains from new ICTs".&lt;ref&gt;Galperin, H. (2010). Goodbye digital divide, Hello digital confusion? A critical embrace of the emerging ICT4D consensus. Information Technologies and International Development, 6 Special Edition, 53–55&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the desired impact and "the end justifies the definition" of the digital divide.&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011"/&gt;

The Facebook Divide, Facebook native, Facebook immigrants, and Facebook left-behind are concepts for social and business management research. Facebook Immigrants are utilizing Facebook for their accumulation of both bonding and bridging social capital. These Facebook Native, Facebook Immigrants, and Facebook left-behind induced the situation of Facebook inequality. In February 2018, the Facebook Divide Index was introduced at the ICMAPRANE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaipuria.ac.in/icmaprane2018/icmaprane-2018/ |title=ICMAPRANE 2018 |work=Jaipuria.ac.in |date=June 20, 2014 |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; conference in Noida, India, to illustrate the Facebook Divide phenomenon.

Overcoming the divide 
See also|Information and communication technologies for development}}

An individual must be able to connect in order to achieve enhancement of social and [[cultural capital]] as well as achieve mass economic gains in productivity. Therefore, access is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for overcoming the digital divide. Access to ICT meets significant challenges that stem from income restrictions. The borderline between ICT as a [[necessity good]] and ICT as a [[luxury good]] is roughly around the "magical number" of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year,&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = When is Cheap, Cheap Enough to Bridge the Digital Divide? Modeling Income Related Structural Challenges of Technology Diffusion in Latin America| doi = 10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.019| journal = World Development| volume = 38| issue = 5| pages = 756–770| year = 2010| url = http://martinhilbert.net/CheapEnoughWD_Hilbert_pre-print.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that people consider ICT expenditure of US$120 per year as a basic necessity. Since more than 40% of the world population lives on less than US$2 per day, and around 20% live on less than US$1 per day (or less than US$365 per year), these income segments would have to spend one third of their income on ICT (120/365 = 33%). The global average of ICT spending is at a mere 3% of income.&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"/&gt; Potential solutions include driving down the costs of ICT, which includes low cost technologies and shared access through [[Telecentre]]s.

Furthermore, even though individuals might be capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by barriers to entry such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of adequate infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in what they can do and what they can achieve in accessing technology. Some individuals have the ability to connect, but they do not have the knowledge to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them. This leads to a focus on capabilities and skills, as well as awareness to move from mere access to effective usage of ICT.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Karen Mossberger (2003). Virtual Inequality: Beyond the Digital Divide. Georgetown University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] is aiming to raise awareness of the divide by way of the [[World Information Society Day]] which has taken place yearly since May 17, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/in-focus-articles/ United Nations Educational] UNDay&lt;/ref&gt; It also set up the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Task Force in November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/dev2353.doc.htm "UN Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) Task Force Launched Today at Headquarters"], Press Release, United Nations (New York), November 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Later [[UN]] initiatives in this area are the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], which was set up in 2003, and the [[Internet Governance Forum]], set up in 2006.

In the year 2000, the [[United Nations Volunteers|United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme]] launched its Online Volunteering service,&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinevolunteering.org Online Volunteering]&lt;/ref&gt; which uses ICT as a vehicle for and in support of volunteering. It constitutes an example of a volunteering initiative that effectively contributes to bridge the digital divide. ICT-enabled volunteering has a clear added value for development. If more people collaborate online with more development institutions and initiatives, this will imply an increase in person-hours dedicated to development cooperation at essentially no additional cost. This is the most visible effect of online volunteering for human development.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo, Manuel. 2005. [http://www.worldvolunteerweb.org/fileadmin/docdb/pdf/2006/Acevedo_Volunteering_in_the_Information_Society_2005.pdf%20 Volunteering in the information society], Research paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media websites serve as both manifestations of and means by which to combat the digital divide. The former describes phenomena such as the divided users demographics that make up sites such as Facebook and Myspace or Word Press and Tumblr. Each of these sites host thriving communities that engage with otherwise [[marginalized]] populations. An example of this is the large online community devoted to Afrofuturism, a discourse that critiques dominant structures of power by merging themes of science fiction and blackness. Social media brings together minds that may not otherwise meet, allowing for the free exchange of ideas and empowerment of marginalized discourses.

=== Libraries ===
[[File:13394-Laptops Anytime Launch-6629 (10844113484).jpg|thumb|A laptop lending kiosk at [[Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce]]'s Gee Library]]

Attempts to bridge the digital divide include a program developed in Durban, South Africa, where very low access to technology and a lack of documented cultural heritage has motivated the creation of an "online indigenous digital library as part of public library services."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greyling | first1 = E. | last2 = Zulu | first2 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Content development in an indigenous digital library: A case study in community participation | url = | journal = IFLA Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 30–9 | doi = 10.1177/0340035209359570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This project has the potential to narrow the digital divide by not only giving the people of the Durban area access to this digital resource, but also by incorporating the community members into the process of creating it.

To address the divide [[The Gates Foundation]] began the Gates Library Initiative. The Gates Foundation focused on providing more than just access, they placed computers and provided training in libraries. In this manner if users began to struggle while using a computer, the user was in a setting where assistance and guidance was available. Further, the Gates Library Initiative was "modeled on the old-fashioned life preserver: The support needs to be around you to keep you afloat."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blau | first1 = A | year = 2002 | title = Access isn't enough: Merely connecting people and computers won't close the digital divide | url = | journal = American Libraries | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 50–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nations where poverty compounds effects of the digital divide, programs are emerging to counter those trends. Prior conditions in Kenya—lack of funding, language and technology illiteracy contributed to an overall lack of computer skills and educational advancement for those citizens. This slowly began to change when foreign investment began. In the early 2000s, The Carnegie Foundation funded a revitalization project through the Kenya National Library Service (KNLS). Those resources enabled public libraries to provide information and communication technologies (ICT) to their patrons. In 2012, public libraries in the Busia and Kiberia communities introduced technology resources to supplement curriculum for primary schools. By 2013, the program expanded into ten schools.&lt;ref&gt;Pingo, Z. B. (2015). Transition from Camel Libraries to Digital Technologies in Kenya Public Libraries. Public Library Quarterly, 34(1), 63-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effective use==
[[Community Informatics]] (CI) provides a somewhat different approach to addressing the digital divide by focusing on issues of "use" rather than simply "access".   CI is concerned with ensuring the opportunity not only for ICT access at the community level but also, according to [[Michael Gurstein]], that the means for the "effective use" of ICTs for community betterment and empowerment are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|title=Effective use: A community informatics strategy beyond the digital divide|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1107/1027|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurstein has also extended the discussion of the digital divide to include issues around access to and the use of "open data" and coined the term "data divide" to refer to this issue area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|title=Open data: Empowering the empowered or effective data use for everyone?|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/3316/2764|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

===Social capital===
Once an individual is connected, Internet connectivity and ICTs can enhance his or her future social and cultural capital. [[Social capital]] is acquired through repeated interactions with other individuals or groups of individuals. Connecting to the Internet creates another set of means by which to achieve repeated interactions. ICTs and Internet connectivity enable repeated interactions through access to social networks, chat rooms, and gaming sites. Once an individual has access to connectivity, obtains infrastructure by which to connect, and can understand and use the information that ICTs and connectivity provide, that individual is capable of becoming a "digital citizen".&lt;ref name="MossbergerRacePlace"/&gt;

=== Economic disparity ===
In the United States, research provided by Sungard Availability Services notes a direct correlation between a company's access to technological advancements and its overall success in bolstering the economy.&lt;ref name="Forbes1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2016/07/16/lack-of-digital-cloud-opportunities-is-actually-embarrassing-for-employees-survey-suggests/|title=Lack Of Digital, Cloud Opportunities Is Actually Embarrassing For Employees, Survey Suggests|last=McKendrick|first=Joe|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The study, which includes over 2,000 IT executives and staff officers, indicates that 69 percent of employees feel they do not have access to sufficient technology in order to make their jobs easier, while 63 percent of them believe the lack of technological mechanisms hinders their ability to develop new work skills.&lt;ref name=Forbes1/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Additional analysis provides more evidence to show how the digital divide also affects the economy in places all over the world. A BCG Report suggests that in countries like Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K., the digital connection among communities is made easier, allowing for their populations to obtain a much larger share of the economies via digital business.&lt;ref name=EcoGrowth&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.time.com/2014/01/22/the-real-threat-to-economic-growth-is-the-digital-divide/|title=The Real Threat to Economic Growth Is the Digital Divide|last=Foroohar|first=Rana|work=Time|access-date=2017-04-17|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;In fact, in these places, populations hold shares approximately 2.5 percentage points higher.&lt;ref name=EcoGrowth/&gt; During a meeting with the United Nations a Bangladesh representative expressed his concern that poor and undeveloped countries would be left behind due to a lack of funds to bridge the digital gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Closing Digital Divide Critical to Social, Economic Development, Delegates Say at Second Committee Debate on Information and Communications Technologies {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/gaef3432.doc.htm|website=www.un.org|accessdate=September 26, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
The digital divide also impacts children's ability to learn and grow in low-income school districts. Without Internet access, students are unable to cultivate necessary tech skills in order to understand today's dynamic economy.&lt;ref name=RichPoor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalresponsibility.org/digital-divide-the-technology-gap-between-rich-and-poor|title=Digital Divide: The Technology Gap between the Rich and Poor|website=Digital Responsibility|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Federal Communication Commission's Broadband Task Force created a report showing that about 70% of teachers give students homework that demand access to broadband.&lt;ref name="Hwk-Gap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neatoday.org/2016/04/20/the-homework-gap/|title=The Homework Gap: The 'Cruelest Part of the Digital Divide'|date=April 20, 2016|website=NEA Today|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Even more, approximately 65% of young scholars use the Internet at home to complete assignments as well as connect with teachers and other students via discussion boards and shared files.&lt;ref name="Hwk-Gap"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;A recent study indicates that practically 50% of students say that they are unable to finish their homework due to an inability to either connect to the Internet, or in some cases, find a computer.&lt;ref name="Hwk-Gap"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;This has led to a new revelation: 42% of students say they received a lower grade because of this disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Hwk-Gap"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Finally, according to research conducted by the Center for American Progress, "if the United States were able to close the educational achievement gaps between native-born white children and black and Hispanic children, the U.S. economy would be 5.8 percent—or nearly $2.3 trillion—larger in 2050".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.net-ref.com/whitepaper-connected-classroom/|title=The Digital Divide in the Age of the Connected Classroom {{!}} NetRef|date=January 14, 2016|work=NetRef|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demographic differences ===
Furthermore, according to the 2012 Pew Report "Digital Differences", a mere 62% of households who make less than $30,000 a year use the Internet, while 90% of those making between $50,000 and $75,000 had access.&lt;ref name=RichPoor/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Studies also show that only 51% of Hispanics and 49% of African Americans have high-speed Internet at home. This is compared to the 66% of Caucasians that too have high-speed Internet in their households.&lt;ref name=RichPoor/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Overall, 10% of all Americans don't have access to high-speed Internet, an equivalent of almost 34 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/09/technology/the-challenges-of-closing-the-digital-divide.html|title=The Challenges of Closing the Digital Divide|last=Kang|first=Cecilia|date=June 7, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-17|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Supplemented reports from the Guardian demonstrate the global effects of limiting technological developments in poorer nations, rather than simply the effects in the United States. Their study shows that the rapid digital expansion excludes those who find themselves in the lower class. 60% of the world's population, almost 4 billion people, have no access to the Internet and are thus left worse off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/13/internet-not-conquered-digital-divide-rich-poor-world-bank-report|title=Spread of internet has not conquered 'digital divide' between rich and poor – report|last=Elliott|first=Larry|date=January 13, 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Knowledge divide===
Since gender, age, racial, income, and educational gaps in the digital divide have lessened compared to past levels, some researchers suggest that the digital divide is shifting from a gap in access and connectivity to ICTs to a [[knowledge divide]].&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt; A knowledge divide concerning technology presents the possibility that the gap has moved beyond access and having the resources to connect to ICTs to interpreting and understanding information presented once connected.&lt;ref&gt;Sciadas, George. (2003). Monitoring the Digital Divide…and Beyond. [[Orbicom-UNESCO|Orbicom]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second-level digital divide===
The second-level digital divide, also referred to as the production gap, describes the gap that separates the consumers of content on the Internet from the producers of content.&lt;ref name="Reilley"&gt;Reilley, Collen A. Teaching Wikipedia as a Mirrored Technology. First Monday, Vol. 16, No. 1-3, January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As the technological digital divide is decreasing between those with access to the Internet and those without, the meaning of the term digital divide is evolving.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Graham | first1 = M.| title = Time machines and virtual portals: The spatialities of the digital divide| doi = 10.1177/146499341001100303| journal = Progress in Development Studies| volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = 211–227|date=July 2011| citeseerx = 10.1.1.659.9379}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, digital divide research has focused on accessibility to the Internet and Internet consumption. However, with more and more of the population with access to the Internet, researchers are examining how people use the Internet to create content and what impact socioeconomics are having on user behavior.&lt;ref name="MGraham"&gt;Graham, Mark (2014).

New applications have made it possible for anyone with a computer and an Internet connection to be a creator of content, yet the majority of user generated content available widely on the Internet, like public blogs, is created by a small portion of the Internet using population. [[Web 2.0]] technologies like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Blogs enable users to participate online and create content without having to understand how the technology actually works, leading to an ever-increasing digital divide between those who have the skills and understanding to interact more fully with the technology and those who are passive consumers of it.&lt;ref name="Reilley" /&gt; Many are only nominal content creators through the use of Web 2.0, posting photos and status updates on Facebook, but not truly interacting with the technology.

Some of the reasons for this production gap include material factors like the type of Internet connection one has and the frequency of access to the Internet. The more frequently a person has access to the Internet and the faster the connection, the more opportunities they have to gain the technology skills and the more time they have to be creative.&lt;ref name="Schradie"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schradie | first1 = Jen | year = 2011 | title = The Digital Production Gap: The Digital Divide and Web 2.0 Collide | url = http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227005023/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-02-27 | format = PDF | journal = Poetics | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–168 | doi = 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reasons include cultural factors often associated with class and socioeconomic status. Users of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to participate in content creation due to disadvantages in education and lack of the necessary free time for the work involved in blog or web site creation and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Schradie" /&gt;  Additionally, there is evidence to support the existence of the second-level digital divide at the K-12 level based on how educators' use technology for instruction.&lt;ref name="Reinhart"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reinhart | first1 = J. | last2 = Thomas | first2 = E. | last3 = Toriskie | first3 = J. | year = 2011 | title = K-12 Teachers: Technology Use and the Second Level Digital Divide | url = | journal = Journal of Instructional Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = 3/4| page = 181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools' economic factors have been found to explain variation in how teachers use technology to promote higher-order thinking skills.&lt;ref name="Reinhart" /&gt;

The global digital divide describes global disparities, primarily between [[Developed country|developed]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]], in regards to access to computing and information resources such as the [[Internet]] and the opportunities derived from such access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lu | first1 = Ming-te | year = 2001 | title = Digital divide in developing countries | url = http://www.uncg.edu/bae/jgitm/Vol4no3.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Global Information Technology Management | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–4 | doi = 10.1080/1097198x.2001.10856304 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115838/http://www.uncg.edu/bae/jgitm/Vol4no3.pdf | archivedate = August 26, 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with a smaller [[unit of analysis]], this gap describes an inequality that exists, referencing a global scale.

The Internet is expanding very quickly, and not all countries—especially developing countries—are able to keep up with the constant changes. The term "digital divide" doesn't necessarily mean that someone doesn’t have technology; it could mean that there is simply a difference in technology.  These differences can refer to, for example, high-quality computers, fast Internet, technical assistance, or telephone services. The difference between all of these is also considered a gap.

In fact, there is a large inequality worldwide in terms of the distribution of installed telecommunication bandwidth. In 2014 only 3 countries (China, US, Japan) host 50% of the globally installed bandwidth potential (see pie-chart Figure on the right).&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"/&gt; This concentration is not new, as historically only 10 countries have hosted 70–75% of the global telecommunication capacity (see Figure). The U.S. lost its global leadership in terms of installed bandwidth in 2011, being replaced by China, which hosts more than twice as much national bandwidth potential in 2014 (29% versus 13% of the global total).&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"/&gt;

===Versus the digital divide===
The global digital divide is a special case of the digital divide, the focus is set on the fact that "Internet has developed unevenly throughout the world"&lt;ref name=Guillen-2005/&gt;{{rp|681}} causing some countries to fall behind in technology, education, labor, democracy, and tourism.  The concept of the digital divide was originally popularized in regard to the disparity in Internet access between rural and urban areas of the United States of America; the ''global'' digital divide mirrors this disparity on an international scale.

The global digital divide also contributes to the inequality of access to goods and services available through technology.  Computers and the Internet provide users with improved education, which can lead to higher wages; the people living in nations with limited access are therefore disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger 1993; Attewell and Battle 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This global divide is often characterized as falling along what is sometimes called the [[north-south divide]] of "northern" wealthier nations and "southern" poorer ones.

===Obstacles to a solution===
Some people argue that basic necessities need to be considered before achieving digital inclusion, such as an ample food supply and quality health care.  Minimizing the global digital divide requires considering and addressing the following types of access:
;Physical access 
Involves "the distribution of ICT devices per capita…and land lines per thousands".&lt;ref name=Wilson-2004/&gt;{{rp|306}}  Individuals need to obtain access to computers, landlines, and networks in order to access the Internet. This access barrier is also addressed in Article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the United Nations. 
;Financial access
The cost of ICT devices, traffic, applications, technician and educator training, software, maintenance and infrastructures require ongoing financial means.&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5" /&gt;
Financial access and "the levels of household income play a significant role in widening the gap" &lt;ref&gt;“Digital Divide.” The Digital Divide, Stanford University, cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/digital-divide/start.html. Retrieved September 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Socio-demographic access
Empirical tests have identified that several socio-demographic characteristics foster or limit ICT access and usage. Among different countries, educational levels and income are the most powerful explanatory variables, with age being a third one.&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = The end justifies the definition: The manifold outlooks on the digital divide and their practical usefulness for policy-making | doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012 | journal = Telecommunications Policy | volume = 35 | issue = 8 | pages = 715–736| year = 2011 | url = http://martinhilbert.net/ManifoldDigitalDivide_Hilbert_AAM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"/&gt; 

While a Global Gender Gap in access and usage of ICT's exist, empirical evidence show that this due to unfavorable conditions with respect to employment, education and income and not to technophobia or lower ability. On the contrary, in the contexts under study, women with the prerequsites for access and usage turn out to be more active users of digital tools than men.&lt;ref name=HilbertGend2011 /&gt;
;Cognitive access
In order to use computer technology, a certain level of information literacy is needed.   Further challenges include information overload and the ability to find and use reliable information.  
;Design access
Computers need to be accessible to individuals with different learning and physical abilities including complying with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws Section 508] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806075749/http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws |date=August 6, 2013 }} (1998). United States Government.&lt;/ref&gt;  
;Institutional access
In illustrating institutional access, Wilson states "the numbers of users are greatly affected by whether access is offered only through individual homes or whether it is offered through schools, community centers, religious institutions, cybercafés, or post offices, especially in poor countries where computer access at work or home is highly limited".&lt;ref name=Wilson-2004/&gt;{{rp|303}} 
;Political access
Guillen &amp; Suarez argue that "democratic political regimes enable a faster growth of the Internet than authoritarian or totalitarian regimes".&lt;ref name=Guillen-2005/&gt;{{rp|687}}  The Internet is considered a form of e-democracy and attempting to control what citizens can or cannot view is in contradiction to this.  Recently situations in Iran and China have denied people the ability to access certain websites and disseminate information.  Iran has prohibited the use of high-speed Internet in the country and has removed many satellite dishes in order to prevent the influence of [[Western culture]], such as music and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/oct/18/news.iran|first1=Robert|last1=Tait|date=July 23, 2006|title=Iran bans fast internet to cut west's influence|work=The Guardian|location=London|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Cultural access
Many experts claim that bridging the digital divide is not sufficient and that the images and language needed to be conveyed in a language and images that can be read across different cultural lines.&lt;ref name=Carr-2007/&gt; A 2013 study conducted by Pew Research Center noted how participants taking the survey in Spanish were nearly twice as likely to not use the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/25/whos-not-online-and-why/|title=Who’s Not Online and Why|date=September 25, 2013|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

In the early 21st century, residents of developed countries enjoy many Internet services which are not yet widely available in developing countries, including:

* In tandem with the above point, mobile phones and small electronic communication devices;
* E-communities and social-networking;
* Fast broadband Internet connections, enabling advanced Internet applications;&lt;ref&gt;This graphic illustrates the difference in [http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_GraphicalDisplay.aspx?ListNames=%22ICT,%20Fixed%20Broadband,%20Subscribers%20per%20100,%20History%20and%20Forecast%22&amp;HistFor=True&amp;GrpOp=1&amp;Dim1=%22Afr-SubSahar%22,%22EU27%22&amp;File=0 fixed broadband penetration (History and Forecast)] between the European Union and Sub-Saharan Africa from [[International Futures]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Affordable and widespread Internet access, either through [[personal computer]]s at [[home]] or work, through public terminals in [[public library|public libraries]] and [[Internet cafe]]s, and through [[wireless access point]]s;
*[[E-commerce]] enabled by efficient electronic payment networks like [[credit card]]s and reliable [[shipping]] services;
*[[Virtual globe]]s featuring street maps searchable down to individual street addresses and detailed satellite and aerial photography;
* Online [[research]] systems like [[LexisNexis]] and [[ProQuest]] which enable users to peruse [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] articles that may be centuries old, without having to leave home;
* Electronic readers such as Kindle, Sony Reader, Samsung Papyrus and Iliad by iRex Technologies;
*[[Price engine]]s like [[Google Shopping]] which help [[consumer]]s find the best possible online [[price]]s, and similar services like [[ShopLocal]] which find the best possible prices at local [[Retailing|retailer]]s;
*[[Electronic services delivery]] of [[government]] services, such as the ability to pay [[tax]]es, [[fee]]s, and [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] online.
* Further civic engagement through e-government and other sources such as finding information about candidates regarding political situations.

==Global solutions==
{{Main|Information and Communication Technologies for Development}}

There are four specific arguments why it is important to "bridge the gap":&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"&gt;Digital Divide - ICT Information Communications Technology - 50x15 Initiative. (March 21, 2014). Retrieved April 13, 2014, from http://www.internetworldstats.com/links10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

*Economic equality – For example, the telephone is often seen as one of the most important components, because having access to a working telephone can lead to higher safety. If there were to be an emergency situation, one could easily call for help if one could use a nearby phone. In another example, many work related tasks are online, and people without access to the Internet may not be able to complete work up to company standards. The Internet is regarded by some as a basic component of civil life that developed countries ought to guarantee for their citizens. Additionally, welfare services, for example, are sometimes offered via the Internet.&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;
*Social mobility – Computer and Internet use is regarded as being very important to development and success. However, some children are not getting as much technical education as others, because lower socioeconomic areas cannot afford to provide schools with computer facilities. For this reason, some kids are being separated and not receiving the same chance as others to be successful.&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;
*Democracy – Some people believe that eliminating the digital divide would help countries become healthier democracies. They argue that communities would become much more involved in events such as elections or decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|title=Inclusion of excluded groups in decision-making in the development of technologies|last=Social Impact Open Repository|first=|date=2011|website=SIOR|archive-url=http://www.sior.ub.edu|archive-date=September 5, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;
*Economic growth – It is believed that less developed nations could gain quick access to economic growth if the information infrastructure were to be developed and well used. By improving the latest technologies, certain countries and industries are able to gain a competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;

While these four arguments are meant to lead to a solution to the digital divide, there are a couple other components that need to be considered. The first one is rural living versus suburban living. Rural areas used to have very minimal access to the Internet, for example. However, nowadays, power lines and satellites are used to increase the availability in these areas. Another component to keep in mind is disabilities. Some people may have the highest quality technologies, but a disability they have may keep them from using these technologies to their fullest extent.&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;

Using previous studies (Gamos, 2003; Nsengiyuma &amp; Stork, 2005; Harwit, 2004 as cited in James), James asserts that in developing countries, "internet use has taken place overwhelmingly among the upper-income, educated, and urban segments" largely due to the high literacy rates of this sector of the population.&lt;ref name=James-2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = J | year = 2008 | title = Digital Divide Complacency: Misconceptions and Dangers | journal = The Information Society | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 54–61 | doi = 10.1080/01972240701774790 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|58}} As such, James suggests that part of the solution requires that developing countries first build up the literacy/language skills, computer literacy, and technical competence that low-income and rural populations need in order to make use of ICT.

It has also been suggested that there is a correlation between democrat regimes and the growth of the Internet. One hypothesis by Gullen is, "The more democratic the polity, the greater the Internet use...Government can try to control the Internet by monopolizing control" and Norris ''et al.'' also contends, "If there is less government control of it, the Internet flourishes, and it is associated with greater democracy and civil liberties.&lt;ref name=PickAndAzari-2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pick | first1 = J. | last2 = Azari | first2 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Global Digital Divide: Influence of Socioeconomic, Governmental, and Accessibility Factors on Information Technology | url = | journal = Information Technology for Development | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 91–115 | doi=10.1002/itdj.20095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an economic perspective, Pick and Azari state that "in developing nations…foreign direct investment (FDI), primary education, educational investment, access to education, and government prioritization of ICT as all important".&lt;ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/&gt;{{rp|112}} Specific solutions proposed by the study include: "invest in stimulating, attracting, and growing creative technical and scientific workforce; increase the access to education and digital literacy; reduce the gender divide and empower women to participate in the ICT workforce; emphasize investing in intensive Research and Development for selected metropolitan areas and regions within nations".&lt;ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/&gt;{{rp|111}}

There are projects worldwide that have implemented, to various degrees, the solutions outlined above.  Many such projects have taken the form of Information Communications Technology Centers (ICT centers).  Rahnman explains that "the main role of ICT intermediaries is defined as an organization providing effective support to local communities in the use and adaptation of technology.  Most commonly an ICT intermediary will be a specialized organization from outside the community, such as a non-governmental organization, local government, or international donor. On the other hand, a social intermediary is defined as a local institution from within the community, such as a community-based organization.&lt;ref&gt;Rahman, H. (2006). ''Empowering Marginal Communities and Information Networking''. Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128}}

Other proposed solutions that the Internet promises for developing countries are the provision of efficient communications within and among developing countries, so that citizens worldwide can effectively help each other to solve their own problems. Grameen Banks and Kiva loans are two microcredit systems designed to help citizens worldwide to contribute online towards entrepreneurship in developing communities. Economic opportunities range from entrepreneurs who can afford the hardware and broadband access required to maintain Internet cafés to agribusinesses having control over the seeds they plant.

At the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the IMARA organization (from [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for "power") sponsors a variety of outreach programs which bridge the Global Digital Divide. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run under the aegis of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] (CSAIL) and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, install and donate computer setups in greater [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Kenya]], Indian reservations the American Southwest such as the [[Navajo Nation]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]]. The CommuniTech project strives to empower underserved communities through sustainable technology and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Fizz|first1=Robyn|last2=Mansur|first2=Karla|title=Helping MIT neighbors cross the 'digital divide'|newspaper=MIT Tech Talk|date=June 4, 2008|publisher=Cambridge: MIT|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/techtalk52-28.pdf|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://imara.csail.mit.edu/ IMARA Project at MIT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fizz, Robyn, [http://ist.mit.edu/news/communitech "CommuniTech Works Locally to Bridge the Digital Divide"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818173543/http://ist.mit.edu/news/communitech |date=August 18, 2011 }}, ''IST News'', MIT, April 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dominik Hartmann of the MIT's Media Lab, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to bridge the global digital divide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Hartmann|first1=Dominik|title=Building bridges|newspaper=D+C, development&amp;cooperation|date=March 25, 2016|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/innovative-interdisciplinary-approaches-needed-tackle-digital-divide-and-growing-inequality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the premise that any effective solution must be decentralized, allowing the local communities in developing nations to generate their own content, one scholar has posited that social media—like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter—may be useful tools in closing the divide.&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ali | first1 = Amir | year = 2011 | title = The Power of Social Media in Developing Nations: New Tools for Closing the Global Digital Divide and Beyond | url = http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/185-220.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Harvard Human Rights Journal | volume = 24 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Amir Hatem Ali suggests, "the popularity and generative nature of social media empower individuals to combat some of the main obstacles to bridging the digital divide".&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"/&gt;{{rp|188}} Facebook’s statistics reinforce this claim. According to Facebook, more than seventy-five percent of its users reside outside of the US.&lt;ref name=FacebookStats-2011&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics "Facebook Statistics"], 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018164409/http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics |date=October 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, more than seventy languages are presented on its website.&lt;ref name=FacebookStats-2011/&gt; The reasons for the high number of international users are due to many the qualities of Facebook and other social media. Amongst them, are its ability to offer a means of interacting with others, user-friendly features, and the fact that most sites are available at no cost.&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"/&gt; The problem with social media, however, is that it can be accessible, provided that there is physical access.&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"/&gt; Nevertheless, with its ability to encourage digital inclusion, social media can be used as a tool to bridge the global digital divide.&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"/&gt;

Some cities in the world have started programs to bridge the digital divide for their residents, school children, students, parents and the elderly. One such program, founded in 1996, was sponsored by the city of Boston and called the Boston Digital Bridge Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021008225433/http://www.digitalbridgefoundation.org/ (Boston) Digital Bridge Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; It especially concentrates on school children and their parents, helping to make both equally and similarly knowledgeable about computers, using application programs, and navigating the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=1479 "Mayor Menino, Boston Digital Bridge Foundation Host Evening on the Bridge 2.0 Celebration"], Mayor's Office, Boston, Press Release, September 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/default.aspx?id=4765 "City of Boston Receives $4.3 Million Grant That Will Give Training, Computers and Opportunity to Underserved Communities"], City of Boston press office, September 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free Basics===
{{Main|Free Basics}}

Free Basics is a partnership between social networking services company Facebook and six companies (Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera Software, Nokia and Qualcomm) that plans to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries by increasing efficiency, and facilitating the development of new business models around the provision of Internet access. In the whitepaper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scontent-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/12057105_1001874746531417_622371037_n.pdf?oh=4a6afa24c125a3debe1784bcacefa8b4&amp;oe=5B03C427|title=Is connectivity a human right?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; realised by Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, connectivity is asserted as a "human right", and Internet.org is created to improve Internet access for people around the world.

"Free Basics provides people with access to useful services on their mobile phones in markets where internet access may be less affordable. The websites are available for free without data charges, and include content about news, employment, health, education and local information etc. By introducing people to the benefits of the internet through these websites, we hope to bring more people online and help improve their lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://info.internet.org/en/|title=Internet.org:About|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Free Basics is also accused of violating [[net neutrality]] for limiting access to handpicked services. Despite a wide deployment in numerous countries, it has been met with heavy resistance notably in India where the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India eventually banned it in 2016.

===Satellite constellations===

Several projects to bring internet to the entire world with a [[satellite constellation]] have been devised in the last decade, one of these being [[Starlink (satellite constellation)|Starlink]] by [[Elon Musk]]'s company [[SpaceX]]. Unlike Free Basics, it would provide people with a full internet access and would not be limited to a few selected services. In the same week Starlink was announced, serial-entrepreneur Richard Branson announced his own project [[OneWeb satellite constellation|OneWeb]], a similar constellation with approximately 700 satellites that has already procured communication frequency licenses for their broadcast spectrum and could possibly be operational as early as in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-satellite-entrepreneurs-20150117-story.html|title=Elon Musk and Richard Branson invest in satellite-Internet ventures|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest hurdle of these projects is the astronomical financial and logistical costs of launching so many satellites. After the failure of previous satellite-to-consumer space ventures, satellite industry consultant Roger Rusch said "It's highly unlikely that you can make a successful business out of this." Musk has publicly acknowledged this business reality, and indicated in mid-2015 that while endeavoring to develop this technically-complicated space-based communication system he wants to avoid overextending the company and stated that they are being measured in the pace of development.

===One Laptop per Child===

[[One Laptop Per Child]] (OLPC) is another attempt to narrow the digital divide.&lt;ref name="wiki.laptop.org"&gt;[http://one.laptop.org/about/mission One Laptop Per Child]. (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; This organization, founded in 2005, provides inexpensively produced "XO" laptops (dubbed the "$100 laptop", though actual production costs vary) to children residing in poor and isolated regions within developing countries. Each laptop belongs to an individual child and provides a gateway to digital learning and Internet access. The XO laptops are designed to withstand more abuse than higher-end machines, and they contain features in context to the unique conditions that remote villages present. Each laptop is constructed to use as little power as possible, have a sunlight-readable screen, and is capable of automatically networking with other XO laptops in order to access the Internet—as many as 500 machines can share a single point of access.&lt;ref name="wiki.laptop.org"/&gt;

==World Summit on the Information Society==
{{Main |World Summit on the Information Society}}

Several of the 67 principles adopted at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] convened by the [[United Nations]] in Geneva in 2003 directly address the digital divide:&lt;ref name=WSIS-03&gt;[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/dop.html "Declaration of Principles"], WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E, World Summit on the Information Society, Geneva, December 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
:10. We are also fully aware that the benefits of the information technology revolution are today unevenly distributed between the developed and developing countries and within societies. We are fully committed to turning this digital divide into a digital opportunity for all, particularly for those who risk being left behind and being further marginalized.
:11. We are committed to realizing our common vision of the Information Society for ourselves and for future generations. We recognize that young people are the future workforce and leading creators and earliest adopters of ICTs. They must therefore be empowered as learners, developers, contributors, entrepreneurs and decision-makers. We must focus especially on young people who have not yet been able to benefit fully from the opportunities provided by ICTs. We are also committed to ensuring that the development of ICT applications and operation of services respects the rights of children as well as their protection and well-being.
:12. We affirm that development of ICTs provides enormous opportunities for women, who should be an integral part of, and key actors, in the Information Society. We are committed to ensuring that the Information Society enables women's empowerment and their full participation on the basis on equality in all spheres of society and in all decision-making processes. To this end, we should mainstream a gender equality perspective and use ICTs as a tool to that end.
:13. In building the Information Society, we shall pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society, including migrants, internally displaced persons and refugees, unemployed and underprivileged people, minorities and nomadic people. We shall also recognize the special needs of older persons and persons with disabilities.
:14. We are resolute to empower the poor, particularly those living in remote, rural and marginalized urban areas, to access information and to use ICTs as a tool to support their efforts to lift themselves out of poverty.
:15. In the evolution of the Information Society, particular attention must be given to the special situation of indigenous peoples, as well as to the preservation of their heritage and their cultural legacy.
:16. We continue to pay special attention to the particular needs of people of developing countries, countries with economies in transition, Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, Landlocked Developing Countries, Highly Indebted Poor Countries, countries and territories under occupation, countries recovering from conflict and countries and regions with special needs as well as to conditions that pose severe threats to development, such as natural disasters.
:21. Connectivity is a central enabling agent in building the Information Society. Universal, ubiquitous, equitable and affordable access to ICT infrastructure and services, constitutes one of the challenges of the Information Society and should be an objective of all stakeholders involved in building it. Connectivity also involves access to energy and postal services, which should be assured in conformity with the domestic legislation of each country.
:28. We strive to promote universal access with equal opportunities for all to scientific knowledge and the creation and dissemination of scientific and technical information, including open access initiatives for scientific publishing.
:46. In building the Information Society, States are strongly urged to take steps with a view to the avoidance of, and refrain from, any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that impedes the full achievement of economic and social development by the population of the affected countries, and that hinders the well-being of their population.

[[File:European Output of Printed Books ca. 1450–1800.png|thumb|300px|European output of printed books from the 15th through the 18th century]]

The '''global spread of the printing press''' began with the invention of the [[printing press]] with [[movable type]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in [[Mainz]], [[Germany]] {{Circa|1439}}. [[Western world|Western]] [[History of printing|printing technology]] was adopted in all world regions by the end of the 19th century, displacing the [[manuscript]] and [[block printing]].

In the [[Western world]], the operation of a press became synonymous with the enterprise of publishing and lent its name to a new branch of media, the "[[Newspaper|press]]" (see [[List of the oldest newspapers]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=387}}: {{quote|At the same time, then, as the printing press in the physical, technological sense was invented, 'the press' in the extended sense of the word also entered the historical stage. The phenomenon of publishing was born.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spread of the Gutenberg press ==

=== Germany ===
[[File:DBP 1954 198 Gutenberg.jpg|thumb|Modern stamp commemorating the [[Gutenberg Bible]], the first major European work printed by mechanical movable type]]

Gutenberg's first major print work was the [[42-line Bible]] in [[Latin]], printed probably between 1452 and 1454 in the German city of [[Mainz]]. After Gutenberg lost a lawsuit against his investor [[Johann Fust]], Fust put Gutenberg's employee [[Peter Schöffer]] in charge of the print shop. Thereupon Gutenberg established a new one with the financial backing of another money lender. With Gutenberg's monopoly revoked, and the technology no longer secret, printing spread throughout Germany and beyond, diffused first by emigrating German printers, but soon also by foreign apprentices.

=== Europe ===
In rapid succession, printing presses were set up in Central and Western Europe. Major towns, in particular, functioned as centers of diffusion ([[Cologne]] 1466, [[Rome]] 1467, [[Venice]] 1469, [[Paris]] 1470, [[Kraków]] 1473, [[London]] 1477). In 1481, barely 30 years after the publication of the 42-line Bible, the small Netherlands already featured printing shops in 21 cities and towns, while Italy and Germany each had shops in about 40 towns at that time. According to one estimate, "by 1500, 1000 printing presses were in operation throughout Western Europe and had produced 8 million books"&lt;ref&gt;E. L. Eisenstein: "The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe", Cambridge, 1993, pp. 13–17, quoted in: [[Angus Maddison]]: "Growth and Interaction in the World Economy: The Roots of Modernity", Washington 2005, p.17f.&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 1550s there were "three hundred or more" printers and booksellers in Geneva alone.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein Elizabeth L. (1979) — The Printing Press as an Agent of Change, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; The output was in the order of twenty million volumes and rose in the sixteenth century tenfold to between 150 and 200 million copies.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."&gt;Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean (1976): "The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing 1450–1800", London: New Left Books, quoted in: Anderson, Benedict: "[http://www.perio.unlp.edu.ar/catedras/system/files/anderson_benedict-_comunidades_imaginadas.pdf Comunidades Imaginadas. Reflexiones sobre el origen y la difusión del nacionalismo]", Fondo de cultura económica, Mexico 1993, {{ISBN|978-968-16-3867-2}}, pp. 58f.&lt;/ref&gt;  Germany and Italy were considered the two main centres of printing in terms of quantity and quality.

=== Rest of the world ===
The near-simultaneous discovery of sea routes to the West ([[Christopher Columbus]], 1492) and East ([[Vasco da Gama]], 1498) and [[Age of Discovery|the subsequent establishment of trade links]] greatly facilitated the global spread of Gutenberg-style printing.  Traders, colonists, but perhaps most importantly, missionaries exported printing presses to the new European oversea domains, setting up new print shops and distributing printing material.  In the Americas, the first extra-European print shop was founded in [[Mexico City]] in 1544 (1539?), and soon after [[Jesuits]] started operating the first printing press in Asia ([[Goa]], 1556).

For a long time however, movable type printing remained mainly the business of Europeans working from within the confines of their colonies. According to Suraiya Faroqhi, lack of interest and religious reasons were among the reasons for the slow adoption of the printing press outside Europe: Thus, the printing of Arabic, after encountering strong opposition by [[Ulama|Muslim legal scholars]] and the [[manuscript]] scribes, remained prohibited in the [[Ottoman empire]] between 1483 and 1729, initially even on penalty of death,&lt;ref&gt;Suraiya Faroqhi, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cQ8ZLZh9WjwC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=printing+Qu%27ran&amp;ei=v5jbS8qMBo-GzgSw8eGcCQ&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=printing%20Qu%27ran&amp;f=false ''Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire''], pp, 134-136, I.B.Tauris, 2005, {{ISBN|1-85043-760-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85043-760-4}};[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PvwUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA803&amp;dq=Islam+block+printing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=QTncS9WLKp2WyAS2yPnGCQ&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Encyclopaedia of Islam: Fascicules 111-112 : Masrah Mawlid], Clifford Edmund Bosworth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watson| 1968|p=435}}; {{harvnb|Clogg| 1979|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some movable Arabic type printing was done by [[Pope Julius II]] (1503−1512) for distribution among Middle Eastern Christians,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krek| 1979|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the oldest [[Qur’an]] printed with movable type was produced in Venice in 1537/1538 for the Ottoman market.

In India, reports are that Jesuits "presented a polyglot Bible to the Emperor [[Akbar]] in 1580 but did not succeed in arousing much curiosity."&lt;ref name="Angus Maddison 65"&gt;Angus Maddison: Growth and Interaction in the World Economy: The Roots of Modernity, Washington 2005, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; But also practical reasons seem to have played a role. The [[English East India Company]], for example, brought a printer to [[Surat]] in 1675, but was not able to cast type in Indian scripts, so the venture failed.&lt;ref name="Angus Maddison 65"/&gt;

North America saw the adoption by the Cherokee Indian [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]] who published the tribe's first newspaper ''[[Cherokee Phoenix]]'' from 1828, partly in his native language, using the Cherokee alphabet recently invented by his compatriot [[Sequoyah]].

In the 19th century, the arrival of the Gutenberg-style press to the shores of [[Tahiti]] (1818), [[Hawaii]] (1821) and other Pacific islands, marked the end of a global diffusion process which had begun almost 400 years earlier. At the same time, the "old style" press (as the Gutenberg model came to be termed in the 19th century), was already in the process of being displaced by industrial machines like the [[Friedrich Koenig|steam powered press]] (1812) and the [[rotary press]] (1833), which radically departed from Gutenberg's design, but were still of the same development line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolza| 1967}}; {{harvnb|Gerhardt| 1971}}; {{harvnb|Gerhardt| 1978|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, printing presses were established in 77 Italian cities and towns. At the end of the following century, 151 locations in Italy had seen at one time printing activities, of which 130 (86%) were north of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borsa| 1976|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these two centuries a total of 2894 printers were active in Italy, with only 216 of them located in southern Italy. Ca. 60% of the Italian printing shops were situated in six cities (Venice, Rome, Milan, Naples, Bologna and Florence), with the concentration of printers in Venice being particularly high (ca. 30%).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borsa| 1977|pp=166–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Đurađ IV Crnojević used the printing press brought to Cetinje by his father [[Ivan I Crnojević]] to print the first books in southeastern Europe, in 1493. The [[Crnojević]] printing press operated from 1493 through 1496, turning out religious books of which five have been preserved: ''Oktoih prvoglasnik'', ''Oktoih petoglasnik'', ''Psaltir'', ''Molitvenik'' and ''Četvorojevanđelje'' (the first Bible in Serbian language). Đurađ managed the printing of the books, wrote prefaces and afterwords, and developed sophisticated tables of Psalms with the lunar calendar. The books from the Crnojević press were printed in two colors, red and black, and were richly ornamented. They served as models for many of the subsequent books printed in Cyrillic.

Until the reign of [[Peter the Great]] printing in Russia remained confined to the print office established by Fedorov in Moscow. In the 18th century, annual printing output gradually rose from 147 titles in 1724 to 435 (1787), but remained constrained by state censorship and widespread illiteracy.&lt;ref name="Klaus Appel 96ff."&gt;{{harvnb|Appel| 1987|pp=96ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to religious qualms, [[Sultan Bayezid II]] and successors prohibited printing in [[Arabic script]] in the [[Ottoman empire]] from 1483 on penalty of death, but printing in other scripts was done by Jews as well as the Greek and Armenian communities (1515 Saloniki, 1554 [[Bursa]] (Adrianople), 1552 Belgrade, 1658 Smyrna). In 1727, Sultan Achmed III gave his permission for the establishment of the first legal print house for printing secular works in Arabic script (religious publications still remained forbidden),&lt;ref name="Watson 1968, 436"/&gt; but printing activities did not really take off until the 19th century.

'''husITa''' (Human Services Information Technology Applications) is an international virtual association{{spnd}}and a registered US non-profit organization{{spnd}}established with the mission of promoting the ethical and effective use of [[information technology]] in the [[human services]]. The main focus of husITa, and the claim to expertise of its associates, is situated at the intersection of three core domains: [[information technology]], [[human services]], and [[social development]]. husITa pursues its mission through international conferences, publications and research dissemination directed at technology applications and innovations that promote social well-being.

For much of its early history husITa operated as an informal international network of human service academics and practitioners. One of the outcomes of its first international conference{{spnd}}husITa1 held in 1987 in [[Birmingham]], England{{spnd}}was the establishment of a working group to determine the feasibility of an international body 'to highlight the importance of human service computing, to guide developments, and to foster international co-operation'.

The working group was composed of Hein de Graaf (Netherlands), Walter LaMendola (USA), Dick Schoech (USA), and Stuart Toole (UK). Initial projects identified by the working group included the development of research agendas, position papers, repositories of information, and promoting a second husITa conference in 1989.  Bryan Glastonbury was later added to the group as secretary. The working group met in Colorado, Denver for three days in May 1988 and published a report on the issues that a husITa international organization would need to address.&lt;ref&gt;See Report of the husITa working group, Computer Use in Social Services Network Newsletter, Fall, 1998, Vol 8/3, pp. 6-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the 1988 Denver meeting agreed its objectives, husITa wasn't formally established as an organization for another twelve years. The structure of the formal organization was later agreed to at Denver in 2000. The founding members at the Denver 2000 meeting were: Hein de Graaf, Walter LaMendola, Rob MacFadden, Jo Ann Regan, Jackie Rafferty, Jan Steyaert, Dick Schoech, Stuart Toole, and Victor Savtschenko.

== Objectives ==
husITa's objectives (agreed by the 1988 Denver working group) are to:
* Facilitate international cooperation in human service technology.
* Collect and disseminate information on human service technology, including tackling the problems of language translation.
* Provide technical assistance in human service technology and encourage the involvement of countries with a less developed human service IT infrastructure.
* Stimulate international discussion on key human service technology issues and encourage position papers in areas such as security/privacy/confidentiality, curriculum content and teaching methods, and ethical issues in systems/software development and use.
* Encourage publications about human service information technology.
* Encourage international research efforts.
* Encourage standards for making human service technology culturally independent.

== Journal of Technology in Human Services ==
The [http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=wths20 ''Journal of Technology in Human Services''] is the official journal of husITa. Formerly known as ''Computers in Human Services'' it was launched in 1985 as a [[Haworth Press]] publication.&lt;ref&gt;The journal [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/wzch20/1/1 Computers in Human Services]&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Schoech, a professor of social work at the [[University of Texas at Arlington]], was its founding editor. The ''Journal of Technology in Human Services'' is a peer-reviewed, refereed journal now published by [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]. Its scope includes the potential of information and communication technologies in mental health, developmental disability, welfare, addictions, education, and other human services. The current Editor-in-Chief is [http://www.laurigoldkind.net/ Dr. Lauri Goldkind] (Associate Professor, Fordham University, USA), with [http://apss.polyu.edu.hk/staff/dr-chan-chitat-chen-zhi-da-bo-shi Dr. Chitat Chan] (Assistant Professor, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong) serves as the Associate Editor-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Journal of Technology in Human Services Turns a New Page|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15228835.2017.1356996|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related human service technology initiatives ==
husITa was built on the activity of an international  network of human service organizations, academics and practitioners in the USA, the UK and the Netherlands. The section below highlights some of the key organizations, people and events.

=== Early developments ===

In 1978, Gunther R. Geiss, aprofessor of social work at [[Adelphi University]], New York, conducted a survey of US schools of [[social work]]. The survey sought to identify faculty members who had used computers in their administrative, teaching or research activities, or who had consulted or participated in the design and development of computer-based information systems. There were over 80 positive responses indicating a wide range of activities and levels of involvement. The survey initiated the development of a system to track and communicate with individuals with expertise in computers and human services.

Walter LaMendola, professor of social work at the [[University of Denver]] in Colorado, described an incident during a social work conference in 1979 suggesting early indications of the resistance of some social work professionals to computer use in the human services.&lt;ref&gt;Walter LaMendola discusses '[http://wweb.uta.edu/faculty/schoech/cussn/stories.htm crowd resistance]' to a human services computer presentation in 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a theme which has continued throughout the history of technology use in the human services and continues to the present day. Some aspects of this resistance can be considered as a well-founded concern about the ethical issues surrounding human service technology applications. However, other aspects of technology resistance seem to be a less rational form of [[Neo-Luddism]].

=== Computer Use in Social Services Network (CUSSN) ===
Growing interest in the use of technology in the human services led a group of US human service technology specialists, meeting at a [http://www.cswe.org/ Council of Social Work Education] conference in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] Kentucky in 1981, to form the Computer Use In Social Services Network ([http://wweb.uta.edu/faculty/schoech/cussn/cussn/index.htm CUSSN]). By the end of 1981 the network had over 350 members. The CUSSN newsletter continued in print until 1992 when it was merged with the first academic journal on human service technology ''Computers in Human Services''.

In 1984 Gunther Geiss was sponsored by the [http://www.socialservicegrants.org/silbermanfund.html Silberman Fund] to organize the Wye Plantation Conference on Human Services Technology. Conference members developed pre-conference position papers via EYES: a centralized email system.&lt;ref&gt;Papers from the Wye Plantation Conference were published in [https://www.amazon.com/Human-Edge-Information-Technology-Helping/dp/0866564047/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350877770&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=0866564047 Geiss &amp; Viswanathan (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, CUSSN developed CUSSNet [http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-17472-001 CUSSNet], a PC and [[FidoNet]] based networking system that automatically exchanged emails between members each night during off-peak telephone hours. [[FidoNet]] was a PC distributed email, bulletin board, and file sharing system that preceded the Internet. CUSSNet quickly developed nodes in major cities in the US, the UK, and the Netherlands.

The name husITa (Human Service Information Technology Applications) was coined in 1983 by Walter LaMendola and Brian Klepinger at the [[University of Denver]].

The Human Service [[Microcomputer]] Conference was held in [[Seattle]].

=== Computer Applications in Social Work (CASW) ===
In 1984 Stuart Toole formed Computer Applications in Social Work (CASW) in the UK to set up and run national conferences and to publish the CASW journal.

Based on the success of the first UK technology conferences, Stuart Toole, Walter LaMendola, and Brian Klepinger agreed to pursue an international conference in 1987: this conference was to become HUSITA's first international conference HUSITA1.

The CASW  journal was later renamed [http://www.southampton.ac.uk/chst/projects/nths_archive/default.htm New Technology in the Human Services] in [when] and continued in publication under this title until it was closed in 2003.

In 1986 the second UK conference held on [[social welfare]] computing was held.

=== The Centre for Human Service Technology (CHST) ===
In 1985 Bryan Glastonbury, from the University of Southampton published ''Computers in Social Work'', the first major academic text on technology and human services.&lt;ref&gt;Glastonbury, B. (1985). Computers in Social Work. London, England: MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the [[University of Southampton]] began publishing the journal New Technology in the Human Services under the editorship of Bryan Glastonbury. In the same year the University of Southampton established the Centre for Human Service Technology (CHST) with Jackie Rafferty as Director. In 2007, Jan Steyaert joined as adjunct research professor and together they edited a special issue of the British Journal of Social Work on ''social work in the digital age''.
The [http://www.southampton.ac.uk/chst/ Centre for Human Service Technology] is based at the University of Southampton in England. CHST is an international, multi-disciplinary research center focused on influencing the appropriate use of technology in social work practice and education and researching its implementation and impact.

In July 1997 the CTI Centre for Human Services held a conference on ''Social Services and Learning Technology''  hosted by the Institute for Health and Community Services at the University of Bournemouth.

In 2003 the journal New Technology in Human Services ceased publication.

=== The European Network for Information Technology in Human Services (ENITH) ===
In 1986 Hein de Graaf, Director of the CREON foundation in the Netherlands, organised the first of a series of three-day gatherings. The CREON foundation was a Dutch foundation for computer research, expertise and support in field of the human services. The gatherings, called WELCOM, were designed to increase the knowledge and understanding of information technology in the Dutch human services. WELCOM1 was held in 1986 in [[Bussum]] with Walter LaMendola as the main international speaker. WELCOM2, a smaller Dutch-only conference, took place in 1987, again in [[Bussum]]. The next WELCOM event, WELCOM3: a combined conference and fair,  was held jointly with HUSITA3 in [[Maastricht]] in 1993.

Following the success of HUSITA's first international conference held in Birmingham in 1987 the Dutch Ministry of Social Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs organized an informal meeting of European experts in the field of Information Technology and Human Services.  The meeting was one of the outcomes of a feasibility study carried out by the CREON foundation, concerning international cooperation in this field.  A main conclusion of this feasibility study was that an international (European) network should be established for the exchange of products, ideas, expertise, experiences and skills with respect to the introduction and use of IT in the human services.  As a first step in this approach the informal meeting of experts was organized.  The European network of organizations was called ENITH (European Network Information Technology and Human services).&lt;ref&gt;This [http://wweb.uta.edu/projects/sswtech/husita/history/ENITH_experts.htm report of an Expert Meeting] held by the Dutch Ministry of Social Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs details the early work of ENITH.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 an ENITH3 Expert Meeting on “IT Applications and the Quality of Life and Services” was held in The Netherlands.

In 1994, from September 21 to September 23 an  ENITH4 conference was held in [[Berlin]], Germany. Bernd kolleck chaired this conference.

In September 1995 a CAUSA5/ENITH5 conference on “The Impact of Information Technology on Social Policy,” was held in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. Jan Steyaert chaired this conference.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19363">The '''knowledge gap hypothesis''' explains that [[knowledge]], like other forms of [[wealth]], is often [[Income inequality|differentially distributed]] throughout a social system.  Specifically, the hypothesis predicts that "as the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, segments of the population with higher  [[socioeconomic status]] tend to acquire this information at a faster rate than the lower status segments, so that the gap in knowledge between these segments tends to increase rather than decrease".&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tichenor|first=P.A. |author2=Donohue, G.A. |author3=Olien, C.N.|title=Mass media flow and differential growth in knowledge|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=34|issue=2|pages=159–170|doi=10.1086/267786|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip J. Tichenor, then Associate Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication, George A. Donohue, Professor of Sociology, and Clarice N. Olien, Instructor in Sociology – three [[University of Minnesota]] researchers – first proposed the knowledge gap hypothesis in 1970.

==Foundations==

Although first formally articulated in 1970, Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt; note that the knowledge gap hypothesis has been implicit throughout the mass communication literature.

Indeed, research published as early as the 1920s had already begun to examine the influence of individual characteristics on people's media content preferences.  For example, Gray and Munroe&lt;ref name="Gray Munroe 1929"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=W.S.|title=The Reading Interests and Habits of Adults|year=1929|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=New York|author2=Munroe, R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified education – still used today as an operationalization of socioeconomic status in knowledge gap research (see, e.g., Hwang and Jeong, 2009)&lt;ref name="Hwang Jeong 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hwang|first=Y|author2=Jeong, S-H. |title=Revisiting the knowledge gap hypothesis: A meta-analysis of thirty-five years of research|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2009|volume=86|issue=3|pages=513–532|doi=10.1177/107769900908600304}}&lt;/ref&gt; – as a significant and positive correlate of a person's tendency to prefer "serious" (rather than non-serious) print content.

Popular belief, however, held that such differences in preferences might be diminished by the advent of radio, which required neither the special skill nor the exertion of reading (Lazarsfeld, 1940).&lt;ref name="Lazarsfeld 1940"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lazarsfeld|first=P.F.|title=Radio and the Printed Page|year=1940|publisher=Duell, Sloan, and Pearce|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guglielmo Marconi, inventor of the wireless telegraph, even believed that the radio would "make war impossible, because it will make war ridiculous" (Narodny, 1912, p.&amp;nbsp;145).&lt;ref name="Narodny 1912"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Narodny|first=I.|title=Marconi's plans for the world|journal=The Technical World Magazine|year=1912|volume=18|pages=145–150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eqpMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=marconi+plans+for+the+world&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kE1RT_2PBcbFtgfT3PSgDQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22the%20coming%20of%20the%20wireless%20era%20will%20make%20war%20impossible%2C%20because%20it%20will%20make%20war%20ridiculous%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interested in whether radio had attenuated these individual differences in content preferences, Paul Lazarsfeld, head of the Office of Radio Research at Columbia University, set out to examine whether (1) the total amount of time that people listened to the radio and (2) the type of content they listened to correlated with their socioeconomic status.  Not only did Lazarsfeld's data indicate people of lower socioeconomic status tended to listen to more radio programming, but also they were simultaneously less likely to listen to "serious" radio content.  Contrary to popular belief at the time, then, the widespread adoption of the radio seems to have had little, if any, effect on a person's tendency to prefer specific types of content.

Further evidence supporting the knowledge gap hypothesis came from Star and Hughes (1950)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Star|first=S.|author2=Hughes, H.M |title=Report of an education campaign: The Cincinnati plan for the United Nations|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=1950|volume=55|pages=389–397|doi=10.1086/220562}}&lt;/ref&gt;  analysis of efforts to inform Cincinnati adults about the United Nations.  Like Gray and Munroe (1929)&lt;ref name="Gray Munroe 1929" /&gt;  and Lazarsfeld (1940)&lt;ref name="Lazarsfeld 1940" /&gt;  before them, Star and Hughes found that while the campaign was successful in reaching better-educated people, those with less education virtually ignored the campaign.  Additionally, after realizing that the highly educated people reached by the campaign also tended to be more interested in the topic, Star and Hughes suggested that knowledge, education, and interest may be interdependent.

==Specification==

Based on observations implicit in mass communication research, Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) define the knowledge gap hypothesis as follows:
:"As the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, higher socioeconomic status segments tend to acquire this information faster than lower socioeconomic-status population segments so that the gap in knowledge between the two tends to increase rather than decrease" (Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien 1970, pp. 159-160).&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;

Additionally, Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien suggest 5 reasons why the knowledge gap should exist:&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt; 
ailor their conte
# ''Communication skills'': higher status people generally have more education, which improves their reading, comprehension, and memory skills;
# ''Stored information'': higher status people are more likely to already know of topics in the news through previous media exposure or through formal education;
# ''Relevant social contact'': higher status people generally have a broader sphere of activity, greater number of reference groups, and interpersonal contacts and are thus more likely to discuss news topics with others;
# ''Selective exposure'': lower status people may be less interested, and therefore less likely to expose themselves to certain news topics; and
# ''Media target markets'': media outlets cater to the tastes and interests of their audience.

==Formal summary==

Given the preceding information, the knowledge gap hypothesis can be expressed using the following set of related propositions:
# People in a society exhibit great psychological diversity due to their psychological makeup, learned experiences, social relationships, and social category memberships.
# Despite these differences, people with more education tend to have better developed cognitive and communication skills, broader social spheres with more and more diverse social contacts, and a greater amount of stored information than their counterparts with less education.
# People with greater education also tend express interest in, and expose themselves to, a broader range of topics, including serious topics like public affairs, science, and health news.
# Therefore, as the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, segments of the population with higher socioeconomic status tend to acquire this information at a faster rate than the lower status segments so that the gap in knowledge between these segments tends to increase rather than decrease.

==Hypothesis operationalization and initial support==
The knowledge gap hypothesis can be operationalized both for cross-sectional and time-series appropriate research.  For cross-sectional research, the knowledge gap hypothesis expects that "''at any given time'', there should be a higher correlation between acquisition of knowledge and education for topics highly publicized in the media than for topics less highly publicized.&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;   Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) tested this hypothesis using an experiment in which participants were asked to read and discuss two news stories of varying publicity.  The results of the experiment support the hypothesis because correlations between education and understanding were significant for high publicity stories but not significant for low publicity stories.&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;

For time-series research, the knowledge gap hypothesis expects that "''over time'', acquisition of knowledge of a heavily publicized topic will proceed at a faster rate among better educated persons than among those with less education."&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;   Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) tested this hypothesis using public opinion surveys gathered between 1949 and 1965 measuring whether participants believed humans would reach the Moon in the foreseeable future.  During the 15-year span, belief among grade-school educated people increased only about 25 percentage points while belief among college educated people increased more than 60 percentage points, a trend consistent with the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;

==Refining the hypothesis==

Although by the mid-1970s extensive data supported the existence of a knowledge gap among low and high socioeconomic status individuals, Donohue, Tichenor, and Olien (1975)&lt;ref name="Donohue, Tichenor, Olien 1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Donohue|first=G.A.|author2=Tichenor, P.J. |author3=Olien, C.N. |title=Mass media and the knowledge gap: A hypothesis revisited|journal=Communication Research|year=1975|volume=2|issue=1|pages=3–23|doi=10.1177/009365027500200101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  sought to refine the hypothesis to determine under what conditions the knowledge gap might be attenuated or even eliminated.  To this end, they examined survey data on national and local issues from probability samples of 16 Minnesota communities gathered between 1969 and 1975.  Donohue and colleagues identified three variables that weakened the knowledge gap:
# ''Level of basic social concern aroused by the issue'' - Local issues that directly implicated the community tended to arouse greater social concern than national issues that did not implicate the community.  Local issues, then, tended to decrease the magnitude of the knowledge gap.
# ''Level of social conflict surrounding the issue'' - Up to the point at which a communication breakdown occurred, issues with more perceived conflict tended to draw more attention and, thus, decrease the magnitude of the knowledge gap.
# ''Level of homogeneity of the community'' - Because smaller, more homogeneous communities tend to exhibit less social differentiation and variety in sources of information than larger, more heterogeneous communities, homogeneous communities tended to exhibit smaller knowledge gaps than heterogeneous communities.

==Narrative review and meta-analytic support==

At least two narrative reviews and one meta-analysis of knowledge gap hypothesis research exist.  Gaziano conducted two narrative reviews, one of 58 articles with relevant data in 1983&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaziano|first=C.|title=The knowledge gap: An analytical review of media effects|journal=Communication Research|year=1983|volume=10|issue=4|pages=447–486|doi=10.1177/009365083010004003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the other of 39 additional studies in 1997.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaziano|first=C.|title=Forecast 2000: Widening knowledge gaps|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|year=1997|volume=74|issue=2|pages=237–264|doi=10.1177/107769909707400202}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gaziano writes, "the most consistent result is the presence of knowledge differentials, regardless of topic, methodological, or theoretical variations, study excellence, or other variables and conditions" (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;240).  Evidence from several decades, Gaziano concludes, underscores the enduring character of knowledge gaps and indicates that they transcend topics and research settings.

Because narrative reviews examine significance tests rather than effect sizes, Hwang and Jeong (2009)&lt;ref name="Hwang Jeong 2009"/&gt; conducted a meta-analysis of 46 knowledge gap studies.  Consistent with Gaziano's results, however, Hwang and Jeong found constant knowledge gaps across time.

==Closing the knowledge gap hypothesis with Web 2.0==
In 2010 Elizabeth Corley and Dietram Scheufele conducted a study to investigate the widening knowledge gap with the example of nanotechnology. On the whole, public opinion research has shown that respondents with higher socioeconomic status (SES) acquire new information at a higher rate than low SES respondents. Their previous analyses of two large national surveys conducted in 2004 and 2007 found that respondents with at least a college degree displayed an increase in knowledge levels between 2004 and 2007 while respondents with education levels of less than a high school diploma had a significant decrease in nanotechnology knowledge levels. These results stress that the group that is most in need of help, low SES bracket, have not been helped through communication efforts and their nanotechnology knowledge levels have decreased over time.

Corley and Scheufele investigated a wide range of factors that may help to close knowledge gaps, including mass media. The researchers found that the number of days a week that respondents spent online was significantly correlated to knowledge levels about nanotechnology. Therefore, internet use helped those with less formal education to catch up to their counterparts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Corley, E. A., &amp; Scheufele, D. A. (forthcoming). Outreach gone wrong? When we talk nano to the public, we are leaving behind key audiences. The Scientist.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the Internet, and more specifically Web 2.0, may be playing a role in closing the knowledge gap. In fact, Corley and Scheufele explain that "the internet may finally live up to the hype … as a tool for creating a more informed citizenry by serving as a "leveler" of knowledge gaps." (2010, p.&amp;nbsp;2)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This is widely due to the fact that information on Web 2.0 is written in layman's terms. The content is created by those individuals who have an understanding of the information, but who are also able to tailor the articles towards a more general audience.

Still, the knowledge gap may still exist even with the emergence of Web 2.0. The disenfranchised group, in this situation, the group with lower SES, must still be motivated to get the information to close the gap. Also, information about a given subject must be given. Without the content being provided, Web 2.0 will not be much of a help.  However, if the content is provided, Web 2.0 has allowed the readers to be more interactive and talk with others online, through discussion boards, forums and blogs. The results of the research conducted by Corley and Scheufele are a clear call to action for researchers to investigate non-traditional ways of connecting with lay audiences about emerging technologies.

Overall, studies show the introduction of Web 2.0 may help in closing the knowledge gap because the content that traditionally those with lower SES could not reach, can now be understood because it is written in layman's terms. Web 2.0 has helped because:
# The content on Web 2.0 is created by everyday people, for everyday people
# As a user, you can be interactive to find more information about a given subject (click through other links to find more information, search for theories and ideas you don't know on search engines, or read supplemented articles to get more information)

==Criticism and directions for future research==

# Although the majority of research supports the proposition that the higher the education, the greater the knowledge of various topics, the knowledge gap hypothesis specifies that this relationship should be moderated by the level of media publicity a given issue receives.  Few knowledge gap studies, however, treat media publicity as a variable.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;
# Because time-trend analyses indicate knowledge differentials fluctuate over time, most one-shot studies offer a brief and potentially misleading snapshot of knowledge gaps.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;
# A new, vital area for knowledge gap researchers to understand is the role of the family in socialization patterns related to learning.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;
# Because policy decisions have played a major role in increasing inequality, and knowledge gap research has policy implications, researchers should include more dialogue with policymakers.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;

== Competing hypotheses ==

There are now three existing competing hypotheses: 1) Media Malaise hypothesis (that predicts a general negative effect), 2) the Virtuous Circle hypothesis (that predicts a general positive effect), and 3) the Differential Effect hypothesis (that predicts a positive effect from newspapers, and a null or negative effect from television)" (Fraile, 2011).&lt;ref name="Fraile 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraile|first=M.|title=Widening or reducing the knowledge gap? Testing the media effects on political knowledge in Spain (2004-2006)|journal=[[International Journal of Press/Politics]]|year=2011|volume=16|issue=2|pages=163–184|doi=10.1177/1940161210388413}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three types of media outlets have been used to examine the media effects on knowledge gap: 1) Television – knowledge gap between lower and higher education groups are greater among light television users compared to heavy television users (Eveland, 2000),&lt;ref name="Eveland Scheufele 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eveland|first=W.P.|author2=Scheufele, D.A. |title=Connecting news media use with gaps in knowledge and participation.|journal=[[Political Communication (journal)|Political Communication]]|year=2000|volume=17|issue=3|pages=215–237|doi=10.1080/105846000414250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  2) Newspaper – the exposure to newspaper can potentially reinforce the knowledge gap in politics for different SES groups since reading newspaper requires literacy ability to effectively understand the information (Jerit ''et al.'', 2006),&lt;ref name="Jerit Jason Toby 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jerit|first=J.|author2=Barabas, J. |author3=Bolsen, T. |title=Citizens, knowledge, and the information environment|journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]]|year=2006|volume=50|issue=2|pages=266–282|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00183.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while other studies suggest that exposure to newspaper actually slightly decreases the knowledge gap rather than increasing it (Eveland, 2000),&lt;ref name="Eveland Scheufele 2000" /&gt;  and 3) Internet - internet exposure increases public's general knowledge in health issues (Shim, 2008).&lt;ref name="Shim 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shim|first=M.|title=Connecting Internet uses with gaps in cancer knowledge|journal=[[Health Communication]]|year=2008|volume=23|issue=6|pages=448–461|doi=10.1080/10410230802342143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2371">'''Soft handover''' or '''soft handoff''' refers to a feature used by the [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] and [[WCDMA|W-CDMA]] standards, where a [[Mobile phone|cell phone]] is simultaneously connected to two or more cells (or cell sectors) during a call. If the sectors are from the same physical [[cell site]] (a sectorised site), it is referred to as '''softer handoff'''.  This technique is a form of mobile-assisted handover, for [[IS-95]]/[[CDMA2000]] CDMA cell phones continuously make power measurements of a list of neighboring cell sites, and determine whether or not to request or end soft handover with the cell sectors on the list.

Due to the properties of the CDMA signaling scheme, it is possible for a CDMA phone to simultaneously receive signals from two or more radio [[base stations]] that are transmitting the same [[bit stream]] (using different transmission codes) on the different physical channels in the same frequency bandwidth. If the signal power from two or more radio base stations is nearly the same, the phone receiver can combine the received signals in such a way that the bit stream is decoded much more reliably than if only one base station were transmitting to the subscriber station. If any one of these signals fades significantly, there will be a relatively high probability of having adequate signal strength from one of the other radio base stations.

On the uplink (phone-to-cell-site), all the cell site sectors that are actively supporting a call in '''soft handover''' send the bit stream that they receive back to the Radio Network Controller (RNC), along with information about the quality of the received [[bit]]s. The RNC examines the quality of all these bit streams and dynamically chooses the bit stream with the highest quality. Again, if the signal degrades rapidly, the chance is still good that a strong signal will be available at one of the other cell sectors that is supporting the call in '''soft handover'''.

Soft handover results in a [[diversity gain]] called soft handover gain.
