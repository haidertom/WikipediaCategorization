{{Translation sidebar}}

'''Computer-assisted translation''','''computer-aided translation''' or '''CAT''' is a form of [[translation|language translation]] in which a human translator uses [[computer hardware]] to support and facilitate the translation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Computer-aided Translation Technology|last=Bowker|first=Lynne|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Ottawa|pages=144|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Computer program|Computer]]-assisted translation is sometimes called machine-assisted, or machine-aided, translation (not to be confused with [[machine translation]]).

== Overview ==

The automatic machine translation systems available today are not able to produce high-quality translations unaided: their output must be edited by a human to correct errors and improve the quality of translation. Computer-assisted translation (CAT) incorporates that manual editing stage into the software, making translation an interactive process between human and computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barrachina |first=Sergio |year=2009 |title=Statistical Approaches to Computer-Assisted Translation |journal=Computational Linguistics|volume=35|issue=1|pages=3–28 |issn=0891-2017 |url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/J/J09/J09-1002.pdf |doi=10.1162/coli.2008.07-055-r2-06-29|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some advanced computer-assisted translation solutions include controlled machine translation (MT). Higher priced MT modules generally provide a more complex set of tools available to the translator, which may include terminology management features and various other linguistic tools and utilities. Carefully customized user dictionaries based on correct terminology significantly improve the accuracy of MT, and as a result, aim at increasing the efficiency of the entire translation process.

== Range of tools ==

Computer-assisted translation is a broad and imprecise term covering a range of tools, from the fairly simple to the complicated. These can include:
* [[Translation memory]] tools (TM tools), consisting of a [[database]] of text segments in a source language and their translations in one or more target languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=Tina Paulsen|last2=Schjoldager|first2=Anne|title=Translation-Memory (TM) Research: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It?|url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/10113/Hermes-44paulsen_christensenschjoldager.pdf|journal=Hermes|volume=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Spell checkers]], either built into [[word processing]] software, or available as [[Plug-in (computing)|add-on programs]]
* [[Grammar checker]]s, either built into word processing software, or available as add-on programs. 
* [[Terminology]] managers, which allow translators to manage their own [[terminology bank]] in an electronic form. This can range from a simple table created in the translator's word processing software or spreadsheet, a database created in a program such as [[FileMaker|FileMaker Pro]] or, for more robust (and more expensive) solutions, specialized software packages such as [[SDL MultiTerm]], LogiTerm, Termex, TermWeb, etc.
* Electronic dictionaries, either unilingual or bilingual, also known as dictorobotary
* Terminology databases, either on the host computer or accessible through the Internet, such as [[TERMIUM Plus]] or [[Grand dictionnaire terminologique]] from the [[Office québécois de la langue française]]
* [[Full-text search|Full-text search tools]] (or indexers), which allow the user to query already translated texts or reference documents of various kinds. Some such indexers are [[ISYS Search Software]], [[DtSearch Corp.|dtSearch Desktop]] and Naturel
* [[Concordancer]]s, which are programs that retrieve instances of a word or an expression and their respective context in a monolingual, bilingual or multilingual corpus, such as a bitext or a translation memory
* [[Bitext]] aligners: tools that align a source text and its translation which can then be analyzed using a [[full-text search|full-text search tool]] or a concordancer
* [[Project management software]] that allows linguists to structure complex translation projects in a form of chain of tasks (often called "workflow"), assign the various tasks to different people, and track the progress of each of these tasks

== Concepts ==

===Translation memory software===
[[Translation memory]] programs store previously translated source texts and their equivalent target texts in a database and retrieve related segments during the translation of new texts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Terminology Management and MT|url=http://www.circuitmagazine.org/images/stories/documents/archives/ci_117_12.pdf|journal=Circuit|volume=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such programs split the source text into manageable units known as "segments". A source-text sentence or sentence-like unit (headings, titles or elements in a list) may be considered a segment. Texts may also be segmented into larger units such as paragraphs or small ones, such as clauses. As the translator works through a document, the software displays each source segment in turn, and provides a previous translation for re-use if it finds a matching source segment in its database. If it does not, the program allows the translator to enter a translation for the new segment. After the translation for a segment is completed, the program stores the new translation and moves on to the next segment. In the dominant paradigm, the translation memory is, in principle, a simple database of fields containing the source language segment, the translation of the segment, and other information such as segment creation date, last access, translator name, and so on. Another translation memory approach does not involve the creation of a database, relying on aligned reference documents instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAT Tools vs. Machine Translation: What’s the Best Method?|url=https://asianabsolute.co.uk/cat-tools-vs-machine-translation-whats-the-best-method/|publisher=Asian Absolute|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some translation memory programs function as [[Computer software|standalone]] environments, while others function as an [[Plug-in (computing)|add-on]] or [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] for commercially available word-processing or other business software programs. Add-on programs allow source documents from other formats, such as desktop publishing files, [[spreadsheet]]s, or [[HTML]] code, to be handled using the TM program.

Translation memory technology is particularly useful to organizations translating text that contains specialized vocabulary related to a particular industry, such as automotive manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Translation Productivity Tools for Businesses|url=https://www.pairaphrase.com/translation-productivity-tools-for-businesses/|website=Pairaphrase|publisher=Pairaphrase Blog|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language search-engine software===
New to the [[translation industry]], Language search-engine software is typically an Internet-based system that works similarly to Internet search engines. Rather than searching the Internet, however, a language search engine searches a large repository of Translation Memories to find previously translated sentence fragments, phrases, whole sentences, even complete paragraphs that match source document segments.

Language search engines are designed to leverage modern search technology to conduct searches based on the source words in context to ensure that the search results match the meaning of the source segments. Like traditional TM tools, the value of a language search engine rests heavily on the Translation Memory repository it searches against.

===Terminology management software===
[[Terminology]] management software provides the translator a means of automatically searching a given terminology database for terms appearing in a document, either by automatically displaying terms in the translation memory software interface window or through the use of hot keys to view the entry in the terminology database. Some programs have other hotkey combinations allowing the translator to add new terminology pairs to the terminology database on the fly during translation. Some of the more advanced systems enable translators to check, either interactively or in [[batch processing|batch mode]], if the correct source/target term combination has been used within and across the translation memory segments in a given project. Independent terminology management systems also exist that can provide workflow functionality, visual taxonomy, work as a type of term checker (similar to spell checker, terms that have not been used correctly are flagged) and can support other types of multilingual term facet classifications such as pictures, videos, or sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etudiant.uqo.ca/tamacanada2008/documents/Tama_workshop_warburton.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425021222/http://etudiant.uqo.ca/tamacanada2008/documents/Tama_workshop_warburton.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Alignment software===
Alignment programs take completed translations, divide both source and target texts into segments, and attempt to determine which segments belong together in order to build a [[translation memory]] or other reference resource with the content. Many alignment programs allow translators to manually realign mismatched segments. The resulting bitext (also known as [[parallel text]]) alignment can then be imported into a translation memory program for future translations or used as a reference document.

===Interactive machine translation===
[[Interactive machine translation]] is a paradigm in which the automatic system attempts to predict the translation the human translator is going to produce by suggesting translation hypotheses. These hypotheses may either be the complete sentence, or the part of the sentence that is yet to be translated.

===Augmented translation===
Augmented translation is a form of human translation carried out within an integrated technology environment that provides translators access to subsegment adaptive [[machine translation]] (MT) and [[translation memory]] (TM), [[Computer-assisted_translation#Terminology_management_software|terminology lookup]] (CAT), and automatic content enrichment (ACE) to aid their work, and that automates project management, file handling, and other ancillary tasks.&lt;ref name="depalma-lommel 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/Default.aspx?Contenttype=ArticleDetAD&amp;tabID=63&amp;Aid=37907&amp;moduleId=390 |title=Augmented Translation Powers up Language Services |last=DePalma  |first=Donald A. and Arle Lommel |date=2017-02-15 |publisher=Common Sense Advisory |access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/focus/cognitive-technologies/artificial-intelligence-government.html |title=AI-augmented government: Using cognitive technologies to redesign public sector work |last=Eggers  |first=William D., David Schatsky, and Dr. Peter Viechnicki |date=2017-04-26 |publisher=Deloitte University Press |access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the concept of [[augmented reality]], augmented translation seeks to make translators more productive by providing them with relevant information on an as-needed basis. This information adapts to the habits and style of individual translators in order to accelerate their work and increase productivity. It differs from classical [[Postediting|postediting of MT]], which has linguists revise entire texts translated by machines, in that it provides machine translation and information as suggestions that can be adopted in their entirety, edited, or ignored, as appropriate.&lt;ref name="depalma-lommel 2017"/&gt;

Augmented translation extends principles first developed in the 1980s that made their way into CAT tools. However, it integrates several functions that have previously been discrete into one environment. For example, translators historically have had to leave their translation environments to do terminology research, but in an augmented environment, an ACE component would automatically provide links to information about terms and concepts found in the text directly within the environment.

As of May 2017, no full implementations of an augmented translation environment exist, although individual developers have created partial systems.

'''''Do You Speak American?''''' is a [[documentary film]] and accompanying [[book]] about [[journalism|journalist]] [[Robert MacNeil]]'s investigation into how different people throughout the [[United States of America]] speak. The book and documentary look at the evolution of America's way of speaking from the [[English language]] to various ways of speaking in regions throughout the country. Divisions of [[ethnicity]], [[geography]] and [[social status]] and how they affect how Americans communicate are addressed. As part of the project, MacNeil traveled across the country conducting interviews with ordinary people as well as experts such as [[William Labov]].

In the United States, the documentary was broadcast in several parts on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. The companion book ({{ISBN|0-385-51198-1}}) was co-authored by MacNeil and William Cran.

There has been a long-standing '''influence of [[French language|French]] on [[English language|English]],''' in terms of [[syntax]], [[grammar]], [[lexicon]], spelling and pronunciation.

Most French vocabulary that entered English occurred after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 and the establishment of a French-speaking administration. French became the language of the court, the administration and the elites for several centuries, until after the [[Hundred Years War]]. English has been constantly influenced by French from that time till present day.
According to Laura K. Lawless, more than a third of the current [[English vocabulary]] is of French origin.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm |website=french.about.com |title=Terms of Enrichment: How French Has Influenced English |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216063051/http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm# |archive-date=2016-12-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to linguist [[Henriette Walter]], words of French origin represent more than two thirds of the English vocabulary. It is estimated by linguist Anthony Lacoudre that over 40 000 English words are directly French and may be understood without [[orthographical]] change by French speakers.&lt;ref name="dailymotion"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5vbb1z |title=L&amp;#039;incroyable histoire des mots français dans la langue anglaise – Vidéo dailymotion |website=dailymotion.com |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of French in England ==

=== Before 1066 ===
At the beginning of XIth century, the English language did not have a well-defined status. Indeed, the inhabitants of what would become [[Great Britain]] did not have a language that allowed them to communicate with each other. There were many different [[dialect]]al forms. Great Britain, in which various [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] idioms had coexisted since the IVth century, had experienced partial [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation]] since the 1st century A.D., and this for four centuries.

From 450 onwards, the [[Saxons]], the [[Angles (people)|Angles]] and the [[Jutes]], who came from the continent, settled in the south and east. Germanic dialects would prevail in these regions, supplanting Celtic dialects, which would remain in the west and north of the island ([[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[Scotland]]) and [[Ireland]]. In the VIIIth century, [[Vikings]] from [[Scandinavia]] settled on the island. Their languages, also Germanic, in turn influence the languages already present on the island. Thus, at the dawn of XIth century, the country was made up of a series of peoples with significantly different speeches, most of them Germanic, with multiple influences.

=== Norman conquest of England and its consequences ===
It is therefore a linguistically disunited people that the Normans will get massively in contact with, from 1066. [[William II of Normandy]], supported by his King, [[Philip I of France]], and his blood legitimacy to the throne of England, landed at [[Hastings]], in [[Sussex]], on 29 September 1066. His men are deployed around the city waiting for the king [[Harold II]]'s troops. On October 14, exhausted by the long journey to Hastings, Harold II's troops lost the battle after a day. Following the defeat of the English, Duke William II of Normandy became King of England on December 25, 1066, crowned under the name of William I of England, also known as William the Conqueror. This date marks the beginning of a long period of ties between the peoples and languages.

In fact, these links already existed before the Battle of Hastings. Indeed, the geographical location of Normandy, facing the English Channel, favoured commercial contacts with England. These ties will be further strengthened at the beginning of the XIth century when the daughter of the Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], Emma, marries King [[Æthelred II of England]]. But it is really from the 1066 conquest that [[proto-English]] becomes massively impregnated with [[Old French]], then modern French. It should be noted, however, that only French will influence English in the centuries following the conquest. The reverse contribution of English to French will only be real from the XVIIIth century.

The arrival of William the Conqueror and his barons significantly changed the linguistic situation in England. [[Norman language|Norman]] is essentially imposed in the upper layers of society. The Anglo-Saxon dialects were supplanted by Norman in the circles of the court and aristocracy, justice and the Church. The influential circles, who came from Normandy and settled in England, kept their Norman mother tongue, while the more modest rural and urban strata continued to speak English.

Norman is a particular variety of the [[Gallo-Roman]] language, spoken in Normandy. It is one of the [[Oil languages]] alongside, among others, the [[Picard language|Picard]] and the [[Walloon language|Walloon]]. The Norman language is modified in contact with the [[Anglo-Saxon]] language. It then integrates words and phrases from English and will give birth to a dialect, [[Anglo-Norman (language)|Anglo-Norman]], still spoken on the [[Anglo-Norman isles]]. Anglo-Norman can be described as a [[vernacular language]], on English soil in the XIth century, in the field of literature, culture, court and among the clergy. French was therefore, at first, spoken in England under the form of this Anglo-Norman dialect.

During the XIIth century, continental French has a greater influence on Old English. It acquires great prestige in England, especially within the aristocracy and the clergy. It becomes the language of law and justice nationwide. Rich and noble families, most of them of Norman origin, teach their children French or send them to study in France. The expansion of the French language in England was also encouraged by royal marriages. From [[Henry II Plantagenet]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] at the beginning of the century, to [[Henri VI]] and [[Marguerite of Anjou|Marguerite]] in the XVth century, all kings of England married French princesses. These marriages made French the language of the English court for several centuries and were decisive in strengthening the use of French in England. This period (XIIth-XVth centuries) is characterized by a massive influx of French words into Old English vocabulary.&lt;ref name="le-mot-juste-en-anglais"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html |title=Comment le français a influencé la langue anglaise |website=Le mot juste en anglais |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120221242/https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html# |archive-date=2018-11-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1204, [[Philippe Auguste]] Normandy is officially annexed to the kingdom of France, politically isolating England from the continent. Normans who choose to stay in England move further away from France and, therefore, from the French language. Keeping its status as the language of justice and the language of power, England saw the first teaching manuals for teaching French to the English. These manuals were intended for English nobles who wish to perfect their knowledge of French and teach it to their children. Two types of French spoken in the higher spheres of English society can be distinguished during the XIIIth century : the Anglo-Norman dialect, which was the aristocrats' mother tongue, and a more prestigious type of French as a second language. Knowing "parisian" French was a mark of social distinction. As a language of culture, French supplanted Latin from the XIIth century onward as the language of diplomacy and worldly relations throughout Europe. The mass and influence of French literature reinforced its reputation and appeal.

=== The developing use of French ===
The [[XVIth century]], that of the [[Renaissance]], is a decisive century for French since king [[François I of France]], through the [[Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterêts]] ([[1539]]), makes French the official language of administration in the whole kingdom.
Although troubled by the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Italian Wars]], the language is marked by intellectual, technical and scientific effervescence. It ushered in an era of prosperity that would also spread to England through French.

The XVIIth century announces the apogee of the Kingdom of France. This period was characterized by the political, literary and artistic prestige of France and the French language. Peace restored and unity ensured in the country, economy grew considerably. Personalities such as the King [[Henri IV of France|Henri IV]], the [[Cardinal of Richelieu]] or the [[Sun King]] contribute to fixing and enhancing the French language in Europe, the Americas, India and Oceania.

The creation of the [[Académie française]] by Richelieu in 1635, under [[Louis XIII]], was a step that led to the standardization of French in continental Europe and abroad, including England. French is then the second language of all the elites in Europe, from Turkey to Ireland and from Moscow to Lisbon. The greatest scholars and intellectuals, writers and scientists, express themselves and correspond in this new standardised French. French is considered a perfect language, whose beauty and elegance are determined by the development of scientific logic, aided by dictionaries and grammars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/caief_0571-5865_1992_num_44_1_1775|title=Le Français face à l'anglais : aspects linguistiques|first=Michael D.|last=Picone|date=22 November 1992|publisher=|journal=Cahiers de l'Association internationale des études francaises|volume=44|issue=1|pages=9–23|doi=10.3406/caief.1992.1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the XXIst Century ==
The geographical use of French has continuously and greatly diversified in the last five hundred years, with countries and states like [[New-Brunswick]], [[Quebec]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Benin]], [[Togo]], [[Guinea]], [[Cameroon]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Tchad]], [[Djibouti]], [[Senegal]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[French Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Vanuatu]] adopting it as their official language. This geographical diversity has led to many different contacts with [[vernacular]] dialects, regional and international languages, from which French has often been enriched locally.
In a number of countries and regions where French shares co-officiality with English (Cameroon, [[Canada]], [[Jersey]], [[Mauritius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311113430/http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rwanda]], Vanuatu), particular lexical regionalisms are observed where French and English terms are used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr/articles.php?pg=850|title=Avenir de la Langue Française (ALF) - Ile Maurice|first=|last=MAR|website=www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contribution of the French lexicon to English ==
Several elements must be observed.

* Sometimes, the English words' form has kept traces of Old French, written or oral, such as certain consonants (''forest'' / forest) or certain vowels or diphthongs (''veil'' / voil; ''leisure'' / leisure), the current French sometimes deviating more from its old form than the English (i.e. Old French ''ante'' gives "tante" in modern French and is written 'aunt' in modern English).
* Many English nouns, verbs and adjectives borrowed from Old French have not always kept the meaning they had in Old French. Sometimes, they have developed a different meaning from French. In both cases, these words are [[false friend]]s (''egre'' giving 'sour' (''aigre'') in French while mutating into 'eager' in English).
* Other English words are composed of both words of French and Germanic origins (''handkerchief'': ''hand'' is from the proto-Germanic ''k'''hand'''uz'' and ''kerchief'' is a mutation on the old French ''core chief'')
* Some forms of Old French did not survive in modern French, while they still exist in English (''soulace'',''conceler'',''estriver'',''gone'').
* It is not uncommon either for an English concept to have two or even three vocabulary words to describe it, one of French origin, a part from proto-Germanic and another of Latin origin (''royal'', ''kingly'', and ''regal'' all mean the same thing, 'royal').
* Most of the English words ending in ''-ous'', ''-ty'' (on the model of ''-té''),''-tion'', ''-ture'', ''-ture'', ''-ent'' are of French origin.
* Uses in social and intellectual life, but also certain domestic and food uses, demonstrate the omnipresence of French in English society in many fields, for example the names of meat: "beef" comes from the French ''buef'' (beef), "mutton" from ''moton'' (sheep), "pork" from ''pork'', "veal" from ''vel'' (calf).
* Some words borrowed in the XIXth and XXth centuries are still considered foreign words, French words (such as ''chic''). They are generally used by educated English people or by the press and other media and are seen as part of a distinguished language.
* Some [[Anglicisms]] are actually words that were borrowed from French a long time ago and have recently been borrowed back from English (such as ''bacon'').

The following French glossary in English is in no way exhaustive. These words come as examples to illustrate the countless French words that are part of the English language.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In this section, examples of French-to-English lexical contributions are classified by field and in chronological order. The periods during which these words were used in the English language are specified as much as possible. It is not always possible to state with certainty the precise period from which a word was borrowed or integrated.

The English word is on the left, with its current French equivalent in brackets, then comes its Old French origin in bold and the century of its introduction on the right.

'''Language''' is a system that consists of the development, acquisition, maintenance and use of complex systems of [[communication]], particularly the [[human]] ability to do so&lt;!--Do not remove the qualifier "human" without first reading the article or consulting the discussions about this issue.--&gt;; and '''a language''' is any specific example of such a system.

The scientific study of language is called [[linguistics]]. Questions concerning the [[philosophy of language]], such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated at least since [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] in [[ancient Greece]]. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] have argued that language originated from [[emotion]]s while others like [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].

Estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and [[dialect]]s. [[Natural language]]s are [[speech|spoken]] or [[sign language|signed]], but any language can be [[Encoding (semiotics)|encoded]] into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]&amp;nbsp;– for example, in [[Whistled language|whistling]], [[sign language|signed]], or [[braille]]. This is because human language is [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]-independent. Depending on [[philosophy of language|philosophical perspectives]] regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the [[cognitive]] ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of [[semiosis]] to relate [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] to particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. [[Oral language|Oral]], [[sign language|manual]] and tactile languages contain a [[phonology|phonological]] system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or [[morpheme]]s, and a [[syntax|syntactic]] system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.

Human language has the properties of [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]] and [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of [[animal communication]]. Language is thought to have originated when early [[hominin]]s started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a [[Theory of mind|theory of other minds]] and a shared [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Chomsky|Fitch|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the [[human brain]], but especially in [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s. Humans [[language acquisition|acquire]] language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human [[culture]]. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[social stratification]], as well as [[social grooming]] and [[entertainment]].

Languages [[language change|evolve]] and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]] by [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparing]] modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a [[language family]]. The [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]] is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hindi]]; the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan family]] includes [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]] and the other [[Chinese language]]s, and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]; the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic family]] includes [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Somali language|Somali]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the [[Bantu languages]] include [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Zulu language|Zulu]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout [[Africa]]; and the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] include [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the [[Pacific]]. The languages of the [[Dravidian language|Dravidian family]], spoken mostly in Southern India, include [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]].  Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become [[Language death|extinct]] by the year 2100.

== Definitions ==
{{main|Philosophy of language}}
The English word ''language'' derives ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s}}'' "tongue, speech, language" through [[Latin]] ''lingua'', "language; tongue", and [[Old French]] ''[[wikt:language#Old French|language]]''.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=language |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=3rd|year=1992|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is sometimes used to refer to [[code]]s, [[cipher]]s, and other kinds of [[constructed language|artificially constructed communication systems]] such as formally defined computer languages used for [[programming language|computer programming]]. Unlike conventional human languages, a [[formal language]] in this sense is a [[system]] of [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] for [[encoding]] and decoding [[information]]. This article specifically concerns the properties of [[Natural language|natural human language]] as it is studied in the discipline of [[linguistics]].

As an object of linguistic study, "language" has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. "[[French language|French]]". The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word ''langage'' for language as a concept, ''[[langue and parole|langue]]'' as a specific instance of a language system, and ''parole'' for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.&lt;ref name="Lyons2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="LyonsIntro"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory.&lt;ref name="TraskLanguage"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pages=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.{{sfn|Bett|2010}}

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world&amp;nbsp;– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the [[linguistic turn]] and philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.{{sfn|Devitt|Sterelny|1999}}

===Mental faculty, organ or instinct===
One definition sees language primarily as the [[mind|mental faculty]] that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the [[human brain]]. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, [[creole languages]] and spontaneously developed sign languages such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]]. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely [[innatism|innate]], for example, in [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] theory of [[Universal Grammar]], or American philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]]'s extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a [[cognitive science]] framework and in [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Fitch|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pinker|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal symbolic system===
Another definition sees language as a [[formal system]] of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed [[structural linguistics|structural systems]] consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=93}} This [[structuralism|structuralist]] view of language was first introduced by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]],&lt;ref name="Saussure"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Saussure|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of Saussure's view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is [[Noam Chomsky]], the originator of the [[generative linguistics|generative theory of grammar]], who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=130}} Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Chomsky|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in [[formal logic]], in [[formal grammar|formal]] [[theoretical linguistics|theories of grammar]], and in applied [[computational linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=93, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|1998|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and other [[formal logic]]ians.

===Tool for communication===
[[File:ASL family.jpg|right|thumb|A conversation in [[American Sign Language]]]]
Yet another definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment. [[Functional theories of grammar]] explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was "tailored" to serve the communicative needs of its users.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Van Valin|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of language is associated with the study of language in [[pragmatics|pragmatic]], [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]], and interactive frameworks, as well as in [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]]. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of [[linguistic typology]], or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of [[grammaticalization]] tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as [[J.L. Austin]], [[Paul Grice]], [[John Searle]], and [[Willard van Orman Quine|W.O. Quine]].{{sfn|Nerlich|2010|p=192}}

===Unique status of human language===
{{main|Animal language|Great ape language}}

A number of features, many of which were described by [[Charles Hockett]] and called [[Hockett's design features|design features]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |title=The Problem of Universals in Language |last=Hockett |first=Charles F. |date=1966 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110023354/http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |archive-date=10 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2013-05-11 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; set human language apart from other known systems of communication, such as those used by non-human [[Animal language|animals]].

Communication systems used by other animals such as [[Bee learning and communication|bees]] or [[great ape language|apes]] are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hockett|1960}}; {{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, human language is open-ended and [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]], meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form an infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).&lt;ref name="Trask5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one study has demonstrated that an Australian bird, the [[chestnut-crowned babbler]], is capable of using the same acoustic elements in different arrangements to create two functionally distinct vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Crane |first2=Jodie S.|last3=Savage |first3=James L.|last4=Russel |first4=Andrew F. |last5=Townsend |first5=Simon W. |date=29 June 2015 |title=Experimental Evidence for Phonemic Contrasts in a Nonhuman Vocal System |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=13|issue=6|pages=e1002171|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002171|pmid=26121619 |pmc=4488142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Southern pied babbler|pied babblers]] have demonstrated the ability to generate two functionally distinct vocalisations composed of the same sound type, which can only be distinguished by the number of repeated elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Ridley |first2=Amanda R.|last3=Townsend |first3=Simon W. |date=20 July 2017 |title=Element repetition rates encode functionally distinct information in pied babbler 'clucks' and 'purrs' |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=20 |issue=5|pages=953–60|doi=10.1007/s10071-017-1114-6|pmid=28730513|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/89798/7/WRAP-element-repetition-rates-encode-functionally-Townsend-2017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through social learning: for instance a [[bonobo]] named [[Kanzi]] learned to express itself using a set of symbolic [[lexigram]]s. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The gorilla [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] reportedly uses as many as 1000 words in [[American Sign Language]], and understands 2000 words of spoken English. There are some doubts about whether her use of signs is based on complex understanding or simple [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]]; {{harvcoltxt|Candland|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ [[grammatical categories|grammatical and semantic categories]], such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used to express exceedingly complex meanings.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"/&gt; Human language is also unique in having the property of [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursivity]]: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun phrase (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]&lt;/nowiki&gt;") or a clause can contain another clause (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[I see [the dog is running]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;").&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt; Human language is also the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as ''modality independent''. This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality, whereas [[sign language]]s and writing use the visual modality, and [[braille]] writing uses the tactile modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=165–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human language is also unique in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called ''[[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]]'', and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of [[bee]]s that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.&lt;ref name="Trask5"/&gt;

}}
Theories about the origin of language differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on the generative view of language pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]] see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ulbaek|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky is one prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"/&gt; He suggests that for scholars interested in the nature of language, "talk about the evolution of the language capacity is beside the point."{{sfn|Chomsky|1972|p=86}} Chomsky proposes that perhaps "some random mutation took place [...] and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}} Though cautioning against taking this story literally, Chomsky insists that "it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}}

Continuity-based theories are held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], hold the precedents to be [[animal cognition]],&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt; whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist [[Michael Tomasello]], see it as having developed from [[animal communication]] in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation.&lt;ref name="Tomasello 2008"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from [[music]], a view already espoused by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], and [[Charles Darwin]]. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]].{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=466–507}} [[Stephen R. Anderson|Stephen Anderson]] states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered&amp;nbsp;... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because language emerged in the early [[prehistory]] of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a [[larynx]] capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=250–92}}

It was mostly undisputed that pre-human [[australopithecine]]s did not have communication systems significantly different from those found in [[great ape]]s in general. However, a 2017 study on [[Origin of language#Ardipithecus ramidus|Ardipithecus ramidus]] challenges this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |pmid=28363458 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus  and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=101–21 |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (2.3 million years ago) while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.8 million years ago) or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' (0.6 million years ago), and the development of language proper with [[Anatomically modern humans|Anatomically Modern ''Homo sapiens'']] with the [[behavioral modernity|Upper Paleolithic revolution]] less than 100,000 years ago.{{sfn|Foley|1997|pp=70–74}}{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=292–93}}

{{main|Linguistics|History of linguistics}}
The study of language, [[linguistics]], has been developing into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in [[India]] more than 2000 years ago, after the development of the [[Brahmi script]]. Modern linguistics is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdisciplines===
The academic study of language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, [[descriptive linguistics]] examines the grammar of single languages, [[theoretical linguistics]] develops theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, [[sociolinguistics]] studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, [[neurolinguistics]] studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, [[computational linguistics]] builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and [[historical linguistics]] relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the [[comparative method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
The formal study of language is often considered to have started in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. However, [[Sumer]]ian scribes already studied the differences between [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century AD, the French [[Port-Royal Grammar]]ians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by British [[philologist]] and expert on ancient India [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1914|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.&lt;ref name="Saussure"/&gt;

By introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|Langue-parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue''), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clarke|1990|pages=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary linguistics===
In the 1960s, [[Noam Chomsky]] formulated the [[Generative linguistics|generative theory of language]]. According to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]]; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the formal theories of the generative school, [[Functional theories of grammar|functional theories of language]] propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. [[Formal grammar|Formal theories of grammar]] seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Functional grammar analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyzes the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approaches not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate even as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formal and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation"; {{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework of [[cognitive linguistics]] interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|Cruse|2004|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological and neural architecture of language and speech==
Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=11–14, 105–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the [[genetics|genetic]] bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is [[FOXP2]], which may cause a kind of [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia|congenital language disorder]] if affected by [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fisher|Lai|Monaco|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brain===
{{main|Neurolinguistics|Language processing in the brain}}
[[File:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|Language Areas of the brain. The [[Angular Gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[Supramarginal Gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green, and the [[Primary Auditory Cortex]] is represented in pink.]] The brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref name="Lesser205"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lesser|1989|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is [[Wernicke's area]], which is in the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop [[receptive aphasia]], a condition in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax|sentence structure]]. The second area is [[Broca's area]], in the posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop [[expressive aphasia]], meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=105–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, [[word repetition]], and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|p=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[electrophysiology]] to study language processing in individuals without impairments.&lt;ref name="Lesser205"/&gt;

Spoken language relies on human physical ability to produce [[sound]], which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the [[ear drum]]. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box ([[larynx]]), and the upper vocal tract&amp;nbsp;– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of [[Segment (linguistics)|segmental and suprasegmental]] elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[phonation]] type, voice [[timbre]], and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], all of which may have effects across multiple segments.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consonant]]s and [[vowel]] segments combine to form [[syllable]]s, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. [[Acoustics|Acoustically]], these different segments are characterized by different [[formant]] structures, that are visible in a [[spectrogram]] of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; Vowels are called ''[[Close vowel|close]]'' when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel {{ipa|[i]}} (English "ee"), or ''[[open vowel|open]]'' when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel {{ipa|[a]}} (English "ah"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes, creating vowels such as {{ipa|[u]}} (English "oo"). The quality also changes depending on whether the lips are [[Roundedness|rounded]] as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that between {{ipa|[i]}} (unrounded front vowel such as English "ee") and {{ipa|[y]}} ([[rounded front vowel]] such as German "ü").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, [[alveolar ridge]], [[palate]], [[Soft palate|velum]], [[uvula]], or [[glottis]]. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by [[manner of articulation]], or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called ''[[occlusive]]'' or ''[[stop consonant|stop]]'', or different degrees of aperture creating ''[[fricative]]s'' and ''[[approximant consonant|approximants]]''. Consonants can also be either ''[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced or unvoiced]]'', depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English {{ipa|[s]}} in ''bus'' ([[sibilant|unvoiced sibilant]]) from {{ipa|[z]}} in ''buzz'' ([[Voiced alveolar sibilant#Voiced alveolar sibilant|voiced sibilant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and these are called ''[[Nasal consonant|nasals]]'' or ''[[Nasalization|nasalized]]'' sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called ''[[Lateral consonant|laterals]]'', because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called ''[[rhotics]]'') that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt;

By using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
When described as a system of [[symbolic communication]], language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[meaning (semiotics)|meanings]], and a [[code (semiotics)|code]] connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of [[semiosis]], how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called [[semiotics]]. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ancient Tamil Script.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription at [[Thanjavur]]]]
Some of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"/&gt;

The rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called [[syntax]] or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called [[semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=218–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantics===
{{main|Semantics|Semiotics|Meaning (linguistics)}}
Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.

Thus, languages must have a [[vocabulary]] of signs related to specific meaning. The English sign "dog" denotes, for example, a member of the species ''[[Canis familiaris]]''. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the [[lexicon]], and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a [[lexeme]]. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of [[Grammatical category|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages contain the semantic structure of [[predicate (grammar)|predication]]: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign [[truth value]]s to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[x [is y]]" or "[x [does y]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"/&gt;

===Sounds and symbols===

Depending on modality, language structure can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in [[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Goldsmith|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called [[phonetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"/&gt;

Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called [[phonemes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called [[minimal pair]]. In English, for example, the words ''bat'' {{ipa|[bæt]}} and ''pat'' {{ipa|[pʰæt]}} form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/p/}} differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}} (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between [[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated and non-aspirated]] pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Hindi]] do: the unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''spin'' {{ipa|[spɪn]}} and the aspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''pin'' {{ipa|[pʰɪn]}} are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called [[allophones]]), whereas in [[Mandarin Chinese]], the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words {{ipa|[pʰá]}} 'crouch' and {{ipa|[pá]}} 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).&lt;ref name="Trask214"/&gt;

All [[oral language|spoken languages]] have phonemes of at least two different categories, [[vowels]] and [[consonants]], that can be combined to form [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[pitch accent|pitch]], [[Vowel length|duration]], and [[tonal language|tone]] to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called [[suprasegmental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] and [[Pirahã language]] with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like [[Taa language#Phonology|Taa]] may have as many as 141 phonemes.&lt;ref name="Trask214"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sign language]]s, [[Phoneme#Phonemes in sign languages|the equivalent to phonemes]] (formerly called [[chereme]]s) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C. (1960). ''Sign Language Structure: An Outline of the Visual Communication Systems of the American Deaf,'' Studies in linguistics: Occasional papers (No. 8). Buffalo: Dept. of Anthropology and Linguistics, University of Buffalo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg (1965). ''A dictionary of American sign languages on linguistic principles.'' Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|pp=539–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Writing system]]s represent language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The [[Latin alphabet]] (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the [[Inuktitut]] syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In [[logographic]] scripts, each sign represents an entire word,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.

Because all languages have a very large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the [[Arabic script]]), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Coulmas|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===
{{main|Grammar}}
Grammar is the study of how meaningful elements called ''[[morpheme]]s'' within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be ''free'' or ''bound''. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called ''[[word]]s'', and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called [[affix]]es. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called ''syntax''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grammatical categories====
{{main|Grammatical category}}
Grammar can be described as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Allerton|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically [[morphosyntactic alignment|distinguishing between their relations]] to a predicate, the encoding of [[Grammatical tense|temporal]] and [[Preposition and postposition|spatial]] relations on predicates, and a system of [[grammatical person]] governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Word classes====
Languages organize their [[parts of speech]] into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as "dog" and "song", are usually called [[noun]]s. The second, which includes "run" and "sing", are called [[verb]]s. Another common category is the [[adjective]]: words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as "red" or "big". Word classes can be "open" if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively "closed" if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix, as in "noun-like"). In other languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]], the situation is the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically, verbs are used to construct [[predicate (grammar)|predicates]], while nouns are used as [[argument]]s of predicates. In a sentence such as "Sally runs", the predicate is "runs", because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally". Some verbs such as "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John". A predicate that can only take a single argument is called [[transitivity (grammar)|''intransitive'']], while a predicate that can take two arguments is called [[transitive verb|''transitive'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] like "and" that serve to join two sentences, [[article (grammar)|articles]] that introduce a noun, [[interjections]] such as "wow!", or [[ideophones]] like "splash" that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the general noun classifier for humans is ''nin'' (人), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Senft|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''san-nin no gakusei'' (三人の学生) lit. "3 human-classifier of student"&amp;nbsp;— three students
For trees, it would be:
:''san-bon no ki'' (三本の木) lit. "3 classifier-for-long-objects of tree"&amp;nbsp;— three trees

====Morphology====
In linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several [[morpheme]]s. For instance, the English word "unexpected" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes "un-", "expect" and "-ed".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aronoff|Fudeman|2011|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or [[affix]]es can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: ''[[prefix]]es'' precede the root, [[suffix]]es follow the root, and [[infix]]es are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word "run", which in the past tense is "ran". This process is called ''[[ablaut]]''. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of [[inflection]], which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of [[Morphological derivation|derivation]], which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb "sing" has the inflectional forms "singing" and "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Bauer|2003}}; {{harvcoltxt|Haspelmath|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called [[Isolating language|isolating]], or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word ''bonus'', or "good", consists of the root ''bon-'', meaning "good", and the suffix -''us'', which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and [[nominative]] case. These languages are called ''[[fusional languages]]'', because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are [[agglutinative languages]] which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is [[Turkish language|Turkish]], where for example, the word ''evlerinizden'', or "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ''ev-ler-iniz-den'' with the meanings ''house-plural-your-from''. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called [[polysynthetic languages]]. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in [[Persian language|Persian]] the single word ''nafahmidamesh'' means ''I didn't understand it'' consisting of morphemes ''na-fahm-id-am-esh'' with the meanings, "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with more complexity, in the [[Yupik language|Yupik]] word ''tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq'', which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes ''tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq'' with the meanings, "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme ''tuntu'' ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called ''[[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]''. For example, in many Indo-European languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective ''bonus'', or "good", is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example, in the [[Basque language|Basque]] phrase ''ikusi nauzu'', or "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb ''n-au-zu'' (similar to English "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the ''n''- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the – ''zu'' suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see you-did-me"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syntax====
{{main|Syntax}}
[[File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|In addition to word classes, a sentence can be analyzed in terms of grammatical functions: "The cat" is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the phrase, "on the mat" is a [[locative (case)|locative]] phrase, and "sat" is the core of the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].]]

Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as "I love you" is meaningful, but "*love you I" is not.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The prefixed asterisk * conventionally indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical, i.e. syntactically incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt; Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baker|2001|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master was cursing the slaves" mean different things, because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in [[Latin language|Latin]], both ''Dominus servos vituperabat'' and ''Servos vituperabat dominus'' mean "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because ''servos'', or "slaves", is in the [[accusative case]], showing that they are the [[Object (grammar)|grammatical object]] of the sentence, and ''dominus'', or "master", is in the [[nominative case]], showing that he is the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of [[Wh-movement|inverse word order in questions]], which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question, it becomes "Who is John talking to?", and not "John is talking to who?". The latter example may be used as a way of placing [[focus (linguistics)|special emphasis]] on "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called [[phrase]]s, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.{{sfn|Baker|2001|pp=269–70}} To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=218–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out. For example, "the cat" is one phrase, and "on the mat" is another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: "[And] on the mat, the cat sat".&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"/&gt; There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;

===Typology and universals===
{{Main|Linguistic typology|Linguistic universal}}

Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1992}};{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic [[word order]], the relative order of the [[verb]], and its constituents in a normal indicative [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. In English, the basic order is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]]: "The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)", whereas for example, the corresponding sentence in the [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian language]] [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] would be ''d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy'' (snake man bit), [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]].&lt;ref name="CroftErg"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word order type is relevant as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of [[prepositions]] or [[postpositions]]. Such correlations are called [[Linguistic universals|implicational universals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Greenberg|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]] type have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009|p=45}}; {{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1994|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses the [[Nominative–absolutive language|nominative-accusative]] word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun ''I''. Some languages, called [[Ergativity|ergative]], Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such as "I run", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of "me run". Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun "I" be used.&lt;ref name="CroftErg"/&gt; In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the [[Tripartite language|tripartite type]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages, "language universals", or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;

==Social contexts of use and transmission==
[[File:Place des Abbesse (the plaque with the je t'aime=te iubesc in 311 laguages).jpg|thumb|The [[Wall of Love]] in [[Paris]], where the phrase "I love you" is featured in 250 languages of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.travelfranceonline.com/wall-of-love-mur-des-je-taime-montmartre/|title=Wall of Love&amp;nbsp;– Mur des Je t'aime&amp;nbsp;– Montmartre|publisher=Travel France Online|accessdate = 30 November 2014|date=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on [[speech community|communities of speakers]] in which children [[language acquisition|learn language]] from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to [[communicate]] and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.&lt;ref name="Myths"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Evans|Levinson|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to [[language contact]]. The process is similar to the process of [[evolution]], where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a [[phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, languages differ from biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of [[diffusion]], as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their [[first language]] or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming [[endangered language|endangered]] as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage and meaning===
{{main|Pragmatics}}

The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called [[deixis]], which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, "I" (which designates the person speaking), "now" (which designates the moment of speaking), and "here" (which designates the position of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=54–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of "naming", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of "pronouncing someone man and wife", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called [[speech act]]s, although they can also be carried out through writing or hand signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=226–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called [[conversational implicature]]s. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring [[communicative competence]] in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=100–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
{{main|Language acquisition|Second-language acquisition|Second language|Language education}}
All healthy, [[Human development (biology)|normally developing]] human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children acquiring [[sign language|sign]] or [[oral language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bonvillian |first1=John D. |author2=Michael D. Orlansky |author3=Leslie Lazin Novack |title=Developmental milestones: Sign language acquisition and motor development |journal=Child Development |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=December 1983 |pages=1435–45 |doi=10.2307/1129806|pmid=6661942 |jstor=1129806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study. In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'', naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] called this process "an instinctive tendency to acquire an art".&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt;

First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different [[Phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]]. Around six months of age, a child will begin [[babbling]], producing the speech sounds or [[handshape]]s of the languages used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average [[vocabulary]] of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 [[word]]s. A child's first [[utterance]]s are [[Holophrasis|holophrases]] (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, he or she will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin to produce [[telegraphic speech]], or short sentences that are less [[Grammar|grammatically]] complex than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the point that it resembles adult language.&lt;ref name="OGrady-Cho"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=O'Grady |first1=William |last2=Cho |first2=Sook Whan |chapter=First language acquisition |title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=fourth |location=Boston |publisher=Bedford St. Martin's |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennison"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kennison|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies published in 2013 have indicated that unborn [[fetus]]es are capable of language acquisition to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;"First Impressions: We start to pick up words, food preferences and hand-eye coordination long before being born", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 1 (July 2015), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beth Skwarecki, "Babies Learn to Recognize Words in the Womb", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 26 August 2013 [http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2013/08/babies-learn-recognize-words-womb]&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Macaro|editor-first1=Ernesto| year=2010 | title=Continuum companion to second language acquisition|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9922-5|pages=137–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
{{see also|Culture#Language_and_culture|l1=Culture|Speech community}}
[[File:Arnold Lakhovsky Conversation.png|thumb|right|[[Arnold Lakhovsky]], ''The Conversation'' (c. 1935)]]
Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but also through having different "cultures of speaking." Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]], [[Anthropological linguistics|ethnolinguists]], and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between [[Speech community|speech communities]].&lt;ref name=Duranti2003&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Duranti|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists use the term "[[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]" to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically or socioculturally defined [[dialect]]s as well as the [[register (sociolinguistics)|jargons]] or [[style shifting|styles]] of [[subculture]]s. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Agha|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups, or between [[social class]]es, just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dixon|1972|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures, for example, have elaborate systems of "social [[deixis]]", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=311–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor", or "Your Honor", but in other languages, such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in languages of east Asia such as [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Old Javanese|Javanese]], different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"/&gt;

===Writing, literacy and technology===
{{main|Writing|Literacy}}
[[File:Winnipeg Forks - Plains Cree Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An inscription of [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] using [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], an [[abugida]] developed by Christian missionaries for Indigenous Canadian languages]]
Throughout history a number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented. These are called [[writing systems]].

The use of writing has made language even more useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and [[formal education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Olson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[4th millennium BC]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]]. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of [[cultural diffusion]]. A similar debate exists for the [[Chinese script]], which developed around 1200 BC. The [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] (including among others [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script]]s) are generally believed to have had independent origins.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"/&gt;

===Change===
{{main|Language change|Grammaticalization}}
[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The first page of the poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', written in [[Old English]] in the early medieval period (800–1100 AD). Although Old English is the direct ancestor of modern English, it is unintelligible to contemporary English speakers.]]
All languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire [[Phonological change|phonological system]]. [[Sound change]] can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or [[distinctive feature|phonetic feature]] by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be ''conditioned'' in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be ''regular'', which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be ''sporadic'', affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a [[chain shift]] in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the [[Germanic languages]] when the sound change known as [[Grimm's law]] affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *{{PIE|bʰ}} became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous *{{PIE|b}} in turn became /p/, and the previous *{{PIE|p}} became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why [[Italic languages]] such as Latin have ''p'' in words like '''''p'''ater'' and '''''p'''isces'', whereas Germanic languages, like English, have '''''f'''ather'' and '''''f'''ish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clackson|2007|pp=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin ''mea domina'' to eventually become the [[French language|French]] ''madame'' and American English ''ma'am''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as [[idiom]]s or particular constructions become [[grammaticalized]]. This frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of [[Caribbean Spanish]] the final /s/ has eroded away. Since [[Standard Spanish]] uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking the [[grammatical person|second person]] subject "you" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun ''tú''. This means that the sentence "what's your name" is ''¿como te llamas?'' {{ipa|[ˈkomo te ˈjamas]}} in Standard Spanish, but {{ipa|[ˈkomo ˈtu te ˈjama]}} in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Zentella|2002|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English "going to" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. ''I'm gonna'').

Language change may be motivated by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] towards more common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as social classes, or with [[Language ideology|ideologies]], and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact===
{{main|language contact}}
One important source of language change is contact and resulting [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] interact on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multilingualism]] is likely to have been the norm throughout [[human history]] and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the [[Nation state|ethno-national state]], monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Romaine|2001|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this may lead to the formation of [[Sprachbund|language areas]] in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the [[Balkan language area]], the [[Mesoamerican language area]], and the [[Ethiopian language area]]. Also, larger areas such as [[South Asia]], Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific [[areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aikhenvald|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including [[language convergence]], [[loanword|borrowing]], and [[relexification]] (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new [[mixed language]]s that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called [[pidgins]] occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a [[creole language]]. An example of such mixed languages is [[Tok Pisin]], the official language of [[Papua New-Guinea]], which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and [[Austronesian languages]]; others are [[Haitian Creole|Kreyòl ayisyen]], the French-based creole language spoken in [[Haiti]], and [[Michif language|Michif]], a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language [[Cree language|Cree]] and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}}; {{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Matras|Bakker|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[SIL Ethnologue]]'' defines a "living language" as "one that has at least one speaker for whom it is their first language". The exact number of known living languages varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of "language", and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and [[dialects]]. As of 2016, ''Ethnologue'' cataloged 7,097 living human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics|title = Ethnologue statistics|website = Summary by world area {{!}} Ethnologue|publisher = SIL|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ethnologue'' establishes linguistic groups based on studies of [[mutual intelligibility]], and therefore often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example, the [[Danish language]] that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutish]]) by the ''Ethnologue''.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt;

According to the ''Ethnologue'', 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers. These languages together account for 94% of the world's population, whereas 94% of the world's languages account for the remaining 6% of the global population. To the right is a table of the world's 10 most spoken languages with population estimates from the ''Ethnologue'' (2009 figures).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages and dialects===
{{main|Dialect#Dialect or language}}
[[File:Novi Sad mayor office.jpg|thumb|[[Multilingualism|Multi-lingual]] sign outside the [[mayor]]'s office in [[Novi Sad]], written in the four official languages of the city: [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian Rusyn]]]]
There is no [[Language or dialect|clear distinction]] between a language and a [[dialect]], notwithstanding a famous [[aphorism]] attributed to linguist [[Max Weinreich]] that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]".&lt;ref name="5 minute linguist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rickerson |first=E.M. |title=What's the difference between dialect and language? |url=http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |work=The Five Minute Linguist |publisher=College of Charleston |accessdate=17 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219070627/http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] are, for example, often classified as "dialects" of Chinese, even though they are more different from each other than [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is from [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. Before the [[Yugoslav civil war]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] was considered a single language with two dialects, but now [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] are considered different languages and employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive [[writing system]]s, or degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language families of the world===
{{Main|Language family|Dialectology|Historical linguistics|List of language families}}
[[File:Primary Human Language Families Map.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Principal language families of the world (and in some cases geographic groups of families). For greater detail, see ''[[:Template:Distribution of languages in the world|Distribution of languages in the world]]''.]]
The world's languages can be grouped into [[Language family|language families]] consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of [[language isolate]]s: languages that cannot be shown to be related to any other languages in the world. Among them are [[Basque language|Basque]], spoken in Europe, [[Zuni language|Zuni]] of [[New Mexico]], [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] of Mexico, [[Ainu language|Ainu]] of Japan, [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]] of [[Pakistan]], and many others.&lt;ref name="Katzner"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Katzner|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language family of the world that has the most speakers is the [[Indo-European languages]], spoken by 46% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}, "[http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/family Summary by language family]"&lt;/ref&gt; This family includes major world languages like [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the [[Eurasia]]n [[Migration Period]] (c. 400–800 AD),{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and subsequently through the [[History of colonialism|European colonial expansion]], which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the [[Americas]] and much of [[Africa]]. The [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] are spoken by 20%&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Hakka, [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Cantonese]], and hundreds of smaller languages.&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009}}; {{harvcoltxt|Brown|Ogilvie|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]] is home to a large number of language families, the largest of which is the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo language family]], which includes such languages as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Shona language|Shona]], and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; A similar number of people speak the [[Afroasiatic languages]], which include the populous [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language]], and the languages of the [[Sahara]] region, such as the [[Berber languages]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]].&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The [[Austronesian languages]] are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch from [[Madagascar]] to [[maritime Southeast Asia]] all the way to [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; It includes such languages as [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Maori language|Māori]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]], and many of the indigenous languages of [[Indonesia]] and [[Formosan languages|Taiwan]]. The Austronesian languages are considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the [[Dravidian languages]] of [[South Asia]] (among them [[Kannada language|Kannada]] [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]), the [[Turkic languages]] of Central Asia (such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] (among them [[Khmer language|Khmer]]), and [[Tai–Kadai languages]] of [[Southeast Asia]] (including [[Thai language|Thai]]).&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The areas of the world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas, [[Papua New Guinea]], [[West Africa]], and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages, though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language families include the [[Quechumaran languages|Quechumaran]], [[Arawak languages|Arawak]], and [[Tupi-Guarani languages|Tupi-Guarani]] families of South America, the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]], [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]], and [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] of [[Mesoamerica]], and the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]], [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]], and [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language families of [[North America]]. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the [[Pama-Nyungan languages|Pama-Nyungan family]], whereas New Guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.&lt;ref name="Katzner"/&gt;

===Language endangerment===
{{main|Endangered language|Language loss|Language shift|Language death|}}
[[File:Linguistic diversity.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Together, the eight countries in red contain more than 50% of the world's languages. The areas in blue are the most linguistically diverse in the world, and the locations of most of the world's endangered languages.]]
[[endangered language|Language endangerment]] occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or [[language shift|shift]] to speaking another language. [[Language loss]] occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a ''[[dead language]]''. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an ''[[extinct language]]''. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of [[globalization]] and [[neo-colonialism]], where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The more commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Moseley|2010}}: "[http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php Statistics]"&lt;/ref&gt; and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of languages by number of native speakers|top 20 languages]], those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) operates with five levels of language endangerment: "safe", "vulnerable" (not spoken by children outside the home), "definitely endangered" (not spoken by children), "severely endangered" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and "critically endangered" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often [[Speaker types|semi-speakers]]). Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common ''[[lingua franca]]'', such as English or [[Esperanto]], there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the [[tower of Babel]] in the [[Old Testament]], that linguistic diversity causes political conflict,&lt;ref name="Haugen"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Haugen|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is contradicted by the fact that many of the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav]] and [[American Civil War]], or the genocide of [[Rwanda]], whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by [[language revitalization|revitalizing]] endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted [[Language policy|specific legislation]] to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous [[speech community|speech communities]]. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chad]] has two official languages, [[French language|French]] and [[Modern Standard Arabic]], and over 120 indigenous languages.  A vernacular version of Arabic, [[Chadian Arabic]], is the [[lingua franca]].  Of the two official languages, French has the most speakers in Chad (though Chadian Arabic has more speakers in Chad than both French and Standard Arabic) [http://ec.europa.eu/development/body/publications/courier/courier197/en/en_017.pdf]. Chad submitted an application to join the [[Arab League]] as a [[Member states of the Arab League|member state]] on 25 March 2014, which is still pending.&lt;ref&gt;[[Middle East Monitor]]: [https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20140412-south-sudan-and-chad-apply-to-join-the-arab-league ''South Sudan and Chad apply to join the Arab League''], 12 April 2014, retrieved 6 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chadian Sign Language]] is actually [[Nigerian Sign Language]], a dialect of [[American Sign Language]]; [[Andrew Foster (educator)|Andrew Foster]] introduced ASL in the 1960s, and Chadian teachers for the deaf train in Nigeria.

[[Image:Signatur Jodok Pein.jpg|thumb|Jodoc Pein mppria in the [[:de:André Falquet#Adelsbrief|Certificate of Nobility for André Falquet]]]]

'''''{{Lang|la|Manu propria}}''''' ([[Latin]] for '[signed] with one's own hand'), abbreviated to '''''m.p.''''' or '''''mppria''''' is a phrase sometimes used at the end of typewritten or printed documents when there is no handwritten [[signature]]. It is typically found just after the name(s) of the person(s) who would have signed the document if it had not been printed or typewritten.

It is also found in several ancient documents in front of or after the writer's signature at the end of the document.

==History==
;Medieval period
Richly decorated ''manu propria'' signs were frequently used by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] dignitaries and literates to verify the [[Authentication|authenticity]] of handwritten documents.

;18th century
''mppria'' was commonly used in the 18th century. However, it was not only used for Latin documents.

*Full autograph title-page of Symphony no.97 by [[Joseph Haydn]] which reads 'Sinfonia in C/di me giuseppe Haydn mppria.  &lt;math&gt;\overline{792}&lt;/math&gt;'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3126938 Early Music, Vol. 10, No. 4 (Oct., 1982), pp. 496 and footnote nr. 5]: &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;The contraction of ''manu propria'' and of the date is usual&lt;/ref&gt;

;From the 19th century
Later, official documents were routinely accompanied with this abbreviation, for example [[To my peoples|declaration of war on Serbia]] by Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] from 1914 ends with ''m.p.''.

==Usage today==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2018|small=y}}
Ordinary personal [[cheque]]s frequently include the abbreviation at the end of the signature line.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

;By country
Some of the countries that still regularly use ''manu propria'' include:
*[[Albania]] in official documents: ''d.v.'' ({{Lang-sq|dora vetë}}) 
*[[Austria]]: ''e. h.'' ({{Lang-de-AT|eigenhändig}})
*the [[Czech Republic]]: ''v. r.'' ({{Lang-cs|vlastní rukou}})&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Czech Technical Norm ČSN 01 6910 6910:2007 Úprava písemností zpracovaných textovými editory. [http://prirucka.ujc.cas.cz/?id=860&amp;dotaz=vlastn%C3%AD%20rukou Online Language Handbook in Czech]&lt;/ref&gt; or occasionally the Latin abbreviation ''m.p.''
*[[Germany]]: ''gez.'' ({{Lang-de|gezeichnet}}){{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}
*[[Hungary]] in official documents: ''s.k.'' ({{Lang-hu|saját kezűleg}}).
*[[Slovakia]]: ''v. r.'' ({{Lang-sk|vlastnou rukou}})

'''Monzombo''' is a minor [[Ubangian language]] of the Congos.

There are three varieties, Monzombo (Mondjembo), Kpala (Kwala), and Yango, which ''Ethnologue'' lists separately. It is not clear how distinct they are.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26926">'''Prosodic bootstrapping''' (also known as '''phonological bootstrapping''') in [[linguistics]] refers to the hypothesis that learners of a primary language [[First language|(L1]]) use [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic features]] such as [[Pitch accent|pitch]], [[Speech tempo|tempo]], [[Rhythm (linguistics)|rhythm]], amplitude, and other auditory aspects from the speech signal as a cue to identify other properties of grammar, such as [[syntactic structure]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Child Language: Acquisition and Growth|last=Lust|first=Barbara|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-521-44922-9|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=290|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acoustically signaled [[prosodic unit]]s in the stream of [[speech]] may provide critical perceptual cues by which infants initially discover [[Generative grammar|syntactic phrases]] in their language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Although these features by themselves are not enough to help infants learn the entire syntax of their native language, they provide various cues about different grammatical properties of the language, such as identifying the ordering of [[Head (linguistics)|heads]] and [[Complement (linguistics)|complements]] in the language using [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] prominence,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christophe|first=Anne|last2=Nespor|first2=Marina|last3=Guasti|first3=Maria|last4=Ooyen|first4=Brit|year=2003|title=Prosodic structure and syntactic acquisition: the case of the head-direction parameter|journal=Developmental Science|volume=6|pages=211–220|doi=10.1111/1467-7687.00273}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating the location of [[Phrase (linguistics)|phrase boundaries]], and word boundaries.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christophe|first=Anne|last2=Guasti|first2=Teresa|last3=Nespor|first3=Marina|last4=Dupoux|first4=Emmanuel|last5=Ooyen|first5=Brit V.|year=1997|title=Reflections on Phonological Bootstrapping: Its Role for Lexical and Syntactic Acquisition|journal=Language and Cognitive Prosesses|volume=12|pages=585–612|doi=10.1080/016909697386637}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of a language plays an initial role in the [[Language acquisition|acquisition of the first language]] helping children to uncover the syntax of the language, mainly due to the fact that children are sensitive to [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] cues at a very young age.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christophe|first=Anne|last2=Mehler|first2=Jacques|last3=Sebastían-Gallés|first3=Núria|year=2001|title=Perception of Prosodic boundary Correlates by Newborn Infants|journal=Infancy|volume=2|pages=385–394|doi=10.1207/s15327078in0203_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Argument for ==
The argument for prosodic bootstrapping was first introduced by Gleitman and Wanner (1982), who observed that infants might use prosodic cues (particularly acoustic cues) to discover underlying [[Grammar|grammatical information]] about their native language.  These cues (e.g [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] contour in a question phrase, lengthening a final segment)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; could aid infants in dividing the speech input into different lexical units, and furthermore aid in placing these units into syntactic phrases appropriate to the language.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Höhle|first=Barbara|year=2009|title=Bootstrapping mechanisms in first language acquisition|url=http://www.uni-potsdam.de/fileadmin/projects/babylab/assets/Hoehle_2009.pdf|journal=Linguistics|volume=47|pages=359–382|doi=10.1515/ling.2009.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosodic bootstrapping may also provide an explanation to the problem as to how infants segment continuous input.  Just like adult speakers, children are exposed to continuous speech. Hearing continuous speech poses a problem for children learning their native language because pauses in speech do not align with word boundaries. As a result, children have to construct word representations from the speech that they hear.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christophe|first=Anne|last2=Dupoux|first2=Emmanuel|last3=Bertoncini|first3=Josiane|last4=Mehler|first4=Jacques|date=1994-03-01|title=Do infants perceive word boundaries? An empirical study of the bootstrapping of lexical acquisition|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/95/3/10.1121/1.408544|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=95|issue=3|pages=1570–1580|doi=10.1121/1.408544|issn=0001-4966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Christophe et al (1994) showed that infants, aging three-days old, are sensitive to acoustic properties of a language. It was shown that three-day olds are able to discriminate bisyllabic stimuli with the same segments based on whether they were extracted from within a word or across a word boundary. The duration of the word initial consonant and the word final vowel are the cues for the existence of a word boundary, which infants may use to learn about [[Syntax|syntactic structure]].&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

Another main support for the prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis is that the use of prosodic elements to segment parts of speech can occur at a very early age, as early as 3 days,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; where infants have shown the ability to differentiate languages based on phonological characteristics alone, and the fact that the use of prosodic cues occurs before the use of lexical or syntactic data.  This has led to hypothesis of "bootstrapping from the signal"/"prosodic bootstrapping", which has three main elements:&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soderstrom|first=Melanie|last2=Seidl|first2=Amanda|last3=Kemler Nelson|first3=Deborah|last4=Jusczyk|first4=Peter|year=2003|title=The prosodic bootstrapping of phrases: Evidence from prelinguistic infants|url=|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=49|pages=249–267|via=|doi=10.1016/s0749-596x(03)00024-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
# The syntax of language is correlated with acoustic properties.    
# Infants can detect and are sensitive to these acoustic properties.    
# These acoustic properties can be used by infants when processing speech.

== Phonological phrases ==
A phonological phrase boundary indicates how the continuous speech stream is broken up into smaller units, which infants use to pick out and more closely identify individual parts of the sentence.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gout|first=Ariel|last2=Christophe|first2=Anne|last3=Morgan|first3=James L.|orig-year=2004|title=Phonological phrase boundaries constrain lexical data access II.  Infant data|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=51|pages=548–567|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2004.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A phonological phrase can contain between four to seven syllables, and can be detected by infants, due to the fact that the edges of the phrases are either strengthened or lengthened.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Various studies have been done to test if prosody helps with acquisition of syntax, morphology, and phonology.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jusczyk|first=P.

Another acoustic cue that indicates a prosodic boundary is the duration of a pause.  These pauses will usually be longer in duration at the edge of a word boundary, when referring to clause boundaries.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; For example, the two sentences below, while seemingly similar on the surface representation, have different prosodic structure, which correlates to the different syntactic structure ("..." = longer duration of pause in speech):     
# "The boy met the girl at the teach in" → [The boy]&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; ... [met the girl]&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; ... [at the teach in]&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt;     
# "The boy met the girl and the teacher" → [The boy]&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; ... [met the girl and the teacher]&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;     
Using different durations of pause, the underlying syntactic structure can be better distinguished by the listener.

=== Acquiring lexicon ===

For infants who are learning their native language, it is difficult to extract words from speech waves because pronounced words are not separated by silence. There are several proposals for lexical acquisition. The first is that children hear words in isolation: if a new piece goes between two words that are known, the new piece must be a new word. The second proposal is that there are some cues in the speech that give signal to the presence of a word boundary: duration, [[Pitch accent|pitch]], energy.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

The fact that speech is presented in a continuous stream without pause only makes the task of acquiring a language more difficult for infants.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christophe|first=Anne|last2=Dupoux|first2=Emmanuel|year=1996|title=Bootstrapping lexical acquisition: The role of prosodic structure|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=13|pages=383–412|doi=10.1515/tlir.1996.13.3-4.383}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that prosodic features such as the strength of certain sounds, relative to their location in the word, can be used to break apart and identify fragments within the speech stream, in order to differentiate between potentially ambiguous sentences.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mattys|first=Sven L.|last2=Jusczyk|first2=Peter W.|year=2001|title=Do Infants Segment Words or Recurring Contiguous Patterns|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=27|pages=644–655|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.27.3.644}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English for example, the final [d] in the word "bold" tends to be "weak", in that it is not fully released.  On the other hand, an initial [d] in a word such as "dime" is more clearly released, opposed to its word-final counterpart.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This difference in strong v. weak sounds may help to better identify where the sound occurs in the word, whether at the beginning or the end.

Studies have shown that phonological boundaries can be interpreted as word boundaries, which further aids the child in the task of developing a lexicon.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; For example, Millotte et al (2010) tested 16-month olds, observing how children use phonological phrase boundaries to constrain lexical access. When infants heard a prosodic boundary, they were able to detect the existence of a word boundary. In the experiments authors used the conditioned head-turn procedure which showed that when infants were trained to turn their heads for a bisyllabic word, they responded to sentences that contained this word more often than to those that contained both syllables of this word, but separated by a phonological phrase boundary.&lt;ref name=":83"/&gt;

Because prosodic boundaries will never occur inside of a word, thus infants will not be constrained in how they identify words in the speech signal.  For example, children can differentiate between words such as "'''dice'''" and "re'''d ice'''", even though both are [[Phonology|phonologically]] similar.  This is because a prosodic boundary will not appear in the middle of the word *(d][ice) but around the word instead ([dice]).&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Children use phonological phrase boundaries to constrain lexical access. They infer the existence of a word boundary given a prosodic boundary. If two sequences differ in prosody while being made up of identical segments (pay per vs. paper), children treat them as different sequences. Studies that measured cues from prosody to phonological phrases have been done in a variety of languages that differ from each other, providing support that phonological phrases could possibly aid in acquiring lexicon universally.&lt;ref name=":83" /&gt;

=== Acquiring syntax ===

In addition to helping to identify lexical items, a key element of prosodic bootstrapping involves using prosodic cues to identify syntactic knowledge about the language.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christophe|first=Anne|last2=Millotte|first2=Séverine|last3=Bernal|first3=Savita|last4=Lidz|first4=Jeffrey|year=2008|title=Bootstrapping Lexical and Syntactic Acquisition|journal=Language and Speech|volume=51|pages=61–75|doi=10.1177/00238309080510010501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because prosodic phrase boundaries are correlated to syntactic boundaries, listeners can determine the syntactic category of a word, using only prosodic boundary information.  Christophe et al. (2008) demonstrated that adults could use prosodic phrases to determine the syntactic category of ambiguous words.  Listeners were provided two sentences with an ambiguous word [mɔʀ], which could either belong to a verb category ("mord", translated as "it bites") or a noun category ("mort", translated as the adjective "dead").&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"

|Verb
|[le petit chien] ['''mord'''...]
|[the little dog] ['''bites'''...]
|-
|Noun (adjective)
|[le petit chien '''mort'''...]
|[the little '''dead''' dog...]
|}

The table above depicts the two sentences heard by French-speaking adults in Christophe et al. (2008), where the emboldened word is the phonetically ambiguous word, and the brackets represent phonological phrase boundaries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Using the position of the prosodic boundaries, adults were able to determine which category the ambiguous word [mɔʀ] belonged to, since the word is assigned to a different phonological phrase, depending on its syntactic category and semantic meaning in the sentence.

An important tool for acquiring syntax is the use of [[function word]]s (e.g. [[Article (grammar)|articles]], verb morphemes, [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]]) to point out [[Constituent (linguistics)|syntactic constituent]] boundaries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These function words frequently occur in language, and generally appear at the borders of [[prosodic unit]]s.  Because of their high frequency in the input, and the fact that they tend to have only one to two syllables, infants are able to pick out these function words when they occur at the edges of a prosodic unit. In turn, the function words can help learners determine the [[syntactic category]] of the neighboring words (e.g., learning that the word "the" [ðə] introduces a noun phrase, and that suffixes such as "-ed" require a verb to precede it).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  For example, in the sentence "The turtle is eating a pigeon", through the use of function words such as "the" and the [[auxiliary verb]] "is", children can get better sense as to where prosodic boundaries fall, resulting in a division such as [The turtle][is eating][a pigeon], where brackets indicate a boundary.  As a result, infants tend to look out for these words to better identify the beginnings and ends of the prosodic units.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Noun articles like "the" or "a", in English for example, can only be followed by noun, since they are the only words that can fit this category;  one would never hear a sentence such as "The *destroy was widespread".  Likewise, the use of verb morphemes (e.g past tense "-ed" [d]/[t], continuous "-ing" [iŋ], auxiliary "is" [ɪz]) indicate that a verb must precede it, and indicate that no other word can fill the category besides a verb (e.g. *"I saw that he *happyed yesterday").

In a study by Carvalho et al (2016), experimenters tested preschool children, where they showed that by the age of 4 prosody is used in real time to determine what kind of syntactic structure sentences could have. The children in the experiments were able to determine the target word as a noun when it was in a sentence with a prosodic structure typical for a noun and as a verb when it was in a sentence with a prosodic structure typical for a verb. Children by the age of 4 use phrasal prosody to determine the syntactic structure of different sentences.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt;

== Linguistic rhythm ==

=== Stress ===

[[Isochrony|Rhythm]] is an important aspect of prosody in terms of [[Isochrony|syllable timing]] and emphasis, and varies from language to language.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramus|first=Franck|last2=Nespor|first2=Marina|last3=Mehler|first3=Jacques|year=1999|title=Correlates of linguistic rhythm in the speech signal|journal=Cognition|volume=73|pages=265–292|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(99)00058-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Languages are grouped into different categories based on their rhythm, primarily in stress based, rhythm (syllable) based, and [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] based categories.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazuka|first=Reiko|orig-year=2007|title=The Rhythm-based Prosodic Bootstrapping Hypothesis of Early Language Acquisition: Does It Work for Learning for All Languages?|journal=Gengo Kenkyu|volume=132|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants around 6 months of age have shown to be able to differentiate between different languages solely on the basis of these particular stress differences.  More specifically, infants by 2 months of age can from vague categories of different rhythmic structures, those that are native classes, and those that are nonnative.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Before reaching 2 months, infants can distinguish between languages of any class, but by the age of 2 months can only put languages in the native or nonnative class.  For example, English speaking infants will have a hard time differentiating between English and Dutch (since both are stress based languages), but will be able to distinguish Russian (a stress based language) and Japanese (a mora based language).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By 2 months however, an English speaking baby will group syllable-timed and mora-timed languages into one "nonnative" group, and thus will have a hard time differentiating languages such as French (syllable-timed) and Japanese (mora-timed).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This stress variance is also a useful tool for bilingual infants, and acts as a strong indicator when differentiating between different languages being learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosch|first=Laura|last2=Sebastián-Gallés|first2=Núria|year=1997|title=Native-language recognition abilities in 4-month-old infants from monolingual and bilingual environments|journal=Cognition|volume=65|pages=33–69|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(97)00040-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Detecting head direction ===

The question of whether the [[Head-directionality parameter|head direction parameter]] can be detected using prosodic cues has been tested with French babies listening to Turkish sentences,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; in order to determine whether or not 6 to 12 weeks old babies are sensitive to prosodic prominence in speech. Setting the head direction parameter allows infants to acquire a hierarchal branching structure for a particular language, which determines whether the language is left-headed (right-branching) or right-headed (left-branching).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This particular experiment (Christophe et al. 2003) had 6- to 12-week-old babies listening to modified "nonsense" (the modified French and modified Turkish sentences in the table below) sentences that were neither French nor Turkish, but only differed in the fact that the Turkish based sentences were [[Head-directionality parameter|head final]] and French based sentenced were [[Head-directionality parameter|head initial]].  The reasoning behind this is that infants might be able detect  prominence within these phonological phrases, as prominence has been shown to follow a systematic pattern with languages; head-initial languages have prominence on the right (French), while head-final languages have prominence on the left (Turkish).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These nonsense sentences were created in order to eliminate any non-prosodic interference (e.g phonological differences, different number of syllables, etc.) thus babies would only be able to differentiate between the two languages based on the prominence of prosodic cues in the sentences.

As predicted, French babies tended to prefer the modified nonsense French phrases, based solely on prosodic prominence, given by the location of the head direction parameter.

Jusczyk et al (1992) tested 9 month-olds, where they showed that infants are sensitive to acoustic correlates of main phrasal units that are present in the prosody of English sentences. The prosodic markers in the input are longer durations of the syllable that precedes a main phrasal boundary and declinations in fundamental frequency.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;

== Computational modeling ==
Several language models have been used to show that in a computational simulation, prosody can help children acquire syntax.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pate|first=John K.|last2=Goldwater|first2=Sharon|date=2011-01-01|title=Unsupervised Syntactic Chunking with Acoustic Cues: Computational Models for Prosodic Bootstrapping|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2021096.2021099|journal=Proceedings of the 2Nd Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics|series=CMCL '11|location=Stroudsburg, PA, USA|publisher=Association for Computational Linguistics|pages=20–29|isbn=9781932432954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, Gutman et al (2015) build a computational model that used prosodic structure and function words to jointly determine the syntactic categories of words.  The model assigned syntactic labels to prosodic phrases with success, using phrasal prosody to determine the boundaries of phrases, and function words at the edges for classification. The study presented the model of how early syntax acquisition is possible with the help of prosody: children access phrasal prosody and pay attention to words placed at the edges of prosodic boundaries. The idea behind the computational implementation is that prosodic boundaries signal syntactic boundaries and function words that are used to label the prosodic phrases. As an example, a sentence "She's eating a cherry" has a prosodic structure such as [She's eating] [a cherry] where the skeleton of a syntactic structure is [VN NP] (VN is for verbal nucleus where a phrase contains a verb and adjacent words such as auxiliaries and subject pronouns). Here, children may utilize their knowledge of function words and prosodic boundaries in order to create an approximation of syntactic structure.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutman|first=Ariel|last2=Dautriche|first2=Isabelle|last3=Crabbé|first3=Benoît|last4=Christophe|first4=Anne|date=2015-07-03|title=Bootstrapping the Syntactic Bootstrapper: Probabilistic Labeling of Prosodic Phrases|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10489223.2014.971956|journal=Language Acquisition|volume=22|issue=3|pages=285–309|doi=10.1080/10489223.2014.971956|issn=1048-9223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study by Pate et al (2011), where a computational language model was presented, it was shown that acoustic cues can be helpful for determining syntactic structure when they are used with lexical information. Combining acoustic cues with lexical cues may usefully provide children with initial information about the place of syntactic phrases which supports the prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
A key criticism of the bootstrapping theory in general is that these mechanisms (whether they be syntactic, semantic, or prosodic) serve mainly as a starting point for learning the language.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; That is, the bootstrapping mechanisms are only useful up to a certain point in linguistic development for infants, and thus there might be some other mechanism that might be used later on, since the bootstrapping mechanisms primarily use information that is not controlled for "cross-linguistic variation" (information that varies from language to language).&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Regarding prosodic bootstrapping in particular, there is speculation on how accurately prosodic phrases map to syntactic structure.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; That is, phrases with identical syntactic structure can have different possible prosodic structures.  In the sentence "The cat chased the rat that ate the cheese.", the prosodic structure would resemble:

[The cat] [chased the rat] [that ate the cheese]

However, the prosodic unit [chased the rat] in this case is not a syntactic constituent, demonstrating that not every prosodic unit is a syntactic unit.  Rather, one can observe that a language may not always provide [[Injective function|one-to-one mapping]] from prosodic information to linguistic units. Prosody does not give children direct and systematic information from prosodic structure to linguistic structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Jusczyk (1997) argued that most people who accept this theory assume that children are drawing on "a range of information available in the speech signal that extends beyond prosody",&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Language-Communication-Jusczyk-1997-01-10/dp/B01A0BVD18|title=The Discovery of Spoken Language|last=Jusczyk|first=Peter W.|date=1997-01-10|publisher=A Bradford Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; further explaining that relying on prosodic information alone is not enough to learn the structure of the language.

'''''Šatrovački''''' ({{IPA-sh|ʃatr̩oʋatʃki}}; [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: шатровачки) or '''''šatra''''' ({{IPA-sh|ʃatr̩a}}; [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]:  шатра) is an argot in the [[Serbo-Croatian]] language. Šatrovački was initially developed by various [[subculture]]s in [[Yugoslavia]] and used a form of secret communication within various [[ingroup]]s. Today, it is primarily used among youth as a form of [[pig latin]]. It is more widespread in urban areas, such as capitals [[Belgrade]] (Serbia), [[Zagreb]] (Croatia) and [[Sarajevo]] (Bosnia and Herzegovina).

==Standard šatrovački==
Words are formed by replacing the syllable order. For example: '''''pi'''vo'' (beer), becomes ''vo'''pi'''''. The new word has the same meaning as the stem. Since the spelling is nearly phonetic it does not change. However, sometimes one of the vowels is changed to make the new word easier to pronounce, avoid ambiguity, or if the stem word is not in [[nominative]]. For example, ''tra'''va''''' ("grass", marijuana) would become ''vutra'' instead of ''vatra'' ("fire").

Some words are more commonly spoken in Šatrovački than others, but there is no specific rule. Examples of  transformed sentences (although, most of the words in a single sentence are rarely transformed) are:

*''Brate, neću da igram fudbal. — Tebra, ćune da ramig dbalfu.'' ("Bro, I don't want to play football.")
*''Zemun zakon brate. — Munze konza tebra.''  (literally: "[[Zemun]] is the law, bro" - meaning: "Zemun rules dude")
*''Pazi brate, murija! — Zipa tebra, rijamu!'' ("Watch out mate - cops!", ''murija'' slang for police)

==Utrovački==

'''Utrovački''' (Утровачки) is a more complex form of ''šatrovački''. Words are formed using: U + last part + ZA + first part + NJE. E.g. '''vikipedija''' (Wikipedia) becomes u'''kipedija'''za'''vi'''nje. Today, utrovački is not widely used.

Alternative Utrovački is same as above, but without "ZA", e.g. '''pivo''' (beer) becomes u'''vopi'''nje, or '''cigare''' (tobacco) becomes u'''gareci'''nje.

==Syllable omission==

A more simplified version of šatrovački is using only parts of the word, while excluding the first syllable, and is most commonly used among young people in Serbia. For example, kon'''cert''' (concert) would be shorthened to '''cert'''. The rules of creating a new word that can be used in [[nominative]] while the stem is not apply similarly to standard šatrovački. An example of a full sentence would be:

:: ''Drugar i ja idemo na koncert na Tvrđavi.'' (My friend and I are going to a concert on the Fortress)
:: ''Gari i ja idemo na cert na Đavi.''

This is particularly characteristic of [[Novi Sad]] youth subculture, and is very rarely spoken outside of [[Vojvodina]].

===Common examples===
* '''zika''' - muzika (music)
* '''cert''' - koncert (concert)
* '''Đava''' - tvrđava (fortress, almost exclusively refers to [[Petrovaradin fortress]] in Novi Sad)
* '''gari''' - drugar (friend)
* '''fika''' - trafika (news stand)
* '''kić''' - sokić (diminutive of juice)
* '''nica''' - stanica (station)
* '''šulja''' - košulja (shirt)
* '''lone''' - pantalone (trousers)
* '''tike''' - patike (sneakers)
* '''njačić''' - vinjačić ([[Diminutive]] for [[Vinjak]], an alcoholic drink similar to [[Cognac (drink)|Cognac]])
* '''tija''' - kutija (box)
* '''ljara''' - pepeljara (ashtray)
* '''ljada''' - hiljada (thousand)
* '''bica''' - torbica (small bag)
* '''čka''' - pička (cunt)
* '''pač''' - štampač (printer)
* '''činka''' - palačinka (crêpe, pancake)
* '''ler''' - drug dealer (usually of [[marijuana]])
* '''ket''' - paket (package or anything packed or wrapped)
* '''ćoza''' - kaprićoza (usually refers to [[Pizza capricciosa]], but can be used for any kind of pizza)

==Adding syllables==

A very rare but present form of expression found in the Belgrade projects (blokovi). Words are reconstructed by adding various suffixes so that the original word remains relatively intact. Usually, the basis is šatrovački. The resulting words have a generally diminutive meaning.

===Examples===

* '''kajblo or kićblo''' - blok (Blok of suburb [[Blokovi]] or [[New Belgrade]])
* '''kićso or kajso''' - sok (juice)
* '''pajdo''' - dop (heroin)

These diminutives can later be combined using the '''Šatrovački''' method, resulting in words like ''kajblo'', or ''kićblo''. However, this is a rare usage, confined to the area of [[Zemun]] and [[New Belgrade]].

Also there is another type of šatrovački, where the words are reconstructed by addition of letter P after each syllable:

===Examples===

* '''di'''pi'''ze'''pe'''l''' - dizel (chav)
* '''ba'''pa'''ci'''pi - baci (throw)
* '''ne'''pe'''mo'''po'''j''' - nemoj (don't)
* '''ma'''pa'''lo'''po - malo (some)
* '''bra'''pa'''te'''pe - brate (brother)
* '''ci'''pi'''ga'''pa'''n''' - cigan (gypsy)
* '''pe'''pe'''de'''pe'''r''' - peder (homosexual)
* '''se'''pe'''lja'''pa'''k''' - seljak (peasant)
* '''pa'''pa'''zi'''pi - pazi (pay attention)
* '''kre'''pe'''te'''pe'''n''' - kreten (idiot)
