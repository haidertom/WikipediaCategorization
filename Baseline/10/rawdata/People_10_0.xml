== Early life ==
Boyd grew up in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] and [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name=age/&gt; and attended [[Manheim Township High School]] from 1992–1996. According to her website, she was born Danah Michele Mattas.&lt;ref name="db_hompage_name"/&gt; Once she reached college, she chose to take her maternal grandfather's name, Boyd, as her own last name. She decided to spell her name in lowercase so as "to reflect my mother's original balancing and to satisfy my own political irritation at the importance of capitalization."&lt;ref name=age/&gt;&lt;ref name="db_hompage_name"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
After her parents' divorce, in 1982, she moved to [[York County, Pennsylvania|York]], [[Pennsylvania]], with her mother and her brother. Her mother married again during danah's third grade and the family moved to [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]. She used online discussions forums to escape from high school. She called Lancaster a "religious and conservative" city. Having had online discussions on the topic, she decided to start identifying as [[queer]].&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/festival/article/2014/08/20/danah-boyd-anthropologue-de-la-generation-numerique_4473731_4415198.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, her brother taught her how to use [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] and [[Usenet]]. Even though she thought computers were "lame" at the time, the possibilities for connecting with others intrigued her. She became an avid participant on Usenet and IRC in her junior year in high school, spending a lot of time browsing, creating content, and conversing with strangers.&lt;ref name="danah.org"&gt;http://www.danah.org/aboutme.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Though active in many extra-curricular activities and excelling academically, boyd had a difficult time socially in high school. She assigns "her survival to her mother, the Internet, and a classmate whose misogynistic comments inspired her to excel."&lt;ref name="danah.org"/&gt;

Her initial ambition was to become an astronaut but after an injury, she became more interested in the Internet.&lt;ref name=age&gt;{{cite news|title=A space of her own – Encounter with Danah Boyd|work=The Age |location=Australia|date=August 4, 2007|author=Debelle, Penelope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education ==
[[File:Danah Boyd.jpg|thumb|danah boyd in 2005, a speaker at Digital Identity conference in Chicago.]]
Boyd initially studied [[computer science]] at [[Brown University]], where she worked with [[Andries van Dam]] and wrote an undergraduate thesis about how "3-D computer systems used cues that were inherently sexist."&lt;ref name=age/&gt;  She pursued her master's degree in sociable media with [[Judith Donath]] at the [[MIT Media Lab]]. She worked for the New York-based activist organization [[V-Day (movement)|V-Day]], first as a volunteer (starting in 2004) and then as paid staff (2007–2009). She eventually moved to San Francisco, where she met the individuals involved in creating the new [[Friendster]] service. She documented what she was observing via her blog, and this grew into a career.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | work=The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/technology/circuits/27frie.html | title=Decoding the New Cues in Online Society | last=Erard | first=Michael | date=November 27, 2003 | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604185643/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/technology/circuits/27frie.html | archivedate=June 4, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, boyd earned a [[Ph.D.]] at the [[UC Berkeley School of Information]],&lt;ref name="boydphd"&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=danah|last=boyd |title=Taken out of context: American teen sociality in networked publics|publisher=University of California, Berkeley |date=2008 |url=http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/search~S1?/e308t+2008+1093|authorlink=Danah boyd}}&lt;/ref&gt; advised by [[Peter Lyman]] (1940–2007) and [[Mizuko Ito]] (aka [[Mimi Ito]]). Her [[dissertation]], ''Taken Out of Context: American Teen Sociality in Networked Publics'', focused on the use of large social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace by U.S. teenagers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/index.php?content=20091022 |title=Voices on Antisemtisim interview with danah boyd |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |date=2009-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505174453/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/index.php?content=20091022 |archivedate=May 5, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was blogged on [[Boing Boing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2009/01/18/taken_out_of_co.html |title=Taken Out of Context – my PhD dissertation |work=zephoria.org |date=January 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://boingboing.net/2009/01/19/danah-boyds-phd-thes.html | title=danah boyd's PhD thesis: Teen sociality online | last=Doctorow | first=Cory | publisher=[[Boing Boing]] | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | date=January 19, 2009 | authorlink=Cory Doctorow }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2006–07 academic year, boyd was a fellow at the [[Annenberg Center for Communication]] at the [[University of Southern California]]. She was a long-time fellow at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at Harvard University, where she co-directed the Internet Safety Technical Task Force,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/isttf/members | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | title=Members of the Internet Safety Technical Task Force | publisher=[[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then served on the Youth and Media Policy Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/digitalnatives/policy|title=Youth and Media Policy Working Group Initiative|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Danah Boyd (12776738645).jpg|thumb|Visualisation from one of boyd's lectures by Willow Brugh]]
While in graduate school, she was involved with a three-year ethnographic project funded by the MacArthur Foundation and led by [[Mimi Ito]]; the project examined youths' use of technologies through interviews, focus groups, observations, and document analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitallearning.macfound.org/site/c.enJLKQNlFiG/b.4773555/k.27DE/Mizuko_Ito.htm |title=MacArthur Foundation Project Summary |accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalyouth.ischool.berkeley.edu/report |title=Final Report |work=The Digital Youth Project |accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her publications included an article in the ''MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Learning, Identity Volume'' called "Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life."&lt;ref name=SocialNetwork&gt;{{cite journal |last=boyd |first=danah |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Buckingham |editor1-link= |title=Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life |journal=Youth, Identity, and Digital Media |series=The John D. and Catherine T.

The project culminated with a co-authored book "Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out: Kids Living and Learning with New Media."&lt;ref name="HangingOut"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ito |first=Mimi |title=Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out: Kids Living and Learning with New Media |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |date=September 2009 |isbn=0-262-01336-3|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She published untraditional research on youth using Facebook and MySpace in 2007. She demonstrated that most young users of Facebook were white and middle-to-upper class, while MySpace users tended to be lower-class black teenagers. Her work is often translated and relayed to major media.&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr" /&gt; In addition to blogging on her own site, she addresses issues of youth and technology use on the [http://dmlcentral.net DMLcentral] blog. boyd has written academic papers and [[op-ed]] pieces on online culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |authorlink=Clay Shirky |title=[[Here Comes Everybody]] |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |date=February 28, 2008 |pages=224–5 |isbn=978-1-59420-153-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her career as a fellow at [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society|Harvard's Berkman Center]] started in 2007. In January 2009, boyd joined [[Microsoft Research]] New England, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], as a Social Media Researcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10047795-36.html|title=Microsoft hires social-net scholar Danah Boyd|author=McCarthy, Caroline|date=September 22, 2008|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, boyd founded [https://datasociety.net/ Data &amp; Society Research Institute] to address the social, technical, ethical, legal and policy issues that are emerging from data-centric technological development.

She was interviewed in the 2015 web documentary about internet privacy, ''[[Do Not Track (documentary)|Do Not Track]]''.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/14/brett-gaylor-do-not-track-interactive-documentary-privacy|title=Do not Track: an online, interactive documentary about who’s watching you|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=14 April 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, boyd is president of [[Data &amp; Society]],&lt;ref&gt;https://datasociety.net&lt;/ref&gt; a Principal Researcher at [[Microsoft Research]] and a Visiting Professor at [[New York University]].

Between July 5 and July 7, 2017, four young men were reported missing in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]].  All were subsequently found murdered.  The victims were Dean A. Finocchiaro, age 19; Thomas C. Meo, age 21; Jimi T. Patrick, age 19; and Mark R. Sturgis, age 22.

The murders are suspected to have been carried out by cousins Cosmo DiNardo and Sean Michael Kratz, both age 20 at the times of the murder.&lt;ref name=CNNCousins&gt;{{cite web |last=Levenson|first=Eric |title=Cousins charged in homicides of four Pennsylvania men|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/14/us/missing-pennsylvania-men-charges/index.html |website=[[CNN]] |date=14 July 2017 |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four victims were murdered, in three separate incidents, after DiNardo arranged to sell them [[marijuana]].&lt;ref name=NBCDiNardoKratzKill&gt;{{cite web |last=McCrone|first=Brian |title=Cosmo DiNardo, Sean Kratz Charged With Allegedly Killing Young Men at Bucks County Farm|url=http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Second-Man-Sean-Michael-Kratz-Held-in-Connection-to-Four-Murders-at-Bucks-County-Pennsylvania-Farm-Day-After-Cosmo-DiNardo-Confesses-434503403.html |website=[[NBC]] Philadelphia |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNCousins/&gt;

The disappearances began on July 5, with Patrick being the first of the men to vanish. Two days later, on July 7, Meo, Finocchiaro, and Sturgis were also reported missing. Each of the four men was reported to be murdered the same day he went missing.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bucks.crimewatchpa.com/da/29567/post/two-men-charged-homicide-four-solebury-slayings|title=Two Men Charged With Homicide in Four Solebury Slayings|date=14 July 2017|publisher=Bucks County District Attorney's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He failed to show up for work the next day.&lt;ref name=NYTSearch&gt;{{cite web |last=Haag|first=Matthew |title=Search in Pennsylvania for 4 Missing Men Focuses on a Vast Farm |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/missing-men-bucks-county.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=U.S.&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article |website=New York Times |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=10 July 2017 |accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick met DiNardo that night to buy four pounds of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch /&gt;

His remains were found in a common grave on a [[Solebury Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Solebury Township]] farm (owned by DiNardo's parents), along with the remains of Mark Sturgis and Thomas Meo on July 12, 2017. Finocchiaro's body was the first to be identified.&lt;ref name=PhillyWho&gt;{{cite web |last=Babay|first=Emily |title=Bucks County missing men: Who they are |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/pennsylvania/bucks-4-missing-men-mark-sturgis-jimi-patrick-dean-finocchiaro-thomas-meo-20170713.html |website=Philly |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finocchiaro and DiNardo had a good relationship, with DiNardo saying that they were like cousins.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch/&gt; As with Patrick, Finocchiaro had agreed to buy marijuana from DiNardo. This was the first murder in which Kratz was involved; the two men repeatedly shot Finocchiaro. His body was placed in a metal oil tank that had been converted to a pork roaster.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch/&gt;
* Mark R. Sturgis (November 20, 1994 {{ndash}} July 7, 2017) went to meet his friend Thomas C. Meo (January 30, 1996 {{ndash}} July 7, 2017) at around 6:00 PM on July 7. Both men worked for Sturgis' father's construction company. The two did not show up for work and calls to their cellphones went directly to voice mail.&lt;ref name=NYTSearch/&gt; DiNardo met with Sturgis and Meo at a church to sell Meo marijuana.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch/&gt; Meo and Sturgis were both shot as they exited their truck.  When he ran out of ammunition, DiNardo drove over a still-alive Meo with a [[backhoe]], then placed both bodies in a metal tank that also held Finocchiaro's body. DiNardo attempted unsuccessfully to burn the bodies using gasoline.&lt;ref name="CNNCousins" /&gt; He used the backhoe to bury the tank containing the three bodies.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch/&gt;

DiNardo, a drug dealer, confessed to killing the four men; he said he did so because he felt cheated or threatened during drug transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://articles.mlive.com/news/us-world/index.ssf/2017/07/suspect_in_pennsylvania_slayin.amp |title=Suspect in Pennsylvania slaying of 4 men burned bodies in a drum after drug deals, source said|first=Tanda |last=Gmiter|date=14 July 2017|work=MLive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only motive disclosed by investigators was that DiNardo said he wanted to set the victims up when they came to the farm to buy marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20170714/NEWS/170719777 |title=Grisly details revealed after 2 men charged in killing of missing men in Bucks|first1=Maryclaire|

Second cousins&lt;ref name=CNNCousins/&gt; Cosmo DiNardo (born January 21, 1997) and Sean Michael Kratz (born February 14, 1997), both age 20, were charged in the murders.

On July 10, DiNardo was arrested for an unrelated weapons charge.&lt;ref name=NYTSearch/&gt; He was not allowed to own a firearm due to his [[schizophrenia]]; nevertheless, at least one of the firearms used by the perpetrators belonged to DiNardo's mother.&lt;ref name=BucksCrimeWatch/&gt;&lt;ref name=NBCDiNardoKratzCharged&gt;{{cite web |last=McCausland|first=Phil |title=Cosmo Dinardo, Sean Michael Kratz Charged With Killing Four in Pennsylvania |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cosmo-dinardo-second-man-charged-killing-four-pennsylvania-n783086 |website=[[NBC News]] |date=14 July 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite 30 run-ins with local police, DiNardo, the son of a wealthy businessman, had, for unexplained reasons, never been convicted of a crime.&lt;ref name=NYTManAdmits&gt;{{cite web |last=Hurdle| first=Jon |title=Man Admits to Killings of 4 Missing Men in Pennsylvania, Lawyer Says |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/us/bucks-county-missing-pennsylvania.html |website=[[New York Times]] |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiNardo was later released after his father posted 10% of the $1 million bail.&lt;ref name=CNNCousins/&gt;

On July 12, DiNardo was arrested and charged for stealing and attempting to sell a car that belonged to Thomas Meo for $500.&lt;ref name=BCCTCosmoConfessed&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Malley|first=James |title=BREAKING: Cosmo DiNardo defense attorney says client confessed to 'participation in murders of four young men'|url=http://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/news/crime/breaking-cosmo-dinardo-defense-attorney-says-client-confessed-to-participation/article_1d6dcb02-67d9-11e7-908b-1bc4ab8b99aa.html |website=Bucks County Courier Times |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicion was also raised by the fact that Meo left his [[insulin]] in the car, something his family said was unusual for him to do.&lt;ref name=BCCTCosmoConfessed/&gt; His bail was set at $5 million. The next day, DiNardo confessed to the murder of the four men. In exchange for his confession, prosecutors stated that they would not seek the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref name=CNNCousins/&gt;

The day after his confession, DiNardo was charged with four counts of criminal homicide, conspiracy to commit criminal homicide, abuse of corpse, and 12 other charges.

On July 14, Sean Michael Kratz was also charged with three counts of criminal homicide, conspiracy to commit criminal homicide, abuse of corpse, and two other charges.&lt;ref name=NBCDiNardoKratzCharged/&gt; Unlike DiNardo, Kratz had a criminal history of [[burglary]], conspiracy, criminal trespassing, theft, receiving stolen property, and criminal mischief.&lt;ref name=CNNCousins/&gt;

A [[polyglotism|polyglot]] is a person with a command of many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=polyglot &amp;#124; Collins Dictionary|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/polyglot|website=Collins Dictionary|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A polyglot may also be called a [[multilingualism|multilingual person]]; the label "multilingual" is used for communities as well as individual speakers.

[[Richard Hudson (linguist)|Richard Hudson]], professor emeritus of [[linguistics]] at [[University College London]], coined the term "hyperpolyglot" for "people 
who know dozens of languages well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson |first=Richard |year=2008 |chapter=Word grammar, cognitive linguistics, and second language learning and teaching |title=Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics and Second Language Acquisition |editor=P. Robinson and N. Ellis |pages=89–113 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Polyglot of Bologna |url=http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/06/26/the-polyglot-of-bologna/ |last=Erard |first=Michael |date=June 2012 |publisher=Public Domain Review |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars apply the label to speakers of even more languages: twelve, sixteen, or in the most extreme cases, even fifty or more.&lt;ref name="Poly"&gt;{{cite web|last=Erard |first=Michael |title=How many languages is it possible for a person to speak? |url=http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/11/how_many_langua_1.html |publisher=The Five Minute Linguist |accessdate=11 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413031021/http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/11/how_many_langua_1.html |archivedate=13 April 2010 |date=3 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to judge which individuals are polyglots, as there is no uncontroversial definition for what it means to "master" a language, and because it is not always clear where to distinguish a [[dialect]] from a [[language]].  Being able to communicate in a language does not mean the person has "mastered" a language.  There are far fewer who have attained higher levels of multi-linguistic skill, and there is no basis for testing those levels, or at least those levels of ability have not been noted here.

This list consists of people who have been noted in news media, historical texts, or academic work as speaking five or more languages fluently. For general discussion of the phenomenon, including discussion of polyglot [[savant syndrome|savants]], see [[polyglotism]].

Tim Doner (US) and Richard Simcott (UK) also appear in the programme to describe their experiences speaking multiple languages.

'''Name change''' generally refers to the legal act by a person of adopting a new name different from their name at birth, marriage or adoption.

The procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, [[common law]] jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions are more restrictive.

A [[pseudonym]] is a name that differs from the original or true name and does not require legal sanction. It is generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but can also be done for personal, social or ideological reasons.

==Reasons for changing one's name==
* Marriage or civil partnership. 
* To avoid a [[stalker]] or [[harassment|harassing]] person.
* To choose a surname associated with a hobby, interest, or accomplishment (e.g., old name Henry Schifberg, new name [[Henry Lizardlover]])
* To receive an inheritance conditional on adopting the name of the deceased (this reason was once quite common in landowning families in the UK)
* To replace a frivolous name given by their parents (e.g., old name Mikey Maus, new name Marcus Maus)
* To replace a name which might be considered undesirable with a more desirable one (e.g. old surname Lipschitz, new surname London)
* To dissociate oneself from a former religion (e.g., Ahmed Abdullah to Adel Karim) 
* To dissociate themselves from a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name [[Michael Jackson]] new name Martin Jackson)
* To identify with a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name Simon Johnson, new name Simon [[King Arthur|Pendragon]])
* To dissociate themselves from a family [[Black sheep (term)|black sheep]] (e.g., relatives of [[Adolf Hitler]]).
* To dissociate themselves from an ethnic origin (e.g. changing [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] to [[Mountbatten]] or Jan Ludvik Hoch to [[Robert Maxwell]]).
* To revert to a former name (e.g., [[Cynthia Lennon]], first wife of [[John Lennon]], after her divorce from later husband John Twist).
* Commercial sponsorship (e.g., [[Jimmy White]] temporarily became Jimmy Brown for [[HP Sauce|HP brown sauce]],&lt;ref name="BBCBrown1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/4245973.stm "Jimmy Gets Saucy with Name Change"], no by-line, ''BBC News'' (online edition), "Sport: Fun and Games" section, 8 February 2005; accessed 14 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ashley Revell]] became Ashley blue square Revell for [[The Rank Group]]'s Blue Square service)
* Protest or activism (e.g., old name Jennifer Taylor, new name Jennifer [[Environmentalism|Save the Forests]])
* To change to a fictional character's name, (e.g. old name Tracy Darling, new name [[Tracy Beaker]])
* To make their name more attractive or "catchy" so as to increase their chance of success (see [[Stage name]])
* To change legal name to one used in everyday life, (e.g. where middle name has been used throughout life)
* To better fit one's [[gender identity]] as a [[transgender]] person (e.g., old name Bruce Jenner, new name [[Caitlyn Jenner]])

==United States==
In the United States, [[State law (United States)|state law]]s regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes (changing the name at will), including ''[[Lindon v. First National Bank]]''.

Usually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Julia Shear|last=Kushner|url=https://uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-1-7.pdf|title=The Right to Control One's Name|work=[[UCLA Law Review]]|issue=313|year=2009|pages=324–9}} The states which require a statutory name-change procedure are Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, and Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the states (except Louisiana) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a [[court order]] is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a [[State court (United States)|state court]]), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change. It is necessary to [[pleading|plead]] that the name change is not for a [[fraud]]ulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a [[lien]] or [[debt]] or for [[defamation|defaming]] someone else.

Applicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited [[judicial discretion]] to grant or deny a change of name, usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or [[Morality|immoral]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Bander, ''Change of Name and Law of Names'' (Dobbs Ferry, New York: Oceana Publications, 1973) Ch. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, a [[Missouri]] man succeeded in changing his name to They.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2004-09-23-name-change_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Missouri man legally changes his name to 'They'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (''Application of Dengler'', 1979); the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] had denied the same request several years before (''Petition of Dengler'', 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/opinions/9205.htm|title=Petition of Dengler, 246 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1976)|work=state.nd.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a [[racial slur]], a threat, or an [[obscene|obscenity]].

Some examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:
* Adopting a new surname upon marriage (typically the surname of the spouse, a [[hyphenated name|hyphenated surname]], or some combination of parts of both surnames).
* Returning to the use of a prior surname (e.g., a [[maiden name]]) upon divorce.
* Simplification or improved familiarity of spelling or pronunciation.

Under the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for [[naturalization]], they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more [[Cultural assimilation#Immigrant name changing as a form of assimilation|Americanized]] names.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/n-400.pdf N-400 Application for Naturalization]", (US Citizenship and Immigration Services, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of [[Police|law enforcement]]. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] naturalizes an applicant.

To maintain a person's [[identity (social science)|identity]], it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.

===Informal methods of legal name change===

====Assumed name====
The "open and notorious" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an [[assumed name]]. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under [[pseudonym]]s; such a right is protected under [[case law]] pursuant to [[United States Constitution]].

====Usage method====
A common law name (i.e. one assumed for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', ''State v. Ford'', 172 P. 802; ''Bonnie Lee Daniels'', 337 A.2d 49; ''Elizabeth Marie Hauptly'' 312 N.E.2d 857; ''Piotrowski v. Piotrowski'', 247 N.W.2d 354; ''Thomas v. Thomas'', 427 N.E.2d 1009; ''Klein v. Klein'', 373 A.2d 86; ''Stuart v. Board of Elections'', 295 A.2d 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method,&lt;ref&gt;''In Matter of Linda A.'', 480 N.Y.S.2d 996.&lt;/ref&gt; unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoffman v. Bank of America'', (M.D. Florida 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California]] the "usage method" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name.  Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Kreuter v US'', 201 F2d 33 (true name need not be abandoned), Florida Statute 322.22 (driver's licenses in two names), ''Loser v. Plainfield'', 128 N.W. 1101 (Iowa), ''Ludwinska v John Hancock'', 317 Pa 577 (may be used for just one nonfraudulent transaction).&lt;/ref&gt; Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.

Specifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 and Family Code § 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 (a) reads, "Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name." Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code § 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)

====Preferred name====
Many universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a "preferred name" instead of one's legal name.  This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and student [[ID card]]s.  It provides a "transitional"
name change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.&lt;ref name="UC Davis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preferred Name {{!}} Office of the University Registrar|url=https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/preferred-name.cfm|website=registrar.ucdavis.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leicester"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a preferred first name or preferred last name? — University of Leicester|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/hr/policies/ess/Questions/what-is-a-preferred-first-name-or-preferred-last-name|website=www2.le.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official registration===
A legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the [[Social Security Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/|title=How do I change or correct my name on my Social Security number card?|work=ssa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/npic/agencies/agencies_913.html|title=U.S. Passports &amp; International Travel|work=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for passports), the [[Federal Communications Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|title=FCC Form 605|author=FCC Internet Services Staff|work=fcc.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422032207/http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|archivedate=2014-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Selective Service System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|title=Selective Service System: Registrant Obligations|website=www.sss.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329020540/http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|archivedate=2015-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.

Although state requirements differ, it is generally recommended to first register a new name with the Social Security office as some state motor-vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes; [[Arizona]] is one of these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mvd/faqs/scripts/faqs.asp?section=dl#1|title=Motor Vehicle Services|work=azdot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time. For example, [[South Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information#NameorAddressChanges {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228092155/http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information |date=2012-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wyoming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919202553/http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna|date=September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; require a name change be registered with their office within ten days.

The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.

Many states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (''e.g.'', intellectual property rights) of others.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., [http://abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name www.abcfamilylaw.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128015829/http://www.abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name |date=2010-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.

In theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their [[passport]], [[driving licence]], tax and [[National Insurance]] records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that "documentary evidence" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage certificate|marriage]] and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are "matters of fact", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.

Documentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, [[decree absolute]], civil partnership certificate, [[statutory declaration]] or [[deed of change of name]]. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc ''Enrolling a Name Change in the Royal Courts of Justice''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002143613/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc |date=2008-10-02 }} (March 2008).

===England and Wales===
People whose births are registered in England and Wales may have their deed poll enrolled at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; See also [[College of Arms#Change of names]].

====Historical usage====
{{See also|Double-barrelled name#British tradition}}
From the mediaeval age to the 19th century, the era of family dynasties, name changes were frequently demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, of members of the gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by [[marriage settlement]]s, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's [[dowry]] her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private [[Act of Parliament]] or by obtaining a Royal Licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research#royal-licences|title=Researching a past change of name – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname ''in addition to'' his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the "[[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]]", even the "triple-barrelled" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy "[[squirearchy]]" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.

Well known examples are:
*Russell to Gorges (14th century). Ralph IV Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges, died without issue in 1331. In an effort to preserve his family name and arms he made one of his younger nephews his heir, on condition that he should adopt the name and arms of Gorges. This nephew was William Russell, the second son of his second sister Eleanor de Gorges who had married Sir Theobald Russell (d.1341) of [[Kingston Russell]], Dorset. The event is referred to in one of the earliest heraldic law cases brought concerning English armory, [[Warbelton v. Gorges]] in 1347.
*Smithson to Percy (18th century). [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet]] (1715–1786) (c.1714–1786) in 1740 married [[Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland|Lady Elizabeth Seymour]], daughter and sole heiress of [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset]], and granddaughter of Lady Elizabeth Percy (d.1722), daughter and sole heiress of [[Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland]] (1644–1670). In 1740, by a private Act of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research/private-acts-parliament/1749-23-Geo-2-14|title=Hugh Earl of Northumberland's name and arms. – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson changed his surname to Percy and inherited the title [[Earl of Northumberland]] and was later created [[Duke of Northumberland]].

===Scotland===
People whose births are [[civil registration|registered]] in Scotland (or who were adopted in Scotland) can change their name in the same way as people from the rest of the United Kingdom.  However they can optionally apply to the [[Registrar General for Scotland]] to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated.

==Other common law countries==

=== Australia ===
Individuals may legally change their name through the [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled "Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/family-and-community/births-deaths-and-marriages-registries|title=Births, deaths and marriages registries – australia.gov.au|first=Digital Transformation|last=Agency|website=www.australia.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/change-of-name/change-of-name.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/changing-your-name/changing-your-name/|title=Changing your name – Your rights, crime and the law|first=; c=AU; o=The State of Queensland; ou=Communication Services|last=Branch|website=www.qld.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions such as banks,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/cip_form_ind_mar08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Passports Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.passports.gov.au/passportsexplained/theapplicationprocess/eligibilityoverview/Pages/confirmingidentity.aspx|title=Documents that confirm your Australian citizenship and identity|first=Australian Passports|last=Office|website=www.passports.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transport authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/change-my-name.asp|title=Change my name|first=|last=nw|website=www.transport.wa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; require proof of identity, so people who change their names need to have proof of the change.

If a person's birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person's birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued [[Birth certificate#Australia|birth certificate]] if born in Australia and/or "Change of Name Certificate".  These certificates are recognised secure [[Identity documents of Australia|identity documents]] and can be verified electronically through the [[Attorney-general of Australia]]'s Document Verification Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|title=Document Verification Service|first=Attorney-General's|last=Department|website=www.ag.gov.au|access-date=2017-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321081501/https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada a person can informally call themselves whatever they want. In all provinces except [[Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm#names {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123172016/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when someone gets married they can change their last name without legally changing their name by using their [[Marriage Certificate]] as verification of the name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programs.alberta.ca/Living/5962.aspx?Ns=364+6228&amp;N=770|title=Government of Alberta – Programs and Services – Getting Married|author=Government of Alberta|work=alberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost impossible for married women in Québec to take their husbands' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|title=Quebec newlywed furious she can't take her husband's name|work=Canada.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102072805/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like the United States, the requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. Except for [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]] and [[New Brunswick]], [[Canadians]] must be 18 to change their names and have lived in the province they are changing it in for at least 3 months to a year, depending on province. (In [[British Columbia]], Canadians must be 19 to change their names, in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]] 16.) People younger than the province's [[age of majority]] can change their names if they have their guardians' consent, are legally married, or have a [[common law marriage]].&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220124142/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html|date=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To change a name, a Name Change application must be submitted to either the Ministry of Government Services, Court of justice or Registrar of civil status. A document such as a birth certificate must be submitted. A statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious. In Canada, a name cannot cause confusion, be used for misrepresentation or fraud and in most cases the name change is announced in newspapers. There is a fee involved and it ranges from $10 to $185 depending on the territory or province.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]] need [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprints]] to be submitted before one changes their name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023224732/http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx|date=October 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crcvc.ca/docs/How%20do%20I%20change%20my%20name.pdf|title=How do I change my name?|format=PDF|work=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
It is a common practice for ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong to adopt a western-style English name in addition to their transliterated Chinese name. As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their [[Legal name|legal English name]] is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.

However, the [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]] which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll. Only one application of this kind is allowed for each applicant; any application for subsequent change(s) must be made with a deed poll.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a person earns their name by "use and repute". For most purposes it is enough to simply use the desired name and ask others to call you by that name. For some administrative purposes, such as changing a name on a driving licence or [[Legal aspects of transgenderism#Republic of Ireland|legally changing gender]], a [[deed of change of name]] must be registered with the [[Four Courts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html|title=Changing your name by deed poll|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/changing_to_your_preferred_gender.html|title=Changing to your preferred gender|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
From September 1995, [[New Zealanders]] can change their name by making a [[statutory declaration]] and, if approved, the new name is registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriages section of the Department of Internal Affairs (Identity Services). Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by [[deed poll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/Files/EOIStandard/$file/EOIStandard.pdf Evidence of Identity Standard] NZ Department of Internal Affairs, June 2006, Version 1.0, {{ISBN|0-478-24462-2}}, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
In general, unlike in [[common law]] countries, names cannot be changed at will in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of [[personal identification numbers]], that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Belgium===
In Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: ''Arrêté royal'', Dutch: ''Koninklijk besluit'') for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:
* A person of non-European origin who wants to adopt a less exotic name to further his/her integration in Belgian society
* A person stuck with a ridiculous last name that is causing him/her great embarrassment or emotional distress. Actual examples: Salami, Naaktgeboren ("born naked"), and Clooten ("sods of earth" in Middle Dutch, but "testicles" in modern Dutch)
* (for minor children) following legal adoption or recognition of paternity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514153237/http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html|date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
According to the Brazilian Civil Code and the Public Registries Act, the name registered after birth is definitive and immutable. However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: 
* If an obvious writing error is made while registering the name of the child.  
* In the first year after a person reaches the [[age of majority]] (18&amp;nbsp;years), they can request a change in their first names, but modification of surnames is not allowed.  
* If a person's name exposes them to ridicule and harms their everyday well-being.  
* If a person is recognized publicly by another name, they can request a name change or addition, by providing as support three testimonials of the change in name.  
* If a person has undergone a sex change, recent jurisprudence has allowed name modifications in most such cases.

===India===
In India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.&lt;ref&gt;http://goaprintingpress.gov.in/uploads/Change%20of%20Name%20and%20Surname%20Act.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Although it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.

===Philippines===
2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]], which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order. Administrative Order No. 1 Series of 2001, implemented the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621060551/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change the first name or nickname in the civil register without need of a judicial order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212183553/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archivedate=February 12, 2012|website=census.gov.ph|title= Civil Registration – Primer for RA 9048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9048.htm|title=PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES – CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Name and gender change====
In case of controversial and substantial changes, [[Philippines]] [[jurisprudence]] requires full-blown court [[lawsuit]], that must include the local civil registrar in the petition, since RA 9048 and Rule 108 (Cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court do not allow the change of sex in a birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/rulesofcourtspecialproceedings.htm#RULE%20108|title=SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only landmark case in the Philippines on name and legal sex change is the Jeff Cagandahan case. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] Justice [[Leonardo Quisumbing]] on September 12, 2008, allowed Cagandahan, 27, who has [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], to change his [[birth certificate]] name from Jennifer to Jeff, and his legal gender from female to male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808193038/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archivedate=August 8, 2014|title=Call him Jeff, says SC; he used to be called Jennifer|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216041937/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archivedate=February 16, 2009|title=Woman's body 'naturally' became male|work=[[News.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html|title=Rare Condition Turns Woman Into Man|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec===
Although as in other jurisdictions residents of [[Quebec]] may informally use whatever name they want, procedures for formal name change are very strict as Quebec (unlike the rest of Canada) operates under a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system. The decision must be authorized by the Director of Civil Status, and requires a valid reason for changing the name, including long-term use of the new name (in the Montreuil case cited below, the Quebec appeals court has considered five years' use to be a sufficient reason), difficulty of use due to spelling or pronunciation, or bearing a name that another person has made infamous.

Only a judge may authorize a name change for a child for reasons of abandonment, deprivation of parental authority, or change in [[Paternity (law)|filiation]] such as [[adoption]].

This has occasionally led to controversy. A lawyer named Micheline Montreuil, a non-operative [[transgender]] woman, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the director of civil status refused to permit the change on the grounds that a legal male could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed [[sex reassignment surgery]], which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeal ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name. (Montreuil was initially prevented from changing her name despite this ruling on the grounds that she had not established general use, as normally required for a name change; the Quebec appeals court finally authorized the change on November 7, 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm#dictateur|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212004926/http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm|archivedate=February 12, 2012|title=Micheline Anne Hélène Montreuil and his fights|website=micheline.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of Civil Status will amend a Quebec birth certificate if a name change certificate is issued by another province. Some have used that loophole by temporarily moving to one of Canada's other provinces, which follow the more permissive common-law rules, in order to get the legal documents.

===South Africa===
South Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil [[Roman Dutch law]], mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in [[South Africa]] are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.

A person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the [[South African Department of Home Affairs|Department of Home Affairs]]. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a "good and sufficient reason" for the change.

A married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)

South Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.

The surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp ''Personal Amendments.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911222143/http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp |date=2008-09-11 }} (c. 1997). South African Department of Home Affairs. Retrieved May 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, a name change requires the approval of the respective [[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantonal]] government, if there are important reasons (''wichtige Gründe'' / ''justes motifs'') for the change, according to article 30 of the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} According to the case law of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]], such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.

===Taiwan===
{{Wikibooks|Annotated Republic of China Laws/Name Act}}
In [[Taiwan]], the government strictly regulates when one's surname, given name or both may or may not be changed, under the Name Act (姓名條例) since 1953 with 10 articles, totally amended into 14 articles in 2001, and the [[s:Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act|Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act]] (姓名條例施行細則).

Legally permitted reasons to change one's given name are:&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 of the Name Act (1953) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國42年)|姓名條例 (民國42年)]]), amended into Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國90年)|姓名條例 (民國90年)]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name when serving in an institution or studying in the same school.
#Since 1983, having the same name as one's parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent.&lt;ref&gt;Clause 2 of Article 6 of the Name Act (1983) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國72年)|姓名條例 (民國72年)]]), amended into Clause 2 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name as someone else who lives in the same county or city and having lived there for at least 6 months.
#Having the same name as a wanted criminal, for example [[:zh:陳進興|陳進興 (Chén Jìnxīng)]], a common name used by not only a convicted kidnapper and murderer who was executed in Taiwan for major crimes in 1997 ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣罪犯)]]) but also a Taiwanese statesman ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣政治人物)]]).
#Having special reasons,&lt;ref&gt;Clause 6 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; which is limited to twice in one's lifetime, while the second given name change of this type may not be done before reaching adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change on religious conversion==
{{further|Religious name}}
Adherents of various religions change their name upon [[Religious conversion|conversion]] or confirmation. The name adopted may not have any legal status but will represent their adopted religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Celia Emmelhainz, [http://works.bepress.com/emmelhainz/4/ ''Naming a New Self: Identity Elasticity and Self-Definition in Voluntary Name Changes.''] (c. 2012). Names, Vol. 60, Iss. 3. Retrieved April 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
* Individuals who attend a ceremony to officially become Buddhists are usually given a new "[[Dharma name]]", which marks their "[[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]]".

===Christianity===
* It has been historical Christian practice to adopt a name on [[baptism]] or (in some countries) [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428082432/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm|date=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The customary practice whereby persons entering a [[religious institute]] take on a [[name in religion]] is still observed by [[Eastern Orthodox]] and some traditional [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. Eastern Orthodox monastics are usually given the name of a prophet or a monastic saint.
* [[Pope]]s take a [[papal name]] upon their accession to office; for example, [[Jorge M. Bergoglio]] adopted the name [[Francis (given name)|Francis]].

===Hinduism===
There is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called [[Shuddhi|Shudhikaran]] (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become [[Hindu]] may be optionally given a new [[Dharma]] (religious) name, which is usually based on [[Sanskrit]] or [[Indian name]] such as names based on [[Hindu deities]].

===Islam===
* Converts to Islamic faith may choose a new name; although it is not required, it may in some cases be preferable for personal reasons or because the name is of uncertain Islamicity (e.g. the person converting has a [[theophoric name]] in another religion, such as Christopher or Ganesh). Boxer Cassius Clay's adoption of the name [[Muhammad Ali]] is a well-known example, as is Cat Stevens' change to [[Yusuf Islam]] and Malcolm Little's adoption of the name [[Malcolm X]] and later ''El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz''.  On the other hand, converts may choose to keep their names, as did [[Dave Chappelle]].
*Women do not normally take their husbands' surnames as their own. Their maiden name continues to be their surname even after marriage. Sometimes their husbands first name becomes their surname, similar to the case of surname chains indicating someone's chain of fathers. 
* In Islamic tradition, there are two kinds of [[surname]].
:# The first kind comes from the father's first name, which means that the particular person is the child of. For example, a name such as ''ibn Abdullah'' means "son of Abdullah", or ''bint Abdullah'' means "daughter of Abdullah". Father descendant names can be chained, meaning that an individual can have the name of their father, followed by their paternal grandfather, followed by the father of that grandfather, to indicate a patrilineal lineage.
:# The second kind is associated with [[clan]], [[tribal]] or [[ethnic]] affiliation and is also solely dependant on the person's patrilineal line. In Islamic family law, the individual is required to keep the clan, tribal or ethnic affiliation of their father where it is known, whether the child be illegitimate, staying with their mother after divorce or adopted.
The last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.

===Judaism===
* Jewish people in the Diaspora sometimes give their children two names: a secular name for everyday use and a Hebrew name for religious purposes.  [[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] choose a Hebrew name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_lifecycles/names/bl_names.htm|title=Choosing a Hebrew Name – Naming a Jewish Baby|author=Ariela Pelaia|work=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full Jewish names include a [[patronym]]: converts take the patronym "ben/bat Avraham Avinu" (son/daughter of Our Father Abraham) as converts are held to be spiritual descendants of [[Abraham]], the forebear of Jews.

===Sikhism===
* Those in the [[Sikh]] faith adopt a new last name upon baptism into the [[Khalsa]]. Men adopt the last name [[Singh]], while women adopt the last name [[Kaur]].
* The Sikhs adopted the name Singh in 1699 during the Birth of the Khalsa.

===Wicca===
* Some wiccans have a [[Craft name]] that is used during coven gatherings and rituals.

A '''person''' is a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as [[reason]], [[morality]], [[consciousness]] or [[self-consciousness]], and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as [[kinship]], [[ownership]] of [[property]], or [[legal obligation|legal responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0169.xml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Craemer, Willy. “A Cross-Cultural Perspective on Personhood.” The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly. Health and Society, vol. 61, no. 1, 1983, pp. 19–34., www.jstor.org/stable/3349814.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Smith. 2003. Moral, Believing Animals: Human Personhood and Culture. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrithers, Michael, Steven Collins, and Steven Lukes, eds. 1985. The category of the person: Anthropology, philosophy, history. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The defining features of [[personhood]] and consequently what makes a person count as a person differ widely among cultures and contexts.

In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about [[personal identity]] and [[self]]: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.

The common plural of "person", "[[people]]", is often used to refer to an entire [[nation]] or [[ethnic group]] (as in "a people"). The plural "persons" is often used in [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[law|legal]] writing.

==Development of the concept==

In ancient Rome, the word ''[[persona]]'' (Latin) or ''[[prosopon]]'' (πρόσωπον; Greek) originally referred to the masks worn by actors on stage. The various masks represented the various "personae" in the stage play.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1911|title=Person|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm|accessdate=2011-03-09|last=Geddes|first=Leonard|volume=11|quote=The Latin word persona was originally used to denote the mask worn by an actor. From this, it was applied to the role he assumed, and, finally, to any character on the stage of life, to any individual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of person was further developed during the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] and [[Christology|Christological]] debates of the 4th and 5th centuries in contrast to the word nature.&lt;ref&gt;Thisleton NIGNTC commentary on 1 Corinthians "Thinkers in ancient times had a difficulty in expressing the notion of personality"; Barfield in History of English Words “Take, for instance, the word person...Its present meaning of an individual human being is largely due to the theologians who hit upon it when they were looking for some term that would enable them to assert the trinity of Godhead without admitting more than one 'substance'"; John Zizioulas in ''Being as Communion'', 1985 New York:St Vladimirs Press p. 27 writes: "although the person and “personal identity” are widely discussed nowadays as a supreme ideal, nobody seems to recognize that historically as well as existentially the concept of the person is indissolubly bound up with theology."&lt;/ref&gt;  During the theological debates, some philosophical tools (concepts) were needed so that the debates could be held on common basis to all theological schools. The purpose of the debate was to establish the relation, similarities and differences between the Λóγος/''Verbum'' and God. The philosophical concept of person arose, taking the word "[[prosopon]]" (πρόσωπον) from the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. Therefore, Christus (the Λóγος/''Verbum'') and God were defined as different "persons". This concept was applied later to the Holy Ghost, the angels and to all human beings.

Since then, a number of important changes to the word's meaning and use have taken place, and attempts have been made to redefine the word with varying degrees of adoption and influence.

==Personhood==
[[File:Paul Klee WI (In Memoriam) 1938.jpg|thumb|An abstract painting of a person by [[Paul Klee]]. The concept of a person can be very challenging to define.]]
{{main article|Personhood}}

{{quotation|The criteria for being a person... are designed to capture those attributes which are the subject of our most humane concern with ourselves and the source of what we regard as most important and most problematical in our lives.|Harry G. Frankfurt|}}
Personhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in [[philosophy]] and [[law]], and is closely tied to legal and [[political]] concepts of [[citizenship]], [[equality before the law|equality]], and [[liberty]]. According to common worldwide general legal practice, only a [[natural person]] or [[legal personality]] has [[rights]], protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability]].
Personhood continues to be a topic of international debate, and has been questioned during the abolition of [[slavery]] and the fight for [[women's rights]], in debates about [[abortion]], [[fetal rights]], and in [[animal rights]] advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of non-human personhood, see Midgley, Mary. [http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/midgley01.htm "Persons and non-persons"], in Peter Singer (ed.) ''In Defense of Animals''. Basil Blackwell, 1985, pp. 52-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various debates have focused on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities. Historically, the personhood of animals, women, and slaves has been a catalyst of social upheaval. In most societies today, living adult humans are usually considered persons, but depending on the context, theory or definition, the category of "person" may be taken to include or not [[adultism|children]] or such [[Non human|non-human]] entities as [[animals]], [[artificial intelligences]], or [[extraterrestrial life]], as well as legal entities such as [[corporations]], [[sovereign states]] and other [[Polity|polities]], or [[estate (law)|estate]]s in [[probate]].&lt;ref&gt;For corporations, see [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html "Justices, 5-4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit"], ''The New York Times'', January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal identity==
[[Image:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|What does it take for individuals to persist from moment to moment – or in other words, for the same individual to exist at different moments?]]
{{main article|Personal identity}}

Personal identity is the [[Identity (philosophy)|unique identity]] of persons through time. That is to say, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the ''same'' person, persisting through time. In the modern [[philosophy of mind]], this concept of personal identity is sometimes referred to as the ''[[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]]'' problem of personal identity. The ''[[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]]'' problem is grounded in the question of what features or traits characterize a given person at one time.

Identity is an issue for both [[continental philosophy]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and [[analytic philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} A key question in continental philosophy is in what sense we can maintain the modern conception of identity, while realizing many of our prior assumptions about the world are incorrect.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Proposed solutions to the problem of personal identity include continuity of the physical body, continuity of an immaterial mind or soul, continuity of consciousness or memory,&lt;ref&gt;Stefaroi, P. (2015). Humanistic Personology: A Humanistic-Ontological Theory of the Person &amp; Personality. Applications in Therapy, Social Work, Education, Management and Art (Theatre).  Charleston SC, USA: CreateSpace.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[bundle theory]] of self,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} continuity of personality after the death of the physical body,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of post-mortal personhood, see Roth, S. (2013) ''Dying is only human. The case death makes for the immortality of the person''. Tamara Journal for Critical Organization Inquiry, Vol. 11, No. 2, pp. 35-39. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2260793]&lt;/ref&gt; and proposals that there are actually no persons or selves who persist over time at all.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Selimovic and Kesinovic were born in Austria to Bosnian immigrants who had fled the [[Bosnian War]] in the 1990s.

A '''shield-maiden''' ({{lang-non|skjaldmær}}), in [[Scandinavian folklore]] and [[Norse mythology|mythology]] was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in [[saga]]s such as ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other [[Germanic peoples]]: [[Goths]], [[Cimbri]], and [[Marcomanni]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfce/0728.html The article ''Sköldmö''] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical [[valkyrie]]s may have been based on the shield-maidens.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;

==Historical existence==
The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]],&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|title=Secrets of the Vikings: Shield Maidens|website=www.history.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125132543/http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|title=Viking women, warriors, and valkyries|website=blog.britishmuseum.org|date=19 April 2014|first=Judith|last=Jesch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194313/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker. On these captains, who had the bodies of women, nature bestowed the souls of men. [[Webiorg]] was also inspired with the same spirit, and was attended by Bo (Bui) Bramason and Brat the Jute, thirsting for war.|[[Saxo Grammaticus]]&lt;ref name=Saxo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elton|first1=Oliver|title=THE DANISH HISTORY,  BOOKS I-IX by  Saxo Grammaticus|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1150|website=Project Gutenberg|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==Archaeology==
Graves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/don’t-underestimate-viking-women|title=Don’t underestimate Viking women|date=2 January 2013|first=Arild S.|last=Foss|website=sciencenordic.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norse immigrant graves in [[England]] and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Warriors and women: the sex ratio of Norse migrants to eastern England up to 900 AD | last = McLeod | first = Shane | work = Early Medieval Europe | publisher = Wiley | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 332–353 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/full | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Invasion of the Viking women unearthed | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/07/invasion-of-the-viking-women-unearthed/1?csp=34news#.U6xrxBwcqs8 | date = July 19, 2011 | publisher = [[USA Today]] | last = Vergano | first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a tie-in special to the TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' Neil Price showed that a 10th Century [[Birka]]-burial excavated in the 1970s containing a large number of weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt; In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female&lt;ref name=jonson2017&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23308|title=A female Viking warrior confirmed by genomics|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=2017|last1=Hedenstierna-Jonson|first1=Charlotte|last2=Kjellström|first2=Anna|last3=Zachrisson|first3=Torun|last4=Krzewińska|first4=Maja|last5=Sobrado|first5=Veronica|last6=Price|first6=Neil|last7=Günther|first7=Torsten|last8=Jakobsson|first8=Mattias|last9=Götherström|first9=Anders|last10=Storå|first10=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the so called [[Birka female Viking warrior]], but others including respected scholar of the Vikings, Judith Jesch says that conclusion is premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

A '''slave name''' is the [[personal name]] given by others to an [[slavery|enslaved]] person, or a name inherited from enslaved ancestors. The modern use of the term applies mostly to [[African Americans]] and [[Afro-Caribbean|West Indians]] who are descended from enslaved Africans who retain their name given to their ancestors by the enslavers.

Changing from a slave name to a name embodying an [[Africanization|African identity]] became common after [[emancipation]] in the 1960s by those in the [[African diaspora in the Americas]] seeking a reconnection to their African cultural roots.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Ancient Rome==
{{Slavery}}
In Rome slaves were given a single name by their owner. A slave who was [[manumission|freed]] might keep his or her slave name and adopt the former owner's name as a [[praenomen]] and [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]. As an example, one historian says that "a man named Publius Larcius freed a male slave named Nicia, who was then called Publius Larcius Nicia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/roman_names.html Roman Nomenclature at vroma.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Harold Whetstone Johnston]] writes of instances in which a slave's former owner chose to ignore custom and simply chose a name for the [[freedman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumromanum.org/life/johnston_2.html#60 Johnson, Harold Whetstone; Johnston, Mary; Names of Freedmen; 1903, 1932; forumromanum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==African Americans==

A number of African-Americans and [[Afro-Caribbeans]] have changed their names out of the belief that the names they were given at birth were slave names. An individual's name change often coincides with a religious conversion ([[Muhammad Ali]] changed his name from Cassius Clay, [[Malcolm X]] from Malcolm Little, and [[Louis Farrakhan]] changed his from Louis Eugene Walcott, for example)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Farrakhan Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/louis-farrakhan-9291850|work=Database|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muhammad Ali Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/muhammad-ali-9181165|work=Database|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or involvement with the [[black nationalist]] movement (e.g., [[Amiri Baraka]] and [[Assata Shakur]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Van Deburg|Deburg, William L. Van]], "Modern Black Nationalism: From Marcus Garvey to Louis Farrakhan",  NYU Press (1997), p 269, {{ISBN|0-8147-8789-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations encourage African-Americans to abandon their slave names. The [[Nation of Islam]] is perhaps the best-known of them. In his book, ''[[Message to the Blackman in America]]'', Nation of Islam leader [[Elijah Muhammad]] writes often of slave names. Some of his comments include:

* "''You must remember that slave-names will keep you a slave in the eyes of the civilized world today. You have seen, and recently, that Africa and Asia will not honor you or give you any respect as long as you are called by the white man's name.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seventhfam.com/temple/books/black_man/blk24.htm [[Muhammad, Elijah]]; ''Message to the Blackman''; Chapter 24; seventhfam.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "''You are still called by your slave-masters' names. By rights, by international rights, you belong to the white man of America. He knows that. You have never gotten out of the shackles of slavery. You are still in them.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seventhfam.com/temple/books/black_man/blk34.htm Muhammad, Elijah; ''Message to the Blackman''; Chapter 34; seventhfam.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] [[US Organization]] also advocates for African-Americans to change their slave names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us-organization.org/nguzosaba/NguzoSaba.html "NGUZO SABA (The Seven Principles)" From : US Organization website]&lt;/ref&gt;
