'''''Alltagsgeschichte''''' is a form of [[microhistory]] that was particularly prevalent amongst German historians during the 1980s. It was founded by historians [[Alf Luedtke]] and [[:de:Hans Medick|Hans Medick]].

The name comes from German, where ''Alltag'' means "everyday life"; it can thus be roughly translated as "everyday history". In this sense, ''Alltagsgeschichte'' can be considered part of the wider Marxian historical school of '[[People's history|history from below]]'. 

The purpose of ''Alltagsgeschichte'' is to find and prove the links between the down-to-earth, everyday, basic experiences of ordinary people in a society, and the broad social and political changes which occur in that society. Because this is such a massively broad endeavour to undertake, it can only feasibly be practised on the most minute of scales. Thus ''Alltagsgeschichte'' becomes a form of microhistory.

Its leading exponents include [[Paul Veyne]] and Michel Rouche in France, and Peter Carr in the United Kingdom. ''Alltagsgeschichte'' can also be linked to the Italian historical doctrine of ''Microstoria'' (microhistory).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7412">The '''Duff Cooper Prize''' is a literary prize awarded annually for the best work of [[history]], [[biography]], [[political science]] or (very occasionally) [[poetry]], published in [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]]. The prize was established in honour of [[Duff Cooper]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] diplomat, Cabinet member and author. The prize was first awarded in 1956 to [[Alan Moorehead]] for his ''Gallipoli''. At present, the winner receives a first edition copy of Duff Cooper's autobiography ''[[Old Men Forget]]'' and a cheque for [[Pound sterling|£]]5,000.

==An overview==
After Duff Cooper's death in 1954, a group of his friends decided to establish a trust to endow a literary prize in his memory. The trust appoints five judges. Two of them are ''ex officio'': the [[List of Wardens of New College, Oxford|Warden]] of [[New College, Oxford]], and a member of Duff Cooper's family (initially, Duff Cooper's son, [[John Julius Norwich]] for the first thirty-six years, and then John Julius' daughter, [[Artemis Cooper]]). The other three judges appointed by the trust serve for five years and they appoint their own successors. The first three judges were [[Maurice Bowra]], [[Cyril Connolly]] and [[Raymond Mortimer]]. At present, the three appointed judges are writer and biographer [[Patrick Marnham]], film critic John McBratney, and former ''[[The Times Literary Supplement|TLS]]'' editor Lindsay Duguid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theduffcooperprize.org/duff-cooper-prize-history|title=History|publisher=The Duff Cooper Prize official website|accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 2013, the prize has been known as The Pol Roger Duff Cooper Prize, following a sponsorship by [[Pol Roger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=London Evening Standard|title=Champagne days for winners of the Duff Cooper Prize|date=February 21, 2013|accessdate=August 26, 2013|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/champagne-days-for-winners-of-the-duff-cooper-prize-8504983.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''historical figure''' is a famous person in [[history]], such as [[Catherine the Great]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[George Washington]], or [[Napoleon]].

The significance of such figures in human progress has been debated. Some think they play a crucial role, while others say they have little impact on the broad currents of thought and social change.  The concept is generally used in the sense that the person really existed in the past, as opposed to being legendary.  However, the legends that can grow up around historical figures may be hard to distinguish from fact.  Sources are often incomplete and may be inaccurate, particularly those from early periods of history. Without a body of personal documents, the more subtle aspects of personality of a historical figure can only be deduced. With historical figures who were also religious figures attempts to separate fact from belief may be controversial.

In education, presenting information as if it were being told by a historical figure may give it greater impact. Since classical times, students have been asked to put themselves in the place of a historical figure as a way of bringing history to life. Historical figures are often represented in fiction, where fact and fancy are combined. In earlier traditions, before the rise of a critical historical tradition, authors took less care to be as accurate when describing what they knew of historical figures and their actions, interpolating imaginary elements intended to serve a moral purpose to events: such is [[Notker the Stammerer|the Monk of St. Gall]]'s anecdotal account of [[Charlemagne]], ''De Carolo Magno''. More recently there has been a tendency once again for authors to freely depart from the "facts" when they conflict with their creative goals.

==Significance==
The significance of historical figures has long been the subject of debate by philosophers. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] (1770–1831) considered that "world-historical figures" played a pivotal role in human progress, but felt that they were bound to emerge when change was needed. [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1795–1881) saw the study of figures such as [[Muhammad]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]] as key to understanding history. [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903), an early believer in evolution and in the universality of natural law, felt that historical individuals were of little importance.

===Hegel's world-historical figure===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] introduced the concept of the "world-historical figure".]]
The German philosopher Hegel defined the concept of the world-historical figure, who embodied the ruthless advance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s World Spirit, often overthrowing outdated structures and ideas.  To him, [[Napoleon]] was such a figure.{{sfn|Hagen|2012|p=125}}
Hegel proposed that a world-historical figure essentially posed a challenge, or thesis, and this would generate an antithesis, or opposing force. Eventually a synthesis would resolve the conflict.{{sfn|Van Doren|2008|p=277}}
Hegel viewed [[Julius Caesar]] as a world historical figure, who appeared at a stage when Rome had grown to the point it could no longer continue as a republican city state but had to become an empire.  Caesar failed in his bid to make himself an emperor, and was assassinated, but the empire came into existence soon afterward, and Caesar's name has become synonymous with "emperor" in forms such as "[[kaiser]]" or "[[czar]]".{{sfn|Karatani|2011|p=20}}

[[Søren Kierkegaard]], in his early essay ''The Concept of Irony'', generally agrees with Hegel's views, such as his characterization of [[Socrates]] as a world-historical figure who acted as a destructive force on Greek received views of morality.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=179}}
In Hegel's view, Socrates broke down social harmony by questioning the meaning of concepts like "justice" and "virtue".
Eventually, the Athenians quite rightly *(Name source) condemned Socrates to death. But they could not stop the evolution of thought that Socrates had begun, which would lead to the concept of individual conscience.{{sfn|Magee|2001|p=192}}
Hegel said of world-historical figures,
{{blockquote|It was theirs to know this nascent principle; the necessary, directly sequent step in progress, which their world was to take; to make this their aim, and to expend their energy in promoting it ... They die early like Alexander; they are murdered, like Caesar; transported to St. Helena, like Napoleon ... They are ''great'' men, because they willed and accomplished something great; not a mere fancy, a mere intention, but that which met the case and fell in with the needs of the age.{{sfn|Cramer|2007|p=272}}}}

However, Hegel, [[Thomas Carlyle]] and others noted that the great historical figures were just representative men, expressions of the material forces of history.  Essentially they have little choice about what they do. This is in conflict with the views of [[George Bancroft]] or [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who praised self-reliance and individualism, and in conflict with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], who also felt that individuals can determine their destiny.{{sfn|Moses|2004|p=5}}
Engels found that Hegel's system contained an "internal and incurable contradiction", resting as it does on both [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectical relativism]] and idealistic absolutism.{{sfn|Moses|2004|p=xv}}

===Spencerian view===
[[File:Spencer1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Herbert Spencer]], who considered events in the lives of kings "historic trivalities"]]
The Scottish philosopher and evolutionist [[Herbert Spencer]], who was highly influential in the latter half of the nineteenth century, felt that historical figures were relatively unimportant.
He wrote to a friend, "I ignore utterly the personal element in history, and, indeed, show little respect for history altogether as it is ordinarily conceived."
He wrote, "The births, deaths,  and marriages of kings, and other like historic trivialities, are committed to memory, not because of any direct benefits that can possibly result from knowing them:  but because society considers them parts of a good education."{{sfn|Carneiro|1981|p=188}}
In his essay ''What Knowledge Is of Most Worth?'' he wrote:
{{blockquote|That which constitutes History,  properly so called, is in great part omitted from works on the subject. Only of late years have historians commenced giving us, in any considerable quantity, the truly valuable information. As in past ages the king was everything and the people nothing; So, in past histories, the doings of the king fill the entire picture, to which the national life forms but an obscure background. While only now, when the welfare of nations rather than of rulers is becoming the dominant idea, are historians beginning to occupy themselves with the phenomena of social progress. The thing it really concerns us to know is the natural history of society.{{sfn|Carneiro|1981|p=188-189}}}}

===Inevitability or determinism===
Taken to an extreme, one may consider that what Hegel calls the "world spirit" and [[T. S. Eliot]] calls "those vast impersonal forces" hold us in their grip.  What happens is predetermined.{{sfn|White|2004|p=52}} 
Both Hegel and Marx advocated historical inevitability in contrast to the doctrine of contingency, allowing for alternative outcomes, that was advocated by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]] and others.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2011|p=chapter 9}}
However, Marx argued against the use of the  "historical inevitability" argument when used to explain the destruction of early communes in Russia.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2009|p=158}}
As an orthodox Marxist, [[Vladimir Lenin]] accepted the laws of history that Marx had discovered, including the historical inevitability of capitalism followed by a transition to socialism.
Despite this, Lenin also believed the transition could be effected faster by voluntary action.{{sfn|Chen|2007|p=37}}

In 1936 [[Karl Popper]] published an influential paper on ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'', published as a book in 1957, that attacked the doctrine of historical inevitability.{{sfn|Agassi|2008|p=218}}
The historian [[Isaiah Berlin]], author of ''Historical Inevitability'', also argued forcibly against this view, going as far as to say that some choices are entirely free and cannot be predicted scientifically.{{sfn|White|2004|p=52}}
Berlin presented his views in a 1953 lecture at the [[London School of Economics]], published soon afterwards.  When speaking he referred to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s views, but the published version speaks approvingly of Karl Popper, which caused a stir among academics.{{sfn|Agassi|2008|p=152}}

===Heroic view===
[[File:Carlyle by Elliott &amp; Fry c1860s.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Carlyle]], champion of study of great men]]
[[Thomas Carlyle]] has espoused the "heroic view" of history, famously saying in his essay on the Norse god [[Odin]] in his book ''On heroes, hero-worship, &amp; the heroic in history'' that "No great man lives in vain. The History of the world is but the Biography of great men ... We do not now call our great men Gods, nor admire ''without'' limit; ah no, ''with'' limit enough! But if we have no great men, or do not admire at all,— that were a still worse case."{{sfn|Carlyle|1841|p=47}}
Carlyle's historical philosophy was based on the "[[Great Man theory]]", saying, "Universal History, the history of what man has accomplished in the world ... [is] at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here."
An extreme believer in individuality, he also believed that the masses of people should let themselves be guided by the great leaders of men.{{sfn|Carlyle|2007|p=9}}
Talking of poets he said,
{{blockquote|That ideal outline of himself, which a man unconsciously shadows forth in his writings, and which, if rightly deciphered, will be truer than any other representation of him, it is the task of the Biographer to fill-up into an actual coherent figure, and to bring him to our experience, or at least our clear undoubted admiration, thereby to instruct and edify us in many ways. Conducted on such principles, the Biography of great men, especially of great Poets, that is, of men in the highest degree noble-minded and wise, might become one of the most dignified and valuable species of composition.{{sfn|Kerry|Hill|2010|p=138}}}}
More recently, in his 1943 book ''The Hero in History'', the [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] scholar [[Sidney Hook]] asserts:
{{blockquote|That history is made by men and women is no longer denied except by some theologians and mystical metaphysicians.  And even they are compelled indirectly to acknowledge this commonplace truth, for they speak of historical personages as 'instruments' of Providence, Justice, Reason, Dialectic, the ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', or Spirit of the Times.  Men agree more readily about the consequences of the use of 'instruments' in history than they do about the ultimate ends 'instruments' allegedly serve, or the first causes by which they are allegedly determined.{{sfn|Hook|1943|p=xi}}}}
Hook recognizes the relevance of the environment within which the "great man" or "hero" acted, but asserts that this can provide the backdrop but never the plot of the "dramas of human history". and distinguish life and species{{sfn|Hook|1943|p=xiii}}

===Ranking===
[[File:Crucifixion by Jacob Jordaens.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The crucifixion of Jesus, the founder of [[Christianity]], painted by [[Jacob Jordaens]] in the 17th century.]]
There have been rankings of the significance of major historical figures.  For example, [[Cesar A. Hidalgo]] and colleagues at the [[MIT Media Lab]] has calculated the memorability of historical figures using data such as the number of language editions for which there are articles for each person, the pageviews received, and other factors.  These lists are available at MIT's [http://pantheon.media.mit.edu Pantheon ] project.

==Historical truth==
It is sometimes hard to discern whether apparently historical figures from the earliest periods did in fact exist, due to the lack of records.  Even with more recent personages, stories or anecdotes about the person often accumulate that have no basis in fact.  Although the external aspects of a historical figure may be well documented, their inner nature can only be a subject of speculation.  With religious figures, often the subjects of voluminous literature, separating "fact" from "belief" can be difficult if not impossible.

===Ancient figures===
With older texts it can be difficult to be sure whether a person in the text is, in fact, a historical figure. "Wisdom literature" from early middle-eastern cultures (such as the [[Book of Job]]), mainly consist of verbal expositions or discussions that must be considered the work of the author, rather than the character supposedly speaking. It may still be possible to identify a figure in such texts with a historical figure known from some other context, and the text may be taken as informative about this figure, even if not verified by an independent source.{{sfn|Longman|Enns|2008|p=335}} On the other hand, a text may include realistic settings and references to historical people, while the central character may or may not be a historical figure.{{sfn|Longman|Enns|2008|p=336}}

===Fables===
[[File:Lady Godiva (John Collier, c. 1897).jpg|thumb|[[Lady Godiva]] was a historical figure, but there is no evidence that the legend of her riding naked through the streets is true (''[[Lady Godiva (painting)|Lady Godiva]]'' painting, 1897 by [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]])]]

Napoleon spoke of history as being a [[fable]] which had been agreed upon:– "''la fable convenue qu'on appellera l'histoire''".{{sfn|Napoleon &amp; Auguste-Dieudonné 1823|p=242}} Great figures of the past have stories told about them which grow in the telling, and so become [[myth]]s and [[legend]]s which may dominate or displace the more prosaic historical facts about them. For example, some ancient chroniclers said that the Emperor [[Nero]] fiddled while Rome burned, but [[Tacitus]] disputed this by saying the stories were just malicious rumours. Similarly, there is no good evidence that [[Marie-Antoinette]] ever said "let them eat cake", or that [[Lady Godiva]] rode naked through the streets of [[Coventry]].{{sfn|Andrews|2012}}

===Personality===
[[Thomas Carlyle]] pointed out that even to the person living it, every life "remains in so many points unintelligible".  The historian must struggle when writing biographies, "the very facts of which, to say nothing of the purport of them, we know not, and cannot know!"{{sfn|Kerry|Hill|2010|p=133-134}}
Some psychologists have sought to understand the personalities of historical figures through clues about the way in which they were raised. However, this theoretical psychoanalytic approach is not supported empirically. An alternative approach, favored by [[Psychobiography|psychobiographers]] such as [[William Runyan]], is to explain the personality of the historical figure in terms of their life history. This approach has the advantage of recognizing that personality may evolve over time in response to events.{{sfn|Roberts|1996|p=208}}

[[File:Confucius Laozi Buddha.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Three great historical figures — [[Confucius]] presenting the [[Buddha]] to [[Lao Tsu]]. They are all of such antiquity that the historical facts about them are now overlaid with centuries of myth and legend.]]

===Religious figures===
With historical religious figures, fact and belief may be difficult to disentangle.
There are cultural differences in the treatment of historical figures. Thus the Chinese can recognise that [[Mencius]] or [[Confucius]] were historical individuals, while also endowing them with sanctity. In Indian [[Hinduism]], on the other hand, figures such as [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]] are almost always seen as embodiments of gods rather than as historical people. The [[Nirvana Sutra]] states: "Do not rely on the man but on the Dharma." A teacher such as [[Gautama Buddha]] is thus treated almost exclusively as a lesser god rather than a historical figure.{{sfn|Yuasa|Kasulis|1987|p=128}}

[[E. P. Sanders]], author of ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'', called Jesus of Nazareth "one of the most important figures in human history".{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=1}} Various writers have struggled to present [[Historical Jesus|"historical" views of Jesus]], as opposed to views distorted by belief.{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=3}} When writing about this subject, a historian who relies only on sources other than the [[New Testament]] may be criticized for implying that it is not a sufficient source of information about the subject.{{sfn|Habermas|1996|p=11}}

The theologian [[Martin Kähler]] is known for his work ''Der sogenannte historische Jesus und der geschichtliche, biblische Christus'' (The so-called historical Jesus, and the historic, biblical Christ). He clearly distinguished between "the Jesus of history" and "the Christ of faith".{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=4}} Some historians openly admit bias, which may anyway be unavoidable. Paul Hollenback says he writes about the historical Jesus, "...in order to overthrow, not simply correct, the mistake called Christianity."  Another historian who has written about Jesus, Frederick Gaiser, says, "historical investigation is part and parcel of biblical faith."{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=3}}

{{clear}}

==Political appropriation==
[[File:Stilke Hermann Anton - Joan of Arc's Death at the Stake.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1843 view of a heroic [[Joan of Arc]] at the stake.]]
A historical figure may be interpreted to support political aims.
In France in the first half of the seventeenth century,&lt;!--didn't the big Joan thing take place around the time of Napoleon?--&gt; there was an outpouring of writing about [[Joan of Arc]], including seven biographies, three plays and an epic poem. Joan had become a symbol of national pride and the Catholic faith, helping unite a country that had been divided by the recent [[French Wars of Religion|wars of religion]].  The reality of the historical Joan was subordinated to the need for a symbol of feminine strength, Christian virtue and resistance to the English.{{sfn|Powers|Gale|1981|p=1}}
[[George Bernard Shaw]], introducing his 1923 play ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'', discussed representations of Joan by other authors.
He felt that [[William Shakespeare]]'s depiction in ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'' was constrained from making her a "beautiful and romantic figure" by political considerations. [[Voltaire]]'s version in his poem ''[[La Pucelle d'Orléans]]'' was also flawed by Voltaire's biases and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s play ''[[Die Jungfrau von Orleans]]'' "is not about Joan at all, and can hardly be said to pretend to be."{{sfn|Innes|1998|p=208}}

A historical figure may be used to validate a politician's claim to authority,
where the modern leader shapes and exploits the ideas associated with the historical figure,
which they are presumed to have inherited.{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=60}}
Thus [[Jesse Jackson]] has frequently evoked the spirit of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]].{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=51}}
[[Fidel Castro]] often presented himself as following the path defined by [[José Martí]].{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=64}}
[[Hugo Chávez]] of Venezuela has frequently identified himself with the historical figure [[Simón Bolívar]], the liberator of South America from Spanish rule.{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=125}}

Hegel believed in the role of the state in guaranteeing individual liberties, and his views were therefore rejected by the German National Socialists, who considered him dangerously liberal and perhaps a proto-Marxist. On the other hand, [[Adolf Hitler]] identified himself as a Hegelian world historical figure, and justified his actions on this basis.{{sfn|Cobley|2002|p=278}}

==In education==
[[Plato]] used historical figures in his writing, but only to illustrate his points. [[Xenophon]] used [[Cyrus the Great]] in the same way.
When Plato apparently quotes [[Socrates]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', it is only to add dramatic effect to the presentation of his own thought.{{sfn|Anton|Preus|1971|p=162}} For this reason, Plato's writings on Socrates tell us little, at least directly, about Socrates. The historical figure is used only as a device for communicating Plato's ideas.{{sfn|Anton|Preus|1971|p=162}} In classical Rome, students of rhetoric had to master the ''[[suasoria]]'' — a form of [[declamation]] in which they wrote the soliloquy of a historical figure who was debating a critical course of action.  For example, the poet [[Juvenal]] wrote a speech for the dictator [[Sulla]], in which he was counselled to retire. The poet [[Ovid]] enjoyed this exercise more than the other final challenge — the ''[[controversia]]''.{{sfn|Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics|p=212}}

The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote an influential essay "On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life". He said "the unhistorical and historical are necessary in equal measure for the health of an individual, of a people and of a culture."{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=2}}
Nietzsche identifies three approaches to history, each with dangers.
The monumental approach describes the glories of the past, often focusing on heroic figures like [[Elizabeth I of England]] or [[Louis Pasteur]]. 
By treating these figures as models, the student is tempted to consider that there can be nobody of such stature today.
The antiquarian view examines the past in minute and reverent detail, turning its back on the present.
The critical approach challenges traditional views, even though they may be valid.{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=3}}

Historical figures may today be simulated as [[animated pedagogical agent]]s to teach history and foreign culture. An example is [[Freudbot]], which acted the part of [[Sigmund Freud]] for psychology students. When a variety of simulated character types were tried as educational agents, students rated historical figures as the most engaging.{{sfn|Veletsianos|2010|p=16}}
There are [[gender difference]]s in the perception of historical figures.  When modern US schoolchildren were asked to roleplay or illustrate historical stereotypes, boys tended to focus upon male figures exclusively while girls showed more varied family groupings.{{sfn|Fournier|Wineburg|1997|p=160-185}}

==In branding==
Using historical figures in marketing communicationsn and in branding is a new area of marketing research but historical figures’ names were used to promote products as early as in the Middle Ages&lt;ref&gt;Madow M., Private Ownership of Public Image: Popular Culture and Publicity Rights, vol. 81, California Law Review 125, 1993, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Historical figure brand is using famous historical person in branding, for instance [[Mozartkugel]], [[Chopin (vodka)]] or Café Einstein https://www.cafeeinstein.com/. 

Historical figure is a person who lived in the past and whose deeds exerted a significant impact on other people’s lives and consciousness. These figures are attributed with certain features that are a compilation of the actual values they proclaimed and the manner they were perceived by others. This perception evolves and subsequent generations read the biography of a given historical figure in their own way through their own knowledge and experience. In order to determine the popularity of the commercialisation of historical figures, a study was conducted at the beginning of 2014 on the number of trademark protection applications filed with the Patent Office of the Republic of Poland as a measure of entrepreneurs’ interest in this activity. The names of 300 most prominent Polish historical figures &lt;ref&gt;Grygiel A.(ed.), Encyklopedia sławnych Polaków, Publicat S.A., Poznań 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; were considered. The study showed that over 21% of the names analysed were recorded in the trademark register. 1,033 trademark protection applications were filed for 64 names out of the 300 historical figures investigated [Aldona Lipka, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;Lipka Aldona, Ograniczona racjonalność i heurystyki w zachowaniach nabywców [w:] G. Wolska (red.), Współczesne problemy ekonomiczne, Zeszyty Naukowe nr 858, Wyd. Uniwersytet Szczeciński, Szczecin 2015. p. 265.(https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=8g7DDDkAAAAJ&amp;hl=pl&amp;oi=ao)&lt;/ref&gt;]. The greatest number of trademark protection applications were recorded for [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko]] (295), followed by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (250), [[John III Sobieski]] (94) and [[Chopin]] (81).

==In art and literature==
[[File:Henry IV 1 title page.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Shakespeare]] wrote a number of plays that dramatized the lives of historical figures, but introduced fictional characters such as [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]].]]

===Realist historical fiction===
There is a huge body of historical fiction, where the text includes both imaginary and factual elements. In early English literature, [[Robin Hood]] was a fictional character, but the historical King [[Richard I of England]] also appears.{{sfn|Nield|1929|p=xviii}}
[[William Shakespeare]]{{efn|William Shakespeare was a historical figure himself, but as a biographer said, "Such materials as there are for Shakespeare's personal history, or for the history of anyone connected with him, have been gathered with the most loving and persevering industry. Unhappily, they amount to very little.  Entries in municipal records, names in a will, a lease, or an inventory, tell hardly anything of the life or character of the man.  That orange has now been squeezed dry."{{sfn|Smith|1899|p=7}}}} wrote [[List of historical figures dramatised by Shakespeare|plays about people who were historical figures in his day]], such as ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. He did not present these people as pure history, but dramatised their lives as a commentary about the people and politics of his own time.{{sfn|Hattaway|2002|p=16}}
Napoleon figured in [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1862 classic ''[[Les Misérables]]''.{{sfn|Powers|Gale|1981|p=65}}
There are many more examples.

The compiler of a survey of historical novels in the 1920s claimed that the "appearance of reality ... is the great charm of the historical novel." He went on to assert, regarding novels about periods of which little is known, that "the danger is that the very elements which add to our interest in the tale as such will go far to mislead us in our conception of the period dealt with".{{sfn|Nield|1929|p=xix}}
Traditionally the treatment of historical figures in fiction was realistic in style and respectful of fact. A historical novel would be true to the facts known about the period in which the novel is set, a [[biographical novel]] would follow the facts that are known about the protagonist's life, and a "[[roman à clef]]" would try to give an accurate interpretation of what is known about a public figure's private life. In each genre, the novelist would avoid introducing any elements that were clearly in conflict with the facts.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xv}}

A writer may be handicapped by his readers' preconceptions about a historical person, which may or may not be accurate, and the facts about the historical person may also conflict with the novelist's plot requirements.{{sfn|Lukacs|1937|p=168}}
According to the Marxist philosopher [[György Lukács]] in his 1937 book on ''The Historical Novel'', "The 'world-historical individual' can only figure as a minor character in the [historical] novel because of the complexity and intricacy of the whole social-historical process."{{sfn|Waters|2009|p=113}}
As Jacobs observes, the "realist aesthetic" of the historical novel "assumes that a recognizable historical figure in fiction must not 'do things' its model did not do in real life; it follows that historical figures can be used only in very limited ways."{{sfn|Wyile|2002|p=16}}
The author of a traditional historical novel should therefore focus more on the people who have been lost to history.{{sfn|Waters|2009|p=112}}
A novelist such as Sir [[Walter Scott]] or [[Leo Tolstoy]] (''[[War and Peace]]'') would describe historical events accurately. They would give rein to their imagination only in scenes that were not significant historically, when interactions with fictional characters could safely be introduced.{{sfn|Wachtel|1995|p=114}}

===Modern fiction===
More recently, however, starting with works such as ''[[The Confessions of Nat Turner]]'', and ''[[Sophie's Choice (novel)|Sophie's Choice]]'' by [[William Styron]],
the novelist has felt more free to introduce much larger amounts of purely imaginary detail about historical people.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xv}}
[[E. L. Doctorow]] illustrates this different attitude when discussing his book ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'': "Certain details were so delicious that I was scrupulous about getting them right. Others&amp;nbsp;... demanded to be mythologized."  This reflects a changing attitude about the distinction between "fact" and "truth", expressed by [[Ursule Molinaro]] when he makes his [[Cassandra]] say, "I've come as close to the truth as facts would let me ... facts oppress the truth, which can breathe freely only in poetry &amp; art."{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xvii}}

===Other media===
Many films have depicted historical figures.  Often the way in which the films interpret these figures and their times reflects the social and cultural values of the period in which the film was made.{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=1}}
Historical figures are familiar to the general reader and so may be used in [[speculative fiction]] so that readers marvel at their appearance in novel settings or with a fresh perspective.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=111ff}}
For example, the time traveler [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] has encountered numerous historical figures such as [[Marco Polo]] and [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in his adventures.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gee|2012}}
They appeared most frequently when the television series first started, as it was directed at children and the use of historical figures in historical settings was intended to be educational.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=19}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">In [[sociology]], an '''industrial society''' is a society driven by the use of [[technology]] to enable [[mass production]], supporting a [[population growth|large population]] with a high capacity for [[division of labour]]. Such a structure developed in the [[Western world]] in the period of time following the [[Industrial Revolution]], and replaced the [[agrarian society|agrarian societies]] of the [[Modern history#Pre-modern|pre-modern]], [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] age. Industrial societies are generally [[mass society|mass societies]], and may be succeeded by an [[information society]]. They are often contrasted with [[traditional society|traditional societies]].&lt;ref name=slang&gt;S. Langlois, Traditions: Social, In: Neil J. Smelser and Paul B. Baltes, Editor(s)-in-Chief, ''International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences'', Pergamon, Oxford, 2001, pages 15829-15833, {{ISBN|978-0-08-043076-8}}, {{doi|10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/02028-3}}. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B7MRM-4MT09VJ-4PM/2/1eb81ee3e63af98afa7a48ecacfb64a6 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[industrialization|Industrial]] societies use external energy sources, such as [[fossil fuels]], to increase the rate and scale of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/98/04717398/0471739898.pdf |title=Chapter 1: Energy Fundamentals, Energy Use in an Industrial Society |website= |accessdate=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of food is shifted to large commercial farms where the products of industry, such as [[combine harvesters]] and fossil fuel based [[fertilizers]], are used to decrease required human labor while increasing production. No longer needed for the production of food, excess labor is moved into these [[factories]] where [[mechanization]] is utilized to further increase efficiency. As populations grow, and [[mechanization]] is further refined, often to the level of [[automation]], many workers shift to expanding [[service industries]].

Industrial society makes [[urbanization]] desirable, in part so that workers can be closer to centers of production, and the [[service industry]] can provide labor to workers and those that benefit financially from them, in exchange for a piece of production profits with which they can buy goods. This leads to the rise of very large cities and surrounding [[suburb]]an areas with a high rate of [[economic activity]].

These [[urban area|urban centers]] require the input of external energy sources in order to overcome the [[diminishing returns]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arthur |first=Brian |title=Positive Feedbacks in the Economy |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=262 |pages=92–99 |date=February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; of agricultural consolidation, due partially to the lack of nearby [[arable land]], associated transportation and storage costs, and are otherwise unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McGranahan |first=Gordon |authorlink= |date=November 2003 |title=URBAN CENTERS: An Assessment of Sustainability |journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources |volume=28 |issue= |pages=243–274 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.28.050302.105541 |last2=Satterthwaite |first2=David }}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the reliable availability of the needed energy resources high priority in industrial government policies.

Some theoreticians (namely [[Ulrich Beck]], [[Anthony Giddens]], and [[Manuel Castells]]) argue that we are located in the middle of a transformation or transition from industrial societies to [[post-industrial society|post-industrial societies]]. The triggering technology for the change from an agricultural to an industrial organisation was [[steam power]], allowing [[mass production]] and reducing the agricultural work necessary. Thus, many industrial cities have been built around rivers. Identified as catalyst or trigger for the transition to post-modern or [[informational society]] is global [[information technology]].

Some, such as Theodore Kaczynski, have argued that an industrialized society leads to [[psychological pain]] and that citizens must actively work to return to a more primitive society. His essay, ''[[Industrial Society and Its Future]]'', describes different political factions and laments the direction of technology and the [[modern world]].

{{Postmodernism}}
'''Postmodernity''' ('''post-modernity''' or the '''postmodern condition''') is the economic or cultural state or condition of society which is said to exist ''after'' [[modernity]]. (In this context, "modern" is not used in the sense of "contemporary", but merely as a name for a specific period in history.) Some schools of thought hold that modernity ended in the late 20th century – in the 1980s or early 1990s – and that it was replaced by postmodernity, while others would extend modernity to cover the developments denoted by postmodernity, while some believe that modernity ended after World War II. The idea of the post-modern condition is sometimes characterised as a culture stripped of its capacity to function in any linear or autonomous state{{huh|date=August 2018}}&lt;!-- what is autonomous from what?--&gt; as opposed to the progressive mindstate of [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, ''Postmodernism'' (London 1991), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodernity can mean a personal response to a postmodern society, the conditions in a society which make it postmodern or the [[state of being]] that is associated with a postmodern society as well a historical epoch. In most contexts it should be distinguished from [[postmodernism]], the adoption of [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern philosophies]] or traits in art, literature, culture and society. In fact, today, historical perspectives on the developments of postmodern art (postmodernism) and postmodern society (postmodernity) can be best described as two umbrella terms for processes engaged in an ongoing dialectical relationship{{huh|date=August 2018}}, the result of which is the evolving culture of the contemporary world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nilges|first1=Mathias|title=The Presence of Postmodernism in Contemporary American Literature|journal=American Literary History|date=Spring 2015|volume=27|issue=1|pages=186–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of the term ==
''Postmodernity'' is the state or condition of being postmodern – after or in reaction to that which is modern, as in [[postmodern art]] (''see [[postmodernism]]''). [[Modernity]] is defined as a period or condition loosely identified with the Progressive Era, the [[Industrial Revolution]], or [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]]. In [[philosophy]] and [[critical theory]] ''postmodernity'' refers to the state or condition of society which is said to exist ''after'' [[modernity]], a historical condition that marks the reasons for the end of [[modernity]]. This usage is ascribed to the philosophers [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Jean Baudrillard]].

One "project" of modernity is said by [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]] to have been the fostering of progress by incorporating principles of [[rationality]] and [[hierarchy]] into public and artistic life. (See also [[postindustrial]], [[Information Age]].) Lyotard understood [[modernity]] as a cultural condition characterized by constant change in the pursuit of progress. Postmodernity then represents the culmination of this process where constant change has become the ''[[status quo]]'' and the notion of progress obsolete. Following [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s critique of the possibility of absolute and total knowledge, Lyotard further argued that the various [[metanarrative]]s of progress such as [[Positivism|positivist]] [[science]], [[Marxism]], and [[structuralism]] were defunct as methods of achieving progress.

The literary critic [[Fredric Jameson]] and the geographer [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] have identified postmodernity with "[[late capitalism]]" or "flexible accumulation", a stage of capitalism following [[finance capitalism]], characterised by highly mobile labor and capital and what Harvey called "time and space compression". They suggest that this coincides with the breakdown of the [[Bretton Woods system]] which, they believe, defined the economic order following the Second World War. (See also [[consumerism]], [[critical theory]].)

Those who generally view modernity as obsolete or an outright failure, a flaw in humanity's evolution leading to disasters like [[Auschwitz]] and [[Hiroshima]], see postmodernity as a positive development. Other philosophers, particularly those seeing themselves as within the modern project, see the state of postmodernity as a negative consequence of holding postmodernist ideas. For example, [[Jürgen Habermas]] and others contend that postmodernity represents a resurgence of long running [[counter-enlightenment]] ideas, that the modern project is not finished and that [[Universal (metaphysics)|universality]] cannot be so lightly dispensed with. Postmodernity, the consequence of holding postmodern ideas, is generally a negative term in this context.

==Postmodernism==
{{Main article|Postmodernism}}
Postmodernity is a condition or a state of being associated with changes to institutions and creations ([[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]], 1990) and with social and political results and innovations, globally but especially in the West since the 1950s, whereas [[postmodernism]] is an aesthetic, literary, political or social philosophy, the "cultural and intellectual phenomenon", especially since the 1920s' new movements in the arts. Both of these terms are used by philosophers, social scientists and social critics to refer to aspects of contemporary culture, economics and society that are the result of features of late 20th century and early 21st century life, including the fragmentation of authority and the [[commoditization]] of knowledge (''see'' "[[Modernity]]"). {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The relationship between postmodernity and critical theory, sociology and philosophy is fiercely contested. The terms "postmodernity" and "postmodernism" are often hard to distinguish, the former being often the result of the latter. The period has had diverse political ramifications: its "anti-ideological ideas" appear to have been associated with the [[feminist movement]], racial equality movements, [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movements]], most forms of late 20th century [[anarchism]] and even the [[peace movement]] as well as various hybrids of these in the current [[anti-globalization movement]]. Though none of these institutions entirely embraces all aspects of the postmodern movement in its most concentrated definition they all reflect, or borrow from, some of its core ideas. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

== History ==
Some authors, such as [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] and [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]], believe that modernity ended in the late 20th century and thus have defined a period subsequent to modernity, namely postmodernity, while others, such as [[Zygmunt Bauman|Bauman]] and [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]], would extend modernity to cover the developments denoted by postmodernity. Others still contend that modernity ended with the [[Victorian Age]] in the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = William D. | title = Black Intellectuals, Black Cognition, and a Black Aesthetic | publisher = Praeger | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-275-95542-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodernity has been said{{By whom|date=September 2009}} to have gone through two relatively distinct phases the first beginning in the late 1940s and 1950s and ending with the [[Cold War]] (when [[Analog signal|analog]] media with limited [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] encouraged a few, authoritative media channels) and the second beginning at the end of the Cold War (marked by the spread of cable television and "new media" based on [[Digital data|digital]] means of information dissemination and broadcast).

The first phase of postmodernity overlaps the end of [[modernity]] and is regarded by many{{By whom|date=September 2009|Whom}} as being part of the modern period ''(see [[lumpers/splitters]], [[periodization]])''. Television became the primary news source, manufacturing decreased in importance in the economies of Western Europe and the United States but trade volumes increased within the developed core. In 1967–1969 a crucial cultural explosion took place within the developed world as the [[baby boom]] generation, which had grown up with postmodernity as its fundamental experience of society, demanded entrance into the political, cultural and educational power structure. A series of demonstrations and acts of rebellion – ranging from nonviolent and cultural, through violent acts of terrorism – represented the opposition of the young to the policies and perspectives of the previous age. Opposition to the [[Algerian War]] and the [[Vietnam War]], to laws allowing or encouraging racial segregation and to laws which overtly discriminated against women and restricted access to [[divorce]], increased use of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[Psychedelic Drug|psychedelics]], the emergence of pop cultural styles of music and drama, including [[Rock and roll|rock music]] and the ubiquity of [[stereo]], television and [[radio]] helped make these changes visible in the broader cultural context. This period is associated with the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], a philosopher who focused on the results of living in a [[media culture]] and argued that participation in a mass media culture both overshadows actual content disseminated and is liberating because it loosens the authority of local social normative standards.

The second phase of postmodernity is defined {{By whom|date=December 2017}} by "[[digitality]]" – the increasing power of personal and [[Digital data|digital]] means of communication including fax machines, modems, cable and high speed internet, which has altered the condition of postmodernity dramatically: digital production of information allows individuals to manipulate virtually every aspect of the media environment. This has brought producers into conflict with consumers over [[intellectual capital]] and [[intellectual property]] and led to the creation of a [[new economy]] whose supporters argue that the dramatic fall in information costs will alter society fundamentally.

It began to be argued {{By whom|date=December 2017}} that digitality or what [[Esther Dyson]] referred to as "being digital" had emerged as a separate condition from postmodernity. Those holding this position argued that the ability to manipulate items of popular culture, the World Wide Web, the use of search engines to index knowledge, and telecommunications were producing a "convergence" which would be marked by the rise of "[[participatory culture]]" in the words of [[Henry Jenkins]] and the use of [[media device]]s, such as Apple's [[iPod]].

The simplest, but not necessarily most correct demarcation point of this era is {{according to whom|date = December 2017}} the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the liberalisation of China in 1991. [[Francis Fukuyama]] wrote "The End of History" in 1989 in anticipation of the fall of the Berlin wall. He predicted that the question of political philosophy had been answered, that large scale wars over fundamental values would no longer arise since "all prior contradictions are resolved and all human needs satisfied." This is a kind of 'endism' also taken up by [[Arthur Danto]] who in 1984 acclaimed that Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes asked the right question of art and hence art had ended.

=== Distinctions in philosophy and critical theory ===

The debate on postmodernity has two distinct elements that are often confused; (1) the nature of contemporary society and (2) the nature of the critique of contemporary society. The first of these elements is concerned with the nature of changes that took place during the late 20th century. There are three principal analyses. Theorists such as [[Callinicos]] (1991) and [[Craig Calhoun|Calhoun]] (1995) offer a conservative position on the nature of contemporary society, downplaying the significance and extent of socio-economic changes and emphasizing a continuity with the past. Second a range of theorists have tried to analyze the present as a development of the "modern" project into a second, distinct phase that is nevertheless still "modernity": this has been termed the "second" or "risk" society by [[Ulrich Beck]] (1986), "late" or "high" modernity by [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Giddens]] (1990, 1991), "liquid" modernity by [[Zygmunt Bauman]] (2000), and the "network" society by [[Manuel Castells|Castells]] (1996, 1997). Third are those who argue that contemporary society has moved into a literally post-modern phase distinct from modernity. The most prominent proponents of this position are [[Lyotard]] and [[Baudrillard]].

Another set of issues concerns the nature of critique, often replaying debates over (what can be crudely termed) [[Universality (philosophy)|universalism]] and [[relativism]], where modernism is seen to represent the former and postmodernity the latter. Seyla Benhabib (1995) and [[Judith Butler]] (1995) pursue this debate in relation to feminist politics, Benhabib arguing that postmodern critique comprises three main elements; an [[Anti-foundationalism|anti-foundationalist]] concept of the subject and identity, the [[The End of History and the Last Man|death of history]] and of notions of [[teleology]] and progress, and the death of [[metaphysics]] defined as the search for objective truth. Benhabib argues forcefully against these critical positions, holding that they undermine the bases upon which feminist politics can be founded, removing the possibility of agency, the sense of self-hood and the appropriation of women’s history in the name of an emancipated future. The denial of normative ideals removes the possibility for utopia, central for ethical thinking and democratic action.

Butler responds to Benhabib by arguing that her use of postmodernism is an expression of a wider paranoia over anti-foundationalist philosophy, in particular, [[poststructuralism]].

{{quote|A number of positions are ascribed to postmodernism – Discourse is all there is, as if discourse were some kind of monistic stuff out of which all things are composed; the subject is dead, I can never say “I” again; there is no reality, only representation.  These characterizations are variously imputed to postmodernism or poststructuralism, which are conflated with each other and sometimes conflated with deconstruction, and understood as an indiscriminate assemblage of French feminism, deconstruction, Lacanian psychoanalysis, Foucauldian analysis, Rorty’s conversationalism, and cultural studies ... In reality, these movements are opposed: Lacanian psychoanalysis in France positions itself officially against poststructuralism, that Foucauldian rarely relate to Derridideans ... Lyotard champions the term, but he cannot be made into the example of what all the rest of the purported postmodernists are doing.  Lyotard’s work is, for instance, seriously at odds with that of Derrida}}

Butler uses the debate over the nature of the post-modernist critique to demonstrate how philosophy is implicated in power relationships and defends poststructuralist critique by arguing that the critique of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] itself is the beginning of analysis, not the end,  because the first task of enquiry is the questioning of accepted "universal" and "objective" norms.

The Benhabib-Butler debate demonstrates that there is no simple definition of a postmodern theorist as the very definition of postmodernity itself is contested. [[Michel Foucault]] rejected the label of postmodernism explicitly in interviews yet is seen by many, such as Benhabib, as advocating a form of critique that is "postmodern" in that it breaks with utopian and transcendental "modern" critiques by calling universal norms of the Enlightenment into question. [[Giddens]] (1990) rejects this characterisation of "modern critique", pointing out that a critique of Enlightenment universals was central to philosophers of the modern period, most notably Nietzsche.

=== Postmodern society ===

[[Fredric Jameson|Jameson]] views a number of phenomena as distinguishing postmodernity from modernity. He speaks of "a new kind of [[superficiality]]" or "depthlessness" in which models that once explained people and things in terms of an "inside" and an "outside" (such as [[hermeneutics]], the [[dialectic]], [[Freud]]ian [[Psychological repression|repression]], the [[existentialist]] distinction between authenticity and inauthenticity, and the [[Sign (semiotics)|semiotic]] distinction of signifier and signified) have been rejected.

Second is a rejection of the modernist "[[Utopia]]n gesture", evident in Van Gogh, of the transformation through art of misery into beauty whereas in the postmodernism movement the object world has undergone a "fundamental mutation" so that it has "now become a set of texts or [[Simulacrum|simulacra]]" (Jameson 1993:38). Whereas modernist art sought to redeem and sacralize the world, to give life to world (we might say, following Graff, to give the world back the enchantment that science and the decline of religion had taken away from it), postmodernist art bestows upon the world a "deathly quality… whose glacéd X-ray elegance mortifies the reified eye of the viewer in a way that would seem to have nothing to do with death or the death obsession or the death anxiety on the level of content" (ibid.). Graff sees the origins of this transformative mission of art in an attempted substitution of art for religion in giving meaning to the world that the rise of science and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationality had removed – but in the postmodern period this is seen as futile.

The third feature of the postmodern age that Jameson identifies is the "waning of affect" – not that all [[emotion]] has disappeared from the postmodern age but that it lacks a particular kind of emotion such as that found in "[[Rimbaud]]'s magical flowers 'that look back at you'". He notes that "[[pastiche]] eclipses [[parody]]" as "the increasing unavailability of the personal style" leads to pastiche becoming a universal practice.

Jameson argues that distance "has been abolished" in postmodernity, that we "are submerged in its henceforth filled and suffused volumes to the point where our now postmodern bodies are bereft of spatial co-ordinates". This "new global space" constitutes postmodernity's "moment of truth". The various other features of the postmodern that he identifies "can all now be seen as themselves partial (yet constitutive) aspects of the same general spatial object". The postmodern era has seen a change in the [[Structural functionalism|social function]] of culture. He identifies culture in the modern age as having had a property of "semi-autonomy", with an "existence… above the practical world of the existent" but, in the postmodern age, culture has been deprived of this autonomy, the cultural has expanded to consume the entire social realm so that all becomes "cultural". "Critical distance", the assumption that culture can be positioned outside "the massive Being of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]" upon which left-wing theories of cultural politics are dependent, has become outmoded. The "prodigious new expansion of multinational capital ends up penetrating and colonizing those very pre-capitalist enclaves (Nature and the Unconscious) which offered extraterritorial and [[Archimedean property|Archimedean]] footholds for critical effectivity". (Jameson 1993:54)

=== Social sciences ===

[[History of sociology#20th Century: Critical theory, postmodernism, and positivist revival|Postmodern sociology]] can be said to focus on conditions of life which became increasingly prevalent in the late 20th century in the most industrialized nations, including the ubiquity of mass media and mass production, the rise of a global economy and a shift from manufacturing to [[service economy|service economies]]. Jameson and Harvey described it as [[consumerism]], where manufacturing, distribution and dissemination have become exceptionally inexpensive but social connectedness and community have become rarer. Other thinkers assert that postmodernity is the natural reaction to mass broadcasting in a society conditioned to mass production and mass politics. The work of [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] informs the versions of postmodernism elaborated by such authors as Murphy (2003) and Bielskis (2005), for whom MacIntyre's postmodern revision of [[Aristotelianism]] poses a challenge to the kind of consumerist ideology that now promotes capital accumulation.

The sociological view of postmodernity ascribes it to more rapid transportation, wider communication and the ability to abandon standardization of mass production, leading to a system which values a wider range of capital than previously and allows value to be stored in a greater variety of forms. Harvey argues that postmodernity is an escape from "[[Fordism]]", a term coined by [[Antonio Gramsci]] to describe the mode of industrial regulation and accumulation which prevailed during the Keynesian era of economic policy in OECD countries from the early 1930s to the 1970s. Fordism for Harvey is associated with Keynesianism in that the first concerns methods of production and capital-labor relations while the latter concerns economic policy and regulation. [[Post-fordism]] is therefore one of the basic aspects of postmodernity from Harvey's point of view.

[[Social artifact|Artifacts]] of postmodernity include the dominance of [[television]] and [[popular culture]], the wide accessibility of information and mass telecommunications. Postmodernity also exhibits a greater resistance to making sacrifices in the name of progress discernible in [[environmentalism]] and the growing importance of the [[anti-war]] movement. Postmodernity in the industrialised core is marked by increasing focus on [[civil rights]] and [[equal opportunity]] as well as movements such as [[feminism]] and [[multiculturalism]] and the backlash against these movements. The postmodern political sphere is marked by multiple arenas and possibilities of citizenship and [[political action]] concerning various forms of struggle against oppression or alienation (in collectives defined by sex or ethnicity) while the modernist political arena remains restricted to class struggle.

Theorists such as [[Michel Maffesoli]] believe that postmodernity is corroding the circumstances that provide for its subsistence and will eventually result in a decline of individualism and the birth of a new [[Neo-Tribalism|neo-Tribal]] era.

According to theories of postmodernity, [[economic]] and [[technological]] conditions of our age have given rise to a decentralized, media-dominated society in which ideas are only [[simulacra]], inter-referential representations and copies of each other with no real, original, stable or objective source of [[communication]] and meaning. [[Globalization]], brought on by innovations in [[communication]], [[manufacturing]] and [[transportation]], is often{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} cited as one force which has driven the decentralized modern life, creating a culturally pluralistic and interconnected global society lacking any single dominant center of political power, communication or intellectual production. The postmodernist view is that [[Intersubjectivity|inter-subjective]], not objective, knowledge will be the dominant form of [[discourse]] under such conditions and that ubiquity of dissemination fundamentally alters the relationship between reader and that which is read, between observer and the observed, between those who consume and those who produce.

In ''Spaces of Hope'' Harvey argues that postmodern political movements have been indirectly responsible for weakening class issues (in the Marxist sense) and the critical consciousness of this field of action which, in his opinion, is now more significant than during the Fordist period. For Harvey this [[class conflict]] is far from solved (something postmodern theorists ignore, according to his argument): globalization has made it more difficult for labour organisations to tackle underpaid work in poor conditions without labour rights and the amount of surplus value earned by corporations is far larger because of the differential between the high prices paid by western consumers and the low wages earned by south-east Asian labourers.

=== Postmodernity as a shift of epistemology ===
Another conceptualization has argued that postmodernity might be best described within the framework of epistemological [[paradigm shift|shifts]]. This argument presupposes that epistemological shifts occur as a result of changes in culture, society, and technology and suggests that the political, cultural, and technological changes of the 1960s and 1970s stimulated an epistemological shift from modernity to postmodernity. Or said differently, the ways in which people communicate, receive, and justify knowledge (i.e. epistemology) change and these changes are argued to broadly influence cultures, worldviews, and people groups.

== Criticisms ==
{{Main article|Criticism of postmodernism}}
Criticisms of the postmodern condition can broadly be put into four categories: criticisms of postmodernity from the perspective of those who reject [[modernism]] and its offshoots, criticisms from supporters of [[modernism]] who believe that postmodernity lacks crucial characteristics of the modern project, critics from within postmodernity who seek reform or change based on their understanding of [[postmodernism]], and those who believe that postmodernity is a passing, and not a growing, phase in social organization.

In literary and historical analysis, '''presentism''' is the [[anachronism|anachronistic]] introduction of present-day ideas and perspectives into depictions or interpretations of the past. Some modern historians seek to avoid presentism in their work because they consider it a form of [[cultural bias]], and believe it creates a distorted understanding of their subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/may-2002/against-presentism |author=[[Lynn_Hunt|Hunt, Lynn]]. |title=Against Presentism &amp;#124; AHA |publisher=''Historians.org,'' May 2002 |accessdate=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of presentism is regarded by some as a common fallacy in historical writing.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, David H. ''Historian's Fallacies,'' 1970, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives the first citation for ''presentism'' in its historiographic sense from 1916, and the word may have been used in this meaning as early as the 1870s. The historian [[David Hackett Fischer]] identifies presentism as a [[fallacy]] also known as the "fallacy of ''[[nunc pro tunc]]''". He has written that the "classic example" of presentism was the so-called "[[Whig history]]", in which certain 18th- and 19th-century British historians wrote history in a way that used the past to validate their own political beliefs. This interpretation was presentist because it did not depict the past in objective historical context but instead viewed history only through the lens of contemporary Whig beliefs. In this kind of approach, which emphasizes the relevance of history to the present, things that do not seem relevant receive little attention, which results in a misleading portrayal of the past. "Whig history" or "whiggishness" are often used as synonyms for ''presentism'' particularly when the historical depiction in question is [[teleology|teleological]] or [[triumphalism|triumphalist]].&lt;ref name="Fischer139"&gt;Fischer, David H. ''Historian's Fallacies,'' 1970, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological analysis==
Presentism has a shorter history in sociological analysis, where it has been used to describe [[technological determinism|technological determinists]] who interpret a change in behavior as starting with the introduction of a new technology. For example, scholars such as [[Frances Cairncross]] proclaimed that the Internet had led to "the death of distance", but most [[community]] ties and many business ties had been transcontinental and even intercontinental for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Barry. "Physical Place and Cyber Place: The Rise of Networked Individualism," ''International Journal of Urban and Regional Research'' '''25'''.2 (June, 2001): 227-52. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral judgments==
Presentism is also a factor in the problematic question of history and [[morality|moral]] judgments. Among historians, the orthodox view may be that reading modern notions of morality into the past is to commit the error of presentism. To avoid this, historians restrict themselves to describing what happened and attempt to refrain from using language that passes judgment. For example, when writing history about [[slavery]] in an era when the practice was widely accepted, letting that fact influence judgment about a group or individual would be presentist and thus should be avoided.

Critics respond that to avoid moral judgments is to practice [[moral relativism]], a controversial idea. Some religious historians argue that morality is timeless, having been established by God; they say it is not anachronistic to apply timeless standards to the past. (In this view, while [[mores]] may change, [[morality]] does not.)

Others argue that application of religious standards has varied over time as well. [[Saint Augustine]], for example, holds that there exist timeless moral principles, but contends that certain practices (such as [[polygamy]]) were acceptable in the past because they were customary but now are neither customary nor acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, Philip, and Henry Wace. ''A Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church'', Vol. III, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1908, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer, for his part, writes that while historians might not always manage to avoid the fallacy completely, they should at least try to be aware of their biases and write history in such a way that they do not create a distorted depiction of the past.&lt;ref name="Fischer139"/&gt;

{{broader|Pseudo-scholarship}}
'''Pseudohistory''' is a form of [[pseudoscholarship]] that attempts to distort or misrepresent the [[Recorded history|historical record]], often using methods resembling those used in legitimate [[History|historical research]]. Pseudohistory frequently presents a [[big lie]] or sensational claims about historical facts which require the [[Historical revisionism|revision]] (re-writing) of the historical record. The related term '''cryptohistory''' applied to a pseudohistory based upon or derived from the superstitions inherent to [[occultism]]. Pseudohistory is related to [[pseudoscience]] and [[pseudoarchaeology]] and usage of the terms may occasionally overlap.

==Definition and etymology==
The term ''pseudohistory'' was coined in the early nineteenth century, which makes the word older than the related terms ''[[wikt:pseudo-scholarship|pseudo-scholarship]]'' and ''[[wikt:pseudo-science|pseudoscience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
Monthly magazine and British register, Volume 55 (February 1823), [https://books.google.com/books?id=q00oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA449&amp;dq=pseudohistory&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Sh9ETLGJOJKTjAfV0PQV&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudo-history&amp;f=false p. 449],  in reference to John Galt, ''Ringan Gilhaize:  Or, The Covenanters'', Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1823.[https://books.google.com/books?id=7VYJAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In an attestation from 1815, it is used to refer to the ''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'', a purportedly historical narrative describing an entirely fictional contest between the Greek poets [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Elton, ''Remains of Hesiod the Ascraean'' 1815, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RcxfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR19&amp;dq=pseudohistory&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Sh9ETLGJOJKTjAfV0PQV&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudo-history&amp;f=false p. xix].&lt;/ref&gt; The pejorative sense of the term, labelling a flawed or disingenuous work of historiography, is found in another 1815 attestation.&lt;ref&gt;The Critical review: or, Annals of literature, Volume 1 ed. Tobias George Smollett, 1815, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EsUPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=pseudohistory&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Sh9ETLGJOJKTjAfV0PQV&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudo-history&amp;f=false p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudohistory is akin to pseudoscience in that both forms of falsification are achieved using the methodology that purports to, but does not, adhere to the established standards of research for the given field of intellectual enquiry to which the pseudoscience claims to be a part, and which offers little or no supporting evidence for its plausibility.&lt;ref name="Fritze"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fritze|first=Ronald H.|date=2009|title=Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-Religions|url=https://books.google.com/?id=l2BrqdFg5AkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Pseudohistory#v=onepage&amp;q=Pseudohistory&amp;f=falselocation=|location=London, England|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-430-4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–18}}

Writers [[Michael Shermer]] and [[Alex Grobman]] define pseudohistory as "the rewriting of the past for present personal or political purposes".&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shermer|first1=Michael|last2=Grobman|first2=Alex|title=Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uACijKy-cbgC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=Holocaust+denial+pseudohistory#v=onepage&amp;q=Holocaust%20denial%20pseudohistory&amp;f=false|location=Oakland, California|publisher=University of California Press|date=2009|isbn=978-0-520-26098-6|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Other writers take a broader definition; Douglas Allchin, a historian of science, contends that when the history of scientific discovery is presented in a simplified way, with drama exaggerated and scientists romanticized, this creates wrong stereotypes about how science works, and in fact constitutes pseudohistory, despite being based on real facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allchin|first=D.|date=2004|url=http://www.tc.umn.edu/~allch001/papers/pseudo.pdf|title=Pseudohistory and pseudoscience|volume=1|journal=Science &amp; Education|issue=13|pages=179–95|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[Robert Todd Carroll]] has developed a list of criteria to identify pseudo-historic works. He states that:
"Pseudohistory is purported history which:
* Treats myths, legends, sagas and similar literature as literal truth
* Is neither critical nor skeptical in its reading of ancient historians, taking their claims at face value and ignoring empirical or logical evidence contrary to the claims of the ancients
* Is on a mission, not a quest, seeking to support some contemporary political or religious agenda rather than find out the truth about the past
* Often denies that there is such a thing as historical truth, clinging to the extreme skeptical notion that only what is absolutely certain can be called 'true' and nothing is absolutely certain, so nothing is true
* Often maintains that history is nothing but mythmaking and that different histories are not to be compared on such traditional academic standards as accuracy, empirical probability, logical consistency, relevancy, completeness, fairness, honesty, etc., but on moral or political grounds
* Is selective in its use of ancient documents, citing favorably those that fit with its agenda, and ignoring or interpreting away those documents which don't fit
* Considers the possibility of something being true as sufficient to believe it is true if it fits with one's agenda
* Often maintains that there is a conspiracy to suppress its claims because of racism, atheism or ethnocentrism, or because of opposition to its political or religious agenda"&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Robert Todd. [http://www.skepdic.com/pseudohs.html ''The skeptic's dictionary'']. Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons (2003), p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] prefers the term "cryptohistory." He identifies two necessary elements as "A complete ignorance of the primary sources" and the repetition of "inaccuracies and wild claims".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224,225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, ''The Occult Roots of Nazism'', p. 225 (Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2005 edition). {{ISBN|978-1-86064-973-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common characteristics of pseudohistory are:
* The arbitrary linking of disparate events so as to form – in the theorist's opinion – a pattern.  This is typically then developed into a [[conspiracy theory]] postulating a hidden agent responsible for creating and maintaining the pattern. For example, the pseudohistorical ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' links the [[Knights Templar]], the medieval [[Holy Grail|Grail Romances]], the [[Merovingian]] Frankish dynasty and the artist [[Nicolas Poussin]] in an attempt to identify lineal descendants of Jesus.
* Hypothesising the consequences of unlikely events that "could" have happened, thereby assuming tacitly that they did.
* [[Sensationalism]], or [[shock value]]

==Categories and examples==
{{Further|Historical negationism|Pseudoarchaeology}}
The following are some common categories of pseudohistorical theory, with examples.  Note that not all theories in a listed category are necessarily pseudohistorical; they are rather categories which seem to attract pseudohistorians. 

===Ancient aliens, ancient technologies, and lost lands===
{{main|Ancient astronauts}}
[[File:ZECHARIA SITCHIN.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zechariah Sitchin]], an influential proponent of the [[ancient astronauts hypothesis]], posing with an enlarged photograph of a purported 6000-year-old [[cylinder seal]] impression]]
[[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s books ''[[Worlds in Collision]]'' (1950), ''[[Ages in Chaos]]'' (1952), and ''Earth in Upheaval'' (1955), which became "instant bestsellers",&lt;ref name="Fritze"/&gt; demonstrated that pseudohistory based on ancient mythology held potential for tremendous financial success&lt;ref name="Fritze"/&gt; and became models of success for future works in the genre.&lt;ref name="Fritze"/&gt;

In 1968, [[Erich von Däniken]] published ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', which claims that ancient visitors from outer space constructed the pyramids and other monuments. He has since published other books in which he makes similar claims. These claims have all been categorized as pseudohistory.&lt;ref name="Fritze"/&gt;{{rp|201}} Similarly, [[Zechariah Sitchin]] has published numerous books claiming that a race of extraterrestrial beings from the [[Nibiru cataclysm#Origins|Planet Nibiru]] known as the [[Anunnaki]] visited earth in ancient times in search of gold and genetically engineered humans to serve as their slaves. He claims that memories of these occurrences are recorded in [[Sumerian mythology]], as well as other mythologies all across the globe. These speculations have likewise been categorized as pseudohistory.&lt;ref name=heiser&gt;{{cite web|title=The Myth of a Sumerian 12th Planet|url=http://www.michaelsheiser.com/nibiru.pdf|author=Michael S. Heiser|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skepdic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/sitchin.html|title=Zecharia Sitchin and ''The Earth Chronicles''|last=Carroll|first=Robert T|date=1994–2009|work=The Skeptic's Dictionary|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient astronaut hypothesis was further popularized in the United States by the [[History (U.S. TV network)|History Channel]] television series ''[[Ancient Aliens]]''.&lt;ref name="Fritze2009"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/hsp/summary/v010/10.5.fritze.html|last=Fritze|first=Ronald H.|title=On the Perils and Pleasures of Confronting Pseudohistory|work=Historically Speaking|volume=10|number=5|date=November 2009|pages=2–5|issn=1941-4188}}&lt;/ref&gt; History professor [[Ronald H. Fritze]] observed that the pseudohistorical claims promoted by von Däniken and the ''Ancient Aliens'' program have a periodic popularity in the US:&lt;ref name=Fritze/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rorotoko/&gt; "In a pop culture with a short memory and a voracious appetite, aliens and pyramids and lost civilizations are recycled like fashions."&lt;ref name=Fritze/&gt;{{rp|201}}&lt;ref name=Rorotoko&gt;{{cite web|last=Fritze|first=Ronald|title=Ronald H.

The author [[Graham Hancock]] has sold over four million copies of books promoting the pseudohistorical thesis that all the major monuments of the ancient world, including [[Stonehenge]], the [[Egyptian pyramids]], and the [[moai]] of [[Easter Island]], were built by a single ancient supercivilization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheiko|first=Konstantin|date=2012|title=Nationalist Imaginings of the Russian Past: Anatolii Fomenko and the Rise of Alternative History in Post-Communist Russia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=74s0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=Graham+Hancock+Pseudohistory#v=onepage&amp;q=Graham%20Hancock%20Pseudohistory&amp;f=false|series=Soviet and Post-Soviet Politics and Society|location=Stuttgart, Germany|publisher=Ibidem-Verlag|volume=86|page=83|ref=harv|isbn=9783838259154}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Hancock claims thrived from 15,000 to 10,000 BC and possessed technological and scientific knowledge equal to or surpassing that of modern civilization.&lt;ref name=Fritze/&gt; He first advanced the full form of this argument in his 1995 bestseller ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'',&lt;ref name=Fritze/&gt; which won popular acclaim, but scholarly disdain.&lt;ref name=Fritze/&gt; [[Christopher Knight (author)|Christopher Knight]] has published numerous books, including ''[[Uriel's Machine]]'' (2000), expounding pseudohistorical assertions that ancient civilizations possessed technology far more advanced than the technology of today.&lt;ref&gt;Merriman, Nick, editor, ''Public Archaeology'', Routledge, 2004 p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tonkin, S., 2003, [http://www.astunit.com/astrocrud/uriel.htm Uriel's Machine – a Commentary on some of the Astronomical Assertions.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The comforts of unreason: the importance and relevance of alternative archaeology|editor-last=Merriman|editor-first=Nick|title=Public Archaeology|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London|date=2004|page=260|isbn=9780415258890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tonkin|first=Stephen|date=2003|url=http://astunit.com/astrocrud.php?topic=uriel|title=Uriel's Machine – a Commentary on some of the Astronomical Assertions|work=The Astronomical Unit|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim that a lost continent known as [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] once existed in the Pacific Ocean has likewise been categorized as pseudohistory.&lt;ref name="Fritze"/&gt;{{rp|11}}

===Antisemitic pseudohistory===
[[File:1934 Protocols Patriotic Pub.jpg|thumb|American edition of the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' from 1934]]
{{see also|Blood libel}}
''[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]'' is a fraudulent work purporting to show a historical conspiracy for world domination by Jews.&lt;ref name="ushmm.org"&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10007058 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'' "Protocols of the Elders of Zion", last updated 4 May 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; The work was conclusively proven to be a forgery in August 1921, when ''[[The Times]]'' revealed that extensive portions of the document were directly plagiarized from [[Maurice Joly]]'s 1864 satirical dialogue ''[[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Philip Graves| title = The truth about "The Protocols"| journal = The Times |date=August 16–18, 1921| location = London| url = https://archive.org/details/truthaboutthepro00londiala}}
&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Hermann Goedsche]]'s 1868 anti-Semitic novel ''Biarritz''.&lt;ref name = "translated97"&gt;{{Citation | last = Segel | first = Binjamin W | title = A Lie and a Libel: The History of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion | editor-link = Richard S.

The [[Khazar theory]] is an academic [[fringe theory]] which postulates that the bulk of European Jewry are of [[Central Asia]]n (Turkic) origin. In spite of [[genetic studies on Jews|mainstream academic consensus]], this theory has been promoted in [[Anti-Semitic]] and [[Anti-Zionist]] circles alike, arguing that Jews are an alien element both in Europe and in Palestine.

[[Holocaust denial]] and [[genocide denial]] in general are widely categorized as pseudohistory.&lt;ref name="Shermer"/&gt;{{rp|237}}&lt;ref name="Lipstadt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipstadt|first=Deborah E.|date=1994|title=Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory|location=New York City, New York|publisher=Plume|page=215|isbn=0-452-27274-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major proponents of Holocaust denial include [[David Irving]] and others, who argue that the [[Holocaust]], [[Holodomor]], [[Armenian genocide]], and other genocides did not occur, or were exaggerated greatly.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt"/&gt;

===Alternative chronologies===
An alternative [[chronology]] is a revised sequences of events, which deviates from the standard timeline of world history accepted by mainstream scholars. An example of an "alterative chronology" is [[Anatoly Fomenko]]'s [[New Chronology (Fomenko)|New Chronology]], which claims that recorded history actually began around the year 1000 AD and all events which allegedly occurred prior to that point either never really happened at all, or are simply inaccurate retellings of events that happened later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novikov|first=S. P.|title=Pseudohistory and pseudomathematics: fantasy in our life|journal=Russian Mathematical Surveys|year=2000|volume=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, slightly less extreme example, is the [[New Chronology (Rohl)|New Chronology]] of [[David Rohl]], which claims that the accepted timelines for ancient Egyptian and Israelite history are wrong.&lt;ref&gt;"In his book ''A Test of Time'' (1995), Rohl argues that the conventionally accepted dates for strata such as the Middle and Late Bronze Ages in Palestine are wrong" – in Daniel Jacobs, Shirley Eber, Francesca Silvani, ''Israel and The Palestinian Territories: The Rough Guide'', p. 424 (Rough Guides Ltd., 2nd revised edition, 1998). {{ISBN|978-1-85828-248-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical falsification===
[[File:Vortigern-Dragons.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|History of the Kings of Britain]]'', a scene from which is shown in this fifteenth-century illumination, was a popular work of pseudohistory during the [[Middle Ages]].]]

The book synthesises earlier Celtic mythical traditions to inflate the deeds of the mythical [[King Arthur]]. The contemporary historian [[William of Newburgh]] wrote around 1190 that "it is quite clear that everything this man wrote about Arthur and his successors, or indeed about his predecessors from [[Vortigern]] onwards, was made up, partly by himself and partly by others".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of the Kings of Britain|last=Thorpe|first=Lewis|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical revisionism===
The [[Shakespeare authorship question]] is a [[fringe theory]] which claims that the works attributed to [[William Shakespeare]] were actually written by someone other than William Shakespeare of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].&lt;ref&gt;Hope, Warren and Kim Holston. ''The Shakespeare Controversy'' (2009) 2nd ed., 3: "In short, this is a history written in opposition to the current prevailing view".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Lois. "Marlowe onstage" in ''Constructing Christopher Marlowe'', James Alan Downie and J. T. Parnell, eds. (2000, 2001), paperback ed., 88–101; 100: "The possibility that Shakespeare may not really be Shakespeare, comic in the context of literary history and pseudo-history, is understandable in this world of double-agents . . ."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aaronovitch, David. "The anti-Stratfordians" in ''Voodoo Histories'' (2010), 226–229: "There is, however, a psychological or anthropological question to be answered about our consumption of pseudo-history and pseudoscience. I have now plowed through enough of these books to be able to state that, as a genre, they are badly written and, in their anxiety to establish their dubious neo-scholarly credentials, incredibly tedious. . . . Why do we read bad history books that have the added lack of distinction of not being in any way true or useful . . ."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kathman, David. [http://shakespeareauthorship.com/harpers.html Shakespeare Authorship Page]: "... Shakespeare scholars regard Oxfordianism as pseudo-scholarship which arbitrarily discards the methods used by real historians. ... In order to support their beliefs, Oxfordians resort to a number of tactics which will be familiar to observers of other forms of pseudo-history and pseudo-science."&lt;/ref&gt; A similar revisionist fringe theory is the [[Christ myth theory]], which claims that [[Jesus]] of Nazareth never existed as a historical figure and that his existence was invented by early Christians. This argument currently finds very little support among scholars and historians of all faiths and has been described as pseudohistorical.&lt;ref name=Ehrman285&gt;In a 2011 review of the state of modern scholarship, [[Bart Ehrman]] (a secular agnostic) wrote: "He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees" B.

A large number of nationalist pseudohistorical theories deal with the legendary [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of ancient Israel.
