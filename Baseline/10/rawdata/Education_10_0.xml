A '''business–education partnership''' is involvement between schools and business-industry, [[Trade union|unions]], governments and community organizations. These partnerships are established by agreement between two or more parties to establish goals, and to construct a plan of action for achievement of those goals.

Business-education partnerships may involve entire school boards and hundreds of students. Others pair private partners with a single class or individual students. Business-education partnerships serve business and industry by providing activities such as in-service training to employees, use of facilities, student directed projects, software development or marketing research. They also serve to strengthen instruction in academic skills and to enrich the educational process through the talents and ideas of the personnel of participating businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=The Canadian Chamber of Commerce|year=1992|title=Focus 2000 Business-Education Partnerships: Your Planning Process Guide|pages=13 |publisher=CCH Canadian Limited|isbn=0-88796-831-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of business-education partnerships==
Frank and Smith (1997), have suggested four classifications for business-education partnerships based on the process the partnership employs.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Flo, and Anne Smith. The Partnership Handbook. Ottawa: Human Resources Development Canada, 2000. PDF accessed February 2007 {{ISBN|0-662-28881-5}}. [http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/MP43-373-1-2000E.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; They found that most business-education partnerships could be categorized into one of the four classifications.

*'''Consultative partnerships''' are for the purpose of receiving public input around change or to gather ideas for policies.
*'''Contributory partnerships''' are formed to benefit an organization or the community.
*'''Operational partnerships''' are work-sharing arrangements in which the components of a given task are delegated to specific parties.
*'''[[Collaborative partnerships]]''' are set up to share resources, risks and decision-making.

==Examples of business-education partnership activities==
There are hundreds of activities in which businesses and schools can engage.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Douglas. Partnerships Survey Report: Findings from the 1st Global Business-Education-Community Partnerships Issues and Trends Survey, The Conference Board of Canada, May 2003 p.10.{{cite web |url=http://www.conferenceboard.ca/topics/education/survey.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831070609/http://www.conferenceboard.ca/topics/education/survey.aspx |archivedate=2012-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These may include:
*Workshops, conferences, tours, exchange programs, classroom visits, assemblies, workplace visits, science fairs, guest speakers; seminars; presentations;
*Work experience programs, internships, tutoring, skills training, career development activities;
*Mentoring, job–shadowing, apprenticeship, and on–the job training;
*Recruiting, training, school to career information, guidance;
*Curriculum support, teacher development, teacher placements;
*Grants, scholarships, equipment, money, fund-raising; starting an education foundation;

==Achievements of a business-education partnership==
Partnerships with schools may: 
* improve the quality of the workplace, 
* provide employees with learning experiences and a new understanding of the educational system,
* provide opportunities for student's career exploration, 
* bring resources to enrich the curriculum, 
* ensure that school teaching is relevant to the skills required of industry,
* improve the education setting through upgrading facilities or equipment,
* integrate young people into the labour market by involving them in cooperative education experiences,
* connect schools with local businesses,
* assist with curriculum development, new learning opportunities and skill development,
* meet the labour market needs of business and industry.

==Building a business-education partnership==
It may involve:&lt;ref&gt;NCREL North Central Regional Educational Laboratory, Chapter 1: Building Collaborative Partnerships - How does a collaborative partnership plan for action?, U.S. Department of Education, April 1996 [http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/envrnmnt/css/ppt/chap1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* recognizing opportunities for change
* mobilizing people and resources to create changes
* developing a vision of long-term change
* seeking support and involvement from partners
* choosing an effective group of involved participants
* building trust among collaborators, and
* developing learning opportunities and benefits for all partners.

==Lessons learned: assessing the long-term impact of short-term results==
Donald M. Clark of The American Association for Career Education (AACE), concurs with the report to Congress on the implementation of the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994 that "more must be done to involve employers." He states that studies of "business-education partnerships" since the White House announcement in 1983 urging this type of connection between the two sectors, have consistently pointed out that they have had little, if any, impact on producing fundamental change in the educational system. More specifically, they rarely encompass attempts to affect the curriculum, the overall educational process, or the acquisition of basic skills. Nor have they significantly affected the dropout rate of participating students (Clark, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Donald M. (1996). Making a Difference in Industry-Education Cooperation. NAIEC Newsletter, XXXII:5, November–December 1996. [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/14/d4/1f.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The evidence of this growing disenchantment by business and industry was seen in the nationwide surveys of employers conducted by the National Center on the Education quality of the Workforce (EQW). The surveys revealed that most partnerships have diffuse and unquantifiable goals and most of the partnership activities are brief and episodic and involve low levels of investment; they seldom run long enough to make a long-term difference.

[[HRDC]]’s evaluation of programs for in-school youth, taken from its June 1997 final report on the Effectiveness of Employment-Related Programs for Youth: Lessons Learned from Past Experience sheds more light on the long-term impact of limited short-term results. This study found that the most effective programs for young people provide sustained adult contact. Results indicate that the most effective strategies for keeping young people in school are those that build bridges to the world of work while young people are still in school. The most effective strategies were found to combine a training component with strong links to the employer community, more formal training linked to on-the-job training and work experience, and job search assistance and transitional wage subsidies (HRDC June 1997).&lt;ref&gt;HRDC, 1997. ''[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110610071740/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/cs/sp/hrsdc/edd/reports/1997-000341/eerpy.pdf Effectiveness of Employment-Related Programs for Youth: Lessons Learned from Past Experience]'', SP-AH027E-06-97&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that co-operative education programs lead to improved employment outcomes in post-secondary school although the number of work experience placements offered by employers is quite limited. 
There are a number of concerns regarding the presence of corporations in the school. There is a fear that the active involvement of business will encourage governments to retreat from their role as the primary funders of education (Torjman, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Torjman, Sherri. (1998). ''[http://www.caledoninst.org/Publications/PDF/partners.pdf Partnerships: The Good, The Bad and The Uncertain]'', {{ISBN|9781894159081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues of corporate involvement in schools reveal disquieting implications of a corporate ideology and ethos entering the learning experience of our young people (Hill and McGowan, 1996).&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;Hill, Philip G., and McGowan, Brian. ''[http://www.oecta.on.ca/pdfs/corpinvolve.pdf Corporate Involvement in Ontario’s Catholic Schools] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114042231/http://www.oecta.on.ca/pdfs/corpinvolve.pdf |date=January 14, 2006 }}''. Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association, Institute for Catholic Education, {{ISBN|0-9699178-4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers are concerned that partnerships with corporations involved in military research and development send a clear message to students. The presence of military contractors in classrooms suggests that schools are not concerned with violence and oppression in the world (Hill and McGowan, 1996).&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; 
Some school boards have developed business-education guidelines which are intended to act as a code that partners can apply to regulate themselves throughout the duration of the partnership but according to the Conference Board of Canada, guidelines and codes of conduct differ significantly (Hill and McGowan, 1996).&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; A code of conduct serves as a screening process to ensure that only socially-responsible businesses are granted access to schools and the partnerships activities would be monitored by an external evaluation committee of parents, community members, teachers and business representatives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1565">In [[mathematics education]], '''concept image''' and '''concept definition''' are two ways of understanding a mathematical concept.

The terms were introduced by {{Harvtxt|Tall|Vinner|1981}}. They define a concept image as such:
:"We shall use the term ''concept image'' to describe the total cognitive structure that is associated with the concept, which includes all the mental pictures and associated properties and processes. It is built up over the years through experiences of all kinds, changing as the individual meets new stimuli and matures."{{sfn|Tall|Vinner|1981|p=152}}
A concept definition is similar to the usual notion of a [[definition]] in mathematics, with the distinction that it is personal to an individual:
:"a ''personal'' concept definition can differ from a ''formal'' concept definition, the latter being a concept definition which is accepted by the mathematical community at large."{{sfn|Tall|Vinner|1981|p=152}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26281">{{Critical pedagogy}}
'''Critical pedagogy''' is a [[philosophy of education]] and [[social movement]] that has developed and applied concepts from [[critical theory]] and related traditions to the field of [[education]] and the study of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kincheloe|first1=Joe|last2=Steinburg|first2=Shirley|year=1997|title=Changing Multiculturalism|publisher=Open University Press|location=[[Bristol, PA]]|page=24|quote="Critical pedagogy is the term used to describe what emerges when critical theory encounters education"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of critical pedagogy view teaching as an inherently [[political]] act, reject the neutrality of knowledge, and insist that issues of [[social justice]] and [[democracy]] itself are not distinct from acts of [[teaching]] and [[learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, H., 2007. Utopian thinking in dangerous times: Critical pedagogy and the project of educated hope. Utopian pedagogy: Radical experiments against neoliberal globalization, pp.25-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of critical pedagogy is [[emancipation]] from [[oppression]] through an awakening of the [[critical consciousness]], based on the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term  ''[[conscientização]]''. When achieved, critical consciousness encourages individuals to effect change in their world through [[Social criticism|social critique]] and [[Activism|political action]].

== Background ==
The concept of critical pedagogy can be traced back to [[Paulo Freire]]'s best-known 1968 work, ''[[The Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]''. Freire, a professor of [[history]] and the [[philosophy of education]] at the [[University of Recife]] in Brazil, sought in this and other works to develop a philosophy of adult education that demonstrated a solidarity with the poor in their common struggle to survive by engaging them in a dialogue of greater awareness and analysis. Although his family had suffered loss and hunger during the [[Great Depression]], the poor viewed him and his formerly middle-class family "as people from another world who happened to fall accidentally into their world".&lt;ref name="PO"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed|last=Freire|first=Paulo|publisher=The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc.|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8264-1276-8|location=New York, NY|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His intimate discovery of class and their borders "led, invariably, to Freire's radical rejection of a class-based society".&lt;ref name="PO" /&gt;

The influential works of [[Paulo Freire|Freire]] made him arguably the most celebrated critical educator. He seldom used the term "critical pedagogy" himself when describing this philosophy. His initial focus targeted adult [[literacy]] projects in Brazil and later was adapted to deal with a wide range of social and educational issues. Freire's pedagogy revolved around an anti-authoritarian and interactive approach aimed to examine issues of relational power for students and workers.&lt;ref name="PO" /&gt; The center of the curriculum used the fundamental goal based on social and political critiques of everyday life. Freire's praxis required implementation of a range of educational practices and processes with the goal of creating not only a better learning environment but also a better world. Freire himself maintained that this was not merely an educational technique but a way of living in our educative practice.&lt;ref name="PO" /&gt;

Freire endorses students' ability to think critically about their education situation; this way of thinking is thought by practitioners of critical pedagogy to allow them to "recognize connections between their individual problems and experiences and the social contexts in which they are embedded".&lt;ref name="Critical Pedagogy on the Web"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mingo.info-science.uiowa.edu/~stevens/critped/page1.htm | title = Critical Pedagogy on the Web | archive-url = https://archive.is/20030715084613/http://mingo.info-science.uiowa.edu/~stevens/critped/page1.htm | archive-date = 2003-07-15 | access-date = 2017-04-12 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing one's consciousness ("[[Critical consciousness|conscientization]]", "''conscientização"'') is then a needed first step of "[[Praxis (process)|praxis]]", which is defined as the power and know-how to take action against oppression while stressing the importance of liberating education. "Praxis involves engaging in a cycle of theory, application, evaluation, reflection, and then back to theory. Social transformation is the product of praxis at the collective level."&lt;ref name="Critical Pedagogy on the Web" /&gt;

Critical pedagogue [[Ira Shor]], who was mentored by and worked closely with Freire from 1980 until Freire's death in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.csi.cuny.edu/ira_shor.html|title=Ira Shor|website=English Department|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines critical pedagogy as:

{{quote|Habits of thought, reading, writing, and speaking which go beneath surface meaning, first impressions, dominant myths, official'' ''pronouncements, traditional clichés, received wisdom, and mere opinions, to understand the deep meaning, root causes, social'' ''context, ideology, and personal consequences of any action, event, object, process, organization, experience, text, subject'' ''matter, policy, mass media, or discourse. (''Empowering Education'', 129)}}

Critical pedagogy explores the dialogic relationships between teaching and learning. Its proponents claim that it is a continuous process of what they call "unlearning", "learning", and "relearning", "reflection", "evaluation", and the effect that these actions have on the students, in particular students whom they believe have been historically and continue to be disenfranchised by what they call "traditional schooling". {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The educational philosophy has since been developed by [[Henry Giroux]] and others since the 1980s as a [[praxis (process)|praxis]]-oriented "educational movement, guided by passion and principle, to help students develop [[critical consciousness|a consciousness]] of freedom, recognize authoritarian tendencies, and connect knowledge to power and the ability to take constructive action".&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, H. (October 27, 2010) "Lessons From Paulo Freire", ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]].'' Retrieved 10/20/10.&lt;/ref&gt; Freire wrote the introduction to his 1988 work, ''Teachers as Intellectuals: Toward a Critical Pedagogy of Learning.'' Another leading critical pedagogy theorist who Freire called his "intellectual cousin",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philcsc.wordpress.com/2016/01/09/foreword-to-peter-mclarens-pedagogy-of-insurrection/|title=Foreword to Peter McLaren's Pedagogy of Insurrection|last=philcsc|date=2016-01-09|website=philcsc.wordpress.com|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter McLaren]], wrote the foreword. McLaren and Giroux co-edited one book on critical pedagogy and co-authored another in the 1990s. Among its other leading figures in no particular order are [[bell hooks]] (Gloria Jean Watkins), [[Joe L. Kincheloe]], Patti Lather, [[Antonia Darder]], [[Gloria Ladson-Billings]], [[Peter McLaren]], [[Joe L. Kincheloe]], [[Khen Lampert]], [[Howard Zinn]], [[Donaldo Macedo]], Sandy Grande, [[Michael Apple]], and Stephanie Ledesma. Educationalists including [[Jonathan Kozol]] and [[Parker Palmer]] are sometimes included in this category. Other critical pedagogues known more for their [[Anti-schooling activism|Anti-schooling,]] [[unschooling]], or [[deschooling]] perspectives include [[Ivan Illich]], [[John Caldwell Holt|John Holt]], [[Ira Shor]], [[John Taylor Gatto]], and [[Matt Hern]].

Critical pedagogy has several other strands and foundations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kincheloe, Joe (2008) Critical Pedagogy Primer. New York: Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodern]], [[anti-racist]], [[feminist]], [[postcolonial]], and [[queer]] theories all play a role in further expanding and enriching Freire's original ideas about a critical pedagogy, shifting its main focus on social class to include issues pertaining to [[religion]], [[military rank|military identification]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], and age. Much of the work also draws on [[anarchism]], [[György Lukács]], [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[postcolonialism]], and the discourse theories of [[Edward Said]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] ([[rhizomatic learning]]) and [[Michel Foucault]]. ''[[Radical Teacher]]'' is a magazine dedicated to critical pedagogy and issues of interest to critical educators. Many contemporary critical pedagogues have embraced [[Postmodern philosophy|Postmodern]], [[non-essentialism|anti-essentialist]] perspectives of the individual, of language, and of power, "while at the same time retaining the [[Paulo Freire|Freirean]] emphasis on critique, disrupting oppressive regimes of power/knowledge, and social change".&lt;ref name="Critical Pedagogy on the Web" /&gt;

==Developments==
Like [[critical theory]] itself, the field of critical pedagogy continues to evolve.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Contemporary critical educators, such as [[bell hooks]] and [[Peter McLaren]], discuss in their criticisms the influence of many varied concerns, institutions, and social structures, "including globalization, the mass media, and race/spiritual relations", while citing reasons for resisting the possibilities to change.&lt;ref name="Critical Pedagogy on the Web" /&gt; McLaren has developed a social movement based version of critical pedagogy that he calls revolutionary critical pedagogy, emphasizing critical pedagogy as a social movement for the creation of a democratic socialist alternative to capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/mclaren/ | title=Peter McLaren, PhD &amp;#124; Professor, Distinguished Professor in Critical Studies; Co-Director, the Paulo Freire Democratic Project and International Ambassador for Global Ethics and Social Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCP"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/peter-mclaren-interview.html#.WDTetvkrLD4|title=Revolutionary Critical Pedagogy and the Struggle against Capital Today: An Interview with Peter McLaren I The Hampton Institute|website=www.hamptoninstitution.org|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe L. Kincheloe]] and Shirley R. Steinberg have created the Paulo and Nita Freire Project for International Critical Pedagogy at [[McGill University|McGill]] University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freireproject.org/|title=Freire Project - Critical Cultural, Community, and Media Activism|author=|date=|website=www.freireproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with Kincheloe and Steinberg's contributions to critical pedagogy, the project attempts to move the field to the next phase of its evolution. In this second phase, critical pedagogy seeks to become a worldwide, decolonizing movement dedicated to listening to and learning from diverse [[discourse]]s of people from around the planet. Kincheloe and Steinberg also embrace Indigenous knowledges in education as a way to expand critical pedagogy and to question educational hegemony. Joe L. Kincheloe, in expanding on the Freire's notion that a pursuit of social change alone could promote anti-intellectualism, promotes a more balanced approach to education than postmodernists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Quote|text=We cannot simply attempt to cultivate the intellect without changing the unjust social context in which such minds operate. Critical educators cannot just work to change the social order without helping to educate a knowledgeable and skillful group of students. Creating a just, progressive, creative, and democratic society demands both dimensions of this pedagogical progress.|sign=|source=}}

One of the major texts taking up the intersection between critical pedagogy and Indigenous knowledge(s) is Sandy Grande's, ''Red Pedagogy: Native American Social and Political Thought'' (Rowman and Littlefield, 2004). In agreement with this perspective, Four Arrows, aka Don Trent Jacobs, challenges the anthropocentrism of critical pedagogy and writes that to achieve its transformative goals there are other differences between Western and Indigenous worldview that must be considered.&lt;ref&gt;Kincheloe, J. &amp; Steinberg, S. (2008) Indigenous Knowledges in Education: Complexities, Dangers, and Profound Benefits in Ed Denzin, N. Handbook of Critical and Indigenous Methodologies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Four Arrows (2011) Differing Worldviews: Two Scholars Argue Cooperatively about Justice Education (Sense)&lt;/ref&gt; Approaching the intersection of Indigenous perspectives and pedagogy from another perspective, [[critical pedagogy of place]] examines the impacts of place.

=== In the classroom ===
[[Ira Shor]], a professor at the [[City University of New York]], provides for an example of how critical pedagogy is used in the classroom. He develops these themes in looking at the use of Freirean teaching methods in the context of the everyday life of classrooms, in particular, institutional settings. He suggests that the whole curriculum of the classroom must be re-examined and reconstructed. He favors a change of role of the student from object to active, critical subject. In doing so, he suggests that students undergo a struggle for ownership of themselves. He states that students have previously been lulled into a sense of complacency by the circumstances of everyday life and that through the processes of the classroom, they can begin to envision and strive for something different for themselves.

Of course, achieving such a goal is not automatic nor easy, as he suggests that the role of the teacher is critical to this process. Students need to be helped by teachers to separate themselves from unconditional acceptance of the conditions of their own existence. Once this separation is achieved, then students may be prepared for critical re-entry into an examination of everyday life. In a classroom environment that achieves such liberating intent, one of the potential outcomes is that the students themselves assume more responsibility for the class. Power is thus distributed amongst the group and the role of the teacher becomes much more mobile, not to mention more challenging. This encourages the growth of each student's intellectual character rather than a mere "mimicry of the professorial style."&lt;ref&gt;Shor, I. (1980). Critical Teaching and Everyday Life. Boston, Massachusetts: South End Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers, however, do not simply abdicate their authority in a [[Student-centred learning|student-centred]] classroom. In the later years of his life, Freire grew increasingly concerned with what he felt was a major misinterpretation of his work and insisted that teachers cannot deny their position of authority.

{{Quote|text=Critical teachers, therefore, must admit that they are in a position of authority and then demonstrate that authority in their actions in supports of students... [A]s teachers relinquish the authority of truth providers, they assume the mature authority of facilitators of student inquiry and problem-solving. In relation to such teacher authority, students gain their freedom--they gain the ability to become self-directed human beings capable of producing their own knowledge.|sign=[[Joe L. Kincheloe]]|source=[[Critical Pedagogy Primer]] p. 17}}

And due to the student-centeredness that critical pedagogy insists upon, there are inherent conflicts associated with the "large collections of top-down content standards in their disciplines".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Critical pedagogy advocates insist that teachers themselves are vital to the discussion about [[Standards-based education reform in the United States]] because a pedagogy that requires a student to learn or a teacher to teach externally imposed information exemplifies the [[banking model of education]] outlined by Freire where the structures of knowledge are left unexamined. To the critical pedagogue, the teaching act must incorporate social critique alongside the cultivation of intellect.

[[Joe L. Kincheloe]] argues that this is in direct opposition to the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] concept of [[positivism]], where "social actions should proceed with law-like predictability".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this philosophy, a teacher and their students would be served by [[Standards-based education reform in the United States|Standards-based education]] where there is "only be one correct way to teach" as "[e]veryone is assumed to be the same regardless of race, class, or gender".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Donald Schön]]'s concept of "indeterminate zones of practice" illustrates how any practice, especially ones with human subjects at their center, are infinitely complex and highly contested, which amplify the critical pedagogue's unwillingness to apply universal practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schon|first=Donald, A.|year=1995|title=The new scholarship requires a new epistemology|url=|journal=Change|volume=27|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[bell hooks]], who is greatly influenced by Freire, points out the importance of engaged pedagogy and the responsibility that teachers, as well as students, must have in the classroom:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/hooks.htm|title=bell hooks on education|author=|date=28 January 2013|website=infed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Teachers must be aware of themselves as practitioners and as human beings if they wish to teach students in a non-threatening, anti-discriminatory way. Self-actualisation should be the goal of the teacher as well as the students.}}

== Resistance from students ==
Students sometimes resist critical pedagogy. Student resistance to critical pedagogy can be attributed to a variety of reasons. Student objections may be due to ideological reasons, religious or moral convictions, fear of criticism, or discomfort with controversial issues. Kristen Seas argues: "Resistance in this context thus occurs when students are asked to shift not only their perspectives, but also their subjectivities as they accept or reject assumptions that contribute to the pedagogical arguments being constructed."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seas|first=Kristen|year=2006|title=Enthymematic Rhetoric and Student Resistance to Critical Pedagogies|jstor=20176747|journal=Rhetoric Review|volume=(25) 4|pages=429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Kopelson asserts that resistance to new information or [[Ideology|ideologies]], introduced in the classroom, is a natural response to persuasive messages that are unfamiliar.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Resistance is often, at the least, understandably protective: As anyone who can remember her or his own first uneasy encounters with particularly challenging new theories or theorists can attest, resistance serves to shield us from uncomfortable shifts or all-out upheavals in perception and understanding-shifts in perception which, if honored, force us to inhabit the world in fundamentally new and different ways.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kopelson|first=Karen|year=2003|title=Rhetoric on the edge of cunning: Or, the performance of neutrality (re) considered as a composition pedagogy for student resistance|jstor=3594203|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=|pages=119|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kristen Seas further explains: "Students [often] reject the teacher's message because they see it as coercive, they do not agree with it, or they feel excluded by it."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Karen Kopelson concludes "that many if not most students come to the university in order to gain access to and eventual enfranchisement in 'the establishment,' not to critique and reject its privileges."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  To overcome student resistance to critical pedagogy, teachers must enact strategic measures to help their students negotiate controversial topics.

== Critical pedagogy of teaching ==
The rapidly changing demographics of the classroom in the [[United States]] has resulted in an unprecedented amount of [[linguistic]] and [[cultural]] diversity. In order to respond to these changes, advocates of critical pedagogy call into question the focus on practical skills of teacher credential programs. "[T]his practical focus far too often occurs without examining teachers' own assumptions, values, and beliefs and how this ideological posture informs, often unconsciously, their perceptions and actions when working with linguistic-minority and other politically, socially, and economically subordinated students."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartolomé|first=Lilia|year=2004|title=Critical Pedagogy and Teacher Education: Radicalizing Prospective Teachers|url=http://www.teqjournal.org/backvols/2004/31_1/bartoleme.pmd.pdf|journal=Teacher Education Quarterly|volume=Winter|pages=97–122|via=teqjournal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As teaching is considered an inherently political act to the critical pedagogue, a more critical element of teacher education becomes addressing implicit biases (also known as [[implicit cognition]] or implicit stereotypes) that can subconsciously affect a teacher's perception of a student's ability to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/research/understanding-implicit-bias/|title=Understanding Implicit Bias|website=kirwaninstitute.osu.edu|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of critical pedagogy insist that teachers, then, must become learners alongside their students, as well as students ''of'' their students. They must become experts beyond their field of [[knowledge]], and immerse themselves in the [[culture]], customs, and lived experiences of the students they aim to teach.

== History ==
During South African [[apartheid]], legal [[racialization]] implemented by the regime drove members of the radical [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] Teachers' League of South Africa to employ critical pedagogy with a focus on nonracialism in Cape Town schools and prisons. Teachers collaborated loosely to subvert the racist curriculum and encourage critical examination of religious, military, political, and social circumstances in terms of spirit-friendly, humanist, and democratic ideologies. The efforts of such teachers are credited with having bolstered student resistance and activism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Criticism ==
Philosopher [[John Searle]] characterizes the goal of Giroux's form of critical pedagogy "to create political radicals", thus highlighting the antagonistic moral and political grounds of the ideals of citizenship and "public wisdom."&lt;ref name="Searle"&gt;Searle, John. (1990) ''The Storm Over the University'', ''The New York Review of Books'', December 6, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; These varying moral perspectives of what is "right" are to be found in what [[John Dewey]]&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1938). Experience and Education.&lt;/ref&gt; has referred to as the tensions between traditional and [[progressive education]]. Searle argues that critical pedagogy's objections to the [[Western canon]] are misplaced and/or disingenuous:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Precisely by inculcating a critical attitude, the "canon" served to demythologize the conventional pieties of the American bourgeoisie and provided the student with a perspective from which to critically analyze American culture and institutions. Ironically, the same tradition is now regarded as oppressive. The texts once served an unmasking function; now we are told that it is the texts which must be unmasked.&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maxine Hairston takes a hard line against critical pedagogy in the first year college composition classroom and argues, "everywhere I turn I find composition faculty, both leaders in the profession and new voices, asserting that they have not only the right, but the duty, to put ideology and radical politics at the center of their teaching."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hairston|first=Maxine|year=1992|title=Diversity, ideology, and teaching writing.|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=43 |issue=2|pages=179–193|doi=10.2307/357563|jstor=357563}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hairston further confers,

&lt;blockquote&gt;When classes focus on complex issues such as racial discrimination, economic injustices, and inequities of class and gender, they should be taught by qualified faculty who have the depth of information and historical competence that such critical social issues warrant. Our society's deep and tangled cultural conflicts can neither be explained nor resolved by simplistic ideological formulas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sharon O'Dair (2003) says that today compositionists "focus [...] almost exclusively on ideological matters",&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Dair|first=Sharon|year=2003|title=Class work: Site of egalitarian activism or site of embourgeoisement?|url=|journal=College English|volume=|pages=593–606|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further argues that this focus is at the expense of proficiency of student writing skills in the composition classroom.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; To this end, O'Dair explains that "recently advocated working-class pedagogies privilege activism over" language instruction."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Jeff Smith argues that students want to gain, rather than to critique, positions of privilege, as encouraged by critical pedagogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Smith|year=1997|title=Students' Goals, Gatekeeping, and Some Questions of Ethics|url=|journal=College English|volume=59|pages=299–320|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a wide variety of views in opposition to critical pedagogy in the first year composition classroom, these are but a few.

The '''Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System''' ('''IPEDS''') is a system of interrelated surveys conducted annually by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] (NCES), a part of the [[Institute for Education Sciences]] within the [[United States Department of Education]]. IPEDS consists of twelve interrelated survey components that are collected over three collection periods (Fall, Winter, and Spring) each year as described in the [http://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/ViewContent.aspx?contentId=15 Data Collection and Dissemination Cycle].  The completion of all IPEDS surveys is mandatory for all institutions that participate in, or are applicants for participation in, any federal financial assistance program authorized by Title IV of the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], as amended.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/aboutIPEDS/|title=The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System|website=Nces.ed.gov|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/ViewContent.aspx?contentId=18  Statutory Requirements For Reporting IPEDS Data]

The IPEDS program department of NCES was created in 1992 and began collecting data in 1993.

==IPEDS Use the Data Page==
The [http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/home/Usethedata/ Use the Data Page], formerly called the IPEDS Data Center, allows users to retrieve IPEDS data, including the ability to view trends on most frequently asked subject areas, retrieve data on a single institution, download or customize an institution's Data Feedback Report, compare institutions on a single variable, calculate descriptive statistics of an institution with or without a comparison institution, generate standard reports for an institution, download data files, and access other resources for data users. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/home/UseTheData/|title=The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System|website=Nces.ed.gov|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IPEDS Glossary==
The [https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/VisGlossaryAll.aspx IPEDS Glossary] provides definitions for postsecondary-related terms used in the collection and dissemination of IPEDS data.

==Data collected in IPEDS&lt;ref name="ed.gov"/&gt;==
IPEDS collects data on postsecondary education in the United States in the following areas: institutional characteristics, institutional prices, admissions, enrollment, student financial aid, degrees and certificates conferred, student persistence and success (retention rates, graduation rates, and outcome measures), institutional human resources, fiscal resources, and academic libraries.

===Institutional characteristics===
Institutional characteristics data are the foundation of the entire IPEDS system. These include basic institutional contact information, tuition and fees, room and board charges, control or affiliation, type of calendar system, levels of awards offered, types of programs, and admissions requirements.

===Institutional prices===
IPEDS collects institutional pricing data from institutions for full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students. This includes tuition and fee data as well as information on the estimated student budgets for students based on living situations (on-campus or off-campus).

===Admissions===

Basic information is collected from institutions that do not have an open-admissions policy on the undergraduate selection process for first-time, degree/certificate-seeking students. This includes information about admissions considerations, admissions yields, and SAT and ACT test scores.

===Enrollment===

Because enrollment patterns differ greatly among the various types of postsecondary institutions, there is a need for both different measures of enrollment and several indicators of access. In IPEDS, the following enrollment-related data are collected:
*Fall enrollment — Fall enrollment is the traditional measure of student access to higher education. Fall enrollment data can be looked at by race/ethnicity; gender; enrollment status (part-time or full-time); and or level of study (undergraduate or graduate).
*Residence of first-time students — Data on the number of first-time freshmen by state of residence, along with data on the number who graduated from high school the previous year, serve to monitor the flow of students across state lines and calculate college-going rates by state. These data are collected in even-numbered years.
*Age data — The age distribution of enrolled students offers insight into the relationship between the changing demographics of college-going cohorts and enrollment in different types of postsecondary institutions. They also permit detailed projections of enrollment by institutional type and by age. Because a student’s dependency status is strongly related to age, the data can be used to provide estimates of the number of independent and dependent students attending postsecondary institutions. These data are collected in odd-numbered years.
*Unduplicated 12-month head count — Enrollment figures based on the unduplicated head count of students enrolled over a 12-month period is particularly valuable for institutions that use non-traditional calendar systems and offer short-term programs. Because this enrollment measure encompasses an entire year, it provides a more complete picture of the number of students these schools serve.
*Instructional activity — Data on instructional activity is measured in total credit and/or contact hours delivered by institutions during a 12-month period.
*Total entering class — Data on the number of incoming students (students enrolling for the first time in a postsecondary institution versus students transferring in from another postsecondary institution) at an institution. This measure permits the calculation of the graduation rate cohort as a proportion of the total entering student body.

===Student financial aid===

IPEDS collects data on the number of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who receive different types of student financial aid, including grants and loans, from different sources at each institution. IPEDS also collects data to show the average dollar amount of aid received by these students. Finally, as a result of the Higher Education Act (1965), as amended, IPEDS collects data to calculate the average net price at each institution for the following two groups: (1) full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who receive grant and scholarship aid; and (2) full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who receive Title IV federal student aid.

===Degrees and certificates conferred (completions)===

IPEDS collects data on the number of students who complete a postsecondary education program by type of program and level of award (certificate or degree). Type of program is categorized according to the [[Classification of Instructional Programs]] (CIP), a detailed coding system for postsecondary instructional programs. These data provide information on the number and location of completers by field. Business and industry, the military, and other groups that need to recruit individuals with particular skills use these data extensively. The data also help satisfy the mandate in the [[Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act]] for information on completions in postsecondary career and technical education programs.

===Student persistence and success===

IPEDS collects two types of data to help track postsecondary student progress and success.
*First–Year Retention Rates — The first-year retention rate measures the percentage of first-year students who had persisted in or completed their educational program a year later. These data have been collected since 2003.
*Graduation Rates — Graduation rate data provide information on institutional productivity and help institutions comply with reporting requirements of the Student Right-to-Know Act.
*Outcome Measures - Starting with the 2015-16 collection, IPEDS collects information on the number of awards conferred and the enrollment status of four degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate student cohorts: 1) Full-time, first-time, 2) Part-time, first-time, 3) Full-time, non-first-time, and 4) Part-time, non-first-time. The reported data are for two points in time: 6-years and 8-years after a cohort enters an institution.

===Institutional resources===

IPEDS collects institutional data on human resources and finances.
*Human resources — Human resources data measure the number and type of staff supporting postsecondary education. Because staffing patterns vary greatly across postsecondary institutions, IPEDS measures human resources in three ways:
**Employees by assigned position — These data classify all employees by full- or part-time status, faculty status, and occupational activity.
**Salaries — These data include the number of full-time instructional faculty by rank, gender, and length of contract/teaching period; total salary outlay; and fringe benefits.
**Staff — These data include demographic and occupational characteristics for staff at institutions.
*Finances — Finance data includes institutional revenues by source, expenditures by category, and assets and liabilities. This information provides context for understanding the cost of providing postsecondary education. It is used to calculate the contribution of postsecondary education to the gross national product. IPEDS collects finance data conforming to the accounting standards that govern public and private institutions. Generally, private institutions use standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and public institutions use standards established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).
*Academic Libraries - Information on collections, expenditures, and services for libraries at degree-granting institutions. Data collected through the IPEDS system replaces the previous U.S. Census and NCES Academic Libraries Survey, which collected data from institutions every other even-number year and was not a mandatory collection.

==College Navigator==
College Navigator is a "''free consumer information tool designed to help students, parents, high school counselors, and others get information about over 7,500 postsecondary institutions in the United States - such as programs offered, retention and graduation rates, prices, aid available, degrees awarded, campus safety, and accreditation.''" Most of the data comes from IPEDS, although other data sources within the Department of Education are also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?cx=1|title=College Navigator - National Center for Education Statistics|website=Nces.ed.gov|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website went live in September 2007 as a replacement for College Opportunities On-line (COOL) and was named in a December issue of [[Money (magazine)|Money magazine]] that year as "the best first screen" for researching colleges.

==IPEDS Peer Analysis System==
The IPEDS Peer Analysis System (PAS), replaced by the IPEDS Data Center and then the Use the Data portal, is no longer online. However, it was once a tool that allowed a user to build a comparison list of colleges and/or universities and compare them to a linchpin school.  This data is downloadable into various formats.  Information that can be retrieved in this manner include:
(1) Institutional characteristics and student charges, (2) Enrollments, (3) Completions, (4) Graduation rates, (5) Student financial Aid, (6) Finance, (7) Faculty salaries, (8) Fall staff, (9)Employees by assigned position.

A similar tool to the PAS was the Dataset Cutting Tool (DCT), which was available around the same time as the PAS. However, DCT is outdated and is no longer available.

==Controversy surrounding "Unit Record" data reporting==

In March 2005 The [[US Department of Education]] released a study on the Feasibility of a Student Unit Record System Within the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System.  This Unit Record proposal met with immediate and vocal opposition from congressional leaders as well as colleges and universities.  The [[US Department of Education]] argued that the development of a national student unit record tracking system, with appropriate privacy safeguards, which collects, analyzes and uses [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] student progression data was a vital tool for accountability and policy-making.  This sparked an immediate reaction regarding the implications of what this means for Institutions of Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Unit Record reporting, as originally conceived, would require institutions that report to IPEDS to upload not summary data but rather to upload files that contain individual student records.  These files would contain a wide range of information on the student but would, most importantly, include the student's [[Social Security Number]].  Concerns were raised that attending even one course would mean you are added to a federal database for the rest of your life.  In a report issued in March 2006 by the [[US Department of Education]], [[Social Security Number]] was specifically excluded from the Unit Record upload data.  It has been suggested that SSN will still be collected but it will be done so by a third-party before it is uploaded to the IPEDS Unit Record Database.

===Huge IPEDS===
In January 2007 it had become clear that Unit Record reporting was on the upswing.  Some of the most vocal opposition was still coming from colleges/universities.  It was at this time that the notion of "Huge IPEDS" was floated by Mark S. Schneider, the Education Department’s commissioner for education statistics.  In a January 24, 2007, Federal Register notice, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) announced it is seeking comments on a set of proposed changes to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) for 2007-08 through 2009-10.  The first installment of Huge IPEDS (optional in 07-08, mandatory in 08-09) would include:
*Collect website addresses for admissions and financial aid offices, instead of phone numbers.
*Add item to collect an estimate of the number of full-time and part-time students enrolled exclusively in online or distance education, by level.
*Add the following question: Does your institution have an online application? If yes, provide URL. This link will be added to COOL.
*Add the following question: Does your institution have its transfer of credit policy posted online? If yes, provide URL. This link will be added to COOL.
*Does your institution use the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), Community College Survey of Student Engagement (CCSSE), Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA), National Measure of Academic Proficiency and Progress (MAPP), or Other assessment tools (please specify)? Yes/No for each. If yes, and if your institution makes the results available on your website, provide URL/s. These links will be added to COOL.

*Item in matrix format to collect information on accountability measures used by the institution, and scores. The matrix will have 3 columns: a column in which to write in the name of the accountability measures used by the institution, a column for the institution's score on that item, and a column for the data year for the score. Note: Once an institution adds a measure, the name of that measure will be added to a list which other institutions will be able to choose from, rather than having to write it in again.
*Collect more detailed student financial aid data. Currently, the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students receiving aid (fall or full-year cohort) and the average amount of aid received are collected for 4 aid categories: Federal grants, State grants, Institutional grants, and Loans. These categories will be expanded to the following list, and the number of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students receiving aid (fall or full-year cohort) and the average amount of aid received will be collected for each
*Collect additional information on aid recipients: 9-cell grid to collect numbers of students by dependency status (dependent, independent with dependents, independent without dependents) crossed by living arrangement (living on campus, living off campus without family, living off campus with family). For public institutions, this will be collected by in-district, in-state, and out-of-state status. This information will be posted on COOL.

'''  Personal development planning''' is the process of creating an [[action plan]] based on awareness, values, reflection, [[goal-setting]] and planning for [[personal development]] within the context of a [[career]], education, relationship or for [[self-improvement]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exceptionality Without Relapse|last=Chinoperekweyi|first=Justine|publisher=Notion Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-947752-78-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''PDP''' (personal development plan), also called an IDP (individual development plan) or a PEP (personal enterprise plan), usually includes a statement of one's [[aspiration (long-term hope) | aspiration]]s, strengths or competencies, education and training, and stages or steps to indicate how the plan is to be realized. Personal development plans may also include a statement of one's career and [[lifestyle (sociology) | lifestyle]] priorities, [[career positioning]], analysis of opportunities and risks, and alternative plans (Plan B), and a ''[[curriculum vitae]]'' (CV).

In higher education, personal development plans typically include a portfolio containing evidence of the skills gathered over a particular timeframe. It is presumed{{by whom?|date=August 2015}} in education that undertaking PDPs will assist in creating self-directed independent learners who are more likely to progress to higher levels of [[Educational attainment|academic attainment]]. [[Human-resource management]] also uses PDPs. 

Personal development plans are often{{quantify|date=August 2015}} a requirement for employee CVs. Employees who participate in [[business training]] are often asked{{by whom?|date=August 2015}} to complete a personal development plan.

An individual can often{{quantify|date=August 2016}} develop a five-year personal development plan to organize personal [[goal]]s and to make them achievable within a certain{{which?|date=August 2015}} time-period.

The '''School of Hard Knocks''' — or '''University of Hard Knocks''' — is an [[idiom]]atic phrase meaning the (sometimes painful) education one gets from life's usually negative experiences, often contrasted with [[formal education]]. The term is frequently misattributed to [[George Ade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=school+hard+knocks&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was actually coined by [[Elbert Hubbard]] in a piece he wrote on himself for [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=An Interesting Personality: Elbert Hubbard |magazine=[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|The Cosmopolitan]] |page=317 |date=January 1902 |volume=XXXII |issue=3 |last=Hubbard |first=Elbert |quote=''So that is how I got my education, such as it is. I am a graduate of the University of Hard Knox, and I've taken several postgraduate courses.'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcNZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA317&amp;lpg=PA317&amp;dq=Cosmopolitan+%22elbert+hubbard%22+%22university+of+hard+knocks%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=px6XaQ0Cp_&amp;sig=RqS4AaSfUPBoYw1IVVXwoFcNU8k&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Cosmopolitan%20%22elbert%20hubbard%22%20%22university%20of%20hard%20knocks%22&amp;f=false |archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/TheCosmopolitanNovember1901-April1902 |archivedate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Elbert Hubbard and his Critics |date=May 10, 1902 |page=638 |magazine=[[The Literary Digest]] |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/LiteraryDigest-1902may10-00638a02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=October 2017}}

It is a phrase which is most-typically used by a person to claim a level of [[wisdom]] imparted by life experience, which should be considered at least equal in merit to [[academic]] knowledge. It is a response that may be given when one is asked about his or her education, particularly if they do not have an extensive formal education but rather life experiences that should be valued instead. It may also be used facetiously, to suggest that formal education is not of practical value compared with "street" experience. In the [[UK]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the phrases "University of Life" and "School of Hard Knocks" may be used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=1293018 NZ Herald - David Hill: Struggling for right meaning]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, newspaperman [[James Franklin Comstock]] ("Jim" Comstock) founded the “University of Hard Knocks”, an honorary society with a mission to recognize people who have made a success of their life without the benefit of higher education. [[Alderson Broaddus College]] in [[Philippi, West Virginia]], USA, sponsored the organization, which moved its offices to the A-B campus in 1976. The society was dissolved in 2014.

{{Platonism}}
The '''Socratic method''', also known as '''maieutics''', '''method of elenchus''', '''elenctic method''', or '''Socratic debate''', is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate [[critical thinking]] and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions. It is a [[dialectic]]al method, involving a discussion in which the defense of one point of view is questioned; one participant may lead another to contradict themselves in some way, thus weakening the defender's point. This method is named after the [[Classical Greek philosophy|Classical Greek]] philosopher [[Socrates]] and is introduced by him in [[Plato]]'s [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]] as midwifery ([[wikt:maieutic|maieutics]]) because it is employed to bring out definitions implicit in the interlocutors' beliefs, or to help them further their understanding.

The Socratic method is a method of hypothesis elimination, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions. The Socratic method searches for general, commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other beliefs. The basic form is a series of [[question]]s formulated as tests of [[logic]] and fact intended to help a person or group discover their [[beliefs]] about some topic, exploring definitions or ''[[logoi]]'' (singular ''[[logos]]'') and seeking to characterize general characteristics shared by various particular instances.

==Development==
In the second half of the 5th century BC, [[sophists]] were teachers who specialized in using the tools of [[philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]] to entertain, impress, or persuade an audience to accept the speaker's point of view. Socrates promoted an alternative method of teaching which came to be called the Socratic method.

Socrates began to engage in such discussions with his fellow [[Athens|Athenians]] after his friend from youth, [[Chaerephon]], visited the [[Pythia|Oracle of Delphi]], which confirmed that no man in [[Greece]] was wiser than Socrates. Socrates saw this as a [[paradox]], and began using the Socratic method to answer his conundrum. [[Diogenes Laërtius]], however, wrote that [[Protagoras]] invented the “Socratic” method.&lt;ref&gt;Jarratt, Susan C. ''Rereading the Sophists: Classical Rhetoric Refigured''. Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991., p 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, Rosamond Kent, ''The Older Sophists'', Hackett Publishing Company ({{ISBN|0-87220-556-8}}), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] famously formalized the Socratic elenctic style in prose—presenting Socrates as the curious questioner of some prominent Athenian interlocutor—in some of his early [[dialogue]]s, such as ''[[Euthyphro]]'' and ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', and the method is most commonly found within the so-called "[[Socratic dialogue]]s", which generally portray Socrates engaging in the method and questioning his fellow citizens about moral and [[epistemology|epistemological]] issues. But in his later dialogues, such as [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]] or [[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]], Plato had a different method to philosophical discussions, namely [[dialectic]].

==Method==
'''Elenchus''' ({{lang-grc|ἔλεγχος|elengkhos|argument of disproof or refutation; cross-examining, testing, scrutiny esp. for purposes of refutation}}&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Scott and Jones, ''Greek-English Lexicon'', 9th Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the central technique of the Socratic method. The Latin form ''elenchus'' (plural ''elenchi'') is used in English as the technical philosophical term.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World College Dictionary'', 4th Edition; ''Oxford English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common adjectival form in English is ''elenctic''; ''elenchic'' and ''elenchtic'' are also current.

In Plato's early dialogues, the elenchus is the technique Socrates uses to investigate, for example, the nature or definition of ethical concepts such as justice or virtue. According to Vlastos,&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Vlastos, 'The Socratic Elenchus', ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy I'', Oxford 1983, 27–58.&lt;/ref&gt; it has the following steps:

# Socrates' [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] asserts a thesis, for example "Courage is endurance of the soul", which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation.
# Socrates secures his interlocutor's agreement to further premises, for example "Courage is a fine thing" and "Ignorant endurance is not a fine thing".
# Socrates then argues, and the interlocutor agrees, that these further premises imply the contrary of the original thesis; in this case, it leads to: "courage is not endurance of the soul".
# Socrates then claims that he has shown that his interlocutor's thesis is false and that its negation is true.

One elenctic examination can lead to a new, more refined, examination of the concept being considered, in this case it invites an examination of the claim: "Courage is ''wise'' endurance of the soul". Most Socratic inquiries consist of a series of elenchi and typically end in puzzlement known as ''[[aporia]]''.

Frede&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frede, "Plato's Arguments and the Dialogue Form", ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'', Supplementary Volume 1992, Oxford 1992, 201–19.&lt;/ref&gt; points out that Vlastos' conclusion in step #4 above makes nonsense of the [[aporetic]] nature of the early dialogues. Having shown that a proposed thesis is false is insufficient to conclude that some other competing thesis must be true. Rather, the interlocutors have reached [[aporia]], an improved state of still not knowing what to say about the subject under discussion.

The exact nature of the elenchus is subject to a great deal of debate, in particular concerning whether it is a positive method, leading to knowledge, or a negative method used solely to refute false claims to knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Salkever, [http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1992/03.05.09.html "Methods of Interpreting Plato and his Dialogues"] ([[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. K. C. Guthrie]] in ''The Greek Philosophers'' sees it as an error to regard the Socratic method as a means by which one seeks the answer to a problem, or knowledge. Guthrie claims that the Socratic method actually aims to demonstrate one's ignorance. Socrates, unlike the [[Sophists]], did believe that knowledge was possible, but believed that the first step to knowledge was recognition of one's ignorance. Guthrie writes, "[Socrates] was accustomed to say that he did not himself know anything, and that the only way in which he was wiser than other men was that he was conscious of his own ignorance, while they were not. The essence of the Socratic method is to convince the interlocutor that whereas he thought he knew something, in fact he does not."{pg 74}

==Application==

Socrates generally applied his method of examination to concepts that seem to lack any concrete definition; e.g., the key moral concepts at the time, the [[virtue]]s of [[piety]], [[wisdom]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[courage]], and [[justice]]. Such an examination challenged the implicit moral beliefs of the interlocutors, bringing out inadequacies and inconsistencies in their beliefs, and usually resulting in [[aporia]]. In view of such inadequacies, Socrates himself professed his ignorance, but others still claimed to have knowledge. Socrates believed that his awareness of his ignorance made him wiser than those who, though ignorant, still claimed knowledge. While this belief seems paradoxical at first glance, it in fact allowed Socrates to discover his own errors where others might assume they were correct. This claim was known by the anecdote of the Delphic oracular pronouncement that Socrates was the wisest of all men. (Or, rather, that no man was wiser than Socrates.)

Socrates used this claim of wisdom as the basis of his moral exhortation. Accordingly, he claimed that the chief goodness consists in the caring of the soul concerned with moral truth and moral understanding, that "wealth does not bring goodness, but goodness brings wealth and every other blessing, both to the individual and to the state", and that "life without examination [dialogue] is not worth living". It is with this in mind that the Socratic method is employed.

The motive for the modern usage of this method and Socrates' use are not necessarily equivalent. Socrates rarely used the method to actually develop consistent theories, instead using [[mythology|myth]] to explain them. The [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides dialogue]] shows [[Parmenides]] using the Socratic method to point out the flaws in the Platonic [[Theory of Forms|theory of the Forms]], as presented by Socrates; it is not the only dialogue in which theories normally expounded by Plato/Socrates are broken down through dialectic. Instead of arriving at answers, the method was used to break down the theories we hold, to go "beyond" the axioms and postulates we take for granted. Therefore, myth and the Socratic method are not meant by Plato to be incompatible; they have different purposes, and are often described as the "left hand" and "right hand" paths to good and wisdom.

===Socratic Circles===

A '''Socratic Circle''' (also known as a '''Socratic Seminar''') is a pedagogical approach based on the Socratic method and uses a [[dialogic]] approach to understand information in a text. Its systematic procedure is used to examine a text through questions and answers founded on the beliefs that all new knowledge is connected to prior knowledge, that all thinking comes from asking questions, and that asking one question should lead to asking further questions.&lt;ref name=Copeland&gt;{{cite book|last=Copeland|first=Matt|title=Socratic Circles: Fostering Critical and Creative Thinking in Middle and High School|year=2010|publisher=Stenhouse|location=Portland, MN}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Socratic Circle is not a debate. The goal of this activity is to have participants work together to construct meaning and arrive at an answer, not for one student or one group to “win the argument”.&lt;ref name=Litunes&gt;{{cite web|title=The Socratic Circle|url=http://www.corndancer.com/tunes/tunes_print/soccirc.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach is based on the belief that participants seek and gain deeper understanding of concepts in the text through thoughtful dialogue rather than memorizing information that has been provided for them.&lt;ref name=Litunes /&gt; While Socratic Circles can differ in structure, and even in name, they typically involve the following components: a passage of text that students must read beforehand and two concentric circles of students: an outer circle and an inner circle. The inner circle focuses on exploring and analysing the text through the act of questioning and answering. During this phase, the outer circle remains silent. Students in the outer circle are much like scientific observers watching and listening to the conversation of the inner circle. When the text has been fully discussed and the inner circle is finished talking, the outer circle provides feedback on the dialogue that took place. This process alternates with the inner circle students going to the outer circle for the next meeting and vice versa. The length of this process varies depending on the text used for the discussion. The teacher may decide to alternate groups within one meeting, or they may alternate at each separate meeting.&lt;ref name=Copeland /&gt;&lt;ref name=Furman&gt;{{cite web|title=Furman: Socratic Seminar|url=http://furman.weebly.com/uploads/5/1/7/6/5176248/socratic_seminar_-_guidance_from_avid.pdf|accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant difference between this activity and most typical classroom activities involves the role of the teacher. In Socratic Circles the students lead the discussion and questioning. The teacher's role is to ensure the discussion advances regardless of the particular direction the discussion takes.&lt;ref name=Copeland /&gt;&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;

====Various approaches to Socratic Circles====

Teachers use Socratic Circles in different ways. The structure it takes may look different in each classroom. While this is not an exhaustive list, teachers may use one of the following structures to administer Socratic Seminar:

# '''Inner/outer circle or fishbowl''': Students need to be arranged in inner and outer circles. The inner circle engages in discussion about the text. The outer circle observes the inner circle, while taking notes. The outer circle shares their [[observations]] and questions the inner circle with guidance from the teacher/facilitator. Students use constructive [[criticism]] as opposed to making judgements. The students on the outside keep track of topics they would like to discuss as part of the debrief. Participants of the outer circle can use an observation checklist or notes form to monitor the participants in the inner circle. These tools will provide structure for listening and give the outside members specific details to discuss later in the seminar.&lt;ref name=Copeland/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt; The teacher may also sit in the circle but at the same height as the students.&lt;ref name=Chowning&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ting Chowning|first=Jeanne|title=Socratic Seminars in Science Class|journal=[[The Science Teacher]] | publisher = [[National Science Teachers Association]]|date=October 2009|volume=76|issue=7|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Triad''': Students are arranged so that each participant (called a “pilot”) in the inner circle has two “co-pilots” sitting behind them on either side. Pilots are the speakers because they are in the inner circle; co-pilots are in the outer circle and only speak during consultation. The seminar proceeds as any other seminar. At a point in the seminar, the [[facilitator]] pauses the discussion and instructs the triad to talk to each other. Conversation will be about topics that need more in-depth discussion or a question posed by the leader. Sometimes triads will be asked by the facilitator to come up with a new question. Any time during a triad conversation, group members can switch seats and one of the co-pilots can sit in the pilot’s seat. Only during that time is the switching of seats allowed. This structure allows for students to speak, who may not yet have the confidence to speak in the large group. This type of seminar involves all students instead of just the students in the inner and outer circles.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;
# '''Simultaneous seminars''': Students are arranged in multiple small groups and placed as far as possible from each other. Following the guidelines of the Socratic Seminar, students engage in small group discussions. Simultaneous seminars are typically done with experienced students who need little guidance and can engage in a discussion without assistance from a teacher/facilitator. According to the literature, this type of seminar is beneficial for teachers who want students to explore a variety of texts around a main issue or topic. Each small group may have a different text to read/view and discuss. A larger Socratic Seminar can then occur as a discussion about how each text corresponds with one another. Simultaneous Seminars can also be used for a particularly difficult text. Students can work through different issues and key passages from the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gose|first=Michael|title=When Socratic Dialogue is Flagging: Questions and Strategies for Engaging Students|journal=College Teaching|date=January 2009|volume=57|issue=1|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No matter what structure the teacher employs, the basic premise of the seminar/circles is to turn partial control and direction of the classroom over to the students. The seminars encourage students to work together, creating meaning from the text and to stay away from trying to find a correct interpretation. The emphasis is on critical and creative thinking.&lt;ref name=Copeland /&gt;

====Text selection====

;Socratic Circle texts

A Socratic Circle text is a tangible document that creates a thought-provoking discussion.&lt;ref name=NPC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Paideia Seminar: active thinking through dialogue centre. 3.4 Planning step 3: Select text|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/paideia/6901|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The text ought to be appropriate for the participants' current level of intellectual and social development.&lt;ref name=Chorzempa&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chorzempa|first=Barbara|author2=Lapidus, Laurie |title=To Find Yourself, Think For Yourself|journal=Teaching Exceptional Children|date=January 2009|volume=41|issue=3|pages=54–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides the anchor for dialogue whereby the [[facilitator]] can bring the participants back to the text if they begin to digress. Furthermore, the seminar text enables the participants to create a level playing field – ensuring that the dialogical tone within the classroom remains consistent and pure to the subject or topic at hand.&lt;ref name=NPC /&gt; Some practitioners argue that "texts" do not have to be confined to printed texts, but can include artifacts such as objects, physical spaces, and the like.

'''Pertinent elements of an effective Socratic text'''

Socratic seminar texts are able to challenge participants’ thinking skills by having these characteristics:

#Ideas and values
#Complexity and challenge
#Relevance to participants' curriculum
#[[Ambiguity]]

1. '''Ideas and values''' -
The text must introduce ideas and values that are complex and difficult to summarize.&lt;ref name=NPC /&gt; Powerful discussions arise from personal connections to abstract ideas and from implications to personal values.

2. '''Complexity and challenge''' -
The text must be rich in ideas and complexity &lt;ref name=Furman /&gt; and open to interpretation.&lt;ref name=Mangrum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mangrum|first=Jennifer|title=Sharing Practice Through Socratic Seminars|journal=Kappan|date=April 2010|volume=91|issue=7|pages=40–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally it should require multiple readings,&lt;ref name=FHO&gt;{{cite web|title=Facing History and Ourselves: Socratic Seminar|url=http://www.facinghistory.org/resources/strategies/socratic-seminar|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but should be neither far above the participants' intellectual level nor very long.

3. '''Relevance to participants and curriculum''' -
An effective text has identifiable themes that are recognizable and pertinent to the lives of the participants.&lt;ref name=Chorzempa /&gt; Themes in the text should relate to the curriculum.

4. '''Ambiguity''' -
The text must be approachable from a variety of different perspectives, including perspectives that seem mutually exclusive, thus provoking critical thinking and raising important questions. The absence of right and wrong answers promotes a variety of discussion and encourages individual contributions.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;&lt;ref name=FHO /&gt;

'''Two different ways to select a text'''

Socratic texts can be divided into two main categories:

1. Print texts (e.g. short stories, poems, and essays) and non-print texts (e.g. photographs, sculptures, and maps); and

2. Subject area, which can draw from print or non-print artifacts. As examples, language arts can be approached through poems, history through written or oral historical speeches, science through policies on environmental issues, math through mathematical proofs, health through nutrition labels, and physical education through fitness guidelines.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;&lt;ref name=NPC /&gt;

====Questioning methods in Socratic Circles====

Socratic Circles are based upon the interaction of peers. The focus is to explore multiple perspectives on a given issue or topic. [[Socratic questioning]] is used to help students apply the activity to their learning. The [[pedagogy]] of Socratic questions is open-ended, focusing on broad, general ideas rather than specific, factual information.&lt;ref name=Copeland /&gt; The questioning technique emphasizes a level of questioning and thinking where there is no single right answer.

Socratic circles generally start with an open-ended question proposed either by the leader or by another participant.&lt;ref name=Chorzempa /&gt; There is no designated first speaker; as individuals participate in Socratic circles, they gain [[experience]] that enables them to be effective in this role of initial questioner.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;

The leader keeps the topic focused by asking a variety of questions about the text itself, as well as questions to help clarify positions when arguments become confused. The leader also seeks to coax reluctant participants into the discussion, and to limit contributions from those who tend to dominate.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt; She or he prompts participants to elaborate on their responses and to build on what others have said. The leader guides participants to deepen, clarify, and paraphrase, and to synthesize a variety of different views.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;

The participants share the responsibility with the leader to maintain the quality of the Socratic circle. They listen actively in order to respond effectively to what others have contributed. This teaches the participants to think and speak persuasively using the discussion to support their position.&lt;ref name=Copeland /&gt; Participants must demonstrate respect for different ideas, thoughts and values, and must not interrupt each other.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;

Questions can be created individually or in small groups.&lt;ref name=Mangrum /&gt; All participants are given the opportunity to take part in the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gose|first=Michael|title=When Socratic Dialogue Is Flagging; Questions and Strategies for Engaging Students|journal=College Teaching|year=2009|volume=57|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socratic Circles specify three types of questions to prepare:

#Opening questions generate discussion at the beginning of the seminar in order to elicit dominant themes.&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mangrum /&gt;
#Guiding questions help deepen and elaborate the discussion, keeping contributions on topic and encouraging a positive atmosphere and consideration for others.
#Closing questions lead participants to summarize their thoughts and learning&lt;ref name=Furman /&gt; and personalize what they’ve discussed.&lt;ref name=Mangrum /&gt;

===Psychotherapy===
The Socratic method, in the form of [[Socratic questioning]], has been adapted for psychotherapy, most prominently in [[Classical Adlerian psychotherapy]], [[Logotherapy]],&lt;ref&gt;Lukas, Elisabeth, Logotherapy Textbook, 2000, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy]], [[Cognitive Therapy]]{{sfn|Overholser|1993|p=75–85}}{{sfn|Overholser|1993|p=286-293}}{{sfn|Overholser|1993|p=283-292}} and [[Reality Therapy]]. It can be used to clarify meaning, feeling, and consequences, as well as to gradually unfold insight, or explore alternative actions.

The Socratic method has also recently inspired a new form of applied philosophy: [[socratic dialogue]], also called [[philosophical counseling]]. In Europe [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] is probably the best known practitioner, and [[Michel Weber]] has also proposed another variant of the practice.

Many scholars and policymakers have noted that the fields of [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM) have remained predominantly male with historically low participation among [[Woman|women]] since their origins during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

Scholars are exploring the various reasons for the continued existence of this [[gender]] disparity in STEM fields. Those who view this disparity as resulting from [[discrimination|discriminatory]] forces are also seeking ways to redress this disparity within STEM fields (these typically construed as well-compensated, high-status professions with universal career appeal).&lt;ref&gt;Gürer, Denise and Camp, Tracy (2001).

Studies suggest that many factors contribute to the attitudes towards the achievement of young women in [[mathematics]] and [[science]], including encouragement from parents, interactions with mathematics and science teachers, curriculum content, hands-on laboratory experiences, high school achievement in mathematics and science, and resources available at home.&lt;ref name="Lost Talent"&gt;S.L. Hanson, "Lost Talent, Women in the Sciences", Philadelphia, PA.: Temple University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], research findings are mixed concerning when boys' and girls' attitudes about mathematics and science diverge. Analyzing several nationally representative [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]], one researcher found few differences in girls' and boys' attitudes towards science in the early secondary school years.&lt;ref name="Lost Talent"/&gt; Students' aspirations to pursue careers in mathematics and science influence both the courses they choose to take in those areas and the level of effort they put forth in these courses.

A 1996 study suggested girls begin to lose self-confidence in middle school because they believe that men possess more intelligence in technological fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pajares | first1 = F | year = 1996 | title = Self-efficacy beliefs and mathematical problem-solving of gifted students | url = | journal = [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]] | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 325–44 | doi=10.1006/ceps.1996.0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that men outperform women in spatial analysis, a skillset many engineering professionals deem vital, generates this misconception.&lt;ref name="CeciWilliams2009" /&gt; Feminist scholars postulate that boys are more likely to gain spatial skills outside the classroom because they are culturally encouraged to build and work with their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Catherine, and Christianne Corbett.

A 1996 study of college freshmen by the [[Higher Education Research Institute]] shows that men and women differ greatly in their intended fields of study. Of first-time college freshmen in 1996, 20 percent of men and 4 percent of women planned to major in [[computer science]] and [[engineering]], while similar percentages of men and women planned to major in [[biology]] or [[Physical Sciences|physical sciences]]. The differences in the intended majors between male and female first-time freshmen directly relate to the differences in the fields in which men and women earn their degree. At the post-secondary level, women are less likely than men to earn a degree in mathematics, physical sciences, or computer sciences and engineering. The exception to this gender imbalance is in the field of [[Life-science|life science]].&lt;ref name="Freshman"&gt;Higher Education Research Institute, Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, The American Freshman: National Norms for Fall 1996, University of California, Los Angeles, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of underrepresentation of women in STEM careers ===
In [[Scotland]], a large number of women graduate in STEM subjects but fail to move onto a STEM career compared to men. The [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] estimates that doubling women's high-skill contributions to Scotland's economy would benefit it by £170&amp;nbsp;million per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Tapping All our Talents|date=April 2012|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/other/tapping-all-our-talents|location=United Kingdom|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=9780902198661|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Men's and women's earnings ===
{{See also|Gender pay gap}}
Female college graduates earned less on average than male college graduates, even though they shared the earnings growth of all college graduates in the 1980s. Some of the differences in salary are related to the differences in occupations entered by women and men. Among recent science and engineering bachelor's degree recipients, women were less likely than men to be employed in science and engineering occupations. There remains a wage gap between men and women in comparable scientific positions. Among more experienced scientists and engineers, the gender gap in salaries is greater than for recent graduates.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation, Women, Minorities and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 1996, Washington, D.C.: 1996, appendix table 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Salaries are highest in mathematics, computer science, and engineering, which are fields in which women are not highly represented. In [[Australia]], a study conducted by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] has shown that the current gender wage gap between men and women in STEM fields in Australia stands at 30.1 percent as of 2013, which is an increase of 3 percent since 2012.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.professionalsaustralia.org.au/professional-women/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2014/03/WOMEN_IN_STEM_v2.pdf|title=Women in STEM in Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Professionals Australia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to a study done by Moss, &lt;ref name="Moss-Racusin2012" /&gt;when faculty members of top research institutions in America were asked to recruit student applicants for a laboratory manager position, both men and women faculty members rated the male applicants as more hireable and competent for the position, as opposed to the female applicants who shared an identical resume with the male applicants. In the Moss study, faculty members were willing to give the male applicants a higher starting salary and career mentoring opportunities.&lt;ref name="Moss-Racusin2012" /&gt;

===Education and perception===
The percentage of PhDs in STEM fields in the U.S. earned by women is about 42%,&lt;ref name="NSF T7.3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/static/data/tab7-3.xlsx |title=TABLE 7-3.

These differences start as early as the third grade according to Thomas Dee, with boys advancing in math and science and girls advancing in reading.&lt;ref&gt;Dee, Thomas S. "Teachers and the Gender Gaps in Student Achievement." The Journal of Human Resources, vol. 42, no. 3, 2007, pp. 528–554. {{JSTOR|40057317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representation of women worldwide ==
[[UNESCO]], among other agencies including the [[European Commission]] and The Association of Academies and Societies of Sciences in Asia (AASSA), have been outspoken about the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields globally.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002315/231519e.pdf|title=A Complex Formula: Girls and Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics in Asia|date=2015|website=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO Bangkok Office|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=She figures 2012 – Research policy and organisation – EU Bookshop|url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/uri?target=EUB:NOTICE:KINA25617:EN:HTML|doi=10.2777/38520|date=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interacademies.net/File.aspx?id=28016|title=Women in Science and Technology in Asia|date=1 September 2015|website=The InterAcademy Partnership|publisher=AASSA, Gyeonggi-Do|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their efforts to compile and interpret comparative statistics, it is necessary to exercise caution. [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] has commented on the obstacles regarding the making of meaningful statistical comparisons between countries:&lt;ref name="fastlane"&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "Life in the fast lane: Arab women in science and technology," ''Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society'', vol. 36, no. 2 (2016), p. 107–117.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|
For a variety of reasons, it is difficult to obtain reliable data on international comparisons of women in STEM fields.  Aggregate figures do not tell us much, especially since terminology describing educational levels, content of majors, job categories, and other markers varies from country to country. 
}}
Even when different countries use the same definitions of terms, the social significance of the categories may differ considerably. Koblitz remarks:&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "Mathematics and gender: Some cross-cultural observations," in Gila Hanna, ed., ''Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|
It is not possible to use the same indicators to determine the situation in every country.  The significant statistic might be the percentage of women teaching at the university level.  But it might also be the proportion of women at research institutes and academies of sciences (and at what level), or the percentage of women who publish (or who publish in foreign as opposed to domestic journals), or the proportion of women who go abroad for conferences, post-graduate study, and so on, or the percentage of women awarded grants by national and international funding agencies.  Indices can have different meanings in different countries, and the prestige of various positions and honors can vary considerably.

=== Asia ===
[[File:Proportion of female graduates A Complex Formula.svg|thumb|Proportion of female graduates in science programmes in tertiary education in Asia.]]
A fact sheet published by UNESCO in March 2015&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; presented worldwide statistics of women in the STEM fields, with a focus on [[Asia]] and the Pacific region. It reports that, worldwide, 30 percent of researchers are women. In these areas, East Asia, the Pacific, South Asia and West Asia had the most uneven balance, with 20 percent of researchers being women in each of those sub-regions. Meanwhile, [[Central Asia]] had the most equal balance in the region, with women comprising 46 percent of its researchers. The Central Asian countries [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] were the only countries in Asia with women as the majority of their researchers, though in both cases it was by a very small margin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002351/235155E.pdf|title=Women in Science|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cambodia ====
As of 2004, 13.9% of students enrolled in science programs in [[Cambodia]] were female and 21% of researchers in science, technology, and innovation&amp;nbsp;fields were female as of 2002. These statistics are significantly lower than those of other Asian countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[Mongolia]], and [[South Korea]]. According to a UNESCO report on women in STEM in Asian countries, Cambodia's education system has a long history of male dominance stemming from its male-only [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teaching practices. Starting in 1924, girls were allowed to enroll in school. Bias against women, not only in education but in other aspects of life as well, exists in the form of traditional views of men as more powerful and dignified than women, especially in the home and in the workplace, according to UNESCO's ''A Complex Formula''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Indonesia ====
UNESCO's ''A Complex Formula'' states that [[Indonesia]]'s government has been working towards gender equality, especially through the [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Education and Culture]], but stereotypes about women's roles in the workplace persists. Due to traditional views and societal [[Norm (social)|norms]], women struggle to remain in their careers or to move up in the workplace. Substantially more women are enrolled in science-based fields such as [[pharmacy]] and biology than in mathematics and [[physics]]. Within engineering, statistics vary based on the specific engineering discipline; women make up 78% of [[chemical engineering]] students but only 5% of [[mechanical engineering]] students. As of 2005, out of 35,564 researchers in science, technology, and engineering, only 10,874 or 31% were female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Malaysia ====
According to UNESCO, 48.19% of students enrolled in science programs in Malaysia were female as of 2011. This number has grown significantly in the past three decades, during which the country's employment of women has increased by 95%. In Malaysia, over 50% of employees in the computer industry, which is generally a male-dominated field within STEM, are women. Of students enrolled in pharmacy, more than 70% are female, while in engineering only 36% of students are female. Women held 49% of research positions in science, technology, and innovation as of 2011.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Mongolia ====
According to UNESCO's data from 2012 and 2011 respectively, 40.2% of students enrolled in science programs and 49% of researchers in science, technology, and innovation in Mongolia are female.&amp;nbsp;Traditionally, [[nomad]]ic Mongol culture was fairly egalitarian, with both women and men raising children, tending livestock, and fighting in battle, which mirrors the relative equality of women and men in Mongolia's modern-day workforce. More females than males pursue higher education and 65% of college graduates in Mongolia are women. However, women earn about 19–30% less than their male counterparts and are perceived by society to be less suited to engineering than men. Thirty percent or less of employees in computer science, construction architecture, and engineering are female while three in four biology students are female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Nepal ====
As of 2011, 26.17% of [[Nepal]]'s science students were women and 19% of their engineering students were also women. In research, women held 7.8% of positions in 2010. These low percentages correspond with Nepal's patriarchal societal values. In Nepal, women that enter STEM fields most often enter forestry or medicine, specifically [[nursing]], which is perceived as a predominantly female occupation in most countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== South Korea ====
In 2012, 30.63% of students enrolled in science programs in South Korea were female, a number that has been increasing since the digital revolution. Numbers of male and female students enrolled at most levels of education are comparable as well, though the gender difference is larger in higher education. Confucian beliefs in the lower societal value of women as well as other cultural factors could influence South Korea's STEM gender gap. In South Korea, as in other countries, the percentage of women in medicine (61.6%) is much higher than the percentage of women in engineering (15.4%) and other more math-based stem fields. In research occupations in science, technology, and innovation, women made up 17% of the workforce as of 2011. In South Korea, most women working in STEM fields are classified as "non-regular" or temporary employees, indicating poor job stability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In a study conducted by the University of Glasgow which examined math anxiety and test performance of boys and girls from various countries, researchers found that South Korea had a high sex difference in mathematics scores, with female students scoring significantly lower than and experiencing more math anxiety on math tests than male students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoet|first=Gijsbert|last2=Bailey|first2=Drew H.|last3=Moore|first3=Alex M.|last4=Geary|first4=David C.|date=2016-04-21|title=Countries with Higher Levels of Gender Equality Show Larger National Sex Differences in Mathematics Anxiety and Relatively Lower Parental Mathematics Valuation for Girls|journal=PLOS One|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e0153857|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0153857|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4839696|pmid=27100631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gulf states ====
[[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] reported&lt;ref name="fastlane"/&gt; on a series of interviews conducted in 2015 in Abu Dhabi with women engineers and computer scientists who had come to the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf states to find opportunities that were not available to them in their home country.  The women spoke of a remarkably high level of job satisfaction and relatively little discrimination.  Koblitz comments that

In the [[European Union]] only 16.7% on average of ICT (Information and communication technology) specialists are women. Only in [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] do women hold more that 25 percent of these roles. The gender distribution is more balanced, particularly in [[History of the European Union|new member states]] when taking into account ICT technicians (middle and low-ranking positions).&lt;ref name=EDJNet /&gt;

In 2012 the percentage of women PhD graduates was 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, and just the 28% of PhD graduates in engineering, manufacturing and construction. In the computing subfield only 21% of PhD graduates were women. In 2013 in the EU as an average men scientists and engineers made up 4.1% of total labour force, while women made up only 2.8%. In more than half of the countries women make up less than 45% of scientists and engineers. The situation has improved, as between 2008 and 2011 the number of women amongst employed scientists and engineers grew by an average of 11.1% per year, while the number of men grew only by 3.3% over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|page= |access-date= 28 August 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men are much more likely than women to have a STEM career regardless of educational attainment. Women in STEM fields earn considerably less than men, even after controlling for a wide set of characteristics such as education and age. On average, men in STEM jobs earn $36.34 per hour while women in STEM jobs earn $31.11 per hour.&lt;ref name="Women in STEM"/&gt;

Women dominate the total number of persons with bachelor's degrees, as well as those in STEM fields defined by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]]. However, they are underrepresented in specific fields including Computer Sciences, Engineering, and Mathematics.

Asian women are over-represented in STEM fields in the U.S.(though not as much as males of the same ethnicity) compared to African American, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, and Native American women.&lt;ref name="NCES2014"/&gt; Within academia, these minority women represent less than 1% of tenure-track positions in the top 100 U.S. universities despite constituting approximately 13% of total US population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Towns|first=Marcy|date=Spring 2010|title=Where Are the Women of Color?

==== African American Women ====
Prejudice and assumed stereotypes keep women of color, especially black women from studying in STEM fields. Psychologically, stereotypes on black women's intellect, cognitive abilities, and work ethic contribute to their lack of confidence in STEM. Spelman College is looking to change how the world looks at African American women, and welcomes black women helping to support them in becoming involved and technically proficient in STEM. Spelman provides the environment which cultivates creativity, intellectual thinking, and curiosity to broaden their thinking for complex solutions. 2,100 students of Spelman come from forty-four states, one territory and eleven countries, with one of the highest ranks of all institutions with black graduating with bachelors of science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Kimberly M.|date=Spring 2014|title=Realigning the crooked room: Spelman claims a space for African American women in STEM|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A379445373/ITOF?u=auraria_main&amp;sid=ITOF&amp;xid=1a7ce7cd|journal=Realigning the Crooked Room: Spelman Claims a Space for African American Women in STEM|volume=16|pages=|via=Auraria Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
According to the National Household Survey, women represented 39% of STEM graduates in Canada, as opposed to 66% in non-STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11874-eng.htm|title=Gender differences in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and computer science (STEM) programs at university|last=Hango|first=Darcy|date=2015|website=statcan|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the [[University of British Columbia]] discovered that only 20–25% of computer science students from all Canadian college and universities are women. As well, only about 1 in 5 of that percentage will graduate from those programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A325699497/GPS?u=ko_k12hs_d73&amp;sid=GPS&amp;xid=ce00382c|title=Unlocking the brilliance: author provides insights on how to inspire young women to join the high tech industry|website=link.galegroup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistically, women are less likely to choose a STEM program, regardless of mathematical ability. Young men with lower marks in mathematics are more likely to pursue STEM fields than their women-identified peers with higher marks in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Darcy Hango|title=Gender differences in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and computer science (STEM) programs at university|date=18 Dec 2013|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-006-x/2013001/article/11874-eng.htm|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underrepresentation in STEM-related awards and competitions ==
In terms of the most prestigious awards in STEM fields, fewer have been awarded to women than to men. Between 1901 and 2017 the female:total ratio of [[Nobel Prize]]s were 2:207 for physics, 4:178 for chemistry, 12:214 for physiology/medicine, and 1:79 for economic sciences.
The ratios for other fields were 14:114 in literature and 16:104 for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/ |title=Nobel Prize Facts |publisher= NobelPrize.org |access-date=18 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maryam Mirzakhani]] was the first woman and first Iranian to receive the [[Fields Medal]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Prizes/2014/news_release_mirzakhani.pdf|title=The Work of Maryam Mirzakhani.

A review of UK patent applications, in 2016, found that the proportion of new inventions registered by women was rising, but that most female inventors were active in stereotypically female fields such as "designing bras and make-up". 94% of inventions in the field of computing, 96% in automotive applications and mining, and 99% in explosives and munitions, were by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=New generation of inventors wanted: women need to apply|last=Keate|first=Georgie|date=27 December 2016|work=[[The Times]]|pages=22–23|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 [[Russia]] had the highest percentage of patents filed by women, at about 16%.

== Explanations for low representation of women ==
There are a variety of proposed reasons for the relatively low numbers of women in STEM fields. These can be broadly classified into societal, psychological, and innate explanations. However, explanations are not necessarily restricted to just one of these categories.

=== Societal ===
====Discrimination====
Schiebinger claims discrimination, both overt and covert, faced by women in STEM fields leads to fewer women in STEM fields.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999" /&gt;{{rp|33}} In the 1980s, researchers demonstrated a general evaluative bias against women.&lt;ref name=Swim1989&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swim|first1=J.|last2=Borgida|first2=E.|last3=Maruyama|first3=G.|last4=Myers|first4=D.G.|title=Joan McKay versus John McKay: Do gender stereotypes bias evaluations?|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1989|volume=105|issue=3|pages=409–429|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.105.3.409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 study, email requests were sent to meet to professors in doctoral programs at the top 260 U.S. universities. It was impossible to determine whether any particular individual in this study was exhibiting discrimination, since each participant only viewed a request from one potential graduate student. However, researchers found evidence for discrimination against ethnic minorities and women relative to Caucasian men.&lt;ref name=Milkman2012&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Milkman| first1=K.L|last2=Akinola| first2=M.|last3=Chugh|first3=D.| title=Temporal Distance and Discrimination: An Audit Study in Academia|journal=Psychological Science|year=2012| volume=23|issue=7|pages=710–717|doi=10.1177/0956797611434539|pmid=22614463}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, science faculty were sent the materials of student who was applying for a lab manager position at their university.&lt;ref name=Moss-Racusin2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moss-Racusin|first1=C.A.|last2=Dovidio| first2=J.F.|last3=Brescoll| first3=V.L.|last4=Graham| first4=M.| last5=Handelsman|first5=J.| title=Science faculty's subtle gender biases favor male students|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2012 |volume=109|issue=41|pages=16474–16479| doi=10.1073/pnas.1211286109|pmid=22988126| pmc=3478626}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials were the same for each participant, but each application was randomly assigned either a male or a female name.

The authors interpreted this to suggest that the underrepresentation of women in the professorial ranks was not solely caused by sexist hiring, promotion, and remuneration.&lt;ref name="Ceci-2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ceci |first1=S.

Both men and women who work in "nontraditional" occupations may encounter discrimination, but the forms and consequences of this discrimination are different. Individuals of a particular gender are often perceived to be better suited to particular careers or areas of study than those of the other gender.&lt;ref name=Gaucher2011&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Gaucher|first1=D.| last2=Friesen|first2=J.|last3=Kay| first3=A.C.|title=Evidence that gendered wording in job advertisements exists and sustains gender inequality|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=101| issue=1|pages=109–128| doi=10.1037/a0022530|pmid=21381851}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyness2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyness|first1=K.S.|last2=Heilman|first2=M.E.|title=When fit is fundamental: Performance evaluations and promotions of upper-level female and male managers|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology| year=2006|volume=91| issue=4| pages=777–785| doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.4.777|pmid=16834505|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.9525}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that job advertisements for male-dominated careers tended to use more agentic words (or words denoting agency, such as "leader" and "goal-oriented") associated with male stereotypes.&lt;ref name=Gaucher2011/&gt; Social Role Theory, proposed in 1991, states that men are expected to display agentic qualities and women to display communal qualities.&lt;ref name=Eagly1991&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagly|first1=A.H.|last2=Wood|first2=W.|title=Explaining Sex Differences in Social Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Perspective|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1991|volume=17|issue=3|pages=306–315| doi=10.1177/0146167291173011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expectations can influence hiring decisions.&lt;ref name=Madera2009&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Madera|first1=J.M.|last2=Hebl|first2=M.R.|last3=Martin|first3=R.C.| title=Gender and letters of recommendation for academia: Agentic and communal differences|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=2009|volume=94|issue=6|pages=1591–1599|doi=10.1037/a0016539|pmid=19916666|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.9717}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study found that women tended to be described in more communal terms and men in more agentic terms in letters of recommendation.

Although women entering traditionally male professions face negative stereotypes suggesting that they are not "real" women, these stereotypes do not seem to deter women to the same degree that similar stereotypes may deter men from pursuing nontraditional professions. There is historical evidence that women flock to male-identified occupations once opportunities are available.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, Samuel. 1985. ''The Process of Occupational Sex-Typing''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, examples of occupations changing from predominantly female to predominantly male are very rare in human history. The few existing cases—such as medicine—suggest that redefinition of the occupations as appropriately masculine is necessary before men will consider joining them.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenreich, Barbara, and Deirdre English. 1978. For Her Own Good: 100 Years of Expert Advice to Women. Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although men in female-dominated occupations may contend with negative stereotypes about their masculinity, they may also experience certain benefits. In 1992 it was suggested that women in male-dominated occupations tended to hit a [[glass ceiling]]; while men in female-dominated occupations may hit a "glass escalator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Christine | year = 1992 | title = The Glass Escalator: Hidden Advantages for Men in the 'Female' Professions | journal = Social Problems | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 253–267 | jstor=3096961 | doi=10.1525/sp.1992.39.3.03x0034h}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the glass ceiling can make it difficult for women and minorities to reach the top of an occupation, the "glass escalator" allows men to excel in a profession that is female dominated.

====Black Sheep effect====
{{Main|Black sheep effect}}

The Black Sheep effect occurs when individuals are likely to evaluate members of their in-group more favorably than members of their out-group when those members are highly qualified.&lt;ref name=Eidelman2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eidelman|first1=S.|last2=Biernat|first2=M.|title=Derogating black sheep: Individual or group protection?|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology| year=2003|volume=39| issue=6|pages=602–609| doi=10.1016/s0022-1031(03)00042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerr1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=N.L.|last2=Hymes|first2=R.W.|last3=Anderson|first3=A.B.|last4=Weathers|first4=J.E.|title=Defendant-juror similarity and mock juror judgments|journal=Law and Human Behavior|year=1995|volume=19|issue=6|pages=545–567|doi=10.1007/bf01499374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marques2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=J.|last2=Abrams|first2=D.|last3=Serodio|first3=R.G.|title=Being better by being right: Subjective group dynamics and derogation of in-group deviants when generic norms are undermined|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=81|issue=3|pages=436–447|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.3.436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=T.S.|last2=Hosch|first2=H.M.|title=An examination of jury verdicts for evidence of a similarity-leniency effect, an out-group punitiveness effect or a black sheep effect|journal=Law and Human Behavior|year=2004|volume=28|issue=5|pages=587–598|doi=10.1023/b:lahu.0000046436.36228.71}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when an individual's in-group members have average or below average qualities, he or she is likely to evaluate them much lower than out-group members with equivalent qualifications.&lt;ref name=Eidelman2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerr1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marques2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2004/&gt; This suggests that established women in STEM fields will be more likely than established men to help early career women who display sufficient qualifications. However, established women will be less likely than men to help early career women who display insufficient qualifications.

====Queen Bee effect====
The Queen Bee effect is similar to the Black Sheep effect but applies only to women. It explains why higher-status women, particularly in male-dominated professions, may actually be far less likely to help other women than their male colleagues might be.&lt;ref name=Cooper1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=V.W.|title=Homophily or the Queen Bee Syndrome|journal=Small Group Research|year=1997|volume=28|issue=4|pages=483–499|doi=10.1177/1046496497284001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellemers|first1=N.|last2=Van den Heuvel|first2=H.|last3=de Gilder|first3=D.|last4=Maass|first4=A.|last5=Bonvini|first5=A.|title=The underrepresentation of women in science: Differential commitment or the queen bee syndrome?|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=43|issue=3|pages=315–338|doi=10.1348/0144666042037999|pmid=15479533|url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/files/1953519/Ellemers%20British%20Journal%20of%20Social%20Psychology%2043%202004%20u.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study found that while doctoral students in a number of different disciplines did not exhibit any gender differences in work commitment or work satisfaction, faculty members at the same university believed that female students were less committed to their work than male students.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; What was particularly surprising was that these beliefs by faculty members were most strongly endorsed by female faculty members, rather than male faculty members.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; One potential explanation for this finding is that individual mobility for a member of a negatively stereotyped group is often accompanied by a social and psychological distancing of oneself from the group. This implies that successful women in traditionally male-dominated careers do not see their success as evidence that negative stereotypes about women's quantitative and analytical abilities are wrong, but rather as proof that they personally are exceptions to the rule.&lt;ref name=Ellemers2004/&gt; Thus, such women may actually play a role in perpetuating, rather than abolishing, these negative stereotypes.

====Mentorship====
In STEM fields, the support and encouragement of a mentor can make a lot of difference in women's decisions of whether or not to continue pursuing a career in their discipline&lt;ref name=Sonnert2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sonnert|first1=G.|last2=Fox|first2=M.F.|last3=Adkins|first3=K.|title=Undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering: Effects of Faculty, Fields, and Institutions Over Time|journal=Social Science Quarterly|year=2007|volume=88|issue=5|pages=1333–1356|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2007.00505.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.452.4529}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stout2011&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Stout|first1=J.G.|last2=Dasgupta| first2=N.|last3=Hunsinger| first3=M.|last4=McManus| first4=M.A.|title=STEMing the tide: Using ingroup experts to inoculate women's self-concept in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=2|pages=255–270|doi=10.1037/a0021385|pmid=21142376}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be particularly true for younger individuals who may face many obstacles early on in their careers.&lt;ref name="Griffith2010"/&gt; Since these younger individuals often look to those who are more established in their discipline for help and guidance, the responsiveness and helpfulness of potential mentors is incredibly important.

====Lack of support====
Women in STEM may leave due to not being invited to professional meetings, the use of sexually discriminating standards against women, inflexible working conditions, the perceived need to hide pregnancies, and the struggle to balance family and work. Women in STEM fields that have children either need child care or to take a long leave of absence. When a [[nuclear family]] can not afford child care, typically it is the mother that gives up her career to stay at home with the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/7-things-keeping-women-out-of-science-2013-10 |title=These Are The 7 Things Keeping Women Out of Science Careers |last=Welsh |first=Jennifier |date=16 Oct 2013 |website= |publisher=Business Insider |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due in part to women being paid statistically less in their careers. The man makes more money so the man goes to work and the woman gives up her career. Maternity leave is another issue women in STEM fields face. In the [[Maternity leave in the United States|U.S. maternity leave]] is required by The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/ |title=Family and Medical Leave Act |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=United States Department of Labor |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FMLA requires 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually for mothers of newborn or newly adopted children. This is one of the lowest levels of leave in the industrialized world. Unlike the United States, most countries have the right to paid time off.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} If a new mother does not have external financial support or savings, they may not be able to take their full maternity leave. Few companies allow men to take paternity leave and it may be shorter than women's maternity leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edd.ca.gov/Disability/PFL_Fathers.htm |title=Paid Family Leave – Fathers |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=State of California, Employment Development Department |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer paternity leaves for men could allow women to go back to work while their partners stay home with the children.

==== Harassment ====
In 1993 ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' indicated that three-quarters of women students and residents were harassed at least once during their medical training.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999" /&gt;{{rp|51}}

==== Lack of role models ====
In engineering and science education, women made up almost 50 percent of non-tenure track lecturer and instructor jobs, but only 10 percent of tenured or tenure-track professors in 1996. In addition, the number of female department chairs in medical schools did not change from 1976 to 1996.&lt;ref name="Pell1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pell|first1=A N|title=Fixing the leaky pipeline: women scientists in academia|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=74|issue=11| year=1996|pages=2843–8|issn=0021-8812| doi=10.2527/1996.74112843x|pmid=8923199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, women who do make it to tenured or tenure-track positions may face the difficulties associated with holding a token status. They may lack support from colleagues and may face antagonism from peers and supervisors.&lt;ref name="Lips2008" /&gt; However, in 2014 a team of psychologists and economists conducted extensive analyses of national data and concluded that the state of women in STEM has changed greatly in the past two decades and any conclusions about their status based on data prior to 2000 are likely to be outdated. In general, they concluded that women had very sizable gains in academic science, including remuneration, promotion, and job satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Ceci2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ceci|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Ginther|first2=Donna K.|last3=Kahn|first3=Shulamit|last4=Williams|first4=Wendy M.|title=Women in Academic Science, A Changing Landscape |journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest |volume=15 |issue=3 |year=2014 |pages=75–141 |issn=1529-1006 |doi=10.1177/1529100614541236|pmid=26172066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it has been posited that more female role models would encourage more women to enter fields dominated by men, research has indicated this is not the case,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Cheryan|first1 = Sapna|last2 = Siy|first2 = John Oliver|last3 = Vichayapai|first3 = Marissa|last4 = Drury|first4 = Benjamin J.|last5 = Kim|first5 = Saenam|title = Do Female and Male Role Models Who Embody STEM Stereotypes Hinder Women's Anticipated Success in STEM?|journal = Social Psychological and Personality Science|volume = 2|issue = 6|pages = 656–664|doi = 10.1177/1948550611405218|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that women's lack of interest in STEM fields may instead in part stem from stereotypes about employees and workplaces in STEM fields, to which stereotypes women are disproportionately responsive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/15/geeky_decor_puts_off_ladies/ |title=Ladies put off tech careers by sci-fi posters, Coke cans |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/06/27/girls_into_tech_cracked_at_last_sorta/ |title=Trick-cyclist's claim: I have FOUND how to get GIRLS INTO TECH |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=27 June 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Clustering and leaky pipeline ====
In the early 1980s Rossiter put forth the concept of "territorial segregation" or [[occupational segregation]], which is the idea that women "cluster" in certain fields of study.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}} For example, "women are more likely to teach and do research in the humanities and social sciences than in the natural sciences and engineering",&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"/&gt;{{rp|34}} and the majority of college women tend to choose majors such as psychology, education, English, performing arts, and nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ruchika Tulshyan |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/03/02/top-10-college-majors-women-forbes-woman-leadership-education_slide_11.html |title=Top 10 College Majors For Women – 10: Liberal Arts and Sciences, General Studies, Humanities |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-07|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123090031/http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/02/top-10-college-majors-women-forbes-woman-leadership-education_slide_11.html|archivedate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossiter also used "hierarchical segregation" as an explanation for the low number of women in STEM fields.{{clarify|date=March 2018}} She describes "hierarchical segregation" as a decrease in the number of women as one "moves up the ladder of power and prestige."&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"/&gt;{{rp|33}} This is related to the [[STEM pipeline|leaky STEM pipeline]] concept. The metaphor of the leaky pipeline has been used to describe how women drop out of STEM fields at all stages of their careers. In the U.S., out of 2,000 high school aged persons, 1944 were enrolled in high school fall 2014.&lt;ref name="NCES d15_201.20"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_201.20.asp |title=Table 201.20.

==== Lack of interest ====
A meta-analysis concluded that men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people. When interests were classified by [[Holland Codes|RIASEC type]] (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional), men showed stronger Realistic and Investigative interests, and women showed stronger Artistic, Social, and Conventional interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering, science, and mathematics interests.&lt;ref name="Su2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=Rong|last2=Rounds|first2=James|last3= Armstrong|first3= Patrick|title=Men and Things, Women and People: A Meta-Analysis of Sex Differences in Interests|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2009|volume=135|issue=6|pages=859–884|doi=10.1037/a0017364|pmid=19883140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 3-year interview study, Seymour and Hewitt (1997) found that perceptions that non-STEM academic majors offered better education options and better matched their interests was the most common (46%) reason provided by female students for switching majors from STEM areas to non-STEM areas. The second most frequently cited reason given for switching to non-STEM areas was a reported loss of interest in the women's chosen STEM majors. Additionally, 38% of female students who remained in STEM majors expressed concerns that there were other academic areas that might be a better fit for their interests.&lt;ref name="Seymour1997"&gt;{{cite book | last=Seymour | first=Elaine | title=Talking about leaving : why undergraduates leave the sciences | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, CO, USA | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-8133-6642-5 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preston's (2004) survey of 1,688 individuals who had left sciences also showed that 30 percent of the women endorsed "other fields more interesting" as their reason for leaving.&lt;ref name="Preston2004"&gt;{{cite book | last=Preston | first=Anne | title=Leaving science : occupational exit from scientific careers | publisher=Russell Sage Foundation | location=New York | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-87154-694-4 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced math skills do not often result in a woman being interested in a STEM career. A [[Statistics Canada]] survey found that even young women of high mathematical ability are much less likely to enter a STEM field than young men of similar or even lesser ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Lack of confidence ====
Research has found that women steer away from STEM fields because they believe they are not qualified for them; the study suggested that this could be fixed by encouraging girls to participate in more mathematics classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/27/new_study_into_lack_of_women_in_tech_its_not_the_mens_fault/?mt=1437990843635 |title=New study into lack of women in Tech: It's NOT the men's fault |last=Page |first=Lewis |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the factors behind girls' lack of confidence might be unqualified or ineffective teachers. Teachers' gendered perceptions on their students' capabilities can create an unbalanced learning environment and deter girls from pursuing further STEM education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbara|first=Lohbeck, Annette{{!}}Grube, Dietmar{{!}}Moschner|date=2017|title=Academic Self-Concept and Causal Attributions for Success and Failure Amongst Elementary School Children.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1137235|journal=International Journal of Early Years Education|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=|issn=0966-9760|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also pass these stereotyped beliefs unto their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keller|first=Carmen|date=2001-05-01|title=Effect of Teachers' Stereotyping on Students' Stereotyping of Mathematics as a Male Domain|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11964907|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=141|issue=2|pages=165–73|doi=10.1080/00224540109600544|pmid=11372563}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also shown that student-teacher interactions affect girls' engagement with STEM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Angela C.|date=2007|title=Unintended consequences: How science professors discourage women of color|journal=Science Education|language=en|volume=91|issue=5|pages=805–821|doi=10.1002/sce.20208|issn=0036-8326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elstad|first=Eyvind|last2=Turmo|first2=Are|date=2009-08-06|title=The Influence of the Teacher's Sex on High School Students' Engagement and Achievement in Science|url=http://genderandset.open.ac.uk/index.php/genderandset/article/view/41|journal=International Journal of Gender, Science and Technology|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|issn=2040-0748}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt; Teachers often give boys more opportunity to figure out the solution to a problem by themselves while telling the girls to follow the rules.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger1999"/&gt;{{rp|56}} Teachers are also more likely to accept questions from boys while telling girls to wait for their turns.&lt;ref name="Pell1996"/&gt; This is partly due to gender expectations that boys will be active but that girls will be quiet and obedient.&lt;ref name="Lips2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lips|first=Hilary|title=Sex &amp; Gender: An Introduction Sixth Edition|year=2008|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1985, girls were provided fewer laboratory opportunities than boys.&lt;ref name="Pell1996"/&gt; In middle and high school, science, mathematics, mechanics and computers courses are mainly taken by male students and also tend to be taught by male teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/50056290/ns/local_news-phoenix_az/t/popovich-girls-need-be-shown-path-success-through-stem-education/#.UL2VYYNfCSo |accessdate=December 5, 2012 |title=MSN &amp;#124; Outlook, Office, Skype, Bing, Breaking News, and Latest Videos }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of opportunities in STEM fields could lead to a loss of self-esteem in math and science abilities, and low self-esteem could prevent people from entering science and math fields.&lt;ref name="Pell1996"/&gt;

Out of STEM-intending students, 35% of women stated that their reason for leaving calculus was due to lack of understanding the material, while only 14% of men stated the same.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt; The study reports that this difference in reason for leaving calculus is thought to develop from women's low level of confidence in their ability, and not actual skill. This study continues to establish that women and men have different levels of confidence in their ability and that confidence is related to how individual's performance in STEM fields.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt; It was seen in another study that when men and women of equal math ability were asked to rate their own ability, women will rate their own ability at a much lower level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chipman|first=Susan|date=September 1992|title=Mathematics Anxiety and Science Careers Among Able College Women|url=|journal=Psychological Science |volume=3 |issue=5|pages=292–295|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs with the purpose to reduce anxiety in math or increase confidence have a positive impact on women continuing their pursuit of a career in the STEM field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Stephanie|date=October 2013|title=For Girls in STEM, Belonging, Not Brain Structure, Makes the Difference|url=|journal=Techniques: Connecting Education &amp; Careers|volume=88 |issue=7|pages=34–36|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only can the issue of confidence keep women from even entering STEM fields, but even women in upper-level courses with higher skill are more strongly affected by the stereotype that they (by nature) do not possess innate ability to succeed.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Julia|date=November–December 2012|title=Calculus GPA and Math Identification as Moderators of Stereotype Threat in Highly Persistent Women|url=|journal=Basic &amp; Applied Social Psychology|volume=34 |issue=6|pages=534–543|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can cause a negative effect on confidence for women despite making it through courses designed to filter students out of the field.

====Stereotype threat====
Stereotype threat arises from the fear that one's actions will confirm a negative stereotype about one's in-group. This fear creates additional stress, consuming valuable cognitive resources and lowering task performance in the threatened domain.&lt;ref name=Schmader2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmader|first1=T.|last2=Johns|first2=M.|title=Converging evidence that stereotype threat reduces working memory capacity|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=85|issue=3|pages=440–452|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.3.440|pmid=14498781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steele1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=C.M.|last2=Aronson|first2=J.|title=Stereotype Threat and the Intellectual Test Performance of African Americans|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=69|issue=5|pages=797–811|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797|pmid=7473032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steele2002&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Steele|first1=C.M.|last2=Spencer|first2=S.J.|last3=Aronson|first3=J.|title=Contending with group image: The psychology of stereotype and social identity threat|year=2002|volume=34|pages=379–440|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(02)80009-0|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|isbn=9780120152346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are susceptible to stereotype threat whenever they are assessed in a domain for which there is a perceived negative stereotype about a group to which they belong. Stereotype threat undermines the academic performance of women and girls in math and science, which leads to an underestimation of abilities in these subjects by standard measures of academic achievement.&lt;ref name=Spencer1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer|first1=S.J.|last2=Steele|first2=C.M.|last3=Quinn|first3=D.M.|title=Stereotype threat and women's math performance|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=1999|volume=35|issue=1|pages=4–28|doi=10.1006/jesp.1998.1373|citeseerx=10.1.1.370.3979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miyake2010/&gt; Individuals who identify strongly with a certain area (e.g., math) are more likely to have their performance in that area hampered by stereotype threat than those who identify less strongly with the area.&lt;ref name=Steele2002/&gt; This means that even highly motivated students from negatively stereotyped groups are likely to be adversely affected by stereotype threat and thus may come to disengage from the stereotyped domain.&lt;ref name=Steele2002/&gt;
Negative stereotypes about girls’ capabilities in mathematics and science drastically lower their performance in mathematics and science courses as well as their interest in pursuing a STEM career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christine-bork/women-in-science_b_1327752.html |title=STEM Fields: Where Are the Women? |last=Bork |first=Christine |date= 2012-03-08|website= |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that gender differences in performance disappear if students are told that there are no gender differences on a particular mathematics test.&lt;ref name=Spencer1999/&gt; This indicates that the learning environment can greatly impact success in a course.

Stereotype threat has been criticized on a theoretical basis.&lt;ref name=jensen&gt;Arthur Robert Jensen "The g factor: the science of mental ability" 1998 {{ISBN|0-275-96103-6}}, Praeger Publishers, 88 Post Road West, Westport, CT 06881, pages 513–515: "the phenomenon of stereotype threat can be explained in terms of a more general construct, test anxiety, which has been studied since the early days of psychometrics. Test anxiety tends to lower performance levels on tests in proportion to the degree of complexity and the amount of mental effort they require of the subject. The relatively greater effect of test anxiety in the black
samples, who had somewhat lower SAT scores, than the white subjects in the Stanford experiments constitutes an example of the Yerkes-Dodson law ... by conducting the same type of experiment using exclusively white (or black)
subjects, divided into lower- and higher-ability groups, it might be shown that 
the phenomenon attributed to stereotype threat has nothing to do with race as
such, but results from the interaction of ability level with test anxiety as a
function of test complexity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoet2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = G. | last2 = Geary | first2 = D.

A study&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; was done to determine how stereotype threat and math identification can affect women who were majoring in a STEM related field. There were three different situations, designed to test the impact of stereotype on performance in math. One group of women were informed that men had previously out-performed women on the same calculus test they were about to take. The next group was told men and women had performed at the same level. The last group was told nothing about how men had performed and there was no mention of gender before taking their test. Out of these situations, women performed at their best scores when there was no mention of gender. The worst scores were from the situation where women were told that men had performed better than women. For women to pursue the male-dominated field of STEM, previous research shows that they must have more confidence in math/science ability.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt;

===Innate versus learned skill===

Some studies propose the explanation that STEM fields (and especially fields like physics, math and philosophy) are considered by both teachers and students to require more innate talent than skills that can be learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/beliefs-about-innate-talent-may-dissuade-students-from-stem-42967 |title=Beliefs about innate talent may dissuade students from STEM |last=Miller |first=David |date=9 Jun 2015 |website= |publisher=The Conversation |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a tendency to view women as having less of the required innate abilities, researchers propose this can result in assessing women as less qualified for STEM positions. In a study done by Ellis, Fosdick and Rasmussen, it was concluded that without strong skills in calculus, women cannot perform as well as their male counterparts in any field of STEM, which leads to the fewer women pursuing a career in these fields.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=Jessica|last2=Fosdick|first2=Bailey K.|last3=Rasmussen|first3=Chris|title=Women 1.5 Times More Likely to Leave STEM Pipeline after Calculus Compared to Men: Lack of Mathematical Confidence a Potential Culprit|journal=PLOS One|volume=11|issue=7|year=2016|pages=1–14|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0157447|pmid=27410262|pmc=4943602}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high percentage of women that do pursue a career in STEM do not continue on this pathway after taking Calculus I, which was found to be a class that weeds out students from the STEM pathway.&lt;ref name="Ellis2016" /&gt;

There have been several controversial statements about innate ability and success in STEM. A few notable examples include [[Lawrence Summers]], former president of [[Harvard University]] who suggested cognitive ability at high end positions could cause a population difference. Summers later stepped down as president.&lt;ref name="harvard2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html |title=Archive of: Remarks at NBER Conference on Diversifying the Science &amp; Engineering Workforce |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130023006/http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html |archivedate=January 30, 2008 |df= }}. January 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Google engineer, James Damore, wrote a memo entitled [[Google's Ideological Echo Chamber]] suggesting that differences in trait distributions between men and women was a reason for gender imbalance in STEM. The memo stated that [[affirmative action]] to reduce the gap could discriminate against highly qualified male candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evzjww/here-are-the-citations-for-the-anti-diversity-manifesto-circulating-at-google |title=Here Are the Citations for the Anti-Diversity Manifesto Circulating at Google |last1=Matsakis |first1=Louise | last2=Koebler |first2=Jason | last3=Emerson |first3=Sarah  |date=7 Aug 2017 |website= |publisher=Vice |access-date=25 Nov 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damore was fired for sending out this memo.

== Strategies for increasing representation of women ==
[[File:15208-event-CMS Girls Engineering Camp-6655 (18682448435).jpg|thumb|The CMS Girls Engineering Camp at [[Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce]] in June 2015]]

There are a multitude of factors that may explain the low representation of women in STEM careers. [[Anne-Marie Slaughter]], the first woman to hold the position of Director of Policy Planning for the [[United States Department of State]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.princeton.edu/slaughter | title=Anne-Marie Slaughter  |website=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt; has recently suggested some strategies to the corporate and political environment to support women to fulfill to the best of their abilities the many roles and responsibilities that they undertake.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/letters/article/1225099--finding-a-work-life-balance Finding a work-life-balance], ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 11 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The academic and research environment for women may benefit by applying some of the suggestions she has made to help women excel, while maintaining a work-life balance.

===Social-psychological interventions===
A number of researchers have tested interventions to alleviate stereotype threat for women in situations where their math and science skills are being evaluated. The hope is that by combating stereotype threat, these interventions will boost women's performance, encouraging a greater number of them to persist in STEM careers.

One simple intervention is simply educating individuals about the existence of stereotype threat. Researchers found that women who were taught about stereotype threat and how it could negatively impact women's performance in math performed as well as men on a math test, even when stereotype threat was induced. These women also performed better than women who were not taught about stereotype threat before they took the math test.&lt;ref name=Johns2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johns|first1=Michael|last2=Schmader|first2=Toni|last3= Martens|first3= Andy|title=Knowing Is Half the Battle: Teaching Stereotype Threat as a Means of Improving Women's Math Performance|journal=Psychological Science|year=2005|volume=16|issue=3|pages=175–179|doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00799.x|pmid=15733195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Role models====
One of the proposed methods for alleviating stereotype threat is through introducing role models. One study found that women who took a math test that was administered by a female experimenter did not suffer a drop in performance when compared to women whose test was administered by a male experimenter.&lt;ref name=Marx2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marx|first1=D.M.|last2=Roman|first2=J.S.|title=Female role models: Protecting women's math performance|journal=Personality and Social Bulletin|year=2002|volume=28|issue=9|pages=1183–1193|doi=10.1177/01461672022812004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these researchers found that it was not the physical presence of the female experimenter but rather learning about her apparent competence in math that buffered participants against stereotype threat.&lt;ref name=Marx2002 /&gt; 
The findings of another study suggest that role models do not necessarily have to be individuals with authority or high status, but can also be drawn from peer groups. This study found that girls in same-gender groups performed better on a task that measured math skills than girls in mixed-gender groups.&lt;ref name=Huguet2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huguet|first1=P.|last2=Regner|first2=I.|title=Stereotype threat among schoolgirls in quasi-ordinary classroom circumstances|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=2007|volume=99|issue=3|pages=545–560|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.99.3.545}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the fact that girls in the same-gender groups had greater access to positive role models, in the form of their female classmates who excelled in math, than girls in mixed-gender groups.&lt;ref name=Huguet2007 /&gt; 
Similarly, another experiment showed that making groups achievements salient helped buffer women against stereotype threat. Female participants who read about successful women, even though these successes were not directly related to performance in math, performed better on a subsequent math test than participants who read about successful corporations rather than successful women.&lt;ref name=McIntyre2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McIntyre|first1=R.B.|last2=Paulson|first2=R.M.|last3= Lord|first3= C.G.|title=Alleviating women's mathematics stereotype threat through salience of group achievements|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=39|issue=1|pages=83–90|doi=10.1016/s0022-1031(02)00513-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A study investigating the role of textbook images on science performance found that women demonstrated better comprehension of a passage from a chemistry lesson when the text was accompanied by a counter-stereotypic image (i.e., of a female scientist) than when the text was accompanied by a stereotypic image (i.e., of a male scientist).&lt;ref name=Good2010 /&gt;
Other scholars distinguish between the challenges of both recruitment and retention in increasing women's participation in STEM fields. These researchers suggest that although both female and male role models can be effective in recruiting women to STEM fields, female role models are more effective at promoting the retention of women in these fields.&lt;ref name=Drury2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drury|first1=Benjamin J.|last2=Siy|first2=John Oliver|last3= Cheryan|first3= Sapna|title=When Do Female Role Models Benefit Women? The Importance of Differentiating Recruitment From Retention in STEM|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=2011|volume=22|issue=4|pages=265–269|doi=10.1080/1047840x.2011.620935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female teachers can also act as role models for young girls. Reports have shown that the presence of female teachers positively influences girls' perceptions of STEM and increases their interest in STEM careers.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stearns|first=Elizabeth|last2=Bottía|first2=Martha Cecilia|last3=Davalos|first3=Eleonora|last4=Mickelson|first4=Roslyn Arlin|last5=Moller|first5=Stephanie|last6=Valentino|first6=Lauren|date=2016-02-01|title=Demographic Characteristics of High School Math and Science Teachers and Girls' Success in STEM|url=https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article/63/1/87/1845557|journal=Social Problems|language=en|volume=63|issue=1|pages=87–110|doi=10.1093/socpro/spv027|issn=0037-7791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-affirmation====
Researchers have investigated the usefulness of self-affirmation in alleviating stereotype threat. One study found that women who affirmed a personal value prior to experiencing stereotype threat performed as well on a math test as men and as women who did not experience stereotype threat.&lt;ref name=Martens2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martens|first1=A.|last2=Johns|first2=M.|last3= Greenberg|first3= J.|last4=Schimel|first4=J.|title=Combating stereotype threat: The effect of self-affirmation on women's intellectual performance|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|issue=2|pages=236–243|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.04.010|hdl=10092/507}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study found that a short writing exercise in which college students, who were enrolled in an introductory physics course, wrote about their most important values substantially decreased the gender performance gap and boosted women's grades.&lt;ref name=Miyake2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miyake|first1=A.|last2=Kost-Smith|first2=L.E.|last3= Finkelstein|first3= N.D.|last4=Pollock|first4=S.J.|last5=Cohen|first5=G.L.|last6=Ito|first6=T.A.|title=Reducing the Gender Achievement Gap in College Science: A Classroom Study of Values Affirmation|journal=Science|year=2010|volume=330|issue=6008|pages=1234–1237|doi=10.1126/science.1195996|pmid=21109670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars believe that the effectiveness of such values-affirmation exercises is their ability to help individuals view themselves as complex individuals, rather than through the lens of a harmful stereotype. Supporting this hypothesis, another study found that women who were encouraged to draw self-concept maps with many nodes did not experience a performance decrease on a math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gresky|first1=D.M.|last2=Eyck|first2=L.L.T.|last3= Lord|first3= C.G.|last4=McIntyre|first4=R.B.|title=Effects of salient multiple identities on women's performance under mathematics stereotype threat|journal=Sex Roles|year=2005|volume=53|issue=9–10|pages=703–716|doi=10.1007/s11199-005-7735-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women who did not draw self-concept maps or only drew maps with a few nodes did perform significantly worse than men on the math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005 /&gt; The effect of these maps with many nodes was to remind women of their "multiple roles and identities," that were unrelated to, and would thus not be harmed by, their performance on the math test.&lt;ref name=Gresky2005 /&gt;

=== Organized efforts ===
Organizations such as [[Girls Who Code]], StemBox,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2218287/stembox-girls-in-stem/|title=Introducing StemBox, Birchbox's Super Smart Little Sister|access-date=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blossom, Engineer Girl, [http://womanity.org/programs/afghanistan/ Girls Can Code] in Afghanistan, [http://robotixedu.com/indian-girls-code/ @IndianGirlsCode], and Kode with Klossy (spearheaded by supermodel [[Karlie Kloss]]) aim to encourage women and girls to explore male-dominated STEM fields. Many of these organizations offer summer programs and scholarships to girls interested in STEM fields. The U.S. government has funded similar endeavors; the Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs created TechGirls and TechWomen, exchange programs which teach Middle Eastern and North African girls and women skills valuable in STEM fields and encourage them to pursue STEM careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/03/205866.htm|title=Advancing the Status of Women and Girls Around the World|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [https://unesco.usmission.gov/teachher/ TeachHer Initiative], spearheaded by UNESCO, Costa Rican First Lady, [[Mercedes Peñas Domingo]], and [[Dr. Jill Biden]] which aims to close the gender gap in STEAM curricula and careers. The Initiative also emphasizes the importance of after school activities and clubs for girls.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;

Current campaigns to increase women's participation within STEM fields include the UK's WISE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/about-us|title=About us|last=WISE|website=Wisecampaign.org.uk|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as mentoring programs, such as the Million Women Mentors initiative connecting girls and young women with STEM mentors,&lt;ref name=MWM&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.millionwomenmentors.com/facts|title=Million Women Mentors|website=Millionwomenmentors.org|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GlamSci (organization)|GlamSci]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/vivian-chan/4-stories-that-show-scien_b_18171712.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS91cmw_c2E9dCZyY3Q9aiZxPSZlc3JjPXMmc291cmNlPXdlYiZjZD02MiZjYWQ9cmphJnVhY3Q9OCZ2ZWQ9MmFoVUtFd2lxZ08zTnQtWGRBaFVPdlZNS0hXbW5CMzQ0UEJBV01BRjZCQWdJRUFFJnVybD1odHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5odWZmaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jby51ayUyRnZpdmlhbi1jaGFuJTJGNC1zdG9yaWVzLXRoYXQtc2hvdy1zY2llbl9iXzE4MTcxNzEyLmh0bWwmdXNnPUFPdlZhdzNoMnZMSDlzZWZMSVRJZy1iQUF3dWc&amp;guce_referrer_cs=zqMJbkEZxOHaLOAC7MSKWA|title=Four Stories That Show Science Still Has A Gender Problem|date=2017-10-09|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Verizon's #InspireHerMind project.&lt;ref name="Verizon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verizon.com/powerfulanswers/inspirehermind/|title=Verizon Innovative Learning|website=Verizon.com|accessdate=20 August 2017|date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Office of Science and Technology Policy during the Obama administration collaborated with the White House Council on Women and Girls to increase the participation of women and girls within STEM fields&lt;ref name="White House"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/women |title=Women in STEM |accessdate=14 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514083057/https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/women |archivedate=14 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the "Educate to Innovate" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/stem_factsheet_2013_07232013.pdf |format=PDF|title=Women and Girls in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)|publisher=Executive Office of the President - White House|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
