The '''cosmic age problem''' is a historical problem in astronomy concerning the [[age of the universe]]. The problem was that at various times in the 20th century, some objects in the universe were estimated to be older than the time elapsed since the [[Big Bang]],&lt;ref name=Evidence&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/astronomy/bigbang.html#oldstars Evidence for the Big Bang] by Björn Feuerbacher and Ryan Scranton. January 25, 2006. Retrieved 16 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as estimated from measurements of the expansion rate of the universe known as the [[Hubble constant]], denoted H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. (This is more correctly called the Hubble parameter, since it generally varies with time).
If so, this would represent a contradiction, since objects such as galaxies, stars and planets could not have existed in the extreme temperatures and densities shortly after the Big Bang.

Since around 1997–2003, the problem is believed to be solved by most cosmologists: modern cosmological measurements lead to a precise estimate of the [[age of the universe]] (i.e. time since the Big Bang) of 13.8 billion years, and recent age estimates for the oldest objects are either younger than this, or consistent allowing for measurement uncertainties.

== Early years ==

Following theoretical developments of the [[Friedmann equations]] by [[Alexander Friedmann]] and [[Georges Lemaître]] in the 1920s, and the discovery of the expanding universe by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, it was immediately clear that tracing this expansion backwards in time predicts that the universe had almost zero size at a finite time in the past. This concept, initially known as the "Primeval Atom" by Lemaitre, was later elaborated into the modern [[Big Bang]] theory. If the universe had expanded at a constant rate in the past, the age of the universe now (i.e. the time since the Big Bang) is simply the inverse of the Hubble constant, often known as the ''Hubble time''. For Big Bang models with zero [[cosmological constant]] and positive matter density, the actual age must be somewhat younger than this Hubble time; typically the age would be between 66% and 90% of the Hubble time, depending on the density of matter.

Hubble's early estimate of his constant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubble|first1=E.|title=A relation between distance and radial velocity among extra-galactic nebulae|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=15 March 1929|volume=15|issue=3|pages=168–173|doi=10.1073/pnas.15.3.168|pmid=16577160|pmc=522427|bibcode = 1929PNAS...15..168H }}&lt;/ref&gt; was 550&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, and the inverse of that is 1.8 billion years. It was believed by many geologists such as [[Arthur Holmes]] in the 1920s that the Earth was probably over 2 billion years old, but with large uncertainty.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The possible discrepancy between the ages of the Earth and the universe was probably one motivation for the development of the [[Steady State theory]] in 1948 as an alternative to the Big Bang;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kragh|first1=Helge|title=Cosmology and Controversy|date=1999|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|isbn=978-0691005461}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the (now obsolete) steady state theory, the universe is infinitely old and on average unchanging with time. The steady state theory postulated spontaneous creation of matter to keep the average density constant as the universe expands, and therefore most galaxies still have an age less than 1/H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. However, if H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; had been 550&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, our Milky Way galaxy would be exceptionally large compared to most other galaxies, so it could well be much older than an average galaxy, therefore eliminating the age problem.

== 1950–1970 ==

In the 1950s, two substantial errors were discovered in Hubble's extragalactic distance scale: first in 1952, [[Walter Baade]] discovered there were two classes of [[Cepheid]] variable star. Hubble's sample comprised different classes nearby and in other galaxies, and correcting this error made all other galaxies twice as distant as Hubble's values, thus doubling the Hubble time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baade|first1=W.|title=The Period-Luminosity Relation of the Cepheids|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|date=February 1956|volume=68|issue=400|pages=5|doi=10.1086/126870|bibcode = 1956PASP...68....5B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second error was discovered by [[Allan Sandage]] and coworkers: for galaxies beyond the [[Local Group]], Cepheids were too faint to observe with Hubble's instruments, so Hubble used the brightest stars as distance indicators. Many of Hubble's "brightest stars" were actually HII regions or clusters containing many stars, which caused another underestimation of distances for these more distant galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Humason |first1=M. L. |last2=Mayall |first2=N. U. |last3=Sandage |first3=A. R. |title=Redshifts and magnitudes of extragalactic nebulae |journal=The Astronomical Journal |date=April 1956 |volume=61 |page=97 |doi=10.1086/107297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in 1958 Sandage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandage|first=Allan|title=Current Problems in the Extragalactic Distance Scale|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=1958|volume=127|page=513|doi=10.1086/146483|bibcode=1958ApJ...127..513S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  published the first reasonably accurate measurement of the Hubble constant, at 75&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, which is close to modern estimates of 68–74&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riess|first=A.|title=A 3% solution: determination of the Hubble constant with the Hubble Space Telescope|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=730|issue=119|pages=119|arxiv=1103.2976|last2=Macri|first2=Lucas|last3=Casertano|first3=Stefano|last4=Lampeitl|first4=Hubert|last5= Ferguson|first5=Henry C.|last6= Filippenko|first6=Alexei V.|last7= Jha|first7=Saurabh W.|last8=Li|first8=Weidong|last9=Chornock|first9=Ryan|year=2011|bibcode = 2011ApJ...730..119R |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/730/2/119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of the Earth (actually the Solar System) was first accurately measured around 1955 by [[Clair Patterson]] at 4.55 billion years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=C.|last2=Tilton|first2=G.|last3=Inghram|first3=M.|title=Age of the Earth|journal=Science|date=21 January 1955|volume=121|issue=3134|pages=69–75|doi=10.1126/science.121.3134.69|pmid=17782556|bibcode = 1955Sci...121...69P }}&lt;/ref&gt; essentially identical to the modern value. For H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 75&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, the inverse of H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is 13.0 billion years; so after 1958 the Big Bang model age was comfortably older than the Earth.

However, in the 1960s and onwards, new developments in the theory of stellar evolution enabled age estimates for large star clusters called [[globular clusters]]: these generally gave age estimates of around 15 billion years, with substantial scatter.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  Further revisions of the Hubble constant by Sandage and [[Gustav Tammann]] in the 1970s gave values around 50–60&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandage|first1=A.|last2=Tammann|first2=G. A.|title=Steps toward the Hubble constant. VII - Distances to NGC 2403, M101, and the Virgo cluster using 21 centimeter line widths compared with optical methods: The global value of H sub 0|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=210|pages=7|doi=10.1086/154798|bibcode=1976ApJ...210....7S|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an inverse of 16-20 billion years, consistent with globular cluster ages.

== 1975–1990 ==

However, in the late 1970s to early 1990s, the age problem re-appeared: new estimates of the Hubble constant gave higher values, with [[Gerard de Vaucouleurs]] estimating values 90–100&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Vaucouleurs|first1=G.|title=Five crucial tests of the cosmic distance scale using the Galaxy as fundamental standard|journal=Nature|date=23 September 1982|volume=299|issue=5881|pages=303–307|doi=10.1038/299303a0|bibcode = 1982Natur.299..303D }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Marc Aaronson]] and co-workers gave values around 80-90 &amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaronson|first1=M.|last2=Bothun|first2=G.|last3=Mould|first3=J.|last4=Huchra|first4=J.|last5=Schommer|first5=R.

== Late 1990s: probable solution ==

The age problem was eventually thought to be resolved by several developments between 1995-2003: firstly, a large program with the [[Hubble space telescope]] measured the Hubble constant at 72&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc with 10 percent uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madore|first1=Barry F.|last2=Freedman|first2=Wendy  L.|last3=Silbermann|first3=N.|last4=Harding|first4=Paul|last5=Huchra|first5=John|last6=Mould|first6=Jeremy R.|last7=Graham|first7=John A.|last8=Ferrarese|first8=Laura|last9=Gibson|first9=Brad K.|last10=Han|first10=Mingsheng|last11=Hoessel|first11=John G.|last12=Hughes|first12=Shaun M.|last13=Illingworth|first13=Garth D.|last14=Phelps|first14=Randy|last15=Sakai|first15=Shoko|last16=Stetson|first16=Peter|title=The Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale.

The presence of dark energy implies that the universe was expanding more slowly at around half its present age than today, which makes the universe older for a given value of the Hubble constant.  The combination of the three results above essentially removed the discrepancy between estimated globular cluster ages and the age of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krauss, Lawrence M. |author2=Chaboyer, Brian |title=Age Estimates of Globular Clusters in the Milky Way: Constraints on Cosmology |journal=Science |date=3 January 2003 |volume=299 |issue=5603 |pages=65&amp;ndash;69 |bibcode=2003Sci...299...65K |doi=10.1126/science.1075631 |pmid=12511641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy density''' is the amount of [[energy]] stored in a given system or region of space per unit [[volume]]. Colloquially it may also be used for energy per unit [[mass]], though the accurate term for this is [[specific energy]].  Often only the ''useful'' or extractable energy is measured, which is to say that inaccessible energy (such as [[rest mass]] energy) is ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec04.html |title=The Two Classes of SI Units and the SI Prefixes |work=NIST Guide to the SI |publisher= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] and other [[general relativity|general relativistic]] contexts, however, the energy densities considered are those that correspond to the elements of the [[stress–energy tensor]] and therefore do include mass energy as well as energy densities associated with the pressures described in the next paragraph.

Energy per unit volume has the same physical units as [[pressure]], and in many circumstances is a [[synonym]]: for example, the energy density of a magnetic field may be expressed as (and behaves as) a physical pressure, and the energy required to compress a compressed gas a little more may be determined by multiplying the difference between the gas pressure and the external pressure by the change in volume. In short, pressure is a measure of the [[enthalpy]] per unit volume of a system. A pressure gradient has the potential to perform work on the surroundings by converting enthalpy to work until equilibrium is reached.

==Introduction to energy density==
&lt;!-- This section in intended for learners, and therefore covers only common materials, and omits excessive detail --&gt;

There are many different types of energy stored in materials, and it takes a particular type of reaction to release each type of energy. In order of the typical magnitude of the energy released, these types of reactions are: nuclear, chemical, electrochemical, and electrical.

[[Nuclear reaction]]s are used by stars and nuclear power plants, both of which derive energy from the binding energy of nuclei. [[Chemical reaction]]s are used by animals to derive energy from food, and by automobiles to derive energy from gasoline. Liquid hydrocarbons (fuels such as gasoline, diesel and kerozene) are today the most dense way known to economically store and  transport chemical energy at a very large scale (1 kg of diesel fuel burns with the oxygen contained in ~15 kg of air). [[Electrochemical reaction]]s are used by most mobile devices such as laptop computers and mobile phones to release the energy from batteries.

===Energy densities of common energy storage materials===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}

&lt;!-- STOP!!! This section is for a basic overview comparison of common energy storage materials. Before adding any items, first ask yourself: Is this material used on a large scale to produce energy, or is it commonly discussed in everyday journalism? If so, go ahead and add it! --&gt;

The following is a list of the thermal energy densities (that is to say: the amount of heat energy that can be extracted) of commonly used or well-known energy storage materials; it doesn't include uncommon or experimental materials. Note that this list does not consider the mass of reactants commonly available such as the oxygen required for combustion or the energy efficiency in use. An extended version of this table is found at [[Energy density#Extended Reference Table]].

The following unit conversions may be helpful when considering the data in the table: 3.6&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|MJ]] = 1&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] ≈ 1.34&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower-hour|HPh]].

==Energy density in energy storage and in fuel==
[[File:Energy density.svg|thumb|400px|Selected energy densities plot&lt;ref name=tzar1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar8 /&gt;]]

In [[energy storage]] applications the energy density relates the [[mass]] of an energy store to the volume of the storage facility, e.g. the [[fuel]] tank. The higher the energy density of the fuel, the more energy may be stored or transported for the same amount of volume. The energy density of a fuel per unit mass is called the [[specific energy]] of that fuel. In general an [[engine]] using that fuel will generate less [[kinetic energy]] due to [[inefficiency|inefficiencies]] and [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] considerations—hence the [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] of an engine will always be greater than its rate of production of the kinetic energy of motion.

===Nuclear energy sources===&lt;!--esoterica to most readers--&gt;
The greatest energy source by far is mass itself.  This energy, ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''m = ρV'', ''ρ'' is the mass per unit volume, ''V'' is the volume of the mass itself and ''c'' is the speed of light.  This energy, however, can be released only by the processes of [[nuclear fission]] (0.1%), [[nuclear fusion]] (1%), or the annihilation of some or all of the matter in the volume ''V'' by matter-[[antimatter]] collisions (100%).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  Nuclear reactions cannot be realized by chemical reactions such as combustion.  Although greater matter densities can be achieved, the density of a [[neutron star]] would approximate the most dense system capable of matter-antimatter annihilation possible.  A [[black hole]], although denser than a neutron star, does not have an equivalent anti-particle form, but would offer the same 100% conversion rate of mass to energy in the form of Hawking radiation. In the case of relatively small black holes (smaller than astronomical objects) the power output would be tremendous.

The highest density sources of energy aside from antimatter are [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] and [[Nuclear fission|fission]]. Fusion includes energy from the sun which will be available for billions of years (in the form of sunlight) but so far (2018), sustained [[fusion power]] production continues to be elusive. 

Power from fission of uranium and thorium in [[nuclear power]] plants will be available for many decades or even centuries because of the plentiful supply of the elements on earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Uranium-Resources/Supply-of-Uranium/ |title=Supply of Uranium |publisher=world-nuclear.org |date=2014-10-08 |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the full potential of this source can only be realised through [[breeder reactor]]s, which are, apart from the [[BN-600 reactor]], not yet used commercially.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/cohen.html |title=Facts from Cohen |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal]], [[gas]], and [[petroleum]] are the current primary energy sources in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pecss_diagram.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506022627/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pecss_diagram.html|archivedate=2010-05-06 |title=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) - Annual Energy Review |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have a much lower energy density. Burning local [[biomass]] fuels supplies household energy needs ([[Biomass Cook Stoves|cooking fires]], [[oil lamp]]s, etc.) worldwide. 

====Thermal power of nuclear fission reactors====
The density of thermal energy contained in the core of a [[light water reactor]] ([[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]] or [[Boiling water reactor|BWR]]) of typically 1 GWe (1 000 MW electrical corresponding to ~3 000 MW thermal) is in the range of 10 to 100 MW of thermal energy per cubic meter of cooling water depending on the location considered in the system (the core itself (~30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the reactor pressure vessel (~50 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), or the whole primary circuit (~300 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)). This represents a considerable density of energy which requires under all circumstances a continuous water flow at high velocity in order to be able to remove the [[heat]] from the core, even after an emergency shutdown of the reactor. The incapacity to cool the cores of three [[boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) at [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] in 2011 after the [[tsunami]] and the resulting loss of the external electrical power and of the cold source was the cause of the meltdown of the three cores in only a few hours. Meanwhile, the three reactors were correctly shut down just after the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]]. This extremely high power density distinguishes nuclear power plants (NPP's) from any thermal power plants (burning coal, fuel or gas) or any chemical plants and explains the large redundancy required to permanently control the [[Nuclear chain reaction|neutron reactivity]] and to remove the residual heat from the core of NPP's.

===Broad implications===
Energy density differs from [[energy conversion efficiency]] (net output per input) or [[embodied energy]] (the energy output costs to provide, as [[energy industry|harvesting]], [[Oil refinery|refining]], distributing, and dealing with [[pollution]] all use energy). Large scale, intensive energy use impacts and is impacted by [[climate]], [[nuclear waste|waste storage]], and [[deforestation|environmental consequences]].

No single energy storage method boasts the best in [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]], [[specific energy]], and energy density. [[Peukert's Law]] describes how the amount of useful energy that can be obtained (for a lead-acid cell) depends on how quickly we pull it out.  To maximize both specific energy and energy density, one can compute the [[specific energy|specific energy density]] of a substance by multiplying the two values together, where the higher the number, the better the substance is at storing energy efficiently.

Alternative options are discussed for energy storage to increase energy density and decrease charging time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ionescu-Zanetti|first1=C.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Nanogap capacitors: Sensitivity to sample permittivity changes|date=2005|volume=99|issue=2|doi=10.1063/1.2161818|bibcode=2006JAP....99b4305I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naoi|first1=K.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=New generation "nanohybrid supercapacitor".|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=2013|doi=10.1021/ar200308h}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubler|first1=A.|last2=Osuagwu|first2=O.|title=Digital quantum batteries: Energy and information storage in nanovacuum tube arrays|journal=Complexity|date=2010|volume=15|issue=5|doi=10.1002/cplx.20306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyon|first1=D.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Gap size dependence of the dielectric strength in nano vacuum gaps|journal=: IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation|date=2013|volume=2|issue=4|doi=10.1109/TDEI.2013.6571470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gravimetric]] and [[volumetric]] energy density of some fuels and storage technologies (modified from the [[Gasoline]] article):
:Note: Some values may not be precise because of [[isomers]] or other irregularities.  See [[Heating value]] for a comprehensive table of specific energies of important fuels.
:Note: Also it is important to realise that generally the density values for chemical fuels do not include the weight of oxygen required for combustion. This is typically two oxygen atoms per carbon atom, and one per two hydrogen atoms. The [[atomic weight]] of carbon and oxygen are similar, while hydrogen is much lighter than oxygen. Figures are presented this way for those fuels where in practice air would only be drawn in locally to the burner. This explains the apparently lower energy density of materials that already include their own oxidiser (such as gunpowder and TNT), where the mass of the oxidiser in effect adds dead weight, and absorbs some of the energy of combustion to dissociate and liberate oxygen to continue the reaction. This also explains some apparent anomalies, such as the energy density of a sandwich appearing to be higher than that of a stick of dynamite.

===Energy densities ignoring external components===
This table lists energy densities of systems that require external components, such as oxidisers or a heat sink or source. These figures do not take into account the mass and volume of the required components as they are assumed to be freely available and present in the atmosphere. Such systems cannot be compared with self-contained systems. These values may not be computed at the same reference conditions.
&lt;!-- To ensure this table sorts correctly: avoid using "-" or unicode dash in columns with numbers; ensure each row has a single numeric value, use data-sort-value="0" |  if unknown; do not use ? or {{?}}; do not use "A to B", nor "C (approximately)"; provide a cite for each value.

==Energy density of electric and magnetic fields==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Special relativity]] --&gt;
[[Electric field|Electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s store energy.  In a vacuum, the (volumetric) energy density is given by

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2} \mathbf{E}^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu_0} \mathbf{B}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''E''' is the [[electric field]] and '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]]. The solution will be (in SI units) in Joules per cubic metre. In the context of [[magnetohydrodynamics]], the physics of conductive fluids, the magnetic energy density behaves like an additional [[pressure]] that adds to the [[kinetic theory of gas|gas pressure]] of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

In normal (linear and nondispersive) substances, the energy density (in SI units) is

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{1}{2} ( \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{H} \cdot \mathbf{B} ) &lt;/math&gt;

where '''D''' is the [[electric displacement field]] and '''H''' is the [[Effective magnetic field|magnetizing field]].

In the case of absence of magnetic fields, by exploting [[Herbert Fröhlich|Fröhlich's relationships]] it is also possible to extend these equations to [[anisotropic|anisotropy]] and [[nonlinear|nonlinearity]] dielectrics, as well as to calculate the correlated [[Helmholtz free energy]] and [[entropy]] densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Parravicini | first1 = J. | doi = 10.1016/j.physb.2018.04.029 | title = Thermodynamic potentials in anisotropic and nonlinear dielectrics | journal = Physica B | volume = 541 | pages = 54-60 | year = 2018 | bibcode = 2018PhyB..541...54P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum mechanics]], [[energy]] is defined in terms of the '''energy operator''', acting on the [[wave function]] of the system as a consequence of [[time translation symmetry]].

==Definition==

It is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Quantum Mechanics Demystified, D. McMahon, Mc Graw Hill (USA), 2006, {{ISBN|0-07-145546-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{E} = i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

It acts on the wave function (the [[probability amplitude]] for different [[Configuration space (physics)|configurations]] of the system)

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Application==

The energy operator [[correspondence principle|corresponds]] to the full energy of a system. The [[Schrödinger equation]] describes the space- and time-dependence of the slow changing (non-[[theory of relativity|relativistic]]) wave function of a quantum system. The solution of this equation for a bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an [[energy level]]) which results in the concept of [[quantum|quanta]].

===Schrödinger equation===
Using the energy operator to the [[Schrödinger equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) = \hat H \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

can be obtained:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp; \hat{E}\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) = \hat{H} \Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]], ''ħ'' is the [[reduced Planck constant]], and &lt;math&gt;\hat H&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] [[operator (physics)|operator]].

In a [[stationary state]] additionally occurs the time-independent [[Schrödinger equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp; E \Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is an [[eigenvalue]] of energy.
===Klein–Gordon equation===

The [[Mass in special relativity#The relativistic energy-momentum equation|relativistic mass-energy relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where again ''E'' = total energy, ''p'' = total 3-[[momentum]] of the particle, ''m'' = [[invariant mass]], and ''c'' = [[speed of light]], can similarly yield the [[Klein–Gordon equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp; \hat{E}^2 = c^2\hat{p}^2 + (mc^2)^2 \\
&amp; \hat{E}^2\Psi = c^2\hat{p}^2\Psi + (mc^2)^2\Psi \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2} =  c^2\nabla^2\Psi - \left(\frac{mc^2}{\hbar}\right)^2\Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation==

The energy operator is easily derived from using the [[free particle]] wave function ([[plane wave]] solution to Schrödinger's equation).&lt;ref&gt;Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles (2nd Edition), R. Resnick, R. Eisberg, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1985, {{ISBN|978-0-471-87373-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in one dimension the wave function is

:&lt;math&gt; \Psi = e^{i(kx-\omega t)} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The time derivative of ''Ψ'' is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -i \omega e^{i(kx-\omega t)} = - i \omega \Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[De Broglie relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; E=\hbar \omega \,\!&lt;/math&gt;,

we have

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = - i \frac{E}{\hbar} \Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Re-arranging the equation leads to

:&lt;math&gt; E\Psi = i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;,

where the energy factor ''E'' is a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] value, the energy the particle has and the value that is measured. The [[partial derivative]] is a [[linear operator]] so this expression ''is'' the operator for energy:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{E} = i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial t} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be concluded that the scalar ''E'' is the [[eigenvalue]] of the operator, while &lt;math&gt; \hat{E} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the operator. Summarizing these results:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{E}\Psi = i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\Psi=E\Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For a 3-d plane wave

:&lt;math&gt; \Psi = e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

the derivation is exactly identical, as no change is made to the term including time and therefore the time derivative. Since the [[linear operator|operator is linear]], they are valid for any [[linear combination]] of plane waves, and so they can act on any wave function without affecting the properties of the wave function or operators. Hence this must be true for any wave function. It turns out to work even in [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], such as the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] above.

[[Andreas Cellarius]], German mathematician and cartographer (1596–1665), conceived an Atlas of the Universe, published in 1660, under the title of ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]''. Numerous illustrations of the solar system appear in this atlas by different authors known at that time. Referring to Ptolemy, Cellarius called the representation of this Ptolemaic conception of heaven as "Imago universi secundum Ptolaeum"

''Imago'' is a word in [[Latin]] which means'' 'image''' or even "representation". Therefore, the title expresses the "Picture of the Universe according to Ptolemy." The Latin expression was used in the Middle Ages to express the representation and size of the known world at that time.

''Imago Universi'' is also the title, in Latin, of a [[cosmography|cosmographic]] treatise, written in 2013 by the Spanish scientist Gabriel Barceló.

After analyzing the history of cosmology, the treatise delves into the prevailing scientific lack of explanation of the rotation of the heavenly bodies in the laws of dynamic behaviour of the sidereal system. The author proposes the application of the [[Theory of Dynamic Interactions]] (TID) to astrophysics, in particular, the dynamics of stellar systems and galaxies. This theory allows new comprehension of the dynamics of nature and understands the dynamic equilibrium of the universe, always subjected to rotational accelerations, but repetitive and persistent. The author also highlights that the orbiting always coincides with the intrinsic rotation of celestial bodies. Paradox incorporating the book, noting that this had not been found to date.

'''Nature-based solutions''' ('''NBS''' or '''NbS''') refers to the [[sustainable management]] and use of nature for tackling socio-environmental challenges. The challenges include issues such as [[climate change]], [[water security]], [[water pollution]], [[food security]], [[human health]], and [[disaster]] [[risk]] management. 

A definition by the [[European Union]] states that these solutions are "inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build [[Resilience (engineering and construction)|resilience]]. The [http://www.naturebasedsolutionsinitiative.org/about/ Nature-based Solutions Initiative] meanwhile defines them as "actions that work with and enhance nature so as to help people adapt to change and disasters". Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.think-nature.eu/|title=thinknature|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With NBS, healthy, resilient and diverse [[ecosystems]] (whether natural, managed or newly created) can provide solutions for the benefit of societies and overall [[biodiversity]].

For instance, the restoration or protection of [[mangroves]] along coastlines utilizes a nature-based solution to accomplish several things. Mangroves moderate the impact of waves and wind on coastal settlements or cities and sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt; . They also provide safe nurseries for marine life that can be the basis for sustaining populations of fish that local populations may depend on. Additionally, the mangrove forests can help control coastal erosion resulting from sea level rise. Similarly, in cities [[green roofs]] or walls are nature-based solutions that can be used to moderate the impact of high temperatures, capture storm water, abate [[pollution]], and act as carbon sinks, while enhancing [[biodiversity]].

Conservation approaches and environment management initiatives have been carried out for decades. What is new is that the benefits of such nature-based solutions to human well-being have been articulated well more recently. Even if the term itself is still being framed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-12|title=‘Nature-based solutions’ is the latest green jargon that means more than you might think|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/541133b|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=541|issue=7636|pages=133–134|doi=10.1038/541133b|bibcode=2017Natur.541R.133.}}&lt;/ref&gt; examples of nature-based solutions can be found all over the world, and imitated. Nature-based solutions are on their way to being mainstreamed in national and international policies and programmes (e.g. climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} For example, the theme for [[World Water Day]] 2018 was "Nature for water" and by [[UN-Water]]'s accompanying [[UN World Water Development Report]] had the title "Nature-based Solutions for Water".&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

Societies increasingly face challenges such as [[climate change]], [[urbanization]], jeopardized [[food security]] and [[water resource]] provision, and [[disaster]] [[risk]]. One approach to answer these challenges is to singularly rely on technological strategies. An alternative approach is to manage the [[Socio-ecological system|(socio-)ecological systems]] in a comprehensive way in order to sustain and potentially increase the delivery of ecosystem services to humans. In this context, nature-based solutions (NBS) have recently been put forward by practitioners and quickly thereafter by [[policymakers]]. These solutions stress the sustainable use of nature in solving coupled environmental-social-economic challenges. 

While [[ecosystem services]] are often valued in terms of immediate benefits to human well-being and economy, NBS focus on the benefits to people and the environment itself, to allow for sustainable solutions that are able to respond to environmental change and [[hazard]]s in the long-term. NBS go beyond the traditional biodiversity conservation and management principles by "re-focusing" the debate on humans and specifically integrating societal factors such as human well-being and [[poverty reduction]], [[Socioeconomic development|socio-economic development]], and [[governance]] principles. 

With respect to water issues, NBS can achieve the following, according to the [[World Water Development Report]] 2018 by [[UN-Water]]:&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Use natural processes to enhance water availability (e.g., [[soil]] moisture retention, [[groundwater recharge]]),  
* Improve [[water quality]] (e.g., [[Wetland|natural wetlands]] and [[constructed wetlands]] to treat [[wastewater]], [[riparian buffer]] strips), and  
* Reduce risks associated with water‐related disasters and climate change (e.g., [[floodplain restoration]], [[green roofs]]).

Likewise, natural infrastructure is defined as a "strategically planned and managed network of natural lands, such as forests and wetlands, working landscapes, and other open spaces that conserves or enhances ecosystem values and functions and provides associated benefits to human populations";&lt;ref name="Smith5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ozment6" /&gt; and [[green infrastructure]] refers to an "interconnected network of green spaces that conserves natural systems and provides assorted benefits to human populations".&lt;ref name="Benedict7" /&gt;

Similarly, the concept of [[ecological engineering]] generally refers to "protecting, restoring (i.e. ecosystem restoration) or modifying ecological systems to increase the quantity, quality and sustainability of particular services they provide, or to build new ecological systems that provide services that would otherwise be provided through more conventional engineering, based on non-renewable resources".&lt;ref name="Borsje8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barot9" /&gt;

== Objectives and framing ==

The general objective of NBS is clear, namely the sustainable management and use of nature for tackling societal challenges.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2016. Resolution 077 World Conservation Congress 2016, Hawai’i (https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077)
17. European Commission. 2016. Horizon2020 Work Programme 2016–2017 – 12. Climate action, environment, resource efficiency &amp; raw materials, 99 pp. (http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-climate_en.pdf)
&lt;/ref&gt; However, different stakeholders view NBS from other perspectives.&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"&gt;Eggermont, H., E. Balian, J. M.N. Azevedo, V. Beumer, T. Brodin, J. Claudet, B. Fady, M. Grube, H. Keune, P. Lamarque, K. Reuter, M. Smitt, C. Van Ham, W.W. Weisser, X. Le Roux. 2015. Nature-based solutions: New influence for Environmental Management and Research in Europe. GAIA Ecological Perspectives 24/4: 243–248.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[IUCN]]&lt;ref name="IUCN16"&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2016. Resolution 077 World Conservation Congress 2016, Hawai’i (https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077)&lt;/ref&gt; defines NBS as "actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits". This framing puts the need for well-managed and restored ecosystems at the heart of NBS, with the overarching goal of "Supporting the achievement of society's development goals and safeguard human well-being in ways that reflect cultural and societal values and enhance the resilience of ecosystems, their capacity for renewal and the provision of services". 

In the context of the ongoing political debate on jobs and growth (main drivers of the current EU policy agenda), the European Commission underlines that NBS can transform environmental and societal challenges into innovation opportunities, by turning [[natural capital]] into a source for green growth and sustainable development.&lt;ref name="European Commission 2015" /&gt; In their view, NBS to societal challenges are "solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;European Commission. 2016. Horizon2020 Work Programme 2016–2017 – 12. Climate action, environment, resource efficiency &amp; raw materials, 99 pp. (http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-climate_en.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;" 

This framing is somewhat broader, and puts economy and social assets at the heart of NBS as importantly as sustaining environmental conditions. It shares similarities with the definition proposed by Maes and Jacobs (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Maes, J., S. Jacobs. 2015. Conservation Letters {{doi|10.1111/conl.12216}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining NBS as "any transition to a use of ES with decreased input of non-renewable natural capital and increased investment in renewable natural processes". In their view, development and evaluation of NBS spans three basic requirements: (1) decrease of fossil fuel input per produced unit; (2) lowering of systemic trade-offs and increasing synergies between ES; and (3) increasing labor input and jobs. Here, nature is seen as a tool to inspire more systemic solutions to societal problems.

Whatever definition used, promoting sustainability and the increased role of natural, self-sustained processes relying on [[biodiversity]], are inherent to NBS. They constitute actions easily seen as positive for a wide range of stakeholders, as they bring about benefits at environmental, economic and social levels. As a consequence, the concept of NBS is gaining acceptance outside the conservation community (e.g. urban planning) and is now on its way to be mainstreamed into policies and programmes (climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Types ==

[[File:Fig 2 NbS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.46|Schematic presentation of the NBS typology.&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"/&gt;]]

In 2015,&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"/&gt; the European network [http://www.biodiversa.org BiodivERsA] mobilized a range of scientists, research donors and stakeholders and proposed a typology characterizing NBS along two gradients. 1. "how much engineering of biodiversity and ecosystems is involved in NBS", and 2. "how many ecosystem services and stakeholder groups are targeted by a given NBS". The typology highlights that NBS can involve very different actions on ecosystems (from protection to management and even creation of new ecosystems) and is based on the assumption that the higher the number of services and stakeholder groups targeted, the lower the capacity to maximize the delivery of each service and simultaneously fulfil the specific needs of all stakeholder groups. As such, three types of NBS are distinguished (Figure 2):

=== Type 1 – Minimal intervention in ecosystems ===
Type 1 NBS consists of no or minimal intervention in ecosystems, with the objectives of maintaining or improving the delivery of a range of ES both inside and outside of these conserved ecosystems. Examples include the protection of mangroves in coastal areas to limit risks associated to extreme weather conditions and provide benefits and opportunities to local populations; and the establishment of marine protected areas to conserve biodiversity within these areas while exporting biomass into fishing grounds. This type of NBS is connected to, for example, the concept of [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|biosphere reserves]] which incorporates core protected areas for nature conservation and buffer zones and transition areas where people live and work in a sustainable way.

=== Type 2 – Some interventions in ecosystems and landscapes ===
Type 2 NBS corresponds to management approaches that develop sustainable and multifunctional ecosystems and landscapes (extensively or intensively managed). These types improve the delivery of selected ES compared to what would be obtained with a more conventional intervention. Examples include innovative planning of agricultural landscapes to increase their multi-functionality; and approaches for enhancing tree species and genetic diversity to increase forest resilience to extreme events. This type of NBS is strongly connected to concepts like natural systems agriculture,&lt;ref name="Jackson1" /&gt; agro-ecology,&lt;ref&gt;Alteri, M.A. 1989. Agroecology – a new research and development paradigm for world agriculture. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment 27: 37–36.&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary-orientated forestry.&lt;ref&gt;Lefèvre F. et al. 2014. Considering evolutionary processes in adaptive forestry. Annals of Forest Science 71: 723 – 739.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Type 3 – Managing ecosystems in extensive ways ===
Type 3 NBS consists of managing ecosystems in very extensive ways or even creating new ecosystems (e.g., artificial ecosystems with new assemblages of organisms for green roofs and walls to mitigate city warming and clean polluted air). Type 3 is linked to concepts like green and blue infrastructures and objectives like restoration of heavily degraded or polluted areas and greening cities.

Type 1 and 2 would typically fall within the IUCN NBS framework, whereas Type 2 and moreover Type 3 are often exemplified by EC for turning natural capital into a source for green growth and sustainable development.

=== Hybrid solutions ===
Hybrid solutions exist along this gradient both in space and time. For instance, at landscape scale, mixing protected and managed areas could be needed to fulfil multi-functionality and sustainability goals. Similarly, a [[constructed wetland]] can be developed as a type 3 but, when well established, may subsequently be preserved and surveyed as a type 1.

== Examples ==

Demonstrating the benefits of nature and healthy ecosystems and showcasing the return on investment they can offer is necessary in order to increase awareness, but also to provide support and guidance on how to implement NBS. A large number of initiatives around the world already highlight the effectiveness of NBS approaches to address a wide range of societal challenges.

==== East Kolkata wetlands ====
In 2018, [[The Hindu]] reported that the [[East Kolkata wetlands]], the world's largest organic sewage treatment facility had been used to clean the sewage of Kolkata in an organic manner by using algae for several decades. In use since the 1930s, the natural system was discovered by Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, an ecologist and a municipal engineer in the 1970s while working in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/wetlands-will-weep-today-1502586927.html|title=The wetlands will weep today|last1=Ghatak|first1=Aditi Roy|date=17 February 2018|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghosh worked for decades to protect the wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhrubajyoti.net/publ/Dr.%20Ghosh_changemaker.pdf|title=The Calcutta Wetlands: turning bad water into good|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dhrubajyoti|website=www.dhrubajyoti.net|publisher=Changemakers (issue October 2008)|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been a practice in [[Kolkata]], one of the five largest cities in [[India]], for the municipal authorities to pump sewage into shallow ponds (''bheris'').&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dhrubajyoti.net/Final%20Ecosystem%20Book.pdf|title=Ecosystem management – towards merging theory and practice|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dhrubajyoti|date=2 October 2014|publisher=Nimby books|isbn=9788190657044|location=New delhi|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the heat of the tropical sun, algae proliferated in them, converting the sewage into clean water, which in turn was used by villagers to grow paddy and vegetables. This system has been in use in the region since the 1930s and treats 750 million litres of [[wastewater]] per day, giving livelihood to 100,000 people in the vicinity.&lt;ref name="kol"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aseem|first1=Shrivastava|title=The ecologically subsidised city: on Kolkata's wetland communities|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-ecologically-subsidised-city/article22970933.ece|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Hindu|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For his work, Ghosh was included in the UN Global 500 Roll of Honour in 1990 and received the [[Luc Hoffmann]] award in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global500.org/index.php/year/1990?start=100|title=Global 500 environmental forum|website=www.global500.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical implementation ==
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2018}}
There is currently no accepted basis on which a government agency, municipality or private company can systematically assess the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of a particular nature-based solution. However, a series of principles are proposed to guide effective and appropriate implementation, and thus to upscale NBS in practice. For example, NBS embrace and are not meant to replace nature conservation norms. Also, NBS are determined by site-specific natural and cultural contexts that include traditional, local and scientific knowledge. NBS are an integral part of the overall design of policies, and measure or actions, to address a specific challenges. Finally, NBS can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions to societal challenges (e.g. technological and engineering solutions) and they are applied at the landscape scale.

Implementing NBS requires political, economic, and scientific challenges to be tackled. First and foremost, private sector investment is needed, not to replace but to supplement traditional sources of capital such as public funding or [[philanthropy]]. The challenge is therefore to provide a robust evidence base for the contribution of nature to economic growth and jobs, and to demonstrate the economic viability of these solutions – compared to technological ones – on a timescale compatible with that of global change. Furthermore, it requires measures like adaptation of economic subsidy schemes, and the creation of opportunities for [[conservation finance]], to name a few. Indeed, such measures will be needed to scale up NBS interventions, and strengthen their impact in mitigating the world's most pressing challenges.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Projects supported by the European Union ===
Since 2016, the EU is supporting a multi-stakeholder dialogue platform (called ThinkNature) to promote the co-design, testing and deployment of improved and innovative NBS in an integrated way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Creation of such science-policy-business-society interfaces could promote the market uptake of NBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolaidis|first=Nikolaos P.|last2=Kolokotsa|first2=Dionyssia|last3=Banwart|first3=Steven A.|date=2017-03-16|title=Nature-based solutions: business|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7645/full/543315d.html?foxtrotcallback=true|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=543|issue=7645|pages=315–315|doi=10.1038/543315d|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2017Natur.543..315N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is part of the EU’s Horizon 2020 – Research and Innovation programme, and will last for 3 years. There are a total of 17 international partners involved, including the Technical University of Crete (Project Leader), the University of Helsinki and BiodivERsA.

In 2017, as part of the Presidency of the [[Estonia|Estonian Republic]] of the [[Council of the European Union]], a conference called “Nature-based Solutions: From Innovation to Common-use” was organized by the Ministry of the Environment of Estonia and the University of Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nbs2017.eu/|title=Nature-Based Solutions, Tallinn, 24–26 October 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conference aimed to strengthen synergies among various recent initiatives and programs related to NBS launched by the European Commission and by the EU Member States, focusing on policy and governance of NBS, and on research and innovation.

=== Nature-based Solutions in the Paris Agreement ===
In recognition of the importance of natural ecosystems for mitigation and adaptation, the [http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf Paris Agreement] calls on all Parties to acknowledge “the importance of the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of the greenhouse gases” and to “note the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans, and the protection of biodiversity, recognized by some cultures as Mother Earth”. It then includes in its Articles several references to nature-based solutions. For example, Article 5.2 encourages Parties to adopt “…policy approaches and positive incentives for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation and sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while reaffirming the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with such approaches”. Article 7.1 further encourages Parties to build the resilience of socioeconomic and ecological systems, including through economic diversification and sustainable management of natural resources. In total, the Agreement refers to nature (ecosystems, natural resources, forests) in 13 distinct places. An in-depth analysis &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbspolicyplatform.org/|title=Nature-Based Solutions Policy Platform|website=www.nbspolicyplatform.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; of all Nationally Determined Contributions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/process/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions/ndc-registry|title=Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) {{!}} UNFCCC|website=unfccc.int|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to UNFCCC, revealed that around 130 NDCs or 65% of signatories commit to nature-based solutions in their climate pledges, suggesting broad consensus for the role of nature in helping meet climate change goals. However, high-level commitments rarely translate into robust, measurable actions on-the-ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=July 2016|title=Ecosystem-based adaptation: a win–win formula for sustainability in a warming world?|url=http://pubs.iied.org/17364IIED/?k=Ecosystem-based+Adaptation+EbA&amp;p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term NBS was put forward by practitioners in the late 2000s (in particular the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] and the [[World Bank]]) and thereafter by policymakers in Europe (most notably the [[European Commission]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faivre|first=Nicolas|last2=Fritz|first2=Marco|last3=Freitas|first3=Tiago|last4=Boissezon|first4=Birgit de|last5=Vandewoestijne|first5=Sofie|title=Nature-Based Solutions in the EU: Innovating with nature to address social, economic and environmental challenges|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.032|journal=Environmental Research|volume=159|pages=509–518|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.032|bibcode=2017ER....159..509F}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "nature-based solutions" was first used in the late 2000s.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon11"&gt;MacKinnon, K., C. Sobrevila, V. Hickey. 2008. Biodiversity, climate change and adaptation: nature-based solutions from the Word Bank portfolio. Washington D.C.: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittermeier12"&gt;Mittermeier, R. et al. 2008. A Climate For Life: Meeting the Global Challenge. Arlington, VA: International League of Conservation Photographers.&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in the context of finding new solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change effects, whilst simultaneously protecting biodiversity and improving sustainable livelihoods. 

The IUCN referred to NBS in a position paper for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2009. No time to lose – make full use of nature-based solutions in the post-2012 climate change regime. Position paper on the Fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 15). Gland: IUCN.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also adopted by European policymakers, in particular by the European Commission in a report&lt;ref name="European Commission 2015"&gt;European Commission. 2015. Towards an EU Research and Innovation policy agenda for nature-based solutions &amp; re-naturing cities. Final Report of the Horizon2020 Expert Group on Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing Cities. Brussels: European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; stressing that NBS can offer innovative means to create jobs and growth as part of a green economy. The term started to make appearances in the mainstream media around the time of the Global Climate Action Summit in California in September 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nathalieseddon.blogspot.com/2018/09/global-climate-action-summit-kicks-off.html|title=Global Climate Action Summit kicks off today in San Francisco with nature-based solutions high on the agenda|website=Global Climate Action Summit kicks off today in San Francisco with nature-based solutions high on the agenda|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting information is then available, given a suitable [[open license]], for statistical analysis and for building numerical [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|models]], including [[open energy system models]].  Permissive licenses like [[Creative Commons]] [[CC0]] and {{nowrap|[[CC BY]]}} are preferred, but some projects will house data made public under market transparency regulations and carrying unqualified [[copyright]].

The databases themselves may furnish information on national power plant fleets, renewable generation assets, transmission networks, [[time series]] for electricity loads, dispatch, [[Spot contract|spot prices]], and cross-border trades, weather information, and similar.  They may also offer other energy statistics including fossil fuel imports and exports, gas, oil, and coal prices, emissions certificate prices, and information on [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] costs and benefits.

Much of the data is sourced from official or semi-official agencies, including [[Official statistics|national statistics offices]], [[transmission system operator]]s, and [[Electricity market|electricity market operators]].  Data is also [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] using public [[wiki]]s and public upload facilities.  Projects usually also maintain a strict record of the [[wiktionary:provenance|provenance]] and version histories of the datasets they hold.  Some projects, as part of their mandate, also try to persuade primary data providers to release their data under more liberal licensing conditions.{{efn|For example, in 2016 the [[#Open Power System Data|Open Power System Data]] project persuaded four German [[transmission system operator]]s to adopt open licensing.&lt;ref name="osi-2016"/&gt;}}

Two drivers favor the establishment of such databases.  The first is a wish to reduce the duplication of effort that accompanies each new analytical project as it assembles and processes the data that it needs from primary sources.  And the second is an increasing desire to make [[public policy]] energy models more transparent to improve their acceptance by policymakers and the public.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Better transparency dictates the use of open information, able to be accessed and scrutinized by third-parties, in addition to releasing the [[source code]] for the models in question.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"/&gt;

&lt;!-- The projects listed here are deemed suitable for inclusion through having pending or published academic literature or by being reported in secondary sources. --&gt;

== General considerations ==

=== Background ===

In the mid-1990s, energy models used structured text files for data interchange but efforts were being made to migrate to [[relational database management system]]s for data processing.&lt;ref name="groscurth-1995-075bf0"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | date = 1 July 1995

 | pages = 445–457
 | doi = 10.1080/00908319508946093
 | issn = 0090-8312
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  These early efforts however remained local to a project and did not involve online publishing or open data principles.

The first energy information portal to go live was [[#OpenEI|OpenEI]] in late 2009, followed by [[#reegle|reegle]] in 2011.

A 2012 paper marks the first scientific publication to advocate the [[crowdsourcing]] of energy data.&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"&gt;

 | access-date = 2016-06-17
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2012 PhD thesis by Chris Davis also discusses the crowdsourcing of energy data in some depth.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;  A 2016 thesis surveyed the spatial ([[geographic information system|GIS]]) information requirements for energy planning and finds that most types of data, with the exception of energy expenditure data, are available but nonetheless remain scattered and poorly coordinated.&lt;ref name="berndtsson-2016-msc"&gt;
{{cite thesis

 | access-date = 2017-03-07
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of open data, a 2017 paper concludes that energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | access-date = 2017-02-03
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213–214}}  The paper also lists the benefits of open data and open models and discusses the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|211–213}}  A one-page opinion piece from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"&gt;&lt;!-- alternative url: http://www.nature.com/news/energy-scientists-must-show-their-workings-1.21517 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Database design ===

[[Data models]] are central to the design and organization of databases.  Open energy database projects generally try to develop and adhere to well resolved data models, using [[De facto standard|de{{nbsp}}facto]] and [[Technical standard|published standards]] where applicable.  Some projects attempt to coordinate their data models in order to harmonize their data and improve its utility.  Defining and maintaining suitable [[metadata]] is also a key issue.  The [[Information lifecycle management|life-cycle management]] of data includes, but is not limited to, the use of [[version control]] to track the provenance of incoming and [[Data cleansing|cleansed]] data.  Some sites allow users to comment on and rate individual datasets.

=== Dataset copyright and database rights ===

Issues surrounding [[copyright]] remain at the forefront with regard to open energy data.  As noted, most energy datasets are collated and published by official or semi-official sources.  But many of the publicly available energy datasets carry no license, limiting their reuse in numerical and statistical models, open or otherwise.  Copyright protected material cannot lawfully be circulated, nor can it be modified and republished.

{{anchor|ec-regulation-543-2013}}Measures to enforce [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] have not helped much because the associated information is again not licensed to enable modification and republication.  Transparency measures include the 2013 European energy market transparency regulation 543/2013.&lt;ref name="ec-regulation-543-2013"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | author = European Commission
 | title = Commission Regulation (EU) No 543/2013 of 14 June 2013 on submission and publication of data in electricity markets and amending Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council
 | date = 15 June 2013
 | journal = Official Journal of the European Union
 | volume = L&amp;nbsp;163
 | pages = 1–12
 | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:163:0001:0012:EN:PDF
 | access-date = 2016-12-01
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, 543/2013 "is only an obligation to publish, not an obligation to license".&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"/&gt;{{rp|slide{{nnbsp}}14}}  Notwithstanding, 543/2013 does enable downloaded data to be computer processed with legal certainty.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

Energy databases with hardware located with the European Union are protected under a general [[Sui generis database right|database law]], irrespective of the legal status of the information they hold.&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"&gt;
{{cite book
 | first1 = Lina | last1 = Boecker

 | access-date = 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Database rights not waived by public sector providers significantly restrict the amount of data a user can lawfully access.

A December 2017 submission by energy researchers in Germany and elsewhere highlighted a number of concerns over the re-use of public sector information within the Europe Union.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2017"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Morrison | first1 = Robbie
 | last2 = Brown | first2 = Tom
 | last3 = De Felice | first3 = Matteo
 | title = Submission on the re-use of public sector information: with an emphasis on energy system datasets — Release 09

 | access-date = 2017-12-13
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The submission drew heavily on a recent legal opinion covering electricity data.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Jaeger | first1 = Till
 | title = Legal aspects of European electricity data — Legal opinion
 | date = 24 July 2017
 | publisher = JBB Rechtsanwälte
 | location = Berlin, Germany
 | url = https://open-power-system-data.org/legal-opinion.pdf
 | access-date = 2017-10-13
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy statistics ===

National and international energy statistics are published regularly by governments and international agencies, such as the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]].&lt;ref name="iea-2016"&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Key world energy statistics
 | date = 2016
 | publisher = International Energy Agency (IEA)
 | location = Paris, France
 | url = https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf
 | access-date = 2016-12-15
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016 the United Nations issued guidelines for energy statistics.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"&gt;&lt;!-- print ISBN: 978-92-1-161584-5 --&gt;
&lt;!-- PDF dated: 23 September 2016  --&gt;
{{cite book|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/IRES_edited2.pdf|title=International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES) — ST/ESA/STAT/SER.M/93|date=2016|publisher=Statistics Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations|isbn=978-92-1-056520-2|location=New York, NY, USA|access-date=2016-12-17}}  Annotated as final edited version prior to typesetting.  Also covers energy-related greenhouse gas emissions accounting.
&lt;/ref&gt;  While the definitions and sectoral breakdowns are useful when defining models, the information provided is rarely in sufficient detail to enable its use in high-resolution energy system models.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|213}}

=== Published standards ===

There are few published standards covering the collection and structuring of high-resolution energy system data.  The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[Common Information Model (electricity)|Common Information Model]] (CIM) defines data exchange protocols for low and high voltage electricity networks.

== Open energy system database projects ==

Energy system models are data intensive and normally require detailed information from a number of sources.  Dedicated projects to collect, collate, document, and republish energy system datasets have arisen to service this need.  Most database projects prefer open data, issued under [[Copyright|free licenses]], but some will accept datasets with proprietary licenses in the absence of other options.

The [[OpenStreetMap]] project, which uses the [[Open Database License]] (ODbL), contains geographic information about energy system components, including transmission lines.  Wikipedia itself has a growing set of information related to national energy systems, including descriptions of individual power stations.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;{{rp|156–159}}

The following [[#table-open-energy-system-database-projects|table]] summarizes projects that specifically publish open energy system data.  Some are general repositories while others (for instance, [[#oedb|oedb]]) are designed to interact with open energy system models in real-time.

The energydata.info project from the [[World Bank Group]], [[Washington, DC]], USA is an energy database portal designed to support national development by improving public access to energy information.&lt;ref name="energydata-info-website"&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as sharing data, the platform also offers tools to visualize and analyze energy data.  Although the World Bank Group has made available a number of dataset and apps, external users and organizations are encouraged to contribute.  The concepts of open data and open source development are central to the project.  energydata.info uses its own [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the [[CKAN]] open source data portal as its web-based platform.  The Creative Commons [[Creative Commons license|CC BY 4.0]] license is preferred for data but other open licenses can be deployed. Users are also bound by the terms of use for the site.&lt;ref name="energydata-info-terms-of-use"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2017|01}}, the database held 131{{nbsp}}datasets, the great majority related to [[Developing country|developing countries]].  The datasets are tagged and can be easily filtered.  A number of download formats, including [[Geographic information system|GIS]] files, are supported: [[Comma-separated values|CSV]], [[Microsoft Excel|XLS]], [[Office Open XML|XLSX]], [[ArcGIS]], [[Esri]], [[GeoJSON]], [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]], and [[Shapefile|SHP]].  Some datasets are also offered as [[HTML]].  Again, {{as of|lc=yes|2017|01}}, four apps are available.  Some are web-based and run from a browser.

The OpenEnergy Platform (OEP) is a collaborative versioned [[dataset]] repository for storing open energy system model datasets.  A dataset is presumed to be in the form of a [[table (database)|database table]], together with [[metadata]].  Registered users can upload and download datasets manually using a web-interface or programmatically via an [[Application programming interface|API]] using [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] calls.  Uploaded datasets are screened for integrity using deterministic rules and then subject to confirmation by a moderator.  The use of versioning means that any prior state of the database can be accessed (as recommended in this 2012 paper).&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the repository is specifically designed to interoperate with energy system models.  The [[Front and back ends|backend]] is a [[PostgreSQL]] [[object-relational database]] under [[Apache Subversion|subversion]] [[version control]].  Open source licenses are specific to each dataset.  Unlike other database projects, users can download the current version (the public tables) of the entire [[PostgreSQL]] database or any previous version.  Initial development is being lead by the Reiner Lemoine Institute, [[Berlin]], Germany.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The platform was originally implemented by the [[University of Flensburg]], [[German Institute for Economic Research|DIW Berlin]], the [[Technical University of Berlin]], and the energy economics consultancy Neon Neue Energieökonomik, all from Germany.  The first phase of the project, from August 2015 to July 2017, was funded by the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy]] (BMWi) for {{val|490000|p=€}}.&lt;ref name="fischer-2015"&gt;

Developers collate and harmonize data from a range of government, regulatory, and industry sources throughout Europe.  The website and the metadata utilize English, whereas the original material can be in any one of [[Languages of European Union|24{{nbsp}}languages]].  Datasets follow the emerging [[Comma-separated values#OKI frictionless tabular data package|frictionless data package]] standard being developed by [[Open Knowledge International]] (OKI).  The website was launched on 28{{nbsp}}October 2016.  {{as of|2018|06}}, the project offers the following primary packages, for Germany and other European countries:

* details, including [[geolocation]], of conventional power plants and renewable energy power plants
* aggregated generation capacity by technology and country
* hourly [[time series]] covering electrical load, day-ahead electricity spot prices, and wind and solar resources
* a script to filter and download [[NASA]] MERRA-2 satellite weather data{{efn|name=merra-2|
MERRA-2 stands for Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2.  The [[Remote sensing|remote-sensed]] data is provided unencumbered by the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] research laboratory.

* electricity demand and self-generation time series for representative south German households
* simulated [[Photovoltaics|PV]] and wind generation [[capacity factor]] time series for Europe, generated by the [[#Renewables.ninja|Renewables.ninja]] project

To facilitate analysis, the data is aggregated into large structured files (in [[comma-separated values|CSV]] format) and loaded into data packages with standardized machine-readable metadata (in [[JSON]] format).&lt;ref name="oki-data-package"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  While much of its data is from US government sources, the platform is intended to be open and global in scope.

OpenEI provides two mechanisms for contributing structured information: a [[semantic wiki]] (using [[MediaWiki]] and the [[Semantic MediaWiki]] extension) for collaboratively-managed resources and a [[dataset]] upload facility for contributor-controlled resources.  US government data is distributed under a [[CC0]] [[public domain]] dedication, whereas other contributors are free to select an open data license of their choice.  Users can rate data using a five-star system, based on accessibility, adaptability, usefulness, and general quality.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt;  Individual datasets can be manually downloaded in an appropriate format, often as [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] files.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt; [[Scripting language|Scripts]] for processing data can also be shared through the site.  In order to build a community around the platform, a number of [[Internet forum|forums]] are offered covering energy system data and related topics.&lt;ref name="openei-homepage"/&gt;

OpenGridMap provides a tailored [[Geographic information system|GIS]] web application, layered on [[OpenStreetMap]], which contributors can use to upload and edit information directly.  The same database automatically stores field recordings submitted by the mobile app.  Subsequent classification by experts allows normal citizens to document and photograph electrical components and have them correctly identified.  The project is experimenting with the use of hobby drones to obtain better information on associated facilities, such as [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] installations.  Transmission line data is also sourced from and shared with OpenStreetMap.  Each component [[Row (database)|record]] is verified by a moderator.

Once sufficient data is available, the transnet software is run to produce a likely network, using [[Correlation and dependence|statistical correlation]], [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi partitioning]], and [[minimum spanning tree]] (MST) algorithms.  The resulting network can be exported in [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] (separate files for nodes and lines), [[XML]], and [[Common Information Model (electricity)|CIM]] formats.  CIM models are well suited for translation into software-specific data formats for further analysis, including [[Power system simulation|power grid simulation]].  Transnet also displays [[descriptive statistics]] about the resulting network for visual confirmation.&lt;ref name="rivera-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|3–5}}

The project is motivated by the need to provide datasets for high-resolution energy system models, so that energy system transitions (like the German ''[[Energiewende]]'') can be better managed, both technically and policy-wise.&lt;ref name="energate-messenger-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapid expansion of [[Renewable energy|renewable generation]] and the anticipated uptake of [[electric vehicle]]s means that electricity system models must increasingly represent distribution and transmission networks in some detail.

{{as of|2017}}, OpenGridMap techniques have been used to estimate the low voltage network in the German city of [[Garching bei München|Garching]] and to estimate the high voltage grids in several other countries.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally released as a specialized [[internet search engine]], reegle was relaunched in 2011 as an information portal.

reegle offers and utilizes [[linked data#linked open data|linked open data]] (LOD) (described [[#tag-linked-open-data|elsewhere]] on this page).&lt;ref name="bauer-and-kaltenboeck-2012"/&gt;{{rp|43–46}}  Sources of data include [[United Nations|UN]] and [[World Bank]] databases, as well as dedicated partners around the world.  reegle maintains a comprehensive structured [[glossary]] (driven by an LOD-compliant [[Thesaurus (information retrieval)|thesaurus]]) of energy and climate compatible development terms to assist with the tagging of datasets.  The glossary also facilitates intelligent web searches.{{efn|
Alternative interfaces to the glossary, provided by the Climate Tagger project, include a [http://www.climatetagger.net/climate-thesaurus/tree tree view] and an [http://www.climatetagger.net/glossary alphabetic view].

[[Renewables.ninja]] is a website that can calculate the hourly power output from [[photovoltaics|solar photovoltaic]] installations and [[wind farm]]s located anywhere in the world.  The website is a joint project between the [https://www.usys.ethz.ch/en/ Department of Environmental Systems Science], [[ETH Zurich]], [[Zürich]], Switzerland and the [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/environmental-policy/ Centre for Environmental Policy], [[Imperial College London]], [[London]], United Kingdom.  The website went live during September 2016.  The resulting time series are provided under a Creative Commons {{nowrap|CC BY-NC 4.0}} license and the underlying power plant models are published using a [[BSD-new]] license.  {{as of|2017|02}}, only the solar model, written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], has been released.&lt;ref name="renewables-ninja-website"&gt;

The project relies on weather data derived from [[meteorological reanalysis]] models and weather [[Meteosat|satellite images]].  More specifically, it uses the 2016 MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset from [[NASA]]{{nnbsp}}{{efn|name=merra-2}} and satellite images from CM-SAF SARAH.&lt;ref name="mueller-etal-2015"&gt;

The website displays an interactive world map to aid the selection of a site.  Users can then choose a plant type and enter some technical characteristics.  {{as of|2017|02}}, only year 2014 data can be served, due to technical restrictions.  The results are automatically plotted and are available for download in hourly [[comma separated values|CSV]] format with or without the associated weather information.  The site offers an [[Application programming interface|API]] for programmatic dataset recovery using token-based authorization.  Examples deploying [[cURL]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are provided.

A number of studies have been undertaking using the power production datasets underpinning the website (these studies predate the launch of the website), with the bulk focusing on energy options for [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="staffel-and-green-2014"&gt;

                 Wikipedia outlines are
              a special type of list article.
              They make up one of Wikipedia's

'''Patterns in nature''' are visible regularities of form found in the natural world. These [[patterns]] recur in different contexts and can sometimes be [[modelled mathematically]]. Natural patterns include [[symmetries]], [[trees]], [[spirals]], [[meanders]], [[wave]]s, [[foams]], [[tessellations]], [[fracture|cracks]] and stripes.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=3}} Early [[Greek philosophers]] studied pattern, with [[Plato]], [[Pythagoras]] and [[Empedocles]] attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.

In the 19th century, Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] examined [[soap film]]s, leading him to formulate the concept of a [[minimal surface]]. German biologist and artist [[Ernst Haeckel]] painted hundreds of [[Marine biology|marine organisms]] to emphasise their [[symmetry]]. Scottish biologist [[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician [[Alan Turing]] predicted mechanisms of [[morphogenesis]] which give rise to [[Turing patterns|patterns]] of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] and French American mathematician [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] showed how the mathematics of [[fractals]] could create plant growth patterns.

[[Mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] can explain patterns in nature at different levels. Patterns in living things are explained by the [[biology|biological]] processes of [[natural selection]] and [[sexual selection]]. Studies of [[pattern formation]] make use of [[computer models]] to simulate a wide range of patterns.

==History==
[[File:Cycas circinalis male cone in Olomouc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fibonacci]] patterns occur widely in plant structures, including this cone of queen sago, ''[[Cycas circinalis]]'']]

Early Greek philosophers attempted to explain order in [[nature]], anticipating modern concepts. [[Plato]] (c. 427 – c. 347 BC) — looking only at his work on natural patterns — argued for the existence of [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]]. He considered these to consist of [[Theory of Forms|ideal forms]] ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}} ''eidos'': "form") of which physical objects are never more than imperfect copies. Thus, a flower may be roughly circular, but it is never a perfect mathematical circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/ | title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher=Stanford University | work=Platonism in Metaphysics | origyear=2004 | date=7 April 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2012 | author=Balaguer, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pythagoras]] explained patterns in nature like the harmonies of music as arising from number, which he took to be the basic constituent of existence.&lt;ref&gt;The so-called Pythagoreans, who were the first to take up mathematics, not only advanced this subject, but saturated with it, they fancied that the principles of mathematics were the principles of all things. [[Aristotle]], ''Metaphysics 1–5 '', cc. 350 BC&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empedocles]] to an extent anticipated [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s evolutionary explanation for the structures of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle reports Empedocles arguing that, "[w]herever, then, everything turned out as it would have if it were happening for a purpose, there the creatures survived, being accidentally compounded in a suitable way; but where this did not happen, the creatures perished." ''The Physics'', B8, 198b29 in Kirk, et al., 304).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1202, [[Fibonacci|Leonardo Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 – c. 1250) introduced the Fibonacci number sequence to the western world with his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Parmanand. ''Acharya Hemachandra and the (so called) Fibonacci Numbers''. Math. Ed. Siwan, 20(1):28–30, 1986. {{issn|0047-6269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibonacci gave an (unrealistic) biological example, on the growth in numbers of a theoretical [[rabbit]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Knott | first = Ron | title = Fibonacci's Rabbits | url=http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat.html#Rabbits | publisher =[[University of Surrey]] Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1658, the English physician and philosopher [[Sir Thomas Browne]] discussed "how Nature Geometrizeth" in ''[[The Garden of Cyrus]]'', citing [[Pythagorean numerology]] involving the number 5, and the [[Platonic form]] of the [[quincunx]] pattern. The discourse's central chapter features examples and observations of the [[quincunx]] in botany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Browne, Thomas |authorlink=Sir Thomas Browne |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/gardennoframes/garden3.html |title=How Nature Geometrizeth |work=[[The Garden of Cyrus]] |date=1658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] (1860–1948) published his book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''. His description of [[phyllotaxis]] and the [[Fibonacci sequence]], the mathematical relationships in the spiral growth patterns of plants, is classic. He showed that simple equations could describe all the apparently complex spiral growth patterns of [[animal horn]]s and [[mollusc shell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darcythompson.org/about.html About D'Arcy]. D' Arcy 150. [[University of Dundee]] and the [[University of St Andrews]]. Retrieved 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] (1801–1883) formulated the [[Plateau's problem|mathematical problem]] of the existence of a [[minimal surface]] with a given boundary, which is now named after him. He studied soap films intensively, formulating [[Plateau's laws]] which describe the structures formed by films in foams.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

The German psychologist [[Adolf Zeising]] (1810–1876) claimed that the [[golden ratio]] was expressed in the arrangement of plant parts, in the [[skeleton]]s of animals and the branching patterns of their veins and nerves, as well as in the geometry of [[crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Proportion | author=Padovan, Richard | authorlink=Richard Padovan | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | date=1999 | isbn=978-0-419-22780-9 | pages=305–306 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vk_CQULdAssC&amp;pg=PA306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nexus Network Journal | first=Richard | last=Padovan | authorlink=Richard Padovan | title=Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture | volume=4 | pages=113–122 | doi=10.1007/s00004-001-0008-7 | date=2002 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Adolf | last=Zeising | title=Neue Lehre van den Proportionen des meschlischen Körpers |date=1854 | page=preface | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919) painted beautiful illustrations of marine organisms, in particular [[Radiolaria]], emphasising their [[symmetry]] to support his faux-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] theories of evolution.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=41}}

The American photographer [[Wilson Bentley]] (1865–1931) took the first micrograph of a [[snowflake]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography | volume=1 | first=John | last=Hannavy | publisher=CRC Press | date=2007 | isbn=978-0-415-97235-2 | page=149 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=PJ8DHBay4_EC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=wilson+bentley+january+15#v=onepage&amp;q=wilson%20bentley%20january%2015&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drcy.svg|thumb|[[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth and form in his 1917 book]]
In 1952, [[Alan Turing]] (1912–1954), better known for his work on computing and [[codebreaking]], wrote ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]'', an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref name=Turing&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Turing | first= A. M. | authorlink=Alan Turing | title = The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | volume = 237 | pages = 37–72 | date = 1952 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | issue= 641| bibcode = 1952RSPTB.237...37T }}&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted [[Chemical clock|oscillating]] [[chemical reaction]]s, in particular the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]]. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns (dubbed "[[Turing pattern]]s") of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=163, 247–250}}

In 1968, the Hungarian theoretical biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] (1925–1989) developed the [[L-system]], a [[formal grammar]] which can be used to model [[plant development|plant growth patterns]] in the style of [[fractal]]s.&lt;ref name=L&gt;[[Rozenberg, Grzegorz]]; Salomaa, Arto. ''The Mathematical Theory of L Systems''. [[Academic Press]], New York, 1980. {{isbn|0-12-597140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; L-systems have an [[alphabet]] of symbols that can be combined using [[Formal grammar|production rules]] to build larger strings of symbols, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. In 1975, after centuries of slow development of the mathematics of patterns by [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Helge von Koch]], [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and others, [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] wrote a famous paper, ''[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension]]'', crystallising mathematical thought into the concept of the [[fractal]].&lt;ref name=Mandelbrot/&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Aphids and live young under Sycamore leaf.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Composite patterns: [[aphids]] and newly born young in arraylike clusters on [[sycamore]] leaf, divided into [[polygon]]s by [[vein (botany)|veins]], which are avoided by the young aphids]]

Living things like [[orchid]]s, [[hummingbird]]s, and the [[Structural coloration|peacock's tail]] have abstract designs with a beauty of form, pattern and colour that artists struggle to match.&lt;ref name=ForbesGuardian&gt;Forbes, Peter. ''All that useless beauty''. The Guardian. Review: Non-fiction. 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The beauty that people perceive in nature has causes at different levels, notably in the mathematics that governs what patterns can physically form, and among living things in the effects of natural selection, that govern how patterns evolve.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=222}}

[[Mathematics]] seeks to discover and explain abstract patterns or regularities of all kinds.&lt;ref name=Steen&gt;[[Lynn Steen|Steen, L.A.]]. ''The Science of Patterns''. [[Science (journal)|Science]], 240: 611–616, 1998. [http://www.ascd.org/publications/curriculum-handbook/409/chapters/The-Future-of-Mathematics-Education.aspx Summary at ascd.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Devlin&gt;[[Keith Devlin|Devlin, Keith]]. ''Mathematics: The Science of Patterns: The Search for Order in Life, Mind and the Universe'' (Scientific American Paperback Library) 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
Visual patterns in nature find explanations in [[chaos theory]], fractals, logarithmic spirals, topology and other mathematical patterns. For example, [[L-system]]s form convincing models of different patterns of tree growth.&lt;ref name=L/&gt;
[[File:Dragon trees.jpg|thumb|The growth patterns of certain trees resemble these [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals.]]

The laws of [[physics]] apply the abstractions of mathematics to the real world, often as if it were [[perfection#Physics and chemistry|perfect]]. For example, a [[crystal]] is perfect when it has no structural defects such as dislocations and is fully symmetric. Exact mathematical perfection can only approximate real objects.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz, Władysław]]. ''Perfection in the Sciences. II. Perfection in Physics and Chemistry'', Dialectics and Humanism, vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Visible patterns in nature are governed by [[physical law]]s; for example, [[meander]]s can be explained using [[fluid dynamics]].

In [[biology]], [[natural selection]] can cause the development of patterns in living things for several reasons, including [[camouflage]],&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]]. ''On the Origin of Species''. 1859, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sexual selection]],&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4/&gt; and different kinds of signalling, including [[mimicry]]&lt;ref name=Wickler&gt;{{cite book |last=Wickler |first=Wolfgang |authorlink=Wolfgang Wickler |date=1968 |title=Mimicry in plants and animals |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cleaning symbiosis]].&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter&gt;Poulin, R.; Grutter, A.S.

''Bioscience'' 46(7): 512–517. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In plants, the shapes, colours, and patterns of [[insect pollination|insect-pollinated]] [[flowers]] like the [[Lilium|lily]] have evolved to attract insects such as [[European honey bee|bees]]. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as [[nectar guides]] that can be seen at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plantphys.info/plants_human/pollenadapt.shtml | title=Plant Physiology Information Website | publisher=Ross Koning | work=Pollination Adaptations | date=1994 | accessdate=May 2, 2012 | author=Koning, Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Symmetry in biology|Floral symmetry|Crystal symmetry}}

[[Symmetry]] is pervasive in living things. Animals mainly have bilateral or [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as do the leaves of plants and some flowers such as [[orchid]]s.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=48–49}} Plants often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], as do many flowers and some groups of animals such as [[sea anemone]]s.

Among non-living things, [[snowflake]]s have striking [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]; each flake's structure forms a record of the varying conditions during its crystallization, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=52}} [[Crystal]]s in general have a variety of symmetries and [[crystal habit]]s; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike [[quasicrystals]]).{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=82–84}} Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things, including the crown-shaped [[Splash (fluid mechanics)|splash]] pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond,{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=60}} and both the [[spheroidal]] shape and rings of a [[planet]] like [[Saturn]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=71}}

Symmetry has a variety of causes. Radial symmetry suits organisms like sea anemones whose adults do not move: food and threats may arrive from any direction. But animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialised with a mouth and sense organs ([[cephalisation]]), and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric (though internal organs need not be).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://biocongroup.eu/DA/Calendario_files/Bilateria.pdf | title=Animal Diversity | edition=Third | publisher=McGraw-Hill | work=Chapter 8: Acoelomate Bilateral Animals | date=2002 | accessdate=October 25, 2012 | author=Hickman, Cleveland P. | author2=Roberts, Larry S. | author3=Larson, Allan | pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; More puzzling is the reason for the fivefold (pentaradiate) symmetry of the echinoderms. Early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical, as their larvae still are. Sumrall and Wray argue that the loss of the old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=4500143 | title=Ontogeny in the fossil record: diversification of body plans and the evolution of "aberrant" symmetry in Paleozoic echinoderms | author=Sumrall, Colin D. | author2=Wray, Gregory A. | journal=Paleobiology |date=January 2007 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=149–163 |doi=10.1666/06053.1}} &lt;!--http://www.psjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1666/06053.1--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trees, fractals ===

[[Fractal]]s are infinitely [[self-similarity|self-similar]], iterated mathematical constructs having [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandelbrot, Benoît B. | title=The fractal geometry of nature| date=1983 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Falconer | first = Kenneth | authorlink=Kenneth Falconer (mathematician) | title = Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications | publisher = John Wiley | date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patterns"&gt;{{Cite book | title=Fractals:The Patterns of Chaos | last=Briggs | first=John | authorlink= |date= 1992|publisher= Thames and Hudson |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinite [[iteration]] is not possible in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, the leaves of [[fern]]s and [[umbellifer]]s (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including [[bryozoa]], [[coral]]s, [[hydrozoa]] like the [[air fern]], ''Sertularia argentea'', and in non-living things, notably [[electrical discharge]]s. [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying a small number of parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points ([[Internode (botany)|internode]] length), and number of branches per branch point.&lt;ref name=L/&gt;

=== Spirals ===
{{further|phyllotaxis}}

[[Spirals]] are common in plants and in some animals, notably [[molluscs]]. For example, in the [[nautilus]], a cephalopod mollusc, each [[Camera (cephalopod)|chamber]] of its shell is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a [[logarithmic spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;Maor, Eli. ''e: The Story of a Number''. Princeton University Press, 2009. Page 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral can be seen as a special case of self-similarity.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=29–32}}

Plant spirals can be seen in [[phyllotaxis]], the arrangement of leaves on a stem, and in the arrangement ([[parastichy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/Lattices/SpiralLattices.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526030701/http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/Lattices/SpiralLattices.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=26 May 2010 | title=Spiral Lattices &amp; Parastichy | publisher=Smith College | accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) of other parts as in [[compositae|composite]] [[flower|flower heads]] and [[seed|seed heads]] like the [[sunflower]] or [[fruit]] structures like the [[pineapple]]&lt;ref name=Kappraff&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/1904/19040335.pdf | title=Growth in Plants: A Study in Number | author=Kappraff, Jay | journal=Forma | date=2004 | volume=19 | pages=335–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|337}} and [[salak|snake fruit]], as well as in the pattern of scales in [[pine cones]], where multiple spirals run both clockwise and anticlockwise. These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology – each individually correct, but all necessary together.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=13}} Phyllotaxis spirals can be generated mathematically from [[Fibonacci]] ratios: the Fibonacci sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones). For example, when leaves alternate up a stem, one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves, so the pattern or ratio is 1/2. In [[hazel]] the ratio is 1/3; in [[apricot]] it is 2/5; in [[pear]] it is 3/8; in [[almond]] it is 5/13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to geometry|first=H. S. M. |last=Coxeter|author-link =Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|publisher =Wiley|date=1961|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In disc phyllotaxis as in the [[sunflower]] and [[Bellis perennis|daisy]], the florets are arranged in [[Fermat's spiral]] with Fibonacci numbering, at least when the flowerhead is mature so all the elements are the same size. Fibonacci ratios approximate the [[golden angle]], 137.508°, which governs the curvature of Fermat's spiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Prusinkiewicz | first =Przemyslaw | authorlink =Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz |author2=Lindenmayer, Aristid |authorlink2=Aristid Lindenmayer | title =The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants | publisher =Springer-Verlag | date =1990 | pages =101–107 | url =http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#webdocs | isbn = 978-0-387-97297-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy configurations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levitov LS |title=Energetic Approach to Phyllotaxis |journal=Europhys.

Phyllotaxis is controlled by [[protein]]s that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone [[auxin]], which activates [[meristem]] growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=163, 249–250}} From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Kappraff/&gt;

=== Chaos, flow, meanders ===

In mathematics, a [[dynamical system]] is chaotic if it is (highly) sensitive to initial conditions (the so-called "[[butterfly effect]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz|first=Edward N. |authorlink=Edward Norton Lorenz |title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |date=March 1963 |volume=20|issue=2 |pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2 | doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2| bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which requires the mathematical properties of [[topological mixing]] and [[dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |date=1999 |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside fractals, [[chaos theory]] ranks as an essentially universal influence on patterns in nature. There is a relationship between chaos and fractals—the ''[[strange attractors]]'' in chaotic systems have a [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruelle, David. ''Chance and Chaos''. Princeton University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[cellular automata]], simple sets of mathematical rules that generate patterns, have chaotic behaviour, notably [[Stephen Wolfram]]'s [[Rule 30]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Stephen. ''[[A New Kind of Science]]''. Wolfram Media, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vortex street]]s are zigzagging patterns of whirling [[Vortex|vortices]] created by the unsteady [[flow separation|separation of flow]] of a [[fluid]], most often air or water, over obstructing objects.&lt;ref&gt;von Kármán, Theodore. ''Aerodynamics''. McGraw-Hill (1963): {{isbn|978-0070676022}}. Dover (1994): {{isbn|978-0486434858}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth ([[Laminar flow|laminar]]) flow starts to break up when the size of the obstruction or the velocity of the flow become large enough compared to the [[viscosity]] of the fluid.

[[Meander]]s are sinuous bends in rivers or other channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As soon as the path is slightly curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as [[helical flow]] drags material like sand and gravel across the river to the inside of the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so [[erosion]] accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful [[positive feedback loop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jacques | last=Lewalle | title=Lecture Notes in Incompressible Fluid Dynamics: Phenomenology, Concepts and Analytical Tools | chapter=Flow Separation and Secondary Flow: Section 9.1 | url=http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | date=2006 | location=Syracuse, NY | publisher=Syracuse University | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929075022/http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-29 | df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waves, dunes ===

[[Wave]]s are disturbances that carry energy as they move. [[Mechanical wave]]s propagate through a medium – air or water, making it [[Oscillation|oscillate]] as they pass by.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P. ''Vibrations and Waves''. Nelson Thornes, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind wave]]s are sea [[surface wave]]s that create the characteristic chaotic pattern of any large body of water, though their statistical behaviour can be predicted with wind wave models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=H.L. | last=Tolman | contribution=Practical wind wave modeling | title=CBMS Conference Proceedings on Water Waves: Theory and Experiment | date=2008 | location=Howard University, USA, 13–18 May 2008 | publisher=World Scientific Publ. | url=http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn270/Howard_08.pdf | editor-first=M.F. | editor-last=Mahmood}}&lt;/ref&gt; As waves in water or wind pass over sand, they create patterns of ripples. When winds blow over large bodies of sand, they create [[dune]]s, sometimes in extensive dune fields as in the [[Taklamakan]] desert. Dunes may form a range of patterns including crescents, very long straight lines, stars, domes, parabolas, and longitudinal or seif ('sword') shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/ | title=Types of Dunes | publisher=USGS | date=29 October 1997 | accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barchan]]s or crescent dunes are produced by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the [[slip face]] point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the [[angle of repose]] of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand [[avalanche]]s, which is a [[nonlinear]] behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then the addition of a further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;Strahler, A. &amp; Archibold, O.W. ''Physical Geography: Science and Systems of the Human Environment''. John Wiley, 4th edition 2008. Page 442.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like [[soliton|solitary waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Schwämmle, V. | author2=Herrman, H.J. | title=Solitary wave behaviour of sand dunes| journal=Nature | volume=426 | issue=Dec. 11 | date=2003 | pages=619–620 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/426619a Abstract] | doi=10.1038/426619a | pmid=14668849|bibcode = 2003Natur.426..619S }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bubbles, foam===

A [[soap bubble]] forms a [[sphere]], a [[minimal surface|surface with minimal area]] — the smallest possible surface area for the volume enclosed. Two bubbles together form a more complex shape: the outer surfaces of both bubbles are spherical; these surfaces are joined by a third spherical surface as the smaller bubble bulges slightly into the larger one.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

A [[foam]] is a mass of bubbles; foams of different materials occur in nature. Foams composed of [[soap film]]s obey [[Plateau's laws]], which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120° and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at the [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] angle of about 109.5°. Plateau's laws further require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant [[mean curvature|average curvature]] at every point. For example, a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved up in one direction (say, left to right) while being curved downwards in another direction (say, front to back).{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=68}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and [[Jean E. Taylor]], ''The geometry of soap films and soap bubbles'', Scientific American, vol. 235, pp. 82–93, July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. [[Lord Kelvin]] identified the problem of the most efficient way to pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887; his solution uses just one solid, the [[bitruncated cubic honeycomb]] with very slightly curved faces to meet Plateau's laws. No better solution was found until 1993 when Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]]; the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]] adapted the structure for their outer wall in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=73–76}}

At the scale of living [[cell (biology)|cells]], foam patterns are common; [[radiolarian]]s, [[sponge]] [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s, [[silicoflagellate]] [[exoskeleton]]s and the calcite skeleton of a [[sea urchin]], ''[[Cidaris rugosa]]'', all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=96–101}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/indexmag.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artfeb05/cbdiatoms.html | title=Geometry and Pattern in Nature 3: The holes in radiolarian and diatom tests | publisher=Microscopy-UK | date=February 2005 | accessdate=May 28, 2012 | author=Brodie, Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skeleton of the [[Radiolarian]], ''Aulonia hexagona'', a beautiful marine form drawn by [[Ernst Haeckel]], looks as if it is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The [[Euler characteristic]] states that for any [[convex polyhedron]], the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a [[Euler characteristic#Soccer ball|soccer ball]], [[Buckminster Fuller]] [[geodesic dome]], or [[fullerene]] molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=51–54}}

=== Tessellations ===
{{main|tessellation}}

[[Tessellation]]s are patterns formed by repeating [[tile]]s all over a flat surface. There are 17 [[wallpaper group]]s of tilings.&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;{{cite book | last=Armstrong | first=M.A. | title=Groups and Symmetry | date=1988 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; While common in art and design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social [[wasp]]s, and the wax cells in [[honeycomb]] built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the [[pangolin]], or fruits like the [[salak]] are protected by overlapping scales or [[osteoderms]], these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, ''[[Fritillaria meleagris]]'', have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of [[minerals]] provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite the hundreds of thousands of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a [[crystal]], defined by [[crystal structure]], [[crystal system]], and [[point group]]; for example, there are exactly 14 [[Bravais lattices]] for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"&gt;Hook, J.R.; Hall, H.E.

=== Cracks ===

[[Fracture|Cracks]] are linear openings that form in materials to relieve [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]. When an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks meet at a node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress in the same direction would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=207}} In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=208}}

===Spots, stripes===

Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; angelfish and zebras are striped.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}} These patterns have an [[evolution]]ary explanation: they have [[Function (biology)|functions]] which increase the chances that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is [[camouflage]];&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4/&gt; for instance, a [[leopard]] that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is [[Signalling theory|signalling]]&lt;ref name=Wickler/&gt; — for instance, a [[ladybird]] is less likely to be attacked by [[predator]]y birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also [[Aposematism|distastefully bitter or poisonous]], or [[Mimicry|mimics]] other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting [[gene]]s that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}}

===Pattern formation===
{{main|Pattern formation}}

Alan Turing,&lt;ref name=Turing/&gt; and later the mathematical biologist [[James D. Murray|James Murray]],&lt;ref name="Murray2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=James D.|title=Mathematical Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3LmCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-662-08539-4|pages=436–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a [[reaction-diffusion]] system.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}} The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a [[morphogen]], resulting in the growth of a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be [[feedback]] control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create [[standing wave]] patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]] is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a [[chemical oscillator]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}}

Later research has managed to create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes, giraffe blotches, jaguar spots (medium-dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings) and ladybird shell patterns (different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes, see illustrations).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=168–180}} [[Richard Prum]]'s activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables to account for the observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots and an array of dots.{{sfn|Rothenberg|2011|pages=93–95}}&lt;ref name=Prum/&gt;{{rp|6}} More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl ''[[Numida meleagris]]'' in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.&lt;ref name=Prum&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.yale.edu/eeb/prum/pdf/Prum%20&amp;%20Williamson%202002.pdf | title=Reaction–diffusion models of within-feather pigmentation patterning | author=Prum, Richard O. |author1link=Richard Prum | author2=Williamson, Scott | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B | date=2002 | volume=269 | issue=1493 | pages=781–792 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1896| pmid=11958709 | pmc=1690965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

Patterns can form for other reasons in the [[patterned vegetation|vegetated landscape]] of [[tiger bush]]&lt;ref name=TigerBush&gt;{{cite book | title=Banded vegetation patterning in arid and semiarid environments | publisher=Springer-Verlag | author=Tongway, D.J. | author2=Valentin, C. | author3=Seghieri, J. | last-author-amp=yes | date=2001 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fir wave]]s.&lt;ref name=FirWave&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tiee.esa.org/vol/v1/figure_sets/disturb/disturb_back4.html | title=Fir Waves: Regeneration in New England Conifer Forests | publisher=TIEE | date=22 February 2004 | accessdate=26 May 2012 | author=D'Avanzo, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger bush stripes occur on arid slopes where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it.&lt;ref name=TigerBush/&gt; Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn more likely to be damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees.&lt;ref name=FirWave/&gt; Natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals, as in the [[Mima mounds]] of the Northwestern United States and some other areas, which appear to be created over many years by the burrowing activities of [[pocket gopher]]s,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |last=Morelle |first=Rebecca |title=‘Digital gophers’ solve Mima mound mystery |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25259133 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the so-called [[fairy circle]]s of Namibia appear to be created by the interaction of competing groups of sand termites, along with competition for water among the desert plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sample|first1=Ian|title=The secret of Namibia's 'fairy circles' may be explained at last|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/18/the-secret-of-namibias-fairy-circles-may-be-explained-at-last|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In permafrost soils with an active upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, [[patterned ground]] can form, creating circles, nets, [[ice wedge]] polygons, steps, and stripes. [[Thermal contraction]] causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into wedges. These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Permafrost: Patterned Ground |url=http://permafrosttunnel.crrel.usace.army.mil/permafrost/patterned_ground.html |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gyrification|fissured pattern]] that develops on vertebrate brains are caused by a physical process of constrained expansion dependent on two geometric parameters: relative tangential cortical expansion and relative thickness of the [[cerebellar cortex|cortex]]. Similar patterns of [[Gyrus|gyri]] (peaks) and [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] (troughs) have been demonstrated in models of the brain starting from smooth, layered gels, with the patterns caused by compressive mechanical forces resulting from the expansion of the outer layer (representing the cortex) after the addition of a solvent. Numerical models in computer simulations support natural and experimental observations that the surface folding patterns increase in larger brains.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-brain-s-bizarre-folding-pattern-re-created-in-a-vat/|last1=Ghose|first1=Tia|title=Human Brain's Bizarre Folding Pattern Re-Created in a Vat|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tallinen|first1=Tuoma|last2=Chung|first2=Jun Young|last3=Biggins|first3= John S.|last4=Mahadevan|first4=L.|title=Gyrification from constrained cortical expansion|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=35|pages=12667–12672|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
