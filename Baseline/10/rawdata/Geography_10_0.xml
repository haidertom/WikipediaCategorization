[[File:Flora OR - aerial.jpg|thumb|right|The small town of [[Flora, Oregon]] in the United States is unincorporated, but is considered a populated place.]]
[[File:Taos Pueblo2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.13|[[Taos Pueblo]], an ancient [[pueblo]] belonging to a [[Taos language|Taos]]-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe of [[Pueblo people]]. It is approximately 1000 years old and lies about 1 mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) north of the modern city of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], [[New Mexico]].]]
In [[geography]], [[statistics]] and [[archaeology]], a '''settlement''', '''locality''' or '''populated place''' is a [[community]] in which people live. The complexity of a settlement can range from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding [[Urban area|urbanized areas]]. Settlements may include [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s, [[village]]s, [[town]]s and [[city|cities]].  A settlement may have known historical properties such as the date or era in which it was first settled, or first settled by  particular people.

In the field of [[geospatial predictive modeling]], settlements are "a city, town, village or other agglomeration of buildings where people live and work".&lt;ref name=Semantics&gt;{{cite book |title= GeoSpatial Semantics: 4th International Conference, GeoS 2011, Brest, France |url= http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00001928/01/062.pdf |chapter= A Facet-Based Methodology for Geo-Spatial Modeling |last= Dutta |first= Biswanath |author2=Fausto Giunchiglia |author3=Vincenzo Maltese |year= 2010 |page= 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A settlement conventionally includes its constructed facilities such as [[road]]s, [[enclosure]]s, [[field systems]], [[Boundaries in landscape history|boundary]] banks and [[ditch]]es, [[pond]]s, [[park]]s and [[wood]]s, [[windmill|wind]] and [[water mill]]s, [[manor house]]s, [[moat]]s and [[church (building)|church]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/msrg/msrgpolicy.htm  Medieval Settlement Research Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest remains that have been found of constructed dwellings are remains of huts that were made of mud and branches around 17,000&amp;nbsp;BC at the [[Ohalo]] site (now underwater) near the edge of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. The [[Natufian]]s built houses, also in the [[Levant]], around 10,000&amp;nbsp;BC. Remains of settlements such as [[village]]s become much more common after the invention of agriculture.

== In landscape history ==
[[File:Eoste Keldrimägi.JPG|thumb|Some settlement sites may go out of use. This location in [[Estonia]] was used for human settlement in 2nd half of first millennium and it is considered an [[archaeological record]], that may provide information on how people lived back then.]]
[[Landscape history]] studies the form (morphology) of settlements – for example whether they are [[dispersed settlement|dispersed]] or [[nucleated village|nucleated]]. [[Urban morphology]] can thus be considered a special type of cultural-historical landscape studies. Settlements can be ordered by size, centrality or other factors to define a [[settlement hierarchy]].

== Statistics ==

=== Australia ===
[[Geoscience Australia]] defines a populated place as "a named settlement with a population of 200 or more persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ga.gov.au/mapspecs/250k100k/appendixA_files/Habitation.jsp#Habitation%20Populated%20Place%20Point |title= NTMS Specifications (250K &amp; 100K): Populated place |publisher= [[Australian Government]] |accessdate= July 26, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110603115645/http://www.ga.gov.au/mapspecs/250k100k/appendixA_files/Habitation.jsp#Habitation%20Populated%20Place%20Point |archive-date= June 3, 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee for Geographical Names in Australasia]] used the term [[Suburbs and localities (Australia)|localities]] for rural areas, while the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] uses the term "urban centres/localities" for urban areas.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The [[Agency for Statistics in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] uses the term "populated place" for rural, and "municipality" and  "town" for urban areas.

=== Bulgaria ===
The Bulgarian Government publishes a National Register of Populated places (NRPP).

=== Canada ===
The Canadian government uses the term "populated place" in the ''[[Atlas of Canada]]'', but does not define it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/glossary/results.html?term= |title=Glossary Search Results |work=[[Atlas of Canada]] |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006185826/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/glossary/results.html?term= |archivedate=October 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Statistics Canada]] uses the term [[Census geographic units of Canada#Localities|localities]] for historical named locations.

=== Croatia ===
The [[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]] records population in units called [[settlement (Croatia)|settlements (''naselja'')]].

=== India ===
The Census Commission of [[India]] has a special definition of [[census town]]s.

=== Ireland ===
The  [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]] has a special definition of [[census town]]s.

=== Russia ===
There are various [[types of inhabited localities in Russia]].

=== Sweden ===
[[Statistics Sweden]] uses the term [[Urban areas in Sweden|localities (''tätort'')]] for various densely populated places. The common English-language translation is ''urban areas''.

=== United Kingdom ===
The UK [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] uses the term "urban settlement" to denote an [[urban area]] when analysing census information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/urbansettlement2001 Urban Settlement 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Registrar General for Scotland]] defines settlements as groups of one or more contiguous localities, which are determined according to [[population density]] and [[postcode]] areas. The Scottish settlements are used as one of several factors defining urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/the-census/key-stats-setloc-txt.pdf Scottish census information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218162030/http://gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/the-census/key-stats-setloc-txt.pdf |date=2010-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) has a [[Geographic Names Information System]] that defines three classes of human settlement:
# '''Populated place''' − [[Location (geography)|place]] or [[Area (country subdivision)|area]] with clustered or scattered [[building]]s and a permanent human [[population]] (city, settlement, town, village).  A populated place is usually not [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] and by definition has no legal boundaries. However, a populated place may have a corresponding "civil" record, the legal boundaries of which may or may not coincide with the perceived populated place.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:8:3692675055014428 |title= Feature Class Definitions |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate= July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Census''' − a statistical area delineated locally specifically for the tabulation of Census Bureau data (census designated place, census county division, unorganized territory, various types of American Indian/Alaska Native statistical areas).&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;
# '''Civil''' − a political division formed for administrative purposes ([[borough]], [[county]], [[Place (United States Census Bureau)|incorporated place]], [[municipio]], [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parish]], [[town]], [[township]])."&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

Populated places may be specifically defined in the context of [[census]]es and be different from general-purpose administrative entities, such as [[Place (United States Census Bureau)|"place" as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau]] or [[census-designated place]]s.

== Geospatial modeling ==
In the field of [[geospatial predictive modeling]], settlements are "a city, town, village, or other agglomeration of buildings where people live and work".&lt;ref name=Semantics&gt;{{cite book |title= GeoSpatial Semantics: 4th International Conference, GeoS 2011, Brest, France |url= http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00001928/01/062.pdf |chapter= A Facet-Based Methodology for Geo-Spatial Modeling |last= Dutta |first= Biswanath |author2=Fausto Giunchiglia |author3=Vincenzo Maltese |year= 2010 |page= 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Human Settlement Layer ([http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ GHSL]) framework produces global spatial information about the human presence on the planet over time. This in the form of built up maps, population density maps and settlement maps. This information is generated with evidence-based analytics and knowledge using new spatial data mining technologies. The framework uses heterogeneous data including global archives of fine-scale satellite imagery, census data, and volunteered geographic information. The data is processed fully automatically and generates analytics and knowledge reporting objectively and systematically about the presence of population and built-up infrastructures. The [http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ GHSL] operates in an open and free data and methods access policy (open input, open method, open output).

== Abandoned populated places ==

[[File:Namibie Kolmanskop 05.JPG|thumb|right|Abandoned buildings in [[Kolmanskop]], [[Namibia]]&lt;ref name="MapAtlas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mapatlas.org/Namibia/Abandoned_Populated_Place/Kolmanskop/3794/road_and_satellite_map |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415082058/http://en.mapatlas.org/Namibia/Abandoned_Populated_Place/Kolmanskop/3794/road_and_satellite_map |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 15, 2013 |title=Maps of Kolmanskop – Namibia 2012 |year=2012 |work=Map Atlas – Google Maps based atlas of the world |publisher=MapAtlas.org |accessdate=February 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The term "Abandoned populated places" is a ''Feature Designation Name'' in databases sourced by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]&lt;ref name="NGA Geonames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geonames.nga.mil/ggmagaz/feadesgsearchhtml.asp |title=Feature Designation Code Lookup |work=NGA: Geonames Search – OGC Viewer |publisher=[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] |location=Springfield, VA, USA |accessdate=February 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102121347/http://geonames.nga.mil/ggmagaz/feadesgsearchhtml.asp |archivedate=January 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GeoNames]].&lt;ref name="GeoNames"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geonames.org/export/codes.html#P.PPLQ |title=GeoNames Feature Codes |date=February 10, 2012 |work=GeoNames |publisher=[[GeoNames]]|accessdate=February 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Populated places can be abandoned.  Sometimes the structures are still easily accessible, such as in a [[ghost town]], and these may become tourist attractions. Some places that have the appearance of a ghost town, however, may still be defined as populated places by government entities.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

A town may become a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it has failed, because of a government action, such as the building of a dam that floods the town, or because of natural or human-caused disasters such as floods, uncontrolled lawlessness, or war. The term is sometimes used to refer to cities, towns, and neighborhoods that are still populated, but significantly less so than in years past.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

'''Landscape detailing''' describes the process of integrating soft landscape materials and hard landscape materials to create a [[landscape design]]. It requires knowledge of:
*[[Landscape architecture]]
*[[Landscape engineering]]
*[[Soft landscape materials]]
*[[Hard landscape materials]]
*[[Landscape products]]
Designing Landscape detailing can be boiled down to three different steps:Function, Structure, and Appearance. Function allows you to satisfy the requirements of the landscape to serve a purpose. Structure is the physical implementation of function through the best available resources; usually those of a local character. Appearance is about obtaining visual satisfaction, commonly known as aesthetic values.

Landscape detailing can influence the attitude and mood of a landscape. A study was conducted on how young people feel when in a natural oriented landscape versus an engineered habitat. The results showed that more structured landscapes are preferred in young people. Detailing in landscape allows the designer to make choices that help influence the landscape; allowing the potential to be shown.(1)

Landscape can have an influence on how communities and societies evolve and vice verse. Communities can shape how the landscape is used based on the needs of the community. We can see an example of this in Canada's landscape and the role the railroads had in shaping the community. With the introduction of the railroad, Canada's wild lands were more susceptible to exploitation. On the contrary to that, the railroad system also allowed the community to experience Canada's array of National Parks.(2)

Landscape detailing is not just limited to actual land, but can also be seen as a way to improve waterfront area; making the waterfront a more appealing setting for the public to enjoy. Typically when addressing the relationship of landscape detailing and water, we think of drainage and how the landscape can be manipulated to serve the user; as to prevent flooding and maintain water flows.(3)

With today's every expanding technologies, there has been an increase in ways to convey landscape detailing. The visualization tools can be split into two categories; traditional and computerized. Traditional ways to convey details in the landscape would be simply a pen/pencil, paper maps, and models; while the computerized way would to use GIS, 3D virtual modelling,or simulations using layers of photography to convey urban areas that have potential to be molded. (4)

Aesthetics are an important part of Landscape Detailing,the visual quality of a landscape is what is noticed by others and therefore the goal is to achieving pleasing aesthetic without creating a synthetic feel. Art and design are also qualities that enhance the landscape. Artistic influence has a direct role in planning a landscape.(5)

It is a sub-branch of the [[Queensland Museum]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/recreation/arts/heritage/museum-of-lands/collections/history|title=Museum history|last=|first=|date=13 March 2018|website=Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003100140/https://www.qld.gov.au/recreation/arts/heritage/museum-of-lands/collections/history|archive-date=3 October 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/About+Us/History|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Queensland Museum]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003101833/http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/About+Us/History|archive-date=3 October 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It actively digitises and makes available historic maps and aerial imagery under open licences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.qld.gov.au/dataset/historical-cadastral-map-seriesqueensland|title=Historical cadastral map series—Queensland|last=|first=|date=|website=Open Data Queensland|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land exploration and surveying has played a crucial role in the development of Queensland. Surveyors and cartographers played an active part in establishing Queensland's borders, physically surveying the land as well as creating maps, survey plans and registers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/recreation/arts/heritage/museum-of-lands/collections/services|title=Collections and services|last=|first=|date=21 September 2018|website=|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003192050/https://www.qld.gov.au/recreation/arts/heritage/museum-of-lands/collections/services|archive-date=4 October 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical input of the surveying and mapping industry to the development of Queensland is an important factor in the role the department plays in providing a valuable resource for a wide range of community interests and government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In its short history the museum has established a comprehensive collection, housing many important maps, survey plans and artefacts, significant to the history of mapping, surveying and land development particularly in Queensland.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The museum acquires, preserves, catalogues and displays information and artefacts pertaining to historical land settlement, surveying and cartographic activities in Queensland.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Collection strategy ===
The museum aims to identify records, artefacts, maps and plans that are useful in filling gaps in the knowledge about the history of mapping and surveying in Queensland, and make such knowledge accessible. New material is constantly being identified as important for research purposes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Historical collections ==
Our physical and digital collections include:

* historical maps and plans
* historical photographs
* aerial photography
* artefacts
* biographies of surveyors and cartographers
* documents (e.g. early Queensland Treasury rental sheets)
* publications.

== History ==
In 1982, the [[Queensland Government]] through the [[Surveyor General of Queensland]], JM Serisier ordered that a mapping and surveying museum be set up in order to preserve the mapping and surveying history of Queensland. The original museum was established in the [[Land Administration Building|Lands Administration Building]], (now the Conrad Treasury Hotel), and Bill Kitson was tasked with establishing and operating the museum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With the support of the department and the mapping and surveying industry Kitson set about collecting artefacts, which were rapidly disappearing as technology overtook the traditional means of creating maps and surveys. The museum’s collection grew from simply holding artefacts to include diaries, artwork, photographs and biographies which captured the personal and social history of those involved in surveying and mapping. Many historical maps of Queensland were also acquired.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1987, the museum moved to the newly constructed Landcentre building  in [[Woolloongabba]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1988, in order to preserve the artefacts that had been collected an agreement was signed with the [[Queensland Museum]] to become custodian of the collections whilst the government provides staff to manage and run the museum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1991, the focus of the museum was broadened and it was renamed the Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying to include history of land development in Queensland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2018, the museum relocated to 317 [[Edward Street, Brisbane|Edward Street]] in the [[Brisbane CBD]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Sea of Zanj''' ({{lang-ar|بحر زنج}}) is a former name for that portion of the western [[Indian Ocean]] adjacent to the region in the [[African Great Lakes]] referred to by [[medieval]] [[Arab]] geographers as [[Zanj]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.eshia.ir/23019/1/542 دانشنامه جهان اسلام، بنیاد دائرة المعارف اسلامی، برگرفته از مقاله «بحرالزنج»، شماره۵۴۲] Article in Islamic World Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; The Sea of Zanj was deemed a fearful zone by Arab mariners and legends regarding dangers in the waters abounded, especially near its far southern limits.&lt;ref name="masudi"&gt;[[Al-Masudi]], ''Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems'', vol. 1, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The term was applied to the sea expanses near the eastern portion of the African continent known by ancient Muslim travelers and chroniclers such as [[Al Masudi]] and [[Ibn Batuta]].&lt;ref name="masudi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IB"&gt;[[Ibn Battuta]], ''The Travels of Ibn Battuta ''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although geographically insufficiently defined, the area of the Sea of Zanj included a vast maritime region roughly stretching as far as ancient navigators reached on their [[dhow]]s. Subject to [[Monsoon]] wind variations, the Sea of Zanj was located to the south of the [[Erythraean Sea]]. It stretched off the coast of Southeast Africa as far south as the [[Mozambique Channel]], including the [[Comoros]] and the waters off the eastern coast of [[Madagascar]]. On its eastern side the sea extended west of the [[Seychelles]] and to the northwest of the islands of the [[Mascarenes]].&lt;ref name="masudi"/&gt;

The term '''sense of place''' has been used in many different ways. It is a characteristic that some geographic [[Location (geography)|places]] have and some do not,&lt;ref name="Yi-Fu"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuan|first1=Yi-Fu|title=Space and place: The perspective of experience|date=1977|publisher=University of Minnesota press|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; while to others it is a feeling or perception held by people (not by the place itself).&lt;ref name="Agnew"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agnew|first1=J.A.|last2=Duncan|first2=J.S.|title=The power of place: Bringing together geographical and sociological imaginations|date=1989|publisher=Unwin Hyman Publishers|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Altman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Altman, ed.|first1=I.|last2=Low, ed.|first2=S.M.|title=Place attachment. Human behavior and environment: Advances in theory and research|date=1992|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often used in relation to those characteristics that make a place special or unique, as well as to those that foster a sense of authentic human attachment and belonging.&lt;ref name="Casey 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casey|first1=E.S.|title=Between geography and philosophy: what does it mean to be in place world?|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|date=2001|volume=91|pages=683–693|doi=10.1111/0004-5608.00266}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as geographer [[Yi-Fu Tuan]], have pointed to senses of place that are not "positive," such as fear.&lt;ref&gt;Tuan, Yi-Fu (1980). ''Landscapes of Fear''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some students and educators engage in "[[place-based education]]" in order to improve their "sense(s) of place," as well as to use various aspects of place as educational tools in general.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2013. Introduction: Learning as a geographical process. The Professional Geographer, 65(3), pp. 363-368. https://doi.org/10.1080/00330124.2012.693872&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D 2013.

The Professional Geographer, 68(4), pp.574-583.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in urban and rural studies in relation to place-making and place-attachment of communities to their environment or homeland.&lt;ref name="Groat"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Groat, ed.|first1=L.|title=Giving places meaning: Readings in environmental psychology|date=1995|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic place==

[[Cultural geography|Cultural geographers]], [[anthropologists]], [[sociologists]] and [[urban planners]] study why certain places hold special meaning to particular people or animals.&lt;ref name="Spretnak"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spretnak|first1=C.|title=The resurgence of the real: Body, nature and place in a hypermodern world|date=1997|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishers|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Places said to have a strong "sense of place" have a strong [[identity (social science)|identity]]  that is deeply felt by inhabitants and visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=W.|title=Personal identity, national identity and international relations|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=J.|last2=Massey|first2=D.|last3=Cochrane|first3=A.|title=Rethinking the Region|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sense of place is a social [[phenomenon]].&lt;ref name="Agnew 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agnew|first1=J.|title=Making political geography|date=2002|publisher=Arnold Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Codes aimed at protecting, preserving and enhancing places felt to be of value include "[[World Heritage Site]]" designations, the British "[[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]" controls and the American "[[National Historic Landmark]]" designation.

==Placelessness==

Places that lack a "sense of place" are sometimes referred to as "placeless" or "inauthentic”;cultural geographer, Edward Relph investigates the "placelessness" of these locations&lt;ref&gt;Relph, Edward, Place and Placelessness&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologist [[Marc Augé]] calls these "non-places."&lt;ref name="Augé"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Augé|first1=Marc|title=Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity|date=1995|publisher=Verson Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stepping against the kind of reductive thinking that placelessness can lead to, in his book, The Practice of Everyday Life, Jesuit philosopher [[Michel de Certeau]] argues that another way of seeing placelessness is to see it as space. For de Certeau,"space is merely composed of intersections of mobile elements" that are not in stasis (117). Place, on the other hand, is space that has been ordered in some way to serve some human need"(117). A park, for instance, is a place that has been constructed "in accord with which elements are distributed in relationships of coexistence"(117) and therefore "implies an indication of stability"(117). de Certeau's ideas became instrumental in understanding the intersections of power and social relations in the construction of place. For de Certeau, placelessness, or "space" was a site for freedom or at least it is the site for what Timotheus Vermeulen sees as "potentially anarchic movement"&lt;ref&gt;https://frieze.com/article/space-place&lt;/ref&gt;    Outside of de Certeau's ideas, Placeless landscapes are seen as those that have no special relationship to the places in which they are located—they could be anywhere; roadside strip [[shopping mall]]s, [[filling stations|gas/petrol stations]] and [[convenience store]]s, [[fast food]] chains, and chain [[department store]]s have been cited as examples of placeless landscape elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Mike|title=City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles|date=1990|publisher=Vintage Press, Penquin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780679738060}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some historic sites or districts that have been heavily commercialized for [[tourism]] and new housing estates are defined as having lost their sense of place.&lt;ref name="Harvey 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=D.C.|title=From space to place and back again: reflections on the condition of post modernity|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gertrude Stein]]'s "there is no there there" has been used as a description of such places.&lt;ref&gt;''Anyone's Autobiography'', 1937: see [[Gertrude Stein]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Human geographers and social psychologists have studied how a sense of place develops, including the importance of comparisons between places, learning from elders and observing natural disasters and other events.  Of particular note is the importance of childhood experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Measham TG (2006) Learning about environments: The significance of primal landscapes, Environmental Management 38(3), pp. 426–434&lt;/ref&gt;  Environmental psychologists have quantified links between exposure to natural environments in childhood and environmental preferences later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Bixler, R. D., M. F. Floyd, and W. E. Hammitt. (2002). Environmental socialization: Quantitative tests of the childhood play hypothesis, Environment and Behavior 34(6) pp. 795–818&lt;/ref&gt; Learning about surrounding environments during childhood is strongly influenced by the direct experience of playing, as well as through the role of family, culture, and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Derr | first1 = V | year = 2002 | title = Children's sense of place in northern New Mexico | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 1–2| pages = 125–137 | doi=10.1006/jevp.2002.0252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The special bond which develops between children and their childhood environments has been called a "primal landscape" by human geographers.&lt;ref&gt;Gayton (1996) Landscapes of the Interior: Re-explorations of Nature and the Human Spirit. Gabriola Island, Canada: New Society Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; This childhood landscape forms part of an individual's identity and constitutes a key point of comparison for considering subsequent places later in life. As people move around as adults, they tend to consider new places in relation to this baseline landscape experienced during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Measham, TG (2007) Primal Landscapes: insights for education from empirical research on ways of learning about environments, International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education 16 (4) pp. 339–350&lt;/ref&gt; Sense of place is used as  a model for community-based psychosocial support programs.&lt;ref&gt;Prewitt Diaz, J.O. and Dayal, A.

The [[topography|topographic]] terms "acme", "apex", [[Pyramidal peak|"peak"]], and "[[zenith]]" are [[synonymous]].

==Definition==
The term "{{vanchor|top}}" is generally used only for a [[mountain]] peak that is located some distance from the nearest point of higher elevation. For example, a big massive rock next to the main summit of a mountain is not considered a summit. Summits near a higher peak, with some prominence or isolation, but not reaching a certain cutoff value for the quantities, are often considered ''subsummits'' (or ''subpeaks'') of the higher peak, and are considered part of the same mountain. A [[pyramidal peak]] is an exaggerated form produced by ice [[erosion]] of a mountain top.
Summit may also refer to the highest point along a line, trail, or route.

The highest summit in the world is Everest with height of 8844.43 m above [[sea level]] (29,029 ft). The first official ascent was made by [[Tenzing_Norgay|Tenzing Norgay]] and [[Sir Edmund Hillary]]. They reached the mountain`s peak in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/21/part-of-mount-everest-has-collapsed-mountaineers-confirm|title=Mount Everest's Hillary Step has collapsed, mountaineer confirms|last=Lyons|first=Kate|date=2017-05-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/everest/|title=Everest|work=[[National Geographic]]|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UIAA]] definition is that a summit is independent if it has a prominence of {{convert|30|m|ft|lk=on}} or more; it is a mountain if it has a prominence of at least {{convert|300|m|ft}}. This can be summarised as follows:

In many parts of the western United States, the term ''summit'' refers to the highest point along a road, highway, or railroad. For example, the highest point along [[Interstate 80]] in [[California]] is referred to as [[Donner Summit]] and the highest point on [[Interstate 5]] is [[Siskiyou Summit|Siskiyou Mountain Summit]].

==Summit climbing equipment==
A summit climbing differs from the common [[mountaineering]]. Summit expedition requires: 1+ year of training, a good physical shape, and a [[Climbing gear|special gear]]. Although a huge part of climber’s stuff can be left and taken at the base camps or given to porters, there is a long list of personal equipment. In addition to common mountaineers’ gear, Summit climbers need to take [[Diamox]] (anti-altitude sickness medication), masks, and bottles of [[oxygen]]. There are also special requirements for [[crampons]], [[ice axe]], rappel device, clothing, etc.

[[Image:DSCN1739-thomson-tide-machine.jpg|thumb|10-component tide-predicting machine of 1872-3, conceived by Sir William Thomson ([[Lord Kelvin]]), and designed by Thomson and collaborators, at the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]], South Kensington, London]]
A '''tide-predicting machine''' was a special-purpose mechanical [[analog computer]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, constructed and set up to predict the ebb and flow of sea tides and the irregular variations in their heights &amp;ndash; which change in mixtures of rhythms, that never (in the aggregate) repeat themselves exactly.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#refAMS-22|American Mathematical Society (2009) II.2]], showing how combinations of waves in non-commensurable frequencies cannot repeat their resultant patterns exactly.&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to shorten the laborious and error-prone computations of tide-prediction. Such machines usually provided predictions valid from hour to hour and day to day for a year or more ahead.

The first tide-predicting machine, designed and built in 1872-3, and followed by two larger machines on similar principles in 1876 and 1879, was conceived by Sir William Thomson (who later became [[Lord Kelvin]]). Thomson had introduced the method of [[Theory of tides#Harmonic analysis|harmonic analysis]] of tidal patterns in the 1860s and the first machine was designed by Thomson with the collaboration of Edward Roberts (assistant at the UK [[HM Nautical Almanac Office]]), and of Alexander Légé, who constructed it.&lt;ref&gt;The [[#refprocice|''Proceedings'' of the Inst.C.E. (1881)]] contains minutes of a somewhat disputatious discussion that took place in 1881 over who had contributed what details. Thomson acknowledged previous work of the 1840s relating to the general mechanical solution of equations, plus a specific suggestion he had from [[Beauchamp Tower]] to use a device of pulleys and a chain once used by [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone]]; Thomson also credited Roberts with calculating the astronomical ratios embodied in the machine, and Légé with design of the drive gear details; Roberts claimed further credit for selecting other parts of the mechanical design.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1107|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, another tide-predicting machine on a different pattern (shown right) was designed by [[William Ferrel]] and built in 1881-2.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refferr1883|Ferrel (1883)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Developments and improvements continued in the UK, US and Germany through the first half of the 20th century.  The machines became widely used for constructing official tidal predictions for general marine navigation. They came to be regarded as of military strategic importance during [[World War I]],&lt;ref&gt;During World War I, Germany built its first tide-predicting machine in 1915-16 when it could no longer obtain British hydrographic data (see [[#reftpmde|Deutsches Museum exhibit, online]]), and when it specially needed accurate and independently-sourced tide data for conducting the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|U-boat campaign]] (see [[#refdsm|German Maritime Museum exhibit, online]]).&lt;/ref&gt; and again during the [[World War II|Second World War]], when the US No.2 Tide Predicting Machine, described below, was [[Classified information|classified]], along with the data that it produced, and used to predict tides for the D-day [[Normandy landings]] and all the island landings in the [[Pacific war]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[#refobb|Ehret (2008)]] at page 44).&lt;/ref&gt; Military interest in such machines continued even for some time afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;During the '[[cold war]]', East Germany built its own tide-predicting machine in 1953-5 "at unbelievable expense", see [[#refdsm|German Maritime Museum (online exhibit)]].&lt;/ref&gt; They were made obsolete by digital electronic computers that can be programmed to carry out similar computations, but the tide-predicting machines continued in use until the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;The US No.2 machine was retired in the 1960s, see [[#refobb|Ehret (2008)]]; the machine used in Norway continued in use until the 1970s (see [[#refnortpm|Norway online exhibit]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Several examples of tide-predicting machines remain [[#Tide predicting machines on display|on display]] as museum pieces, occasionally put into operation for demonstration purposes, monuments to the mathematical and mechanical ingenuity of their creators.

==Background to the problem solved by the machines==

&lt;!-- see/reuse Tides#History of tidal physics --&gt;[[Image:099-ferreltpm.jpg|thumb|William Ferrel's tide-predicting machine of 1881-2, now at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History]]
Modern scientific study of tides dates back to Isaac Newton's 'Principia' of 1687, in which he applied the theory of gravitation to make a first approximation of the effects of the Moon and Sun on the Earth's tidal waters.  The approximation developed by Newton and his successors of the next 90 years is known as the 'equilibrium theory' of tides.

Beginning in the 1770s, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] made a fundamental advance on the equilibrium approximation by bringing into consideration non-equilibrium dynamical aspects of the motion of tidal waters that occurs in response to the tide-generating forces due to the Moon and Sun.

Laplace's improvements in theory were substantial, but they still left prediction in an approximate state.  This position changed in the 1860s when the local circumstances of tidal phenomena were more fully brought into account by [[Lord Kelvin|William Thomson]]'s application of [[Fourier analysis]] to the tidal motions. Thomson's work in this field was then further developed and extended by [[George Darwin]]: Darwin's work was based on the [[lunar theory]] current in his time.  His symbols for the tidal harmonic constituents are still used.  Darwin's harmonic developments of the tide-generating forces were later brought by [[Arthur Thomas Doodson|A. T. Doodson]] up to date and extended in light of the new and more accurate lunar theory of [[Ernest William Brown|E. W. Brown]] that remained current through most of the twentieth century.

The state to which the science of tide-prediction had arrived by the 1870s can be summarized:  Astronomical theories of the Moon and Sun had identified the frequencies and strengths of different components of the tide-generating force.  But effective prediction at any given place called for measurement of an adequate sample of local tidal observations, to show the local tidal response at those different frequencies, in amplitude and phase.  Those observations had then to be analyzed, to derive the coefficients and phase angles.  Then, for purposes of prediction, those local tidal constants had to be recombined, each with a different component of the tide-generating forces to which it applied, and at each of a sequence of future dates and times, and then the different elements finally collected together to obtain their aggregate effects.  In the age when calculations were done by hand and brain, with pencil and paper and tables, this was recognized as an immensely laborious and error-prone undertaking.

Thomson recognized that what was needed was a convenient and preferably automated way to evaluate repeatedly the sum of tidal terms such as:

:&lt;math&gt;A_1 \cos(\omega_1 t+\phi_1)+A_2 \cos(\omega_2 t+\phi_2)+A_3 \cos(\omega_3 t+\phi_3)+\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

containing 10, 20 or even more trigonometrical terms, so that the computation could conveniently be repeated in full for each of a very large number of different chosen values of the date/time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  This was the core of the problem solved by the tide-predicting machines.

==How they worked to predict the tides==

Thomson conceived his aim as to construct a mechanism that would evaluate this trigonometrical sum physically, e.g. as the vertical position of a pen that could then plot a curve on a moving band of paper.

[[Image:099-tmpshaft.jpg|thumb|right|200px|mechanism for generating sinusoidal motion component]]
There were several mechanisms available to him for converting rotary motion into sinusoidal motion.  One of them is shown in the schematic (right).  A rotating drive-wheel is fitted with an off-center peg.  A shaft with a horizontally-slotted section is free to move vertically up and down.  The wheel's off-center peg is located in the slot.  As a result, when the peg moves around with the wheel, it can make the shaft move up and down within limits.  This arrangement shows that when the drive-wheel rotates uniformly, say clockwise, the shaft moves sinusoidally up and down.  The vertical position of the center of the slot, at any time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, can then be expressed as
&lt;math&gt;A_1 \cos(\omega_1 t+\phi_1)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; is the radial distance from the wheel's center to the peg, &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; is the rate at which the wheel turns (in [[radian]]s per unit of time), and &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; is the starting phase angle of the peg, measured in radians from the 12 o'clock position to the angular position where the peg was at time zero.

This arrangement makes a physical analog of just one trigonometrical term.  Thomson needed to construct a physical sum of many such terms.

At first he inclined to use gears.  Then he discussed the problem with engineer [[Beauchamp Tower]] before the British Association meeting in 1872, and Tower suggested the use of a device that (as he remembered) was once used by [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone]]. It was a chain running alternately over and under a sequence of pulleys on movable shafts.  The chain was fixed at one end, and the other (free) end was weighted to keep it taut. As each shaft moved up or down it would take up or release a corresponding length of the chain. The movements in position of the free (movable) end of the chain represented the sum of the movements of the different shafts.  The movable end was kept taut, and fitted with a pen and a moving band of paper on which the pen plotted a tidal curve.  In some designs, the movable end of the line was connected instead to a dial and scale from which tidal heights could be read off.

[[Image:099-tpm3-sk.jpg|thumb|Thomson's design for the third tide-predicting machine, 1879-81]]
One of Thomson's designs for the calculating part of a tide-predicting machine is shown in the figure (right), closely similar to the third machine of 1879-81. A long cord, with one end held fixed, passed vertically upwards and over a first upper pulley, then vertically downwards and under the next, and so on. These pulleys were all moved up and down by cranks, and each pulley took in or let out cord according to the direction in which it moved. These cranks were all moved by trains of wheels gearing into the wheels fixed on a drive shaft. The greatest number of teeth on any wheel was 802 engaging with another of 423. All the other wheels had comparatively small numbers of teeth. A flywheel of great inertia enabled the operator to turn the machine fast, without jerking the pulleys, and so to run off a year's curve in about twenty-five minutes. The machine shown in the figure was arranged for fifteen constituents in all.

Thomson acknowledged that the use of an over-and-under arrangement of the flexible line that summed the motion components was suggested to him in August 1872 by engineer [[Beauchamp Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp Tower was initially referred to in Thomson's acknowledgements only as 'Mr Tower', but he was more fully identified in discussion between Thomson and E Roberts at the Institution of Civil Engineers (reported in the ICE minutes in the [[#refprocice|''Proceedings'', 1881]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online demonstration of the mechanism==

An online demonstration is available to show the principle of operation of a 7-component version of a tide-predicting machine otherwise like Thomson's (Kelvin's) original design.&lt;ref&gt;See American Mathematical Society/[[Bill Casselman (mathematician)|Bill Casselman]] (2009), [http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/tidesIII3.html animated JAVA simulation based on Kelvin's Tide Predicting Machine] (the animation shows computing 7 harmonic components).&lt;/ref&gt; The animation shows part of the operation of the machine:  the motions of several pulleys can be seen, each moving up and down to simulate one of the tidal frequencies;  and the animation also shows how these sinusoidal motions were generated by wheel rotations and how they were combined to form the resulting tidal curve.  Not shown in the animation is the way in which the individual motions were generated in the machine at the correct relative frequencies, by gearing in the correct ratios, or how the amplitudes and starting phase angles for each motion were set in an adjustable way. These amplitudes and starting phase angles represented the local tidal constants, separately reset, and different for each place for which predictions were to be made.  Also, in the real Thomson machines, to save on motion and wear of the other parts, the shaft and pulley with the largest expected motion (for the M2 tide component at twice per lunar day) was mounted nearest to the pen, and the shaft and pulley representing the smallest component was at the other end, nearest to the point of fixing of the flexible cord or chain, to minimize unnecessary motion in the most part of the flexible cord.

==History of their building and use==

===The first tide-predicting machines 1872-1883===

The first tide predicting machine, designed in 1872 and of which a model was exhibited at the British Association meeting in 1873&lt;ref&gt;See [[#refprocice|''Proceedings'' of the Inst.C.E. (1881)]], at page 31.&lt;/ref&gt; (for computing 8 tidal components), followed in 1875-6 by a machine on a slightly larger scale (for computing 10 tidal components), was designed by Sir William Thomson (who later became [[Lord Kelvin]]).&lt;ref&gt;see [[#refthom1881|W Thomson (1881)]], a paper of Thomson's presented to the Institution of Civil Engineers in January 1881. Subsequent discussion at the same meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers covered questions of history and priority about aspects of the design since 1872, see [[#refprocice|Proceedings for January 1881]] especially pages 30-31. The design had been described at the British Association Meeting of 1872 and a model for an 8-component prototype shown at the British Association meeting of 1873.&lt;/ref&gt; The 10-component machine and results obtained from it were shown at the Paris Exhibition in 1878.  An enlarged and improved version of the machine, for computing 20 tidal components, was built for the Government of India in 1879, and then modified in 1881 to extend it to compute 24 harmonic components.&lt;ref&gt;The 20-component instrument was described by [[#refrob1879|E Roberts (1879)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In these machines, the prediction was delivered in the form of a continuous graphical pen-plot of tidal height against time.  The plot was marked with hour- and noon-marks, and was made by the machine on a moving band of paper as the mechanism was turned.  A year's tidal predictions for a given place, usually a chosen seaport, could be plotted by the 1876 and 1879 machines in about four hours (but the drives had to be rewound during that time).

In 1881-2, another tide predicting machine, operating quite differently, was designed by [[William Ferrel]] and built in Washington under Ferrel's direction by E. G. Fischer (who later designed the successor machine described below, which was in operation at the US Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1912 until the 1960s).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refferr1883|W Ferrel (1883)]]; also [[#reffis-tpm2|E G Fischer (1912)]], at pages 273-275; also [[#refsci1884|''Science'' (1884)]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferrel's machine delivered predictions by telling the times and heights of successive high and low waters, shown by pointer-readings on dials and scales. These were read by an operator who copied the readings on to forms, to be sent to the printer of the US tide-tables.

These machines had to be set with local tidal constants special to the place for which predictions were to be made.  Such numbers express the local tidal response to individual components of the global tide-generating potential, at different frequencies.  This local response, shown in the timing and the height of tidal contributions at different frequencies, is a result of local and regional features of the coasts and sea-bed.  The tidal constants are usually evaluated from local histories of tide-gauge observations, by harmonic analysis based on the principal tide-generating frequencies as shown by the global [[theory of tides]] and the underlying [[lunar theory]].

Thomson was also responsible for originating the method of harmonic tidal analysis, and for devising a harmonic analyzer machine, which partly mechanized the evaluation of the constants from the gauge readings.

Development and improvement based on the experience of these early machines continued through the first half of the 20th century.

British Tide Predictor No.2, after initial use to generate data for Indian ports, was used for tide prediction for the British empire beyond India, and transferred to the National Physical Laboratory in 1903.  British Tide Predictor No.3 was sold to the French Government in 1900 and used to generate French tide tables.
[[File:Tide Predicting Machine No. 2 ("Old Brass Brains").jpg|alt=The face of Tide Predicting Machine No. 2|thumb|[[Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2]] ("Old Brass Brains"). The operator powered the machine by turning the crank at the left. The machine stopped when the simulation reached high and low tides, at which time the operator recorded the tide height and the day and time from the dials on the machine's face. The tide curve drawn on the paper above the dials was retained in case questions were raised later about the calculations.]]

Tide-predicting machines were built in Germany during World War I, and again in the period 1935-8.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#refdsm|German Maritime Museum]] online exhibit, and [[#reftpmde|Deutsches Museum]] online exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the last to be built were: 
* a TPM built in 1947 for the Norwegian Hydrographic Service by Chadburn of Liverpool, and designed to compute 30 tidal harmonic constituents;  used until 1975 to compute official Norwegian Tide Tables, before being superseded by digital computing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vannstand.statkart.no/Engelsk/hist_tilbake.php Norwegian Hydrographic Service - history].&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[#refpoltpm|Doodson-Légé TPM]] built in 1949,
* an East German TPM built 1953-5.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#refdsm|German Maritime Museum (online exhibit)]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Excluding small portable machines, a total of 33 tide-predicting machines are known to have been built, of which 2 have been destroyed and 4 are presently lost.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/513660/ P.
