'''Bride service''' has traditionally been portrayed in the [[Anthropology|anthropological]] literature as the service rendered by the [[bridegroom]] to a bride's family as a [[bride price]] or part of one (see [[dowry]]). Bride service and [[bride wealth]] models frame anthropological discussions of [[kinship]] in many regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;

Patterns of [[matrilocal]] post-marital residence, as well as the practice of temporary or prolonged bride service, have been widely reported for [[indigenous peoples]] of the [[Amazon basin]].&lt;ref&gt;

The length of uxorilocal residence and the duration of bride service are contingent upon negotiations between the concerned parties, the outcome of which has been characterized as an enduring commitment or permanent [[debt]].&lt;ref name=Rosengren&gt;{{cite book |title=In the eyes of the beholder: Leadership and the social construction of power and dominance among the Matsigenka of the Peruvian Amazon |date=1987 |page=127 |last=Rosengren |first=Dan |publisher=Göteborgs etnografiska museum |location=Göteborg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gow&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gow |first=Peter |date=December 1989 |title=The perverse child: Desire in a native Amazonian subsistence economy |journal=Man |volume=24 |number=4 |pages=299–314}} &lt;/ref&gt; The [[Power (sociology)|power]] wielded by those who “give” wives over those who “take” them is also said to be a significant part of the political relationships in societies where bride service obligations are prevalent.&lt;ref name="Rivière 1997"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Rivière |first=Peter G |date=1977 |title=Some problems in the comparative study of Carib societies |encyclopedia=Carib-speaking Indians: culture, society, and language |editor-last=Basso |editor-first=Ellen B. |location=Tucson |publisher=University of Arizona Press |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mentore |first=George P. |date=September 1987 |title=Waiwai women: the basis of wealth and power |journal=Man |volume=22 |number=3 |pages=511–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
An example of bride service occurs in the [[Hebrew Bible]], {{bibleverse||Genesis|29:16-29|NIV}}, when [[Jacob]] labored for [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] for fourteen years to marry [[Rachel]]. Originally the deal was seven years, but Laban tricked Jacob by giving him [[Leah]] on their wedding day, so Jacob had to work another seven years to obtain the girl he had originally fallen in love with, Rachel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15151">A '''caption contest''' or '''caption competition''' is a competition between multiple participants, who are required to give the best description for a certain [[image]] offered by the [[Competition|contest]] organizer. Rules and information about the competition process are also given by the competition organizer.

== General information ==
Caption contest participants have to describe a given image as accurately and [[originality|originally]] as possible. Contests may vary by image type ([[photograph|photo]] or [[drawing]]), [[Photo caption|caption]] format ([[description]] of a situation or a [[dialogue]]), as well as [[judgement|judging]] criteria. The competition organizer is required to give information about caption submission rules and other information that is important for the contest.

Caption contests are mainly arranged as an [[amusement]], and they can be organized under different conditions (between separate individuals, in public events, [[mass media]], etc.), as well as using various means (drawn pictures on paper, digital image, printed image, press publication, etc.). Traditionally, the most popular and typical format has been publication of caption contests in [[newspaper]]s or [[magazine]]s, but with the development of modern technologies, it is also very popular to organize caption contests on the [[Internet]].

Caption contests can be used not only as an [[entertainment]] but also for other purposes, such as newspaper promotion, bringing forward a certain [[problem]], or product [[advertising|advertisement]]. An important aspect of caption competition is to look at an object, event or issue from unusual point of view.

The caption, unless competition rules do not restrict, can be in any form of literary expression - [[prose]], [[poetry]], as one [[word]] or a [[word play]]. Usually the submitted captions are judged by the originality and [[wit]], but not always the decisive assessment is [[humour]]. It is generally assumed that the caption has to describe image as precisely as possible, so both humour and precision are equally important.

As caption writing is an [[art]] of words, it is rarely possible to evaluate the superiority of one caption over others accurately and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]]. Consequently, the judging of submitted captions is usually quite [[subjectivity|subjective]]. Sometimes competition rules limit caption size, but usually the caption is no longer than one [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] (10 - 20 words). As an exception, the caption can consist of several sentences. Usually it is not allowed to use [[profanity|profane]] or offensive language in submitted captions.

In several caption contests, [[champion|winners]] are awarded with [[prize]]s.

== History ==
It is considered that the origins of caption contests are related to the increase of [[popularity]] of [[cartoon]]s and [[comics]] as well as widespread use of [[illustration]]s and the rise of [[photojournalism]] in printed media at the end of the 19th century. All these areas share the combination of words and images that could be multiplied and made available to a wide audience with the beginnings of mass printing and wide spread of newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/20/business/earlier-media-achieved-critical-mass-printing-press-yelling-stop-presses-didn-t.html D. J. R. Bruckner. "How the Earlier Media Achieved Critical Mass." ''The New York Times'', November 20, 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt;

From currently available information, the first caption contests in printed media appeared in the [[United States|U.S.]] press of the late 19th century (such as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1920-11-07/ed-1/seq-25/ "$1000.00 in Prizes." ''New-York tribune'', November 07, 1920.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which was published from year 1883 to 1936). At that time these competitions were called ''picture title'' or ''picture headline'' contests, but their concept and meaning was identical to current caption contests. It must be considered, that the term ''caption'' in its present sense firstly appeared in [[English language]] only in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=caption&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the 20th century, at least in the U.S. press (for example, ''[[The San Francisco Call]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1912-01-07/ed-1/seq-17/ "The Sunday Call Will Pay $20 for the Best Title for This Picture." ''The San Francisco call'', January 07, 1912.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Daily News (New York)|The Daily News]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1920-03-23/ed-1/seq-11/ "What does this Picture mean?" ''New-York tribune'', March 23, 1920, p.11.] chroniclingamerica.loc.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Connecticut Post|The Bridgeport Telegram]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/bridgeport-telegram/1921-12-20/page-30/ "$10 A Week for the Best Titles in Sunday Post Caption Contest" ''Bridgeport Telegram'', December 20, 1921, p.30.] newspaperarchive.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) caption contests were already quite popular. In these competitions drawn pictures and cartoons were mainly used. [[Photo caption]] contests appeared little later with the improvement of printing quality (towards the second quarter of 20th century).

During the course of the 20th century, caption contests were published in printed media in many countries of the world. For example, in Soviet Union one of the first caption contests was published in daily newspaper ''Izvestia'' Sunday supplement ''Nedelya'' (''The Week'') at the beginning of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odnako.org/magazine/material/show_14096/ "Золотой глаз-Геолог и Мальтус".] odnako.org. Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Little later a newspaper ''Literaturnaya gazeta'' began to publish caption contests that became very popular and they are part of this newspaper up until now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgz.ru/article/18729/ "Что бы это значило?".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620052849/http://www.lgz.ru/article/18729/# |date=2012-06-20 }} lgz.ru. Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of caption contests increased even more with the emergence of the Internet by the end of the 20th century, and at the beginning of the 21st century. Internet has made the organization of caption contests and participation in them possible for wide audiences across the world.

== Present situation ==
Although a considerable amount of caption contests are now on Internet, caption contests in printed media still exist and are quite popular. A very popular and prominent is a weekly caption contest published in American magazine ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904199404576538831896448132 Russell Adams. "How About Never-Is Never Good for You?" ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 10, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The contest first appeared in 1998 and has been published regularly in each issue since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/05/02/your-caption-here Your Caption Here] The New Yorker. 2 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Each week several thousand participants take part in this competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/bob-mankoff/seven-reasons-why-hard-to-win-caption-contest Seven Reasons It's Hard To Win The Caption Contest] Mankoff, Robert. 8 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On the Internet, a very popular is the weekly caption competition on ''[[BBC]]'' website (''[[BBC News Magazine Monitor|Magazine Monitor]]'' section), held since 2006.

Along the traditional caption contests, there have appeared different forms of this [[genre]] such as anti-caption contests&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; for worst submitted caption and reverse caption contests where the most suitable picture must be submitted for a given caption. There are also caption contests devoted to particular themes such as [[history]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.archives.gov/prologue/?p=9388 "Thursday Photo Caption Contest"] blogs.archives.gov. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[association football|football]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footytube.com/forums/funny-football/the-silly-captions-competition-2770/ "The Silly Captions Competition"] footytube.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the website caption.me &lt;ref&gt;http://www.caption.me/&lt;/ref&gt; (then captioncompetition.co.uk) was founded, featuring amusing photos loaded automatically from photo-sharing site [[Flickr]]. Visitors submit captions and vote for others. Caption.Me features a real-time collaborative mind-mapping feature called [http://www.caption.me/forum/discussion/557/maption-is-live#Item_0 Maption]

In 2009, there was released an online multiplayer caption writing game called ''[[Caption That (Game)|Caption That]]'' where players write captions for a given image and then vote for their favourite from the list others have written.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captionthat.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219001151/http://www.captionthat.com/ |date=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the iPhone app [http://www.captionit.co Captionit] was released on the Apple App Store. Captionit is a free mobile app that allows people to play and create caption contests on their iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbwire.com/press-releases/waste-your-creativity-with-captionits-new-iphone-app-483131.htm/ Waste Your Creativity with Captionit's New Iphone App"] SBWire, March 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captionit.co/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, mobile phone application [http://tinnbin.com TinnBin] was released for both iPhone and Android. TinnBin users create contests called "Bins" by uploading a picture from their device and selecting how long they would like the contest to run. While the bin is open, users can add and vote on comments, called "Tinns". Once the bin is closed, the winning tinn is appended to the image in the form of a caption. TinnBin is different from most other caption contests as the winner is chosen strictly by users of the application, and not the contest creators, and all the contests are created by users of the application.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tinnbin.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New Yorker'' magazine, noting the popularity of its cartoon caption contest, has created a caption contest [[board game]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120731102549/http://www.familyandpartygames.com/pdf/NY_instructions.pdf/ "The New Yorker Cartoon caption game"] familyandpartygames.com.

Also concerning the ''New Yorker'' caption contest, several scientific studies have been carried out: researchers from [[University of New Mexico]], Department of Anthropology, in 2010 have compared humour ability in males and females in context of this competition;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611000523/ | doi=10.1016/j.intell.2011.03.006 | volume=39 | title=Humor ability reveals intelligence, predicts mating success, and is higher in males | journal=Intelligence | pages=188–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of ''The New Yorker'' editorial board and [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado Boulder]] [[Leeds School of Business]] in 2011 analysed several thousand entries of this contest to study the concept of humour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leeds.colorado.edu/news/113 Leeds School of Business "What It Takes To Win The New Yorker`s Cartoon Caption Contest"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204013344/http://leeds.colorado.edu/news/113 |date=December 4, 2012}} leeds.colorado.edu, April 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future perspectives ==
The future of caption contests depends on the [[imagination]] and [[creativity]] of their organizers and participants, as well as future development of information and [[Information and communications technology|communication technologies]].

== In popular culture ==
In U.S. TV series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', seventh-season episode ''[[The Search (The Office)|The Search]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/the-office/episode-guide/season-7/42801/the-search/episode-715/281549/ "The Search".] "The Office" episode guide. nbc.com. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; its character [[Pam Beesly|Pam]] starts a caption contest in the office, with her co-worker [[Gabe Lewis|Gabe]] instituting rules that no one wants to follow.

In [[British sitcom]] ''[[Green Wing]]'', the second series, episode six, its character [[Alan Statham]] wins a caption competition on the ''Consultant Radiologists International'' website, an organisation of which Alan claims to be an "Esteemed member".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/shows/green-wing/episodes/ "Episode 6 – Season 2".] "Green Wing" episode guide. tv.com. Retrieved June 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a children's novel ''[[Absolute Zero (novel)|Absolute Zero]]'' by [[Helen Cresswell]] its character Uncle Parker has won a trip to the [[Caribbean]] in a caption contest. The rest of the family immediately enter similar competitions in an attempt to better his prize but, much of the time, beating the others to an entry form is a victory in itself.

In season two of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Bored to Death]]'', George (played by [[Ted Danson]]) struggles to caption a New Yorker cartoon, which portrays a police duck interacting with a suicidal bear.

==Quintilian Development==
The art of facilitas was most notably taught by [[Quintilian]], the Roman rhetorician, in the latter part of the first century A.D. (c. 35 – c. 100).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pearltrees.com/#/N-f=1_6721279&amp;N-fa=5997373&amp;N-p=62584516&amp;N-play=0&amp;N-s=1_6721279&amp;N-u=1_789406&lt;/ref&gt; In Quintilian's [[Institutio Oratoria]], Quintilian summarizes the Roman educational system. In this system, students, generally young boys, were trained daily from the age of six to about eighteen. There were two levels of masters who taught the children: the grammaticus, who helped children with imitations, speaking and writing exercises, and the rhetor, who prepared students for the final stage of declamation, when they gave fictitious speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, J.J. (1996). Quintilian. In T. Enos (Ed.), Encyclopedia of rhetoric and composition: Communication from ancient times to the information age (581–585). New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of Quintilian’s curriculum was for men to have facilitas: the ability to speak extemporaneously on any subject at any time.&lt;ref&gt;Bourelle, Andrew.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11107">'''Hierotopy''' (from {{lang-grc|ἱερός}}, sacred + {{lang-grc|τόπος}}, place, space) is the creation of [[sacred]] spaces viewed as a special form of human creativity and also a related academic field where specific examples of such creativity are studied. The concept and the term were developed in 2002  by [[Russia]]n art-historian and [[Byzantinism|byzantinist]] [[Alexei Lidov]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy. The creation of sacred spaces as a form of creativity and subject of cultural history" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A.Lidov, Moscow: Progress-Tradition, 2006, pp. 32-58&lt;/ref&gt; Hierotopy accounts for the ways in which a vast array of media (e.g. religious [[image]]s, [[ritual]], [[song]], [[incense]], [[light]]) are used to organize sacred spaces. As an academic field, it spans the disciplines of [[art history]], [[archeology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[ethnology]] and [[religious studies]], but it possesses an object of study and a methodology of its own. It differs from the phenomenology of the sacred (which has been studied by [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Rudolf Otto]] and [[Pavel Florensky]]) insofar as it focuses on historical examples of hierotopic projects, that is, projects establishing a medium of communication between the [[mundane]] and the [[sacred]]. Though related with religious [[mysticism]], hierotopy deals first and foremost with forms of conscious, creative activity. 

According to the hierotopic approach, [[icon]]s and other sacred [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] are viewed not as isolated objects, but as components of larger hierotopic projects. Though such artifacts often play a prominent role in hierotopic studies, it is these projects themselves – including both their conceptual and artistic aspects, as well as the historical developments leading to their formation – that are the primary focus of study. The role played by the creators of sacred spaces is also of chief importance, and could be compared with that of an artist. The creative element at work here resembles the work of contemporary film directors, for both involve the coordinated effort of various artists and specialists in shaping a single, comprehensive vision.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Creator of Sacred Space as a Phenomenon of Byzantine Culture" in ''L’artista a Bisanzio e nel mondo cristiano-orientale'', ed. Michele Bacci, Pisa, 2003, pp.135-176&lt;/ref&gt; As examples of hierotopic projects, one can consider [[Solomon|King Solomon]]'s construction of the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]], the erection of [[Hagia Sophia]] by [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]], as well as the work of [[Abbot Suger]] in the conception of first [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]]. Hierotopic projects are not limited to churches and sanctuaries; in other cases, landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;Sh. Tsuji. "Creating an Iconic Space. The Transformation of Narrative Landscape" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 627-642&lt;/ref&gt; architectural compounds &lt;ref&gt;G. Zelenskaya. "New Jerusalem near Moscow. Aspects of the Conception and New Discoveries" in: ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 745-773&lt;/ref&gt; and even cities&lt;ref&gt;E. Kirichenko. "The Church and the City: on the Symbolic and Structural Unity of the Russian Sacred Space" in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 292-322&lt;/ref&gt; and countries&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Петрухин, Владимир Яковлевич|V. Petrukhin]]. "Hierotopy of the Russian Land and the Primary Chronicle" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow, 2006, pp. 480-490&lt;/ref&gt; have become products of hierotopic creativity. 

The topics of hierotopic study cover a broad span of interests and range, for example, from the role played by light in church architecture &lt;ref&gt;A. Godovanets. "The Icon of Light in the Architectural Space of Hagia Sophia" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 119-142&lt;/ref&gt; to the study of religious ceremonies, feasts&lt;ref&gt;L. Beliaev. "The Hierotopy of the Orthodox Feast: on the National Traditions in the Making of Sacred Spaces" in: ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 270-291&lt;/ref&gt; and folk customs.&lt;ref&gt;A. Moroz. "Sacred and Horrible Places. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Traditional Culture" in: ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 259-269&lt;/ref&gt;  The comparison of hierotopic models at work in different cultures is another focus of interest.&lt;ref&gt;N. Isar. "Vision and Performance. A Hierotopic Approach to Contemporary Art", in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 341-375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Chegodaev. "The Hierotopy of the Ancient Egyptian Sarcophagus" in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 18-37&lt;/ref&gt; 

Six international [[symposium|symposia]] (2004, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2014, 2017) have been organized on hierotopic subjects.

== Spatial icons ==
The concept of the ''[[spatial icon]]'' plays a central role in  hierotopy and is used to describe the perception of sacred spaces. Spatial icons are understood to play a mediating role between the [[mundane]] and the [[sacred]]. They are mediatory images that are evoked, for example, in the space of a [[temple]] or [[sanctuary]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: Spatial icons and Image-Paradigms in Byzantine Culture", Moscow: Theoria, 2009, Ch. 2. Spatial Icons. The miraculous performance with the Hodegetria of Constantinople. pp. 39-70, 311-316&lt;/ref&gt; Hierotopic creativity is a sort of art, which can be described as the creation of spatial icons. This concept applies to the way in which the perception of architecture, light, image, ritual practice, as well as various other components forming sacred spaces, is unified into a single vision. It is also used in the study both of "sacred landscapes", such as the [[New Jerusalem Monastery]] near [[Moscow]], as well as of various ritual practices creating iconic medium, such as the [[Donkey walk]] in [[medieval]] Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;M. Flier. "The Image of the Tsar in the Muscovite Palm Sunday Ritual" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp.533-562&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial icons are essentially dynamic and performative in nature, such that the formal boundary between ‘image’ and ‘beholder’ no longer pertains. Typically, the beholders of spatial icons are actively involved in some way and become, to a certain extent, co-creators of the icons.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Byzantine World and Performative Spaces" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer of sacred spaces ==
The transfer of sacred spaces is an important form of hierotopic creativity. While an original sacred space often appears as the result of a [[theophany]], such as a divine visitation or omen, this  primary sacred space is then consciously reproduced in [[sanctuary|sanctuaries]] or [[temple]]s as a spatial icon. For example, the construction of the [[First Temple]], as recounted in the [[Old Testament]], can be viewed as the reproduction of the sacred space of the [[Tabernacle]]. Similarly, in the design and construction of many Christian churches, the First Temple itself has been taken as a hierotopic prototype.  Multiple "New Jerusalems" (reproductions of the Holy City of [[Jerusalem]]), aimed to establish a link to the space of the [[Holy Land]], are common both to the Eastern and Western branches of the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. [http://hierotopy.ru/contents/NewJerusalems_01_Lidov_Introduction_2009_RusEng.pdf "New Jerusalems. Transferring of the Holy Land as Generative Matrix of Christian Culture"] in ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Image-paradigms ==
The perception of sacred spaces has been analyzed by Lidov in terms of ''image-paradigms''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Image-paradigms as a category of visual culture. Hierotopic approach to the art history", ''Russian Journal of Art History(Iskusstvoznanie)'', 2011, No 3-4, pp.109-122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Image-Paradigms as a Notion of Mediterranean Visual Culture: a Hierotopic Approach to Art History" in ''Crossing Cultures. Papers of  the International Congress of Art History. CIHA-2008'', Melbourne, 2009, pp.177-183&lt;/ref&gt; According to his conception, an image-paradigm is a guiding image-vision that is created with the help of various media and that is aimed at evoking the same image in the mind of beholders of a sacred space. An image-paradigm, which is essentially different from an illustrative picture or representation, is a means of communication between the creators of sacred spaces and their beholders. It constitutes a kernel of meaning that gives form to an entire hierotopic project. As an example, the image of the [[Heavenly Jerusalem]], which was present in [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] churches without being directly represented, is one of the most significant image-paradigms in the Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: Spatial icons and Image-Paradigms in Byzantine Culture", Moscow: Theoria, 2009.  Ch. 10, Image-Paradigms as a New Notion of Visual Culture, pp. 293-305, 335-337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Kessler. "Seeing Medieval Art", Broadview Press, 2004, ch.5, Church, pp. 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">'''Keywords''' are the words that academics use to reveal the internal structure of an author's 
reasoning.  While they are used primarily for [[rhetoric]], they are also used in a strictly 
grammatical sense for structural composition, reasoning, and comprehension.  Indeed, they are 
an essential part of any language.

There are many different types of keyword categories including: Conclusion, Continuation, Contrast,
Emphasis, Evidence, Illustration and Sequence. Each category serves its own function, as do the keywords
inside of a given category.

When someone uses a search engine, they type in one or more words describing what they are looking for:
'Norwich florist' or 'cheap holidays Greece', for example. These words or phrases are known as keywords.

==Corpus linguistic keywords==
In [[corpus linguistics]], key words are words that appear with statistically unusual frequency in a text
or a corpus of texts. They are identified by software that compares a word-list of the text with a word-list
based on a larger reference corpus. A suitable term for the phenomenon is [[keyness]]. The procedure used,
for example by [[WordSmith]], to list key words and phrases and plot where they appear in texts. These items
are very often of interest—particularly those human readers would not likely notice, such as prepositions,
time adverbs, and pronouns.

==Teaching Keywords==
One method used to teach keywords is called the "keyword method." It involves taking complex keywords that students do not know very well, and makes them into easier words. The easier words must have something to do with the complex keywords so students can correlate between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uberti|first1=H. Z.|last2=Scruggs|first2=T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19363">The '''knowledge gap hypothesis''' explains that [[knowledge]], like other forms of [[wealth]], is often [[Income inequality|differentially distributed]] throughout a social system.  Specifically, the hypothesis predicts that "as the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, segments of the population with higher  [[socioeconomic status]] tend to acquire this information at a faster rate than the lower status segments, so that the gap in knowledge between these segments tends to increase rather than decrease".&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tichenor|first=P.A. |author2=Donohue, G.A. |author3=Olien, C.N.|title=Mass media flow and differential growth in knowledge|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=34|issue=2|pages=159–170|doi=10.1086/267786|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip J. Tichenor, then Associate Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication, George A. Donohue, Professor of Sociology, and Clarice N. Olien, Instructor in Sociology – three [[University of Minnesota]] researchers – first proposed the knowledge gap hypothesis in 1970.

==Foundations==

Although first formally articulated in 1970, Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt; note that the knowledge gap hypothesis has been implicit throughout the mass communication literature.

Indeed, research published as early as the 1920s had already begun to examine the influence of individual characteristics on people's media content preferences.  For example, Gray and Munroe&lt;ref name="Gray Munroe 1929"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=W.S.|title=The Reading Interests and Habits of Adults|year=1929|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=New York|author2=Munroe, R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified education – still used today as an operationalization of socioeconomic status in knowledge gap research (see, e.g., Hwang and Jeong, 2009)&lt;ref name="Hwang Jeong 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hwang|first=Y|author2=Jeong, S-H. |title=Revisiting the knowledge gap hypothesis: A meta-analysis of thirty-five years of research|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2009|volume=86|issue=3|pages=513–532|doi=10.1177/107769900908600304}}&lt;/ref&gt; – as a significant and positive correlate of a person's tendency to prefer "serious" (rather than non-serious) print content.

Popular belief, however, held that such differences in preferences might be diminished by the advent of radio, which required neither the special skill nor the exertion of reading (Lazarsfeld, 1940).&lt;ref name="Lazarsfeld 1940"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lazarsfeld|first=P.F.|title=Radio and the Printed Page|year=1940|publisher=Duell, Sloan, and Pearce|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guglielmo Marconi, inventor of the wireless telegraph, even believed that the radio would "make war impossible, because it will make war ridiculous" (Narodny, 1912, p.&amp;nbsp;145).&lt;ref name="Narodny 1912"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Narodny|first=I.|title=Marconi's plans for the world|journal=The Technical World Magazine|year=1912|volume=18|pages=145–150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eqpMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=marconi+plans+for+the+world&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kE1RT_2PBcbFtgfT3PSgDQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22the%20coming%20of%20the%20wireless%20era%20will%20make%20war%20impossible%2C%20because%20it%20will%20make%20war%20ridiculous%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interested in whether radio had attenuated these individual differences in content preferences, Paul Lazarsfeld, head of the Office of Radio Research at Columbia University, set out to examine whether (1) the total amount of time that people listened to the radio and (2) the type of content they listened to correlated with their socioeconomic status.  Not only did Lazarsfeld's data indicate people of lower socioeconomic status tended to listen to more radio programming, but also they were simultaneously less likely to listen to "serious" radio content.  Contrary to popular belief at the time, then, the widespread adoption of the radio seems to have had little, if any, effect on a person's tendency to prefer specific types of content.

Further evidence supporting the knowledge gap hypothesis came from Star and Hughes (1950)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Star|first=S.|author2=Hughes, H.M |title=Report of an education campaign: The Cincinnati plan for the United Nations|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=1950|volume=55|pages=389–397|doi=10.1086/220562}}&lt;/ref&gt;  analysis of efforts to inform Cincinnati adults about the United Nations.  Like Gray and Munroe (1929)&lt;ref name="Gray Munroe 1929" /&gt;  and Lazarsfeld (1940)&lt;ref name="Lazarsfeld 1940" /&gt;  before them, Star and Hughes found that while the campaign was successful in reaching better-educated people, those with less education virtually ignored the campaign.  Additionally, after realizing that the highly educated people reached by the campaign also tended to be more interested in the topic, Star and Hughes suggested that knowledge, education, and interest may be interdependent.

==Specification==

Based on observations implicit in mass communication research, Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) define the knowledge gap hypothesis as follows:
:"As the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, higher socioeconomic status segments tend to acquire this information faster than lower socioeconomic-status population segments so that the gap in knowledge between the two tends to increase rather than decrease" (Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien 1970, pp. 159-160).&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;

Additionally, Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien suggest 5 reasons why the knowledge gap should exist:&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt; 
ailor their conte
# ''Communication skills'': higher status people generally have more education, which improves their reading, comprehension, and memory skills;
# ''Stored information'': higher status people are more likely to already know of topics in the news through previous media exposure or through formal education;
# ''Relevant social contact'': higher status people generally have a broader sphere of activity, greater number of reference groups, and interpersonal contacts and are thus more likely to discuss news topics with others;
# ''Selective exposure'': lower status people may be less interested, and therefore less likely to expose themselves to certain news topics; and
# ''Media target markets'': media outlets cater to the tastes and interests of their audience.

==Formal summary==

Given the preceding information, the knowledge gap hypothesis can be expressed using the following set of related propositions:
# People in a society exhibit great psychological diversity due to their psychological makeup, learned experiences, social relationships, and social category memberships.
# Despite these differences, people with more education tend to have better developed cognitive and communication skills, broader social spheres with more and more diverse social contacts, and a greater amount of stored information than their counterparts with less education.
# People with greater education also tend express interest in, and expose themselves to, a broader range of topics, including serious topics like public affairs, science, and health news.
# Therefore, as the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, segments of the population with higher socioeconomic status tend to acquire this information at a faster rate than the lower status segments so that the gap in knowledge between these segments tends to increase rather than decrease.

==Hypothesis operationalization and initial support==
The knowledge gap hypothesis can be operationalized both for cross-sectional and time-series appropriate research.  For cross-sectional research, the knowledge gap hypothesis expects that "''at any given time'', there should be a higher correlation between acquisition of knowledge and education for topics highly publicized in the media than for topics less highly publicized.&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;   Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) tested this hypothesis using an experiment in which participants were asked to read and discuss two news stories of varying publicity.  The results of the experiment support the hypothesis because correlations between education and understanding were significant for high publicity stories but not significant for low publicity stories.&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;

For time-series research, the knowledge gap hypothesis expects that "''over time'', acquisition of knowledge of a heavily publicized topic will proceed at a faster rate among better educated persons than among those with less education."&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;   Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) tested this hypothesis using public opinion surveys gathered between 1949 and 1965 measuring whether participants believed humans would reach the Moon in the foreseeable future.  During the 15-year span, belief among grade-school educated people increased only about 25 percentage points while belief among college educated people increased more than 60 percentage points, a trend consistent with the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;

==Refining the hypothesis==

Although by the mid-1970s extensive data supported the existence of a knowledge gap among low and high socioeconomic status individuals, Donohue, Tichenor, and Olien (1975)&lt;ref name="Donohue, Tichenor, Olien 1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Donohue|first=G.A.|author2=Tichenor, P.J. |author3=Olien, C.N. |title=Mass media and the knowledge gap: A hypothesis revisited|journal=Communication Research|year=1975|volume=2|issue=1|pages=3–23|doi=10.1177/009365027500200101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  sought to refine the hypothesis to determine under what conditions the knowledge gap might be attenuated or even eliminated.  To this end, they examined survey data on national and local issues from probability samples of 16 Minnesota communities gathered between 1969 and 1975.  Donohue and colleagues identified three variables that weakened the knowledge gap:
# ''Level of basic social concern aroused by the issue'' - Local issues that directly implicated the community tended to arouse greater social concern than national issues that did not implicate the community.  Local issues, then, tended to decrease the magnitude of the knowledge gap.
# ''Level of social conflict surrounding the issue'' - Up to the point at which a communication breakdown occurred, issues with more perceived conflict tended to draw more attention and, thus, decrease the magnitude of the knowledge gap.
# ''Level of homogeneity of the community'' - Because smaller, more homogeneous communities tend to exhibit less social differentiation and variety in sources of information than larger, more heterogeneous communities, homogeneous communities tended to exhibit smaller knowledge gaps than heterogeneous communities.

==Narrative review and meta-analytic support==

At least two narrative reviews and one meta-analysis of knowledge gap hypothesis research exist.  Gaziano conducted two narrative reviews, one of 58 articles with relevant data in 1983&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaziano|first=C.|title=The knowledge gap: An analytical review of media effects|journal=Communication Research|year=1983|volume=10|issue=4|pages=447–486|doi=10.1177/009365083010004003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the other of 39 additional studies in 1997.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaziano|first=C.|title=Forecast 2000: Widening knowledge gaps|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|year=1997|volume=74|issue=2|pages=237–264|doi=10.1177/107769909707400202}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gaziano writes, "the most consistent result is the presence of knowledge differentials, regardless of topic, methodological, or theoretical variations, study excellence, or other variables and conditions" (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;240).  Evidence from several decades, Gaziano concludes, underscores the enduring character of knowledge gaps and indicates that they transcend topics and research settings.

Because narrative reviews examine significance tests rather than effect sizes, Hwang and Jeong (2009)&lt;ref name="Hwang Jeong 2009"/&gt; conducted a meta-analysis of 46 knowledge gap studies.  Consistent with Gaziano's results, however, Hwang and Jeong found constant knowledge gaps across time.

==Closing the knowledge gap hypothesis with Web 2.0==
In 2010 Elizabeth Corley and Dietram Scheufele conducted a study to investigate the widening knowledge gap with the example of nanotechnology. On the whole, public opinion research has shown that respondents with higher socioeconomic status (SES) acquire new information at a higher rate than low SES respondents. Their previous analyses of two large national surveys conducted in 2004 and 2007 found that respondents with at least a college degree displayed an increase in knowledge levels between 2004 and 2007 while respondents with education levels of less than a high school diploma had a significant decrease in nanotechnology knowledge levels. These results stress that the group that is most in need of help, low SES bracket, have not been helped through communication efforts and their nanotechnology knowledge levels have decreased over time.

Corley and Scheufele investigated a wide range of factors that may help to close knowledge gaps, including mass media. The researchers found that the number of days a week that respondents spent online was significantly correlated to knowledge levels about nanotechnology. Therefore, internet use helped those with less formal education to catch up to their counterparts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Corley, E. A., &amp; Scheufele, D. A. (forthcoming). Outreach gone wrong? When we talk nano to the public, we are leaving behind key audiences. The Scientist.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the Internet, and more specifically Web 2.0, may be playing a role in closing the knowledge gap. In fact, Corley and Scheufele explain that "the internet may finally live up to the hype … as a tool for creating a more informed citizenry by serving as a "leveler" of knowledge gaps." (2010, p.&amp;nbsp;2)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This is widely due to the fact that information on Web 2.0 is written in layman's terms. The content is created by those individuals who have an understanding of the information, but who are also able to tailor the articles towards a more general audience.

Still, the knowledge gap may still exist even with the emergence of Web 2.0. The disenfranchised group, in this situation, the group with lower SES, must still be motivated to get the information to close the gap. Also, information about a given subject must be given. Without the content being provided, Web 2.0 will not be much of a help.  However, if the content is provided, Web 2.0 has allowed the readers to be more interactive and talk with others online, through discussion boards, forums and blogs. The results of the research conducted by Corley and Scheufele are a clear call to action for researchers to investigate non-traditional ways of connecting with lay audiences about emerging technologies.

Overall, studies show the introduction of Web 2.0 may help in closing the knowledge gap because the content that traditionally those with lower SES could not reach, can now be understood because it is written in layman's terms. Web 2.0 has helped because:
# The content on Web 2.0 is created by everyday people, for everyday people
# As a user, you can be interactive to find more information about a given subject (click through other links to find more information, search for theories and ideas you don't know on search engines, or read supplemented articles to get more information)

==Criticism and directions for future research==

# Although the majority of research supports the proposition that the higher the education, the greater the knowledge of various topics, the knowledge gap hypothesis specifies that this relationship should be moderated by the level of media publicity a given issue receives.  Few knowledge gap studies, however, treat media publicity as a variable.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;
# Because time-trend analyses indicate knowledge differentials fluctuate over time, most one-shot studies offer a brief and potentially misleading snapshot of knowledge gaps.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;
# A new, vital area for knowledge gap researchers to understand is the role of the family in socialization patterns related to learning.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;
# Because policy decisions have played a major role in increasing inequality, and knowledge gap research has policy implications, researchers should include more dialogue with policymakers.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;

== Competing hypotheses ==

There are now three existing competing hypotheses: 1) Media Malaise hypothesis (that predicts a general negative effect), 2) the Virtuous Circle hypothesis (that predicts a general positive effect), and 3) the Differential Effect hypothesis (that predicts a positive effect from newspapers, and a null or negative effect from television)" (Fraile, 2011).&lt;ref name="Fraile 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraile|first=M.|title=Widening or reducing the knowledge gap? Testing the media effects on political knowledge in Spain (2004-2006)|journal=[[International Journal of Press/Politics]]|year=2011|volume=16|issue=2|pages=163–184|doi=10.1177/1940161210388413}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three types of media outlets have been used to examine the media effects on knowledge gap: 1) Television – knowledge gap between lower and higher education groups are greater among light television users compared to heavy television users (Eveland, 2000),&lt;ref name="Eveland Scheufele 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eveland|first=W.P.|author2=Scheufele, D.A. |title=Connecting news media use with gaps in knowledge and participation.|journal=[[Political Communication (journal)|Political Communication]]|year=2000|volume=17|issue=3|pages=215–237|doi=10.1080/105846000414250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  2) Newspaper – the exposure to newspaper can potentially reinforce the knowledge gap in politics for different SES groups since reading newspaper requires literacy ability to effectively understand the information (Jerit ''et al.'', 2006),&lt;ref name="Jerit Jason Toby 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jerit|first=J.|author2=Barabas, J. |author3=Bolsen, T. |title=Citizens, knowledge, and the information environment|journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]]|year=2006|volume=50|issue=2|pages=266–282|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00183.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while other studies suggest that exposure to newspaper actually slightly decreases the knowledge gap rather than increasing it (Eveland, 2000),&lt;ref name="Eveland Scheufele 2000" /&gt;  and 3) Internet - internet exposure increases public's general knowledge in health issues (Shim, 2008).&lt;ref name="Shim 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shim|first=M.|title=Connecting Internet uses with gaps in cancer knowledge|journal=[[Health Communication]]|year=2008|volume=23|issue=6|pages=448–461|doi=10.1080/10410230802342143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''noun particle''' is any [[morpheme]] that denotes or marks the presence of a [[noun]].  Noun particles do not exist in [[English language|English]], but can be found in other languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. &lt;!-- I'm pretty sure Arabic has object and topic particles as well; someone knowledgeable in Arabic should add something below. -Roehl Sybing --&gt;

==Korean particles==
&lt;!-- The following section is based on the Korean reference found on Wikibooks, as I have very little experience with Korean.  Romanization - as well as clarifications/corrections - is most certainly encouraged and requested. -RS --&gt;
{{Main|Korean language}}
Korean particles are [[postposition]]s, which differ from English [[preposition]]s in that they come ''after'' the word they mark.
*'''Example #1:''' {{lang|ko|새가 지붕 '''위에''' 있어요.}} (There's a bird '''on''' the roof.)
The particle "{{lang|ko|위에}}" is used to mean "on" or "above." It follows the word "{{lang|ko|지붕}}" ("roof").
*'''Example #2:''' {{lang|ko|도서관이 시장 옆에 있어요.}} (The library is '''next to''' the market.)
The particle "{{lang|ko|옆에}}" means "next to," and it follows "{{lang|ko|시장}}" ("market").

==Japanese particles==
{{Main|Japanese grammar}}

Just as in Korean, noun particles follow the noun being marked, and can serve any of several functions in a given sentence.
*'''Example #1:''' {{lang|ja|昨日スーパーへ行きました。}} (Yesterday, I went '''to''' the supermarket.)
**Kinoo suupaa '''e''' ikimashita.
In this example, "e" is the noun particle for "suupaa" ("supermarket").  This particular noun particle denotes direction towards a place, being "supermarket."

*'''Example #2:''' {{lang|ja|昼ごはんは私がピザを食べた。}} (I ate pizza for lunch. '''lit.''' '''As for''' lunch, I ate pizza.)
**Hirugohan '''wa''' watashi '''ga''' piza '''o''' tabeta.
The three noun particles ("wa," "ga," and "o") all serve different functions:
* "wa" - ''topic marker'' ("hirugohan" - lunch)
* "ga" - ''subject marker'' ("watashi" - I)
* "o" - ''object marker'' ("piza" - pizza)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14520">'''Religious education''' is the term given to  [[education]] concerned with [[religion]]. It may refer to education provided by a [[Church body|church]] or religious organization, for instruction in [[doctrine]] and [[faith]], or for  education in various aspects of religion, but without explicitly religious or [[moral]] aims, e.g. in a [[school]] or [[college]]. The term is often known as [[religious studies]].

==England==
Religious Education (RE) is a compulsory subject in the [[public education|state education]] system in [[England]].  Schools are required to teach a programme of religious studies according to local and national guidelines.

Religious Education in [[England]] is mandated by the [[Education Act 1944]] as amended by the [[Education Reform Act 1988]] and the [[School Standards and Framework Act 1998]]. The provision of Religious Education is compulsory in all state-funded schools, but it is not compulsory for any of the children to take the subject. The subject consists of the study of different religions, religious leaders, and other religious and moral themes. However, the curriculum is required to reflect the predominant place of Christianity in religious life and hence Christianity forms the majority of the content of the subject. All parents have the right to withdraw a child from religious education, which schools must approve.&lt;ref name="withdraw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/r/recollectiveworshipandtherighttowithdraw/|title=Religious Education&amp;nbsp;— collective worship and the right to withdraw|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families|author=Department for Children, Schools and Families|work=Teachernet|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630193803/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/r/recollectiveworshipandtherighttowithdraw/|archivedate=2008-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, all schools are required by law to provide a daily act of [[Collective Worship (schools in England and Wales)|collective worship]], of which at least 51% must be Christian in basis over the course of the academic year.&lt;ref name="collwors"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/c/collectiveworship/|title=Collective worship|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families|year=2005|author=Department for Children, Schools and Families|work=Teachernet|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112044304/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/c/collectiveworship/|archivedate=2008-01-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Smalley, the chair of the Association of Religious Education inspectors, advisors and consultants, stated that some "schools did have problems fulfilling the requirement for worship" due to what they thought was "a lack of space to gather the entire school for worship" although Smalley noted that "there is actually no requirement for such a gathering, as smaller groups are allowed."&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4693129.stm|title=School worship: from sports to death|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=BBC|author=Lucy Wilkins|work=BBC News website | date=2005-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Union of Teachers]] suggested in 2008 that parents should have a right to have specific schooling in their own faith and that imams, rabbis and priests should be invited to offer religious instruction to pupils in all state schools.&lt;ref name="nutbbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7311178.stm|title=Call to offer faith class choice|accessdate=2008-03-27|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|author=Hannah Goff|work=BBC News website | date=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[England]] has a Local Agreed [[Syllabus]] which mandate subject teaching for each [[Key Stage]] and possibly for each school year. The [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]] has also produced the non-statutory National Framework for Religious Education, which provides guidelines for the provision of RE at all key stages, and models the eight-levels as applied in National Curriculum subjects.&lt;ref name="nc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nc.uk.net/webdav/harmonise?Page/@id=6004&amp;Subject/@id=7881|title=Religious Education: non-statutory framework|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|year=2004|author=Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|work=National Curriculum Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211211245/http://www.nc.uk.net/webdav/harmonise?Page%2F%40id=6004&amp;Subject%2F%40id=7881|archivedate=2007-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
In France, RE is replaced by a non-religious moral teaching (called civic, legal and social education : ''éducation civique, juridique et sociale'', ECJS). Children can additionally receive, on a voluntary basis, a religious education, either at school in private religious school, or outside of school, in their religious community, if they are in a public (State) school. Although in some rare regions, namely Alsace-Moselle, the old Concordat of 1801 being still valid because of the German occupation at the time of the separation of Church and State in France and the strong stand of population in favour of this, religious education is compulsory, and a dispense is necessary if the child refuses to be following (Catholic or Protestant) religious education.

==Ireland==
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] religion is taught in a subject called Religious Education which is compulsory in many schools for the Junior Certificate, but available as an option for the Leaving Certificate{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. The course educates students about communities of faith, the foundations of the major world religions, the sacred texts, religious practices and festivals for Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. Students also learn about religious change in Ireland, meaning in life, religious and non-religious responses to the search for meaning, atheism, agnosticism and other forms of belief. Students are also educated about morality in a number of different faiths and their moral codes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Israel==
Israeli school system includes State Schools; Religious State Schools; Recognized Schools and Exempt Schools, whose students are regarded as fulfilling the obligatory education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.bepress.com/taulwps/fp/art44 A. Maoz, "Religious Education in Israel", 83  U. Det. Mercy L. Rev (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;679-728.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
The prevailing view is that the religious education would contravene the constitutional [[Secularism|separation of state and religion]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In place of RE, there is a short but nonetheless compulsory subject called {{nihongo|"Ethics"|{{ruby-ja|道徳|どうとく}}|doutoku|''lit.'' "morality"}} in [[primary school]], where the purpose is to teach [[moral values]] rather than to teach ethics as an academic subject. However, despite the stated [[secular]] stance, references to the majority religions of Shinto and Buddhism are sometimes made in class texts.

==Lebanon==
Being a secular country, with no state religion, Lebanon is expected to have a neutral position regarding religious education in its schools, which is not the case in the country, as well as many European and American countries. Lebanon doesn't have a law concerning RE in its educational establishments. Schools have the right to either give RE classes, or do the opposite. Religious classes are not obligatory, nor banned, and they are not replaced by "ethics" classes.
Private Schools (Christian and Muslim) give mandatory religious classes, reflecting their religious identification. Students from other religions don't take any classes during the religious ones, but they always can sign up for the RE class. Catholic schools give only Catholic classes, mandatory for Christian students, but can be signed up for by Muslim students, if not, Muslims do not take any classes in parallel to Christian ones. Public schools kind of have a more liberal religious program. A Lebanese public school may give, or not give RE classes, which regard the predominant religion of the population in the area the school is located in. Students have to take these classes, whether they are Christian or Muslim. A public school located in a mixed area would prefer not to give RE classes, unless voted oppositely by locals, RE classes may be both Christian and Muslim at the same time in this case, and students divide when this happens.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Malaysia==
The Malaysian education system makes ''Moral Studies'' compulsory for non-Muslim students at secondary and primary schools. Muslim students instead partake in ''Islamic Studies'' lessons. Both subjects figure among the seven compulsory subjects undertaken by students for the [[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia]]. There has been considerable debate about the usefulness of the "Moral" subject, primarily due to the strict exam-oriented marking-schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/2377731/Article/index_html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019192539/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/2377731/Article/index_html |archivedate=2008-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland ==
{{Main|Education in Scotland}}
In [[Scotland|Scottish]] state schools, Religious Education is called ''Religious and Moral Education'' from ages 5 to 14, and ''Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies'' from 14 to 18.

The majority of [[state school]]s in are [[Secular Education|non-denominational]], but as a result of the [[Education Act 1918]], separate denominational [[state school]]s were also established. The vast majority of denominational state schools are [[Roman Catholic]] but there are also a number of [[Scottish Episcopal]] schools. The school buildings are built and maintained by the Roman Catholic Church were handed over to the state under the Education Act. Since then,the Catholic schools are fully funded by the [[Scottish Government]] and administered by the [[Education and Lifelong Learning Directorate]]. As part of the deal, there are specific legal provisions to ensure the promotion of a Catholic ethos in such schools: applicants for positions in the areas of Religious Education, Guidance or Senior Management must be approved by the [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland]], which also appoints a [[chaplain]] to each of its schools. There is also one Jewish state primary school.

==South Africa==
The [[South Africa]]n National Policy on Religion and Education adopted in September 2003 provides for Religion Education, i.e. education about diverse religions, which does not promote any particular religion in the [[State school|public school]] curriculum. The policy does not apply to [[private school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Policy on Religion and Education|url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70211|publisher=info.gov.za|accessdate=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131232848/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70211|archivedate=31 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeenah|first=Na'eem|editor1-first=Brian|editor1-last=Ramadiro|editor2-first=Salim|editor2-last=Vally|title=Education Rights for Learners, Parents and Educators Book 5: Religion and Schools|url=http://www.erp.org.za/pdf/religion%20booklet_WEB.pdf|publisher=Education Rights Project|accessdate=20 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030181341/http://www.erp.org.za/pdf/religion%20booklet_WEB.pdf|archivedate=30 October 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vietnamese calligraphy''' (Vietnamese Quốc ngữ: thư pháp Việt Nam, Hán Nôm: 書法越南) refers to the [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] traditions of Vietnam.  It can refer to calligraphic works using a variety of scripts, including [[Chinese characters]], [[Chữ nôm]], and the Latin-based [[Quốc ngữ]].  Historically, calligraphers used the former two scripts.  However, due to the adoption of the Latin-based Quốc ngữ, modern Vietnamese calligraphy also uses Roman characters.

Traditional Vietnamese calligraphy is strongly affected by that of China.  As part of the East Asian cultural spheres, Classical Chinese was often used as the written medium of communication, and as a result, Vietnamese calligraphy thus also follows Chinese calligraphy’s standard and use Han script (Chinese language) in many of its writings. For example, during the [[Lý dynasty]], its style was very much similar to China’s [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907), during the [[Trần dynasty]], it was influenced strongly by China’s [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960-1279) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (1271-1368) dynasties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/life-style/350055/new-book-tells-story-of-vn-calligraphy.html#6ebrFO7wJy6J0uqO.97|title=New book tells story of VN calligraphy|last=|first=|date=|work=Vietnam News|access-date=19 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nonetheless, over time, Vietnam developed its own styles of calligraphy for writing both Classical Chinese and [[Chữ Nôm|Chữ nôm]]. In [[Lê dynasty|Later Le dynasty]], Vietnam developed a unique style of calligraphy which was called Nam tự (南字）by Phạm Đình Hổ (範廷琥) in his book Vũ Trung Tùy Bút (雨中隨筆)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vũ Trung Tùy Bút|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was first used in bureaucracy only, but later became popular in all writing purposes. It was also called Lệnh Thư (令書) in Việt Sử Toát Yếu (越史撮要) because of its bureaucratic characteristic at first&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Việt Sử Toát Yếu|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In modern times, calligraphy has been done frequently in the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ script, as Chữ nôm and Chinese characters have largely fallen out of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vietnamese neglect Han-Nom heritage|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/sunday/features/220749/vietnamese-neglect-han-nom-heritage.html|accessdate=18 December 2013|newspaper=Viet Nam News|date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quốc Ngữ calligraphy gained popularity during the [[Vietnamese poetry#New poetry movement|New Poetry]] and [[Vietnamese poetry#Free poetry movement|Free Poetry Movements]], due to the increasing popularity of using the Vietnamese vernacular, as well as influence from French literature.  Modern Vietnamese calligraphy is undoubtedly influenced by modern Latin [[cursive]], but is written using the [[ink brush|calligraphy brush]], rather than quill or reed pens as is done in Western calligraphy.  Much as Chinese calligraphy is used to write poems, festive banners, signage, and so on, Vietnamese calligraphy can also serve the same purpose today.
