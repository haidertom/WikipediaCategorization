'''Boutique manufacturing''' is a method used for the custom production of certain products in limited quantities by hand or with a restricted level of automation. Products produced this way often include ceramics, furniture, amplifiers, yachts, boats, leather goods or watches and jewellery among others. In industrial countries, boutique manufacturing is being selected generally for high class goods in upper price levels and only for single products or small batches.

==Benefits and disadvantages==

The key advantages of boutique manufacturing in comparison to traditional factory manufacturing with batch fabrication, large or mass production are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
* low investment in factory automation
* high flexibility during manufacturing
* quick alteration of product types produced on every workplace or production line
* supports build to order without the necessity of using many pre-assembled components; creation of value caused by assembly takes place mainly at the end of the production flow.
* allows an unachieved level of product individualization

Consequently, boutique manufacturing closes the gap between piece production and small batch/low volume production. The workflow organization of a boutique manufacturing entity can be a mixture of both – elements of jobbing or batch production, however involving higher standardization than the first one. Often boutique manufacturing workshop and factories are organized with single workplaces or production cells carrying out a number of subsequent production steps until completion of certain components or even the whole product. Flexibility and variety of products being able to produce in the entity therefore are much higher than with the more standardized method batch production. 

However, with this method, manufacturing of larger quantities of unified products is not possible at reasonable costs. Serial fabrication or large production of goods then would be suitable alternative production methods involving higher grades of automation and standardization.

}}In a '''case competition''', participants strive to develop the best solution to a business or education-related [[case study]] within an allocated time frame, typically with teams of two or more individuals pitted against each other in a head-to-head or broader relative ranking.&lt;ref name="CBS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UCB" /&gt; Teams deliver presentations for judges and, while competitions vary in composition, a standard [[wikt:format|format]] and purpose exists.

== History ==
The case competition concept originated in the United States and originally included participants from domestic universities. The notion of expanding to include international competitors emerged later, with the concept eventually taking hold across North America and Western Europe. Today, a wide range of international competitions are hosted in various countries in North America, Europe, and Asia,&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a case competition? |url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/CBS-International/International-Collaboration/CBS-and-Case-Competitions/CBS-and-Case-Competitions/content/What-is-a-case-competition |work=Copenhagen Business School |publisher=Copenhagen Business School |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Stephanie Wold Hadler |date=11 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126093841/http://www.cbs.dk/en/CBS-International/International-Collaboration/CBS-and-Case-Competitions/CBS-and-Case-Competitions/content/What-is-a-case-competition |archivedate=26 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. International case competitions have also begun expanding beyond the undergraduate level, as competitions like the Wharton China Business Society International Case Competition offer high school divisions &lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2017/02/wharton-china-business-forum|title=Wharton China Business Society International Case Competiton}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [http://www.aub.edu.lb/osb/menarcci/ Middle East &amp; North Africa Regional Case Initiative]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (MENARCCI) at the American University of Beirut (AUB). MENARCCI's goal is to serve as a depository of all necessary knowledge about the case method, sources of cases and publishing outlets, and the links to all cases on the Region available on-line. In the Middle East, cases competitions are conducted by [http://www.aub.edu.lb the American University of Beirut] and [http://www.aucegypt.edu the American University in Cairo].

==Format==

Formats vary according to a number of dimensions. The following dimensions are often used to classify and compare competitions: Host: corporate versus educational institution; Participant selection: "by invitation" versus "by application"; and, Level: undergraduate, [[Postgraduate education|graduate]]. Formats may vary along practical dimensions, including: Case specificity (whether the case has been written especially for the competition or not); Number of teams; Organization (student-run, professional etc.); Rules, e.g.:Time (common formats are 3-4 or 24 hours), Materials, Degree of access to expert advice (either from within the competition or externally, and electronically or face to face).

Some competitions add complexity to create a more interesting challenge. For example, [[Ohio State University|Ohio State University (OSU)]]'s Center For International Business Education And Research (CIBER), in its annual Case Challenge, created teams from the overall pool of participants, regardless of school, dissolving the usual school-based team format. For the Ohio State scenario, once the students are assigned to teams, a full day of [[Team building|team-building]] exercises is run for competitors.

Competitions can be internal to a [[business school]], or they can involve teams from multiple schools. Sometimes the competition includes several rounds, with the final round typically judged by outside [[Senior management|company executives]] (sometimes the panel consists of executives from the actual company in the case). For example, the [[University of Washington]]’s [[Foster School of Business]]' 2010 round of its Global Business Case Competition featured a customized case on the [[Boeing|Boeing Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives Global Business Case Competition|url=http://www.foster.washington.edu/centers/gbc/globalbusinesscasecompetition/Pages/archives.aspx|work=Foster|publisher=Michael G. Foster School of Business, University of Washington|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff|year=2002-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Boeing executives acted as judges.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Participation==
Participants exercise skills and knowledge on a "[[Reality|real world]]" case for an actual organization, with the support of representatives who can provide professional advice.&lt;ref name="CBS" /&gt; Other competitions select an issue based on its degree of importance, and employ the competition as a means to both highlight the issue and create potential solutions through the efforts of the competitors.&lt;ref name="UCB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Nonprofit and Public Leadership {{!}} Educational Case Leadership Competition |url=http://nonprofit.haas.berkeley.edu/new/elcc.html |work=University of California, Berkeley {{!}} Haas School of Business |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Staff |year=1996–2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510134032/http://nonprofit.haas.berkeley.edu/new/elcc.html |archivedate=10 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants can also be assessed as potential [[candidate]]s for [[analysis]]-based jobs within the targeted companies.

Teams in case competitions are tasked with assessing the situation facing the organization, analyzing available information, crafting a solution, and defending their recommendations. In general, teams adhere to a time limit and specific rules. Each team is judged independently, and the judges' decision is final, although a confidential summary [[evaluation]] is generally provided.&lt;ref name="Molson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact John Molson MBA International Case Competition|url=http://www.mbacasecomp.com/en/contact|work=John Molson MBA International Case Competition|publisher=John Molson MBA International Case Competition|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a term used in the [[Retailing|retail]] industry.   [[Retailing|Retailers]] contract with their [[Supply chain|suppliers]] to supply a quantity of product in a specified time period to a specific location at an agreed price.  The quantity and value of the [[balance of contract]] represents a risk to the retailer from the point of view that the retailer will have to discount a product that experiences a [[Demand curve|slump in demand]].   The setting of targets and maxima at various levels in the retailer's product hierarchies and time dimensions; and the subordination of purchasing to these limits, is known as "Commitment control".

A '''corporate accelerator''' is a specific form of [[seed accelerator]] which is sponsored by an established for-profit corporation. Similar to seed accelerators they support early-stage [[Startup company|startup companies]] through [[mentorship]] and often capital and office space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Accelerating Entrepreneurs and Ecosystems: The Seed Accelerator Model |journal=Innovation Policy and the Economy |date=2015 |last=Hochberg |first=Yael |volume=16 |page=24|accessdate=2015-06-17 |url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c13584.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to regular programs, though, corporate accelerators derive their objectives from the sponsoring organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://corporate-accelerators.net/2015/06/15/what-is-a-corporate-accelerator.html |title=What are Corporate Accelerators? |last=Heinemann |first=Florian |date=2015-06-15 |accessdate=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These objectives can include the wish to stay close to emerging trends or to establish a funnel for corporate [[venture capital]] investments.

According to [https://corporate-accelerators.net/database/index.html Corporate Accelerator DB] there are 70+ such programs in existence as of December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://corporate-accelerators.net/database/index.html |title=Corporate Accelerator Database |last=Heinemann |first=Florian |accessdate=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable companies include [[Microsoft]], [[Citrix]], and [[Telefónica]] who were among the first companies to offer such programs in the early 2010s. More recently, corporate accelerators have faced criticism as they might be less effective as regular seed accelerators. For example, the startup could be too focused on solving the problems of the sponsoring firm rather than finding external customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/25/corporate-accelerators-are-an-oxymoron/ |title=Corporate Accelerators Are An Oxymoron |last=Crichton |first=Danny |date=2014-08-25 |accessdate=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate accelerators differ from [[Business incubators]], which usually have a continuous intake, due to their fixed-term, cohort-based organization (similar to seed accelerators) and are distinct to [[corporate venture capital]] which is a direct, targeted investment.

'''Feasibility Study''' is an assessment of the practicality of a proposed project or system.

== Overview ==
A feasibility study aims to objectively and rationally uncover the strengths and weaknesses of an existing business or proposed venture, opportunities and threats present in the [[natural environment]], the [[resources]] required to carry through, and ultimately the prospects for success.&lt;ref name="Justis"&gt;Justis, R. T. &amp; Kreigsmann, B. (1979). The feasibility study as a tool for venture analysis. ''Business Journal of Small Business Management'' 17 (1) 35-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georgakellos, D. A. &amp; Marcis, A. M. (2009). Application of the semantic learning approach in the feasibility studies preparation training process. ''Information Systems Management'' 26 (3) 231-240.&lt;/ref&gt; In its simplest terms, the two criteria to judge feasibility are [[cost]] required and [[value (economics)|value]] to be attained.&lt;ref&gt;Young, G. I. M. (1970). Feasibility studies. ''Appraisal Journal'' 38 (3) 376-383.&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-designed feasibility study should provide a historical background of the business or project, a description of the [[Product (business)|product]] or [[Service (economics)|service]], accounting statements, details of the [[Business operations|operations]] and [[management]], [[marketing research]] and policies, financial data, legal requirements and tax obligations.&lt;ref name="Justis"/&gt; Generally, feasibility studies precede technical development and [[project]] implementation.

A feasibility study evaluates the project's potential for success; therefore, perceived objectivity is an important factor in the credibility of the study for potential investors and lending institutions.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Feasibility studies as a tool for successful co-operative business enterprises {{Cite web|title = (A case study of the importance of Feasibility students to co-operative investment)|url = https://www.grossarchive.com/project/1796/FEASIBILITY-STUDIES-AS-A-TOOL-FOR-SUCCESSFUL-COPERATIVE-BUSINESS-INTERPRISES--A-CASE-STUDY-OF-THE-IMPORTANCE-OF-FEASIBILITY-STUDENTS-TO-CO-OPERATIVE-INVESTMENT-.html|website =grossarchive.com|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It must therefore be conducted with an objective, unbiased approach to provide information upon which decisions can be based.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Formal definition==

A project feasibility study is a comprehensive report that examines in detail the five frames of analysis of a given project. It also takes into consideration
its four Ps, its risks and POVs, and its constraints (calendar, costs, and norms of quality). The goal is to determine whether the project should go ahead, be redesigned, or else abandoned altogether.&lt;ref&gt; Mesly, Olivier. (2017). ''Project feasibility – Tools for uncovering points of vulnerability.'' New York, NY: Taylor and Francis, CRC Press. 546 pages. ISBN 9 781498 757911. See page 130.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The five frames of analysis are: The frame of definition; the frame of contextual risks; the frame of potentiality; the parametric frame; the frame of dominant and contingency strategies.

The four Ps are traditionally defined as Plan, Processes, People, and Power. The risks are considered to be external to the project (e.g., weather conditions) and are divided in eight categories: (Plan) financial and organizational (e.g., government structure for a private project); (Processes) environmental and technological; (People) marketing and sociocultural; and (Power) legal and political. POVs are Points of Vulnerability: they differ from risks in the sense that they are internal to the project and can be controlled or else eliminated.

The constraints are the standard constraints of calendar, costs and norms of quality that can each be objectively determined and measured along the entire project lifecycle. Depending on projects, portions of the study may suffice to produce a feasibility study; smaller projects, for example, may not require an exhaustive environmental assessment.

== Common factors ==
The acronym [[TELOS (project management)|TELOS]] refers to the five areas of feasibility -  Technical, Economic, Legal, Operational and Scheduling.

===Technical feasibility===  
This assessment is based on an outline design of system requirements, to determine whether the company has the technical expertise to handle completion of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Blecke, Curtis. Financial Analysis for Decision making. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: prentice-Hall, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caiden, Naomi, and Aaron Wildovsky. planning and Budgeting in Poor Countries. New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pouliquen, Louis Y. Risk Analysis in Project Appraisal. World Bank Staff Occasional Papers, no. 11. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; When writing a feasibility report, the following should be taken to consideration:
* A brief description of the business to assess more possible factors which could affect the study
* The part of the business being examined
* The human and economic factor
* The possible solutions to the problem    

At this level, the concern is whether the proposal is both ''technically'' and ''[[legally]]'' feasible (assuming moderate cost).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The technical feasibility assessment is focused on gaining an understanding of the present technical resources of the organization and their applicability to the expected needs of the proposed system.
It is an evaluation of the hardware and software and how it meets the need of the proposed system&lt;ref name="Management Information Systems 10e"&gt;O'Brien, J. A., &amp; Marakas, G. M. (2011). Developing Business/IT Solutions. In Management Information Systems (pp. 488-489). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill/Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Method of production ====
The selection among a number of methods to produce the same commodity should be undertaken first. Factors that make one method being preferred to other method in agricultural projects are the following:
* Availability of inputs or raw materials and their quality and prices. 
* Availability of markets for outputs of each method and the expected prices for these outputs.
* Various efficiency factors such as the expected increase in one additional unit of fertilizer or productivity of a specified crop per one dunum.

==== Production technique ====
After we determine the appropriate method of production of a commodity, it is necessary to look for the optimal technique to produce this commodity. 
 
==== Project requirements ====
Once the method of production and its technique are determined, technical people have to determine the projects' requirements during the investment and operating periods. These include:
* Determination of tools and equipment needed for the project such as drinkers and feeders or pumps or pipes …etc.
* Determination of projects' requirements of constructions such as buildings, storage, and roads …etc. in addition to internal designs for these requirements.
* Determination of projects' requirements of skilled and unskilled  labor and managerial and financial labor.
* Determination of construction period concerning the costs of designs and consultations and the costs of constructions and other tools.
* Determination of minimum storage of inputs, cash money to cope with operating and contingency costs.

==== Project location ====
The most important factors that determine the selection of project location are the following:
* Availability of land (proper acreage and reasonable costs). 
* The impact of the project on the environment and the approval of the concerned institutions for license.
* The costs of transporting inputs and outputs to the project's location (i.e., the distance from the markets).
* Availability of various services related to the project such as availability of extension services or veterinary or water or electricity or good roads ...etc.

===Legal feasibility===
It Determines whether the proposed system conflicts with legal requirements, e.g., a data processing system must comply with the local data protection regulations and if the proposed venture is acceptable in accordance to the laws of the land.

===Operational feasibility study===
Operational feasibility is the measure of how well a proposed system solves the problems, and takes advantage of the opportunities identified during scope definition and how it satisfies the requirements identified in the requirements analysis phase of system development.&lt;ref name="SAD-Global_Enterprise"&gt;Bentley, L &amp; Whitten, J (2007). ''System Analysis &amp; Design for the Global Enterprise''. 7th ed. (p. 417).&lt;/ref&gt;

The operational feasibility assessment focuses on the degree to which the proposed development project fits in with the existing business environment and objectives with regard to development schedule, delivery date, [[corporate culture]] and existing business processes.

To ensure success, desired operational outcomes must be imparted during design and development. These include such design-dependent parameters as reliability, maintainability, supportability, usability, producibility, disposability, sustainability, affordability and others. These parameters are required to be considered at the early stages of design if desired operational behaviours are to be realised. A system design and development requires appropriate and timely application of engineering and management efforts to meet the previously mentioned parameters. A system may serve its intended purpose most effectively when its technical and operating characteristics are engineered into the design. Therefore, operational feasibility is a critical aspect of systems engineering that needs to be an integral part of the early design phases.&lt;ref name="SE_and_Analysis"&gt;[[Benjamin S. Blanchard]] &amp; [[Wolt Fabrycky]] (uk). ''Systems Engineering &amp; Analysis ''. 5th ed. (p. 361).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time feasibility===
A time feasibility study will take into account the period in which the project is going to take upto its completion. A project will fail if it takes too long to be completed before it is useful. Typically this means estimating how long the system will take to develop, and if it can be completed in a given time period using some methods like payback period. Time feasibility is a measure of how reasonable the project timetable is. Given our technical expertise, are the project deadlines reasonable? Some projects are initiated with specific deadlines. It is necessary to determine whether the deadlines are mandatory or desirable.

==Other feasibility factors==


===Resource feasibility===
Describe how much time is available to build the new system, when it can be built, whether it interferes with normal business operations, type and amount of resources required, dependencies,
and developmental procedures with company revenue prospectus.

===Financial feasibility===
In case of a new project, financial viability can be judged on the following parameters:

* Total estimated cost of the project
* Financing of the project in terms of its capital structure, debt to equity ratio and promoter's share of total cost
* Existing investment by the promoter in any other business
* Projected cash flow and profitability

The financial viability of a project should provide the following information:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/procurement-policy-and-guidance/buying/contract-issues/assessing-financial-viability/practice.html|title=ASSESSING FINANCIAL VIABILITY|first=Department of|last=Finance|date=30 October 2013|website=www.finance.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Full details of the assets to be financed and how liquid those assets are.
* Rate of conversion to cash-liquidity (i.e., how easily the various assets can be converted to cash).
* Project's funding potential and repayment terms.
* Sensitivity in the repayments capability to the following factors:
** Mild slowing of sales.
** Acute reduction/slowing of sales.
** Small increase in cost.
** Large increase in cost.
** Adverse economic conditions.
In 1983 the first generation of the Computer Model for Feasibility Analysis and Reporting (COMFAR), a computation tool for financial analysis of investments, was released. Since then, this United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) software has been developed to also support the economic appraisal of projects.
The COMFAR III Expert is intended as an aid in the analysis of investment projects. The main module of the program accepts financial and economic data, produces financial and economic statements and graphical displays and calculates measures of performance. Supplementary modules assist in the analytical process. Cost-benefit and value-added methods of economic analysis developed by UNIDO are included in the program and the methods of major international development institutions are accommodated. The program is applicable for the analysis of investment in new projects and expansion or rehabilitation of existing enterprises as, e.g., in the case of reprivatisation projects. For joint ventures, the financial perspective of each partner or class of shareholder can be developed. Analysis can be performed under a variety of assumptions concerning inflation, currency revaluation and price escalations.&lt;ref&gt;COMFAR III Expert Reference Manual United Nations Industrial Development Organisation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market research studies==
This is one of the most important sections of the feasibility study as it examines the marketability of the product or services and convinces readers that there is a potential market for the product or services.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} If a significant market for the product or services cannot be established, then there is no project.

Typically, market studies will assess the potential sales of the product, absorption and market capture rates and the project's timing.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The feasibility study outputs the ''feasibility study report'', a report detailing the evaluation criteria, the study findings, and the recommendations.&lt;ref name="fsr"&gt;{{Citation| author=Michele Berrie|date=September 2008|url=http://www.pmhut.com/initiating-phase-feasibility-study-request-and-report| title=Initiating Phase - Feasibility Study Request and Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''InfoZoom''' software is a data analysis, [[business intelligence]] and [[data visualization]] [[Computer software|software]] product created using [[in-memory database|in-memory]] analytics.  The software is created and supported by humanIT and the Fraunhofer Institute FIT ,&lt;ref&gt;InfoZoom development at the Fraunhofer Institute FIT http://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/de/fb/risk/projects/infozoom.html&lt;/ref&gt; the same organization that created [[MP3]] compression technology.&lt;ref&gt;How MP3 was invented http://www.mp3-history.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  The software has over 100,000 licensed users and over 1000 customers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Customer case studies, http://www.softlakesolutions.com/customers/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
InfoZoom software is developed by humanIT GmbH near Bonn, [[Germany]].  It was created in 1997 as a spin-off from the [[Fraunhofer Society]] which is the same scientific organization that contributed to MP3 compression technology.  
Since 2003, humanIT is a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] of [[proALPHA]], an ERP ([[Enterprise resource planning]]) vendor based in Weilerbach, Germany.  Today, InfoZoom is co-developed and supported by the Fraunhofer-Institut für Angewandte Informationstechnik (FIT),&lt;ref&gt;Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology, http://www.fit.fraunhofer.de&lt;/ref&gt; as known as the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology in St. Augustin, Germany.  

InfoZoom v6.0 was released in March, 2009.  The 64-bit version of InfoZoom was released as v6.4 in November 2009.  InfoZoom v7.0 was released in November, 2010, with the release of v8.0 in November 2011.

By the end of 2009, InfoZoom had grown significantly reaching 36,000 licensed users and 800 client organizations worldwide and in 2011 reaching 50,000 users with 1000 clients.

== Products ==

{{Business administration}}

A '''business entity''' is an entity that is formed and administered as per [[corporate law]] in order to engage in [[business]] activities, charitable work, or other activities allowable. Most often, business entities are formed to sell a product or a service.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} There are many types of [[business entities]] defined in the legal systems of various countries. These include [[corporation]]s, [[cooperative]]s, [[partnership]]s, [[sole trader]]s, [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]] and other specifically permitted and labelled types of entities. The specific rules vary by country and by state or province. Some of these types are listed below, by country. For guidance, approximate equivalents in the company law of English-speaking countries are given in most cases, for example:

:≈ [[Ltd.]] (UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth)
:≈ [[public limited company]] (UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth)
:≈ [[limited partnership]]
:≈ unlimited partnership
:≈ [[chartered company]]
:≈ [[Statutory corporation|statutory company]]
:≈ [[holding company]]
:≈ [[Subsidiary|subsidiary company]]
:≈ one man company ([[sole proprietorship]])
:≈ [[charitable incorporated organisation]] (UK)
:≈ [[non-governmental organization]]

However, the regulations governing particular types of entities, even those described as roughly equivalent, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. When creating or restructuring a business, the legal responsibilities will depend on the type of business entity chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Choose a legal structure for a new business |url=https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures |publisher=[[GOV.UK]] |accessdate=19 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115173536/https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures# |archive-date=2013-01-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In Canada entities can be incorporated under either federal or provincial (or territorial) law. [[Unlimited liability corporation]]s can be formed in Alberta "AULC" and Nova Scotia "NSULC".

The word or expression "Limited", ''Limitée'', "Incorporated", ''Incorporée'', "Corporation" or ''Société par actions de régime fédéral'' or the corresponding abbreviation "Ltd.", ''Ltée'', "Inc.", "Corp." or ''S.A.R.F.'' forms part of the name of every entity incorporated under the [[Canada Business Corporations Act]] (R.S., 1985, c. C-44). ≈ Ltd. or Plc (UK)

As an exception, entities registered prior to 1985 may continue to be designated ''Société commerciale canadienne'' or by the abbreviation ''S.C.C.''

Under the [[Canada Cooperatives Act]] (1998, c. 1), a co-operative must have the word "cooperative", "co-operative", "coop", "co-op", ''coopérative'', "united" or "pool", or another grammatical form of any of those words, as part of its name.

Unlike in many other Western countries, Canadian businesses generally only have one form of incorporation available. The aforementioned AULC and NSULC are generally not used as operating business structures, but are instead used to create favorable tax positions for either Americans investing in Canada or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2006/january-february/regulars/camagazine7794.aspx|title=NS vs. Alberta ULCs|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723021544/http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2006/january-february/regulars/camagazine7794.aspx#|archive-date=2014-07-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather, Canadian businesses are generally formed under one of the following structures:
*SP (Sole Proprietorship): No formal business structure is established
*GP (General Partnership): Either a formal structure with a partnership agreement, or an informal structure, in which case the Partnerships Act for the province will apply
*LP (Limited Partnership): An investment structure, limiting both the liability and the participation of the investor. An investor who takes an active role will be deemed a general partner, and become exposed to unlimited liability.
*Corporation
*Joint Venture: A business activity shared by two or more business entities. The joint venture's activities must be finite in terms of either time or scope.

There are three main forms of business:

(a) Sole Proprietorship
(b) Partnership
(c) Company

*Sole Proprietorship

In a sole proprietorship, an individual on his/her own account carries out the business or profession. No formal procedure or formality is required for setting up a sole proprietary concern.

*Partnership

A partnership is a business relationship entered into by a formal agreement between two or more persons or corporations carrying on a business in common. The capital for a partnership is provided by the partners who are liable for the total debts of the firms and who share the profits and losses of the business concern according to the terms of the partnership agreement.

Partnerships (other than banking companies) are generally limited in size to twenty partners. The interest of a partner is transferable only with the prior consent of the other partner(s). However, a partner's right to a share of the partnership income may be received in trust for another person.

For taxation purposes, partnerships are classified into:

(i) Registered Firms
(ii) Unregistered Firms

The income of the registered firm is subject to Super Tax before distribution to the partners. Also the individual income of the partners is subject to income tax at the usual rates.

For unregistered firms, income tax is levied on the firm's income and the partners are not liable to pay tax on the shares of profit received from the unregistered firm(s).

*Company

A company is a legal entity formed under the Companies Ordinance, 1984. It can have share capital or can be formed without share capital.

A company having share capital may be formed as:

(i) A company limited by shares.
(ii) A company limited by guarantee.
(iii) An unlimited company.

*Company Limited by Shares

The liability of its members is limited to the extent of their shares in the paid-up capital of the company. These companies may further be classified as public limited and private limited companies.

*Public Limited Companies can be formed by at least seven persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. The word 'Limited' is used as the last word of its name.
*Private Limited Companies may be formed by at least two persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. A private limited company, by its Articles of Association:

(i) Restricts the right to transfer its shares;
(ii) Limits the number of its members to fifty; and;
(iii) Prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures of the company.

A private limited company is required to use the words "(Private) Limited" as the last words of its name.

*Company Limited By Guarantee

Means a company having the liability of its members limited by memorandum to such amounts as the members may respectively undertake to contribute to the capital of the company in the event of its winding up. A company limited by guarantee is usually formed on a 'non profit basis'. Companies limited by guarantee use the words (Guarantee) Limited" as the last words of their n
Unlimited Company

Means a company having unlimited liability of its members

==United States==
In the United States, the individual states incorporate most businesses. Very few special types are incorporated by the federal government.

=== Tax classifications ===
For federal tax purposes, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] has separate [[entity classification]] rules. Under the tax rules, an entity may be classified as a [[corporation]], a [[partnership]], a [[Cooperative]] or a disregarded entity. A corporation may be taxed as either a [[C corporation]] or elect to be treated as a [[Subchapter S corporation]]. A disregarded entity has one owner (or a married couple as owner) that is not recognized for tax purposes as an entity separate from its owner. Types of disregarded entities include single-member [[Limited liability company|LLC]]s; qualified sub-chapter S subsidiaries and qualified [[real estate investment trust]] subsidiaries. A disregarded entity's transparent tax status does not affect its status under state law. For example, for federal tax purposes, a sole-member LLC (SMLLC) is disregarded, so that all its assets and liabilities are treated as owned by its single member. But under state law, an SMLLC can contract in its own name and its owner is generally not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the entity.&lt;ref name="Presti and Naegele Newsletter"&gt;[http://www.prestinaegele.com/faq-what-is-a-disregarded-entity Presti and Naegele Newsletter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115173503/http://www.prestinaegele.com/faq-what-is-a-disregarded-entity# |date=2013-01-15 }}, 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; To be recognized as a [[Cooperative]] for tax purposes Cooperatives must follow certain rules under Sub Chapter T of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref name="IRS Sub Chapter T"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-044-001.html#d0e184|title=IRS Sub Chapter T|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904163915/http://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-044-001.html#d0e184#d0e184|archive-date=2014-09-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federally incorporated===
The key word for a bank is "national". A bank chartered by the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC) must have the word "national" in its name. A bank chartered by a state cannot have "national" in its name.

For a savings bank (formerly called a savings and loan association) or credit union, the key word is "federal", and the same rules apply; a federally chartered savings bank or credit union must have the word "federal" in its name, while a state chartered savings bank or credit union cannot have "federal" in its name.

*FSB ([[Federal savings bank|Federal Savings Bank]]), formerly called federal savings and loan association
*NA ([[National bank#United States|National Association]]), a designation used by banks chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
*NT&amp;SA ([[National Trust and Savings Association]]), a less common designation used by national banks
*[[Credit union#United States|Federal Credit Union]], chartered by the National Credit Union Association (NCUA)

Many federal governmental units are specially formed [[Government-owned corporation|public corporation]]s, while some private organizations have received a [[Congressional charter|charter from Congress]].

===State, territory or commonwealth incorporated===
{{See also|United States corporate law}}

The following are the main business designations and types:
*'''[[Sole proprietorship]]''': a business consisting of a single owner (which may in turn be a business entity), not in a separately recognized business form.
*'''[[Trust (business)|Trust]]'''

====Partnerships====
*'''[[General partnership]]''': a partnership in which all the partners are jointly and separately liable for the debts of the partnership. In most U.S. states, it can be created by agreement without requiring a public filing. The partners may themselves be legal entities or individuals.
*[[Limited partnership|LP]], '''Limited partnership''': a partnership where at least one partner (the general partner, which may itself be an entity or an individual) has unlimited liability for the LP's debts and one or more partners (the limited partners) have limited liability (which means that they are not responsible for the LP's debts beyond the amount they agreed to invest). Limited partners generally do not participate in the management of the entity or its business. 
*[[Limited liability partnership|LLP]], '''Limited Liability Partnership''': a partnership where a partner's liability for the debts of the partnership is limited except in the case of liability for acts of professional negligence or malpractice. In some states, LLPs may only be formed for purposes of practicing a licensed profession, typically attorneys, accountants and architects. This is often the only form of limited partnership allowed for law firms (as opposed to general partnerships).
*[[Limited liability limited partnership|LLLP]], '''Limited Liability Limited Partnership''': a combination of LP and LLP, available in some states.

====Limited Liability Companies====
*[[Limited liability company|LLC]], LC, Ltd. Co., '''Limited Liability Company''': a form of business whose owners enjoy limited liability, but which is not a [[corporation]]. Allowable abbreviations vary by state. Note that in some states ''Ltd.'' by itself is not a valid abbreviation for an LLC, because in some states (e.g. [[Texas]]), it may denote a corporation instead. See also [[Series LLC]]. For U.S. federal tax purposes, in general, an LLC with two or more members is treated as a partnership, and an LLC with one member is treated as a sole proprietorship.
*[[Limited liability company#Variations|PLLC]], '''Professional Limited Liability Company''': some states do not allow certain professionals to form an LLC that would limit the liability that results from the services professionals provide such as doctors, medical care; lawyers, legal advice; and accountants, accounting services; architects, architectural services; when the company formed offers the services of the professionals. Instead those states allow a PLLC or in the LLC statutes, the liability limitation only applies to the business side, such as creditors of the company, as opposed to the client/customer service side, the level of medical care, legal services, or accounting provided to clients. This is meant to maintain the higher ethical standards that these professionals have committed themselves to by becoming licensed in their profession and to prevent them from being immune (or at least limit their immunity) to malpractice suits.

====Corporations====
*[[Corporation|Corp.]], [[Incorporation (business)|Inc.]], '''Corporation, Incorporated''': used to denote [[corporation]]s ([[public company|public]] or otherwise). These are the only terms universally accepted by all 51 corporation chartering jurisdictions in the United States. However, in some states other suffixes may be used to identify a corporation, such as Ltd., Co./Company, or the Italian term S.p.A. (in [[Connecticut]]; see under [[#Italy|Italy]]). Some states that allow the use of "Company" prohibit the use of "and Company", "and Co.", "&amp; Company" or "&amp; Co.". In most states [[sole proprietorship]]s and partnerships may register a fictitious "[[doing business as]]" name with the word "Company" in it. For a full list of allowed designations by state, see the table below. 
*'''[[Professional corporation]]''', PC or P.C.: those corporate entities for which many corporation statutes make special provision, regulating the use of the corporate form by licensed professionals such as attorneys, architects, accountants, and doctors.
*'''[[Doing Business As]]''': denotes a business name used by a person or entity that is different from the person's or entity's true name. DBAs are not separate entities and do not shield the person or entity who uses the DBA as a business name from liability for debts or lawsuits. Filing requirements vary and are not permitted for some types of businesses or professional practices.  See also [[Delaware corporation]], [[Delaware statutory trust]], [[Nevada corporation]], and [[Massachusetts business trust]].
