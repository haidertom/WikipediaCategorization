'''100.000 of niets'''  (''100,000 or nothing'') was a [[Flanders|Flemish]] TV quiz, broadcast on the Flemish [[public service]] TV station N.I.R. (nowadays the [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]]), between 1956 and 1959 on Sunday evenings. It was one of the most popular TV shows from the Flemish pioneer years.

==Concept==

"100.000 of niets" was originally part of another quiz, "Knal, wie vangt de bal?" ("Bang, who catches the ball?").&lt;ref name=manu&gt;ADRIAENS, Manu, Blijven kijken! 50 jaar televisie in Vlaanderen, Uitgeverij Lannoo, Tielt, 2003, blz. 147-148.&lt;/ref&gt; It aired on December 11, 1956 and by January 12, 1958 it became an independent weekly show. The show was hosted by Tony Corsari, Bob Van Bael and Pros Verbruggen and the jury was hosted by Mr. Van Hove, professor Lucien De Smet and Dr. A.J. Aernouts. In 1959 the show was cancelled. In 1968 it returned to the screen, presented by Pros Verbruggen, Jan Theys and Rudy Samson. Regine Clauwaert was the female guest host.&lt;ref name=manu/&gt;

Each show had three candidates and four thematical rounds. One candidate remained in the finale and had to answer one very detailed question correctly. The prize was 100.000 Belgian francs, though most of the time the winner just received a kitchen device.&lt;ref name=manu/&gt;

==Controversy==

While the show was popular quite some candidates criticized the correct answers needed. On March 9, 1958, one candidate named Van Cuyck lost after giving only one wrong answer in a series of seven correct ones. According to present-day norms many questions were phrased in an ambiguous manner and since every round the acceptance of dubious answers tended to differ at times.&lt;ref name=manu/&gt; One time a candidate complained that his answer was indeed correct, despite being told it wasn't. Host Tony Corsari personally made sure that the man received his award after all.&lt;ref name=manu/&gt;

Female host [[Liliane Taelemans]] received a lot of criticism because her clothes were considered to be "too revealing". She was eventually fired and in 1958 she went on to become the Belgian candidate for the [[Miss Universe]] election.&lt;ref name=manu/&gt;

==In popular culture==
* In ''[[The Adventures of Nero]]'' album "De Witte Parel" ("The White Pearl") (1962) [[Nero (comic book character)|Nero]] is a contestant on "100.000 of Niets". The host is a caricature of Tony Corsari.&lt;ref&gt;AUWERA, Fernand and DE SMET, Jan, "Marc Sleen", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''''Boogiepop'' series'''|ブギーポップシリーズ|Bugīpoppu shirīzu}} of Japanese [[light novels]] is written by [[Kouhei Kadono]] and illustrated by [[Kouji Ogata]]. It includes titles from different media, each connected by repeating characters and related plots. Presented in [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]], each chapter presents the reader with only snapshots of what is happening, leaving them to find clues to understand the greater plot.&lt;ref name="ultimate1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomanga.com/news/boogiepop_01.php|last=Smith|first=Lesley|title=Boogiepop: The Ultimate Guide (Part 1 of 4)|date=2006-01-30|accessdate=2006-06-20|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Boogiepop'' is best characterized as [[young adult literature|young adult]] [[fiction]] and is credited with starting the light novel trend in Japan.&lt;ref name="sselicense"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomanga.com/news/press_015.php|title=Seven Seas Enters the World of Boogiepop|date=2005-10-31|accessdate=2006-06-20|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2000, two million copies of Kadono's Boogiepop light novels works were in print.&lt;ref name="bnlvol1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kadono|first=Kouhei|authorlink=Kouhei Kadono|date=2006-04-24|title=Boogiepop Doesn't Laugh|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]|isbn=978-1-933164-18-2|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boogiepop Phantom|anime]] and [[Boogiepop and Others#Film adaptation|live action film]] inspired by the original light novels have been released in English by [[The Right Stuf International]], while [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] released four of the light novels and the [[manga]].

== Overview ==
{{See also|List of Boogiepop media}}

To face the "enemies of the world", the ''[[shinigami]]'' Boogiepop automatically rises to the surface. In Boogiepop's world, the Towa Organization, a shadowy group seeking to control humanity, managed to capture an alien organism who had taken the form of a [[evolution|highly evolved]] human. By studying him, the Towa Organization was able to create synthetic humans, people who have been artificially enhanced with special abilities. The mission of the Towa Organization and its agents is to find and kill MPLS, people who are more evolved than others and possess special abilities. However, Boogiepop will not let the Towa Organization get its way and he is not alone in his efforts.

The Boogiepop series is very much about the characters: their relationships, their pasts, their memories. This is especially true for how their pasts molded them into the people they are today. It can also be seen through scenes being presented from the perspective of different characters, and how the individual casts a different "feel" by how they relate to events.&lt;ref name="bpdvd1com"&gt;DVD commentary featuring Jeff Thompson and Joe DiGiorgi (August 2001) ''Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 1''&lt;/ref&gt; Another important theme is change. How the world changes and our different perceptions of this change, especially how one's perception of things changes as they grow up.&lt;ref name="bpdvd2com"&gt;DVD commentary featuring Jeff Thompson, [[Crispin Freeman]], and Rachel Lillie (2001) ''Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 2''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Boogiepop Phantom]]'' is also highly [[metaphorical]], with a character or an image representing much more than face value.&lt;ref name="bpdvd4com"&gt;DVD commentary featuring Jeff Thompson and Angora Deb (2002) ''Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 4''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also "a show about the inter-related nature of people's lives and the concept that they know of as time."&lt;ref name=afbp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/02.01/feature/1/|title=Boogiepop Phantom - A Myriad of Moments Past and Present|last=Arnold|first=Adam|accessdate=2006-08-07|date=January 2002|publisher=Animefringe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kadono has published fourteen light novels and has serialized [[short stories]] in ''Dengegi HP'',&lt;ref name="mcshorts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mostlycloudy.net/~ballzapalooza/boogiepop/ss.htm.ja.euc |last=Collette |first=Chris |title=Boogiepop Short Stories |accessdate=2006-06-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504013426/http://mostlycloudy.net/~ballzapalooza/boogiepop/ss.htm.ja.euc |archivedate=2006-05-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which have been published as a four-volume series about Pete Beat, a member of the Towa Organization. Two manga serials have been drawn for this series, which were serialized in ''[[Dengeki Daioh]]''&lt;ref name="ultimate3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomanga.com/news/boogiepop_03.php|last=Smith|first=Lesley|title=Boogiepop: The Ultimate Guide (Part 3 of 4)|date=2006-01-30|accessdate=2006-06-20|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Dengeki Animation''.&lt;ref name="ultimate1" /&gt; In 2000, the [[anime]] series ''Boogiepop Phantom'' aired on Japanese television; a drama CD, featuring [[Kaori Shimizu (voice actress)|Kaori Shimizu]], was released to promote this series.&lt;ref name="ultimate3" /&gt; Later that year, the movie ''[[Boogiepop and Others]]'' was released.&lt;ref name="ultimate1" /&gt;

== Characters ==
{{Main|List of Boogiepop characters}}
Each Boogiepop title has its own cast of characters, and many of these characters will make appearances in more than one title, but there are only four central characters that are consistently at the center of the plot.

; {{nihongo|[[Boogiepop (character)|Boogiepop]]|ブギーポップ|Bugīpoppu}}

The [[shinigami]] whispered of among the female students of Shinyo Academy, few people know that Boogiepop actually exists. Normally dormant, Boogiepop rises to the surface when enemies of the world appear. Boogiepop's appearance and voice are ambiguous: they seem both masculine and feminine at the same time. However, hidden beneath his signature black cloak and black, pipe-shaped hat, little is ever seen of him. Straight-faced and to the point, Boogiepop acts as mechanical as he claims to be. Boogiepop speaks in an archaic manner, and seems fond of whistling the overture to [[Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''.

; {{nihongo|[[Miyashita Touka|Touka Miyashita]]|宮下藤花|Miyashita Tōka}}

An ordinary, happy school girl at Shinyo Academy, Miyashita is in love with her boyfriend, Keiji Takeda, and close friends with Suema. Not particularly good at school, she does not stand out in any way. Unknown to most, she was hospitalized as a child, and this saw her life change, though even Miyashita herself does not seem to know the truth of what happened, and was simply told that she had been possessed by a [[kitsune]]. Unknowingly, when the world is in trouble, she carries a Spalding sports bag containing the effects of Boogiepop, her [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. She has no recollection of her time as Boogiepop, and alters her memories to explain the blanks.

; {{nihongo|[[Kirima Nagi|Nagi Kirima]]|霧間凪|Kirima Nagi}}

Known as the Fire Witch to many, Kirima has made few friends due the way she distances herself from others: she knows that she is too dangerous for 'normal' people to associate with. She has a [[messianic complex]], and seeks to save the world from whatever may threaten it. As such, whenever there are unusual happenings within the city, Kirima can be found investigating what has happened. In the past, she had spent a period of time in hospital. A combination of the events from that period of her life, as well as the death of her father, the famous writer Kirima Seiichi, brought her to follow this path in life. Extremely gifted both physically and intellectually, she has the basic tools she needs to carry out her self-appointed mission.

; {{nihongo|[[Suema Kazuko|Kazuko Suema]]|末間和子|Suema Kazuko}}

As a result of a childhood trauma, Suema has developed an unusual fascination with [[criminal psychology|criminal]] and [[abnormal psychology]], as well as the desire to not let anything occur around her without her knowing. As a result of this, she desperately seeks the truth about the unexplained events happening in her city, and meddles with forces best left untouched. Good friends with Miyashita Touka, Suema appreciates how she so open and unconditionally accepting of her, and looks out for her friend. She seeks to be closer with Kirima Nagi, who seems to know the answers to the questions that have haunted her all these years. Despite her involvement in several incidents, she has yet to see Boogiepop in action.

== Internationalisation ==
The Right Stuf International licensed ''Boogiepop Phantom'' for English release in 2001.&lt;ref name="annbplicence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=19|title=Anime Dates and Delays|date=2001-01-06|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] the series and have distributed it in the US in both [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] formats.

In 2004, The Right Stuf International acquired the film ''Boogiepop and Others''.&lt;ref name="annbolicense"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=5278|title=New Right Stuf Acquisitions|date=2004-07-31|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been released on DVD in Japanese with English [[subtitles]], and is distributed in both the US and Europe, along with a director's [[Audio commentary (DVD)|commentary]] and behind the scenes interviews with the cast.

In 2005, Seven Seas Entertainment announced they had acquired the rights to publish the Boogiepop novels and manga in English.&lt;ref name="sselicense" /&gt; Before 2018, they released the first three novels and the sixth, as well as the ''Boogiepop Doesn't Laugh'' and "Boogiepop Dual" manga. Seven Seas Entertainment has announced that they will re-release the novels in an omnibus format.

== Reception ==

=== Impact and influence ===

''Boogiepop and Others'' won the Fourth [[Dengeki Novel Prize]] in 1997 and was released in the Dengeki Book Collection in 1998 where it gained popularity.&lt;ref name="baohob"&gt;History of Boogiepop (1 March 2005) ''Boogiepop and Others''&lt;/ref&gt; It is credited with popularizing light novels,&lt;ref name="sselicense" /&gt; as well as redefining young adult fiction in Japan.&lt;ref name="annbr1rev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=1017|last=Martin|first=Theron|title=Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator, Part 1|date=2006-07-27|accessdate=2006-07-28|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adapted into a live action film by Ryu Kaneda, a two-volume manga by Kouji Ogata and served as the inspiration for a [[soundtrack]] composed by [[Yuki Kajiura]].&lt;ref name="ultimate1" /&gt; ''Boogiepop and Others'' also sets the scene for the anime, ''Boogiepop Phantom'', which has its backstory loosely based on the climax of the light novel. Having already gained a strong readership among High School and University age men, the release of ''[[Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1]]'' was met with overwhelming support. By the time the ''Boogiepop and Others'' film was released, the Boogiepop series was a bestseller, with over two million copies in print.&lt;ref name="baohob" /&gt;

=== Reviews ===
The Boogiepop series has received high praise from critics. ''Boogiepop Phantom'' has received the most exposure, where it is often compared to ''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]'' and ''[[Paranoia Agent]]''.&lt;ref name="ultimate2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomanga.com/news/boogiepop_02.php|last=Smith|first=Lesley|title=Boogiepop: The Ultimate Guide (Part 2 of 4)|date=2006-01-30|accessdate=2006-06-20|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that the series is "not your average anime", and one that "demands your attention".&lt;ref name="ntusabprev"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lopez|first=Javier|date=January 2003|title=[[Newtype USA]]|publisher=[[A.D. Vision]]|pages=??}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the fine detail the animators went into with the visuals has received much praise, bland character designs have been noted as one of the series' flaws, though "astute viewers may notice some rather interesting [...] differences between the various characters."&lt;ref name="annev1rev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=170|last=Macdonald|first=Christopher|title=Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 1 DVD|date=2001-11-15|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack has received much acclaim, not only for the [[background music]] and [[voice actor]] performances, but also the detail that went into the [[sound effects]].&lt;ref name="aodvdbprev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/123.php|last=Beveridge|first=Chris|title=Boogiepop Phantom|date=2001-10-30|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=Anime on DVD|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050411155900/http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/123.php|archivedate=2005-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation of the storyline was well received, but it was acknowledged that not everyone would be interested in following the subtle clues in each episode&lt;ref name="thembprev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=68|last=Cynova|first=Isaac|title=Boogiepop Phantom|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "artistically deliberate sense of confusion".&lt;ref name="sfbprev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue253/anime.html |last=Robinson |first=Tasha |title=Boogiepop Phantom |accessdate=2006-06-23 |publisher=SciFi.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509093331/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue253/anime.html |archivedate=2006-05-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common complaint, however, is that there are many loose ends, mainly relating to the backstory,&lt;ref name="sfbprev"/&gt; leaving the series "with more questions than answers".&lt;ref name="ntusabprev" /&gt;

Far less critiqued, the ''Boogiepop and Others'' film fares less well than its sequel. Whilst the characters and plot were well received, the [[special effects]] and costumes have been described as "campy", but "par for the course of something of this level and budget".&lt;ref name="aodvdborev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/3885.php |last=Beveridge |first=Chris |title=Boogiepop and Others |date=2 July 2005 |accessdate=2006-06-23 |publisher=Anime on DVD |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101173507/http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/3885.php |archivedate=2006-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie is, however, cited as being easier to watch, and is recommended to fans of the anime, so as to gain "a complete understanding of the Boogiepop events".&lt;ref name="mementoborev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designchronicle.com/memento/archives/boogiepop_and_others.html|title=Boogiepop and Others|date=11 February 2004|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=Memento}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Boogiepop and Others'' novel has received more favorable reviews, though these have mostly focused on the translation, which has been cited as "a standard against which future Japanese novel translations are judged".&lt;ref name="annbonrev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=959|last=Martin|first=Theron|title=Boogiepop and Others|date=13 March 2006|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also received praise for ripping "the rules of narrative wide open",&lt;ref name="rtobonrev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/columns/rightturnonly.php?id=25|last=Santos|first=Carlo|title=RIGHT TURN ONLY!!|date=21 March 2006|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially for how it allows the characters to grow on the reader.&lt;ref name="aodvdbonrev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/manga/manga.php?manga_view=2051|last=Pine|first=Jarred|title=Boogiepop|date=17 March 2006|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=Anime on DVD|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325061759/http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/manga/manga.php?manga_view=2051|archivedate=25 March 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1'' continues receiving positive feedback for its easy-to-read style and excellent translation, as well as its use of atmosphere and characters. The main flaw, however, is the briefness of the title, which has clearly been used to set up the sequel.&lt;ref name="annbr1rev" /&gt;

''Boogiepop Doesn't Laugh'' has received generally favorable reviews, particularly for capturing some of the more complicated scenes better than the original light novel. This makes the plot easier to follow, and captures the urgency of the climactic battle.&lt;ref name="rtobdl2rev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/columns/rightturnonly.php?id=34|last=Santos|first=Carlo|title=RIGHT TURN ONLY!!|date=25 July 2006|accessdate=2006-07-26|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been noted that breaking the complicated plot of ''Boogiepop and Others'' into a multi-volume manga results in individually weak volumes.&lt;ref name="rtobdl1rev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/columns/rightturnonly.php?id=28|last=Santos|first=Carlo|title=RIGHT TURN ONLY!!|date=2 May 2006|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with ''Boogiepop Phantom'', the character designs have been noted as "lookalike and nondescript", which can make some of the events difficult to follow. The art has also been described as "washed out and dull".&lt;ref name="rtobdl2rev" /&gt;

'''''Ghostbusters''''' is a [[supernatural fiction|supernatural]] comedy [[media franchise|franchise]] created in 1984. Its first installment was the film ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', released on June 8, 1984, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It centers on a group of eccentric New York City [[parapsychologist]]s who investigate and capture ghosts for a living. For the film, the franchise licensed [[action figures]], [[novelization]]s, and other original ''Ghostbusters''-themed products. After the initial success, they released original material in other fields such as [[comic book]]s, video games, television series, and several  [[theme park]] attractions.

==Development==
The concept of the first film was inspired by [[Dan Aykroyd]]'s own fascination with the paranormal, and it was conceived by Aykroyd as a vehicle for himself and friend and fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' alum [[John Belushi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aykroyd |first1=Dan |last2=Ramis |first2=Harold |last3=Shay |first3=Don |title=Making Ghostbusters: The Screenplay |date=1985 |publisher=New York Zoetrope |location=New York |isbn=0918432685}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2017}} Aykroyd came up with ''Ghostbusters'' after reading an article about quantum physics and [[parapsychology]] in the ''American Society of Psychical Research Journal'' and then watching movies like ''[[Ghost Chasers]]''. Aykroyd thought, "Let's redo one of those old ghost comedies, but let's use the research that's being done today. Even at that time, there was plausible research that could point to a device that could capture ectoplasm or materialization; at least visually."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Will Fresch |date=January 1, 2002 |title=A Well-Traveled Gentleman |url=http://www.crazewire.com/features/20030716296.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609234203/http://www.crazewire.com/features/20030716296.php |archivedate=June 9, 2007 |work=Crazewire |accessdate=August 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original story as written by Aykroyd was much more ambitious, and unfocused, than what would be eventually filmed; in Aykroyd's original vision, a group of Ghostbusters would travel through time, space and other dimensions taking on huge ghosts (of which the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man was just one of many). Also, the Ghostbusters wore [[SWAT]]-like outfits and used Proton Packs to fight the ghosts; ''Ghostbusters'' [[storyboard]]s show them wearing [[riot squad]]–type helmets with movable transparent [[visor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A ''Ghostbusters 1 and 2'' DVD pack included a 28-page booklet of copies of ''Ghostbusters'' [[storyboard]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; The original draft of the script written by Aykroyd was very large, compared to a "phone book" by director [[Ivan Reitman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |date=September 29, 2003 |title=Featured Filmmaker: Dan Aykroyd |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/452/452080p1.html |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=August 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aykroyd pitched his story to director and producer Reitman, who liked the basic idea but immediately saw the budgetary impossibilities demanded by Aykroyd's first draft. At Reitman's suggestion, the story was given a major overhaul, eventually evolving into the final screenplay which Aykroyd and [[Harold Ramis]] finalised during a few months in a [[Martha's Vineyard]] [[bomb shelter]], according to Ramis on the DVD commentary track for the movie.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Aykroyd and Ramis initially wrote the script with roles written especially for Belushi, [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[John Candy]]. However, Belushi died due to a drug overdose during the writing of the screenplay, and neither Murphy nor Candy could commit to the movie due to prior engagements, so Aykroyd and Ramis shifted some of these changes around and polished a basic, yet sci-fi oriented screenplay for their final draft.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In addition to Aykroyd's [[high-concept]] basic premise and Ramis' skill at grounding the fantasy elements with a realistic setting, the film benefits from [[Bill Murray]]'s semi-improvisational performance as [[Peter Venkman]], the character initially intended for Belushi. The extent of Murray's improvisation while delivering his lines is debated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

With the first DVD release of the film on the 15th anniversary of the original theatrical release, many original concepts of the film were revealed, based on the storyboard artwork: Louis Tully was originally to be a conservative man in a business suit played by comedian Candy, but he was unable to commit to the role. The role was taken by [[Rick Moranis]], portraying Louis as a [[geek]]. Gozer was originally going to appear in the form of Ivo Shandor as a slender, unremarkable man in a suit played by [[Paul Reubens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://protoncharging.com/gb/1998/08/27/interview-slavitza-jovan/ |title=Proton Charging interview with Gozer actress, Slavitza Jovan |accessdate=April 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source is a fansite.|date=December 2017}} In the end, the role was played by Yugoslavian model [[Slavitza Jovan]], whose Eastern European accented voice was later dubbed over by [[Paddi Edwards]]'s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Winston Zeddemore]] was written with Eddie Murphy in mind, but he had to decline the role as he was filming ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' at the same time. When Murphy had the role, Zeddemore was going to be hired much earlier in the film, and would accompany the trio on their hunt for Slimer at the hotel and be "slimed" in place of Venkman. When [[Ernie Hudson]] took over, it was decided that he be brought in later to indicate how the Ghostbusters were struggling to keep up with the outbreak of ghosts.

In order to properly light the set for Gozer's temple and create the physical effects for the set, other stages needed to be shut down and all their power diverted to the set. The hallway sets for the Sedgewick Hotel were originally built for the movie ''[[Rich and Famous (1981 film)|Rich and Famous]]'' in 1981 and patterned after the [[Algonquin Hotel]] in New York City, where Reitman originally wanted to do the hotel bust. [[New York Biltmore Hotel|The Biltmore Hotel]] was chosen because the large lobby allowed for a [[tracking shot]] of the Ghostbusters in complete gear for the first time. Dana Barrett and Louis Tully's apartments were constructed across two stages and were actually on the other side of their doors in the hallway, an unusual move in film-making.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

A problem arose during filming when it was discovered that a show was produced in 1975 by [[Filmation]] for [[CBS]] called ''[[The Ghost Busters]]''. Columbia Pictures prepared a list of alternative names in the event the rights could not be secured, but during the filming of the crowd for the final battle, the extras were all chanting "Ghostbusters", which inspired the producers to insist that the studio buy the rights to the name.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} For the test screening of ''Ghostbusters'', half of the ghost effects were missing, not yet having been completed by the production team. The audience response was still enthusiastic, and the ghost elements were completed for the official theatrical release shortly thereafter.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===''Ghostbusters'' (1984)===
{{Main|Ghostbusters}}
''[[Ghostbusters (1984 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', the first film in the series, is a 1984 [[science fiction|sci-fi]] [[comedy film]] about three eccentric New York City parapsychologists. After they are fired from [[Columbia University]], they start their own business investigating and capturing ghosts. Starring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Annie Potts]], and Ernie Hudson, it was released in the United States on June 8, 1984. The film grossed approximately 240 million US$ in the United States and over $50 million abroad during its theatrical run, more than the domestic gross of the second ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|Indiana Jones]]'' installment, making it the most successful film in America that year (after re-releases), and one of the most successful comedies of the 1980s. The [[American Film Institute]] ranked it 28th in its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|top 100 comedies of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/laughs.aspx |title=AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs |accessdate=December 11, 2006 |publisher=American Film Institute |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208043102/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/laughs.aspx |archivedate=December 8, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] voted ''Ghostbusters'' the greatest comedy ever in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/674/674712p5.html |title=Top 25 Comedies of All-Time |accessdate=December 11, 2006 |publisher=IGN |last=Carle |first=Chris |date=December 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TV Channel [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] ranked ''Ghostbusters'' number 28 on their ''100 Funniest Movies'' list in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boards.boston.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?nav=messages&amp;tsn=1&amp;tid=231&amp;webtag=bc-movies |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018005734/http://boards.boston.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?nav=messages&amp;tsn=1&amp;tid=231&amp;webtag=bc-movies |archivedate=October 18, 2007 |title=Bravo's 100 Funniest Films |accessdate=December 11, 2006 |publisher=The Boston Globe |last=Cammorata |first=Nicole |author2=Duffy, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ghostbusters II'' (1989)===
{{Main|Ghostbusters II}}
The second film, ''Ghostbusters II'', was released in 1989. After the success of the first film and the animated series ''The Real Ghostbusters'', Columbia Pictures pressed the producers to make a sequel. Aykroyd, Ramis, and Reitman were uncomfortable with this at first, as the original film was intended to be conclusive and they wished to work on other projects. Eventually, they agreed and created a script.

In August 2014, it was reported that [[Paul Feig]] was in talks to direct a third film in the franchise, featuring women in all the lead roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/02/paul-feig-ghostbusters_n_5644486.html |title=Paul Feig Reportedly In Talks To Direct Female-Centered 'Ghostbusters' Reboot |last=Whitney |first=Erin |work=The Huffington Post |date=August 2, 2014 |accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main cast members were announced as [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]] and [[Kate McKinnon]] in January 2015 and [[Chris Hemsworth]] was cast as a male receptionist in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/chris-hemsworth-joins-ghostbusters-reboot-801718 |title=Chris Hemsworth Joins 'Ghostbusters' Reboot as Receptionist |work=The Hollywood Reporter |last=Kit |first=Borys |date=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was scheduled to start shooting in mid-2015 in New York City, with a projected release date of July 22, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-31016868 |title=Ghostbusters female line-up confirmed |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming was moved to the [[Boston]] area for budgetary reasons and commenced in [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], Massachusetts on June 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Antonio|first1=Jonathan|title='Ghostbusters' Remake is Now Filming!|url=http://www.projectcasting.com/news/ghostbusters-remake-is-now-filming/|website=Project Casting|accessdate=August 2, 2016|date=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Aykroyd]] revealed in the [[Unmasked (radio show)|Unmasked with Ron Bennington]] radio show his potential return in the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barton|first1=Steve|title=Dan Aykroyd Insists His Ghostbusters 3 Is Coming|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/90390/dan-aykroyd-insists-ghostbusters-3-coming/|website=Dread Central|accessdate=August 2, 2016|date=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 5, 2015, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] set the film for a release on July 15, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= |first1= |title=Sony Pictures Dates 16 Films Through 2019! |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/468725-sony-pictures-dates-16-films |accessdate=August 5, 2015 |publisher=comingsoon.net |date=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aykroyd along with original cast members [[Bill Murray]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Ernie Hudson]] and [[Annie Potts]] all have small cameo roles in the reboot, but don't play any of their original characters from the first two films. Although initially marketed simply as "''Ghostbusters''", the film was seemingly renamed ''Ghostbusters: Answer the Call'' shortly before the film's release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ben Bussey |url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/ghostbusters-reboot-officially-retitled-for-us-165041049.html |title=Ghostbusters Reboot Officially Retitled For US Home Entertainment Release |publisher=Uk.movies.yahoo.com |date=2016-08-31 |accessdate=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later Paul Feig stated that the film was always subtitled ''Answer the Call''.&lt;ref name="Lussier"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/nope-ghostbusters-has-not-suddenly-gotten-a-new-title-1786062339/ |title=Nope, Ghostbusters Did Not Suddenly Get a New Title |first=Germain |last=Lussier |publisher=Io9 |date=September 1, 2016 |accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the first ''Ghostbusters'' film, [[Ivan Reitman]], corroborated the decision to give the film a subtitle.&lt;ref name="Lussier"/&gt;

On July 18, 2016, [[Sony Pictures]] announced that they had plans to make a sequel for the 2016 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |title=Sony has plans for a Ghostbusters sequel |first=Julia |last=Alexander |date=July 18, 2016 |url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/7/18/12211904/ghostbusters-sequel-sony}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Feig confirmed that a sequel will not be made due to the film losing money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universityherald.com/articles/51482/20161124/ghostbusters.htm |title=Sequel to Ghostbusters Reboot Not Happening According To Director |date=November 24, 2016 |accessdate=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, producer Reitman said, "There’s going to be many other ''Ghostbusters'' movies, they’re just in development right now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/future-ghostbusters-movies/ |title=Ivan Reitman Says There Are "Many" More ‘Ghostbusters’ Movies in Development |last=Anderton |first=Ethan |publisher=[[/Film]] |date=November 28, 2016 |accessdate=November 28, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6mMXD54ta?url=http://www.slashfilm.com/future-ghostbusters-movies/ |archivedate=November 28, 2016 |deadurl=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canceled projects===
====''Ghostbusters III''====
During the 1990s, Aykroyd wrote a script for a potential third film in the series, titled ''Ghostbusters III: Hellbent''.&lt;ref name="Collider"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collider.com/2009/12/29/could-ghostbusters-3-start-filming-this-summer/ |title=Could ''Ghostbusters 3'' Start Filming This Summer? |first=Jeffrey |last=Van Camp |date=December 29, 2009 |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |accessdate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept had the characters transported to an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate version]] of Manhattan called Manhellton, where the people and places are "[[hell]]ish" versions of their originals and where the Ghostbusters meet the devil (a modified version of this script was later used in ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'').&lt;ref name="Hollywood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN Script" /&gt; At the time, Aykroyd stated that the studio was interested, though the principal actors were not. It featured a new, younger group of Ghostbusters, while Ray, Egon, and Winston (who is referred to as Dr. Zeddemore) struggle to keep the business going after Peter leaves to be with Dana. In reviewing the proposed script, IGN stated that the new Ghostbusters were "practically interchangeable," lacked personality conflicts, and were not "especially funny or charming." It also found the script to be too full of technobabble, and Venkman's appearance at the end is noted to be the "best gag" in the script.&lt;ref name="IGN Script"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/366/366119p1.html |title=IGN FilmForce Exclusive: The Stax Report: Script Review of Ghostbusters 3: Hellbent! |publisher=IGN |date=July 30, 2002 |accessdate=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 29, 2012, Aykroyd said he was unsure if a third film would ever be made, and considered the film to be in "suspended animation." Aykroyd said if the film were made, Murray was confirmed not to return; they would need his permission if they wanted to re-cast his role or have him appear as a CGI ghost, which Aykroyd doubted they would get. He said Murray is busy with his six kids, owns many houses and is happy just appearing at golf tournaments where people pay him to turn up to provide a laugh. Aykroyd said the two remain close personal friends and Murray is a friend first, colleague second and that he can't be mad at him for refusing to make a third movie.

"We’re going to have to cast. We need four new ghostbusters. We need four new Columbia students. It’s based upon new research that’s being done in particle physics by the young men and women at [[Columbia University]]. Basically there’s research being done that...I can say that the world or our dimension that we live in, our four planes of existence, length, height, width, and time, become threatened by some of the research that is being done. And Ghostbusters, new Ghostbusters have to come and solve the problem.” Aykroyd said. When asked about Murray's status with the film, Aykroyd responded "He’s a good friend, I love him, but he just doesn’t want to reprise the role. However, there will be a hole for him. If Billy wants to walk in the door and be in the movie, we will find a place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pantozzi|first1=Jill|title=Dan Aykroyd May Have Just Given Us Concrete Ghostbusters 3 Plot Information|url=http://www.themarysue.com/dan-ackroyd-ghostbusters3/|website=The Mary Sue|accessdate=July 26, 2013|language=en|date=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Rick Moranis gave a rare interview where he talked about appearing in the third film and his disappointment with the sequel. Moranis said “I haven’t talked to Dan Aykroyd about it.

=====Decision to reboot series=====
In a 2016 interview between Richard Edwards and ''Ghostbusters'' (2016) director [[Paul Feig]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete SFX Guide to Ghostbusters''&lt;/ref&gt; Feig revealed that [[Ivan Reitman]] initially approached Feig about making a direct sequel to ''Ghostbusters II'', which was "''a movie that would have seen the original 'busters handing the keys of Ecto-1 over to a new team''", which Feig disliked.&lt;ref&gt;"''I read the script and thought it was really fun, but New York and the world had been through this ghost attack problem twice in the past and it'd been solved. So now if a new team was going to come together and be given all their weaponry from the old team... it kind of sounded better on paper than it did in reality.

===''The Real Ghostbusters''===
{{Main|The Real Ghostbusters}}
From 1986 to 1991, [[Columbia Pictures Television]] and [[DIC Entertainment]] produced an animated spin-off television series created by Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd that is non-canon to the original film, entitled ''The Real Ghostbusters''. "The Real" was added to the title due to a dispute with Filmation and [[Ghostbusters (1986 TV series)|its ''Ghostbusters'' properties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=5561 |author=Lou Scheimer |title=A Candid Conversation with Filmation's Founder, by R.J. Carter |publisher=The-Trades.com |accessdate=June 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423051330/http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=5561 |archivedate=April 23, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series continues the adventures of paranormal investigators Venkman, Stantz, Spengler, Zeddemore, their secretary Melnitz, and their mascot ghost Slimer. ''The Real Ghostbusters'' was nominated for an [[Emmy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |date=July 24, 2002 |title=Featured Filmmaker: Ivan Reitman |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/365/365755p1.html |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=August 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the show's producers began to see the youth appeal of the character Slimer, he began to be featured more prominently. In 1988, the series was retooled and renamed ''Slimer! and the Real Ghostbusters'', and featured an hourlong format with a typical ''Real Ghostbusters'' episode leading into a more kid-friendly ''Slimer!'' cartoon. As the series progressed, the regular ''Real Ghostbusters'' episodes started to become lighter in tone so as not to frighten the growing fanbase of young children.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Additionally, the characterizations became more one-dimensional, and the animation became less detailed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} More changes went on behind the scenes as well with the departure of writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[Dave Coulier]] of ''[[Full House]]'' fame came on to fill the role of Peter (voiced by [[Lorenzo Music]]), [[Buster Jones]] took over Winston from [[Arsenio Hall]], and [[Kath Soucie]] took on Janine after Laura Summer voiced the role. Straczynski returned to the series temporarily in the 1990 season..{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The only cast members who remained throughout the entire series were [[Frank Welker]] (voice of Stantz and Slimer) and [[Maurice LaMarche]] (voice of Spengler). The show was cancelled in 1991.

===''Extreme Ghostbusters''===
{{Main|Extreme Ghostbusters}}
''Extreme Ghostbusters'' was a sequel and spin-off of ''The Real Ghostbusters'' that aired in late 1997. The show featured a new team of younger Ghostbusters led by veteran Ghostbuster Egon Spengler, secretary [[Janine Melnitz]], and the ghost Slimer. The premise is similar to the plot of ''Ghostbusters II''. Set years after the end of ''The Real Ghostbusters'', a lack of supernatural activity has put the Ghostbusters out of business. Each has gone his separate way, except for Egon, who still lives in the Firehouse to monitor the containment unit, further his studies, and teach a class on the paranormal at a local college. When ghosts start to reappear, Egon is forced to recruit his four students as the new Ghostbusters. The new Ghostbusters were Kylie Griffin, a genius, expert on the occult, and female counterpart to Egon; Eduardo Rivera, a hip, cynical Latino slacker and counterpart to Peter; Garrett Miller, a wheelchair-bound young athlete and counterpart to Ray; and Roland Jackson, a studious African-American machinery whiz and counterpart to Winston. The show was given the Los Angeles Commission on Disabilities Award for making one of its main characters (Garrett) disabled but universally relatable.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===''Ghostbusters: Ecto Force''===
A new animated series, titled ''Ghostbusters: Ecto Force'', was announced for development on June 20, 2016. The series will be set in the year 2050 and follows a new team of Ghostbusters who capture ghosts from around the world and was initially targeted for an early 2018 debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kit |first=Borys |title=Sony Unveils Plans for Animated 'Spider-Man' and 'Emojimovie: Express Yourself' |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sony-unveils-plans-animated-spider-904574 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=June 20, 2016 |accessdate=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017 Reitman revealed that the series had been postponed to prioritize development on the planned ''Ghostbusters'' animated feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Takao |title=Ghostbusters: Ecto Force postponed for new film |url=http://www.toonbarn.com/other-cartoons/ghostbusters-ecto-force-postponed-animated-feature/ |website=ToonBarn |accessdate=August 16, 2017 |date=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
The first film sparked the [[catchphrase]]s, "Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters!" and "I ain't afraid of no ghost." Both came from the [[Ghostbusters (song)|theme song]] performed by [[Ray Parker, Jr.]], who wrote it in a day and a half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gary James |date=January 1, 2002 |title=Gary James' Interview With Ray Parker Jr. |url=http://www.classicbands.com/RayParkerJrInterview.html |work=classicbands.com |accessdate=August 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was a huge hit, staying at No. 1 for three weeks on Billboard's [[Hot 100]] chart and No. 1 for two weeks on the Black Singles chart. The song earned Parker an Academy Award nomination for "[[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]."

The music video produced for the song is considered one of the key productions in the early music video era, and was a No. 1 [[MTV]] video. Directed by Reitman, and produced by Jeffrey Abelson, the video organically integrated footage of the film in a specially designed haunted house, lined with neon in its entirety. The film footage was intercut with a humorous performance by Parker and featured [[cameo appearances]] by celebrities who joined in the call and response chorus, including [[Chevy Chase]], [[Irene Cara]], [[John Candy]], [[Nickolas Ashford]], [[Melissa Gilbert]], [[Jeffrey Tambor]], [[George Wendt]], [[Al Franken]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Peter Falk]], and [[Teri Garr]]. The video ends with footage of the four main Ghostbusters actors, in costume and character, dancing in [[Times Square]] behind Parker, joining in the singing.

The sequel spawned two singles from the soundtrack. [[Rhythm and Blues|R&amp;B]] artist [[Bobby Brown]] had a successful hit with "On Our Own", while [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Run-D.M.C.]] were commissioned to perform "Ghostbusters (rap version)" for the sequel.

The film spawned a theme park special effects show at [[Universal Studios Florida]] that closed in 1996. The Ghostbusters were later featured in a lip-synching dance show including [[Beetlejuice]] on the steps of the [[New York Public Library]] facade at the park. The characters were all new and "extreme" versions in the show, save for the Zeddemore character. Their Ecto-1 automobile was used to drive them around the park, and was often used in the park's annual "[[Macy's]] Holiday Parade." For the show, an experimental [[silicone]] skin was used on Slimer, which took two weeks to put together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=January 1, 2002 |title=Spooktacular at Universal Studios, Florida |url=http://www.ghostbustershq.com/spooktacular/intbm.html |work=GhostbustersHQ.com |accessdate=August 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824091851/http://www.ghostbustershq.com/spooktacular/intbm.html |archivedate=August 24, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show, Ecto-1, and all other Ghostbuster trademarks were discontinued in 2005 when Universal failed to renew the rights for theme park use.

The [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association]] (NECA) released a line of 7" scale action figures based on the first movie, but only produced a series of ghost characters, as Murray refused the rights to use his facial likeness. Their first and only series included Gozer, Slimer (or Onionhead), the Terror Dogs: Zuul and Vinz Clortho, and a massive [[Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man]], contrasting the diminutive figure that was in the original figure line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sanderson, Peter |date=February 26, 2004 |title=Toy Fair 2004 Day Two: DC Comics, Marvel, Buffy, South Park &amp; More |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/495/495012p5.html |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=September 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ertl Company|Ertl]] released a die-cast 1/25 scale [[Ectomobile]], also known as the Ecto-1, the Ghostbusters' main transportation. Rubies' Costumes has produced a Ghostbusters Halloween costume, consisting of a one-piece jumpsuit with logos and an inflatable Proton Pack.

By 2007, ''Ghostbusters'' merchandise sales had exceeded {{US$|1 billion|long=no}} in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116170125/www.gamingbits.com/general-gaming-news-bits/ghostbusters-the-video-game-teaser-trailer-and-screenshots/|title=Ghostbusters: The Video Game Teaser Trailer and Screenshots|website=GamingBits|date=November 16, 2007|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mattel]] has produced a series of action figures based on characters from both the 1984 &amp; 1989 movies and the 2009 video game, most of which were sold exclusively on their MattyCollector.Com webstore. This 6" line featured Peter, Ray, Egon, Winston, Gatekeeper Dana, Keymaster Louis, Walter Peck, Vigo the Carpathian, and most of the ghosts including a giant Mr Stay Puft. Mattel also offered a series of 12" figures with fabric clothing and light-up proton packs/slime blowers, as well as a number of replica toy props such as the PKE Meter &amp; Ghost Trap. For retail stores, there was a "retro" series of 8-inch, cloth-costumed action figures based on the animated series, and a festive 6" Ghostbusters II set featuring the team in their dark grey uniforms with Santa hats.

At the February 2015 Toyfair [[Diamond Select Toys]] revealed several figures in a new 7" action figure line based on the first movie. These will include Ray, Winston, Peter, Egon, Gozer, the Terror Dogs (Zuul &amp; Vinz Clortho), Dana, and Louis. Each figure will also include pieces to assemble a diorama of the rooftop temple.

In 2017 [[Playmobil]] also produced a toy line featuring the Ghostbusters and essential elements from the first movie, including Dana Barret, the Marshmallow Man and Ecto-1.&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Liszewski |first1=Andrew |title=Playmobil's New Ghostbusters Toys Are So Great You'll Wish You Had A Childhood Do-Over|url=https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/playmobils-new-ghostbusters-toys-are-so-great-youll-wish-you-had-a-childhood-do-over/|accessdate=February 2, 2017|publisher=Gizmodo|date=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighties, [[NOW Comics]] and [[Marvel UK]] published, ''[[The Real Ghostbusters (comics)|The Real Ghostbusters]]'', comics based on the TV series of the same name.

In May 2003, [[Sony]] signed an agreement with 88MPH Studios to work on a comic update of the ''Ghostbusters'' movie, to be released in later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=May 16, 2003 |title=New Ghostbusters Comic On The Way: Artwork Available |url=http://archive.ghostbusters.net/article/69/ |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=September 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6822 |title=Making The Call: Clavet &amp; Dabb On Ghostbusters – Newsarama |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630135209/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6822 |archivedate=June 30, 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Source is a forum post.|date=May 2017}} ''[[Ghostbusters: Legion]]'' saw the return of the four Ghostbusters and the principal cast from the movie. ''Legion'' updated the series by setting the events of the first movie in 2004 rather than 1984. Set six months after the Gozer incident, the series was designed to follow the Ghostbusters as their initial fame faded and they returned to the regular chore of busting ghosts on a daily basis. The series sees the team run ragged as a spate of supernatural crimes and other related occurrences plague the city, as well as contemplating the greater effects of their success beyond the immediate media attention.

Manga publisher [[Tokyopop]] produced an [[original English-language manga]] around the same time the video game was announced. It was released in October 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Scott Lowe |date=July 8, 2008 |title=AX08: Tokyopop Announces Ghostbusters Manga |url=http://anime.ign.com/articles/886/886424p1.html |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsarama.com/comics/080709-GBustersManga.html |title=Tokyopop to Publish Ghostbusters Manga |website=Newsarama.com |date=July 9, 2008 |accessdate=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the title ''Ghostbusters: Ghost Busted''. Taking place between the second film and the game, the manga featured a series of [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] stories from several different artists and writers, as well as a subplot involving Jack Hardemeyer (from the second movie) and a [[vengeful ghost|vengeful army of ghosts]] attempting to get revenge on the Ghostbusters.

[[IDW Publishing]] also released a comic book series based on the franchise. Their first series, ''Ghostbusters: The Other Side'', was written by [[Keith Champagne]], with art by Tom Nguyen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=17427 |title=CCI: Bustin' Makes Keith Feel Good |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=July 26, 2008 |accessdate=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second series was later released in 2009 as ''Ghostbusters: Displaced Aggression''. A third series, ''Ghostbusters: Haunted Holidays'' was released November 2010. From September 2011 through December 2012, IDW published an ongoing series that ran 16 issues, written by Erik Burnham with art by Dan Schoening and Luis Antonio Delgado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comics.org/series/61188/ |title=GCD :: Series :: Ghostbusters |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From February 2013 through September 2014, a new ongoing series titled ''The New Ghostbusters'', also by Burnham, Schoening, and Delgado, ran 20 issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comics.org/series/71934/ |title=GCD :: Series :: Ghostbusters |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the occasion of the mutual 30-year anniversary of both franchises, IDW published a limited crossover series titled ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles/Ghostbusters'' in 2014, featuring the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW Publishing)|IDW version]] of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] joining forces with the comics Ghostbusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=54061/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: IDW Adds "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles/Ghostbusters," "Edward Scissorhands" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the series launched a sequel—''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles/Ghostbusters 2''—three years later, with an accompanying assortment of action figures blending the Turtles' and the Ghostbusters' physical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terror |first=Jude |url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/07/20/tmntghostbusters-comic-gets-sequel-november-crossover-toys-target-stores/|title=TMNT/Ghostbusters Comic Gets A Sequel For November, With Crossover Toys In Target Stores|publisher=Bleeding Cool.com|date=2017-07-20 |accessdate=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Narcisse|first1=Evan|title=Here Are the Ninja Turtles/Ghostbusters Mash-Up Figures Someone Has Definitely Been Waiting for|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/here-are-the-ninja-turtles-ghostbusters-mash-up-figures-1797101652|website=io9|accessdate=2017-11-20|date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
The Ghostbusters use a specialized set of equipment in the 1984 film, and all subsequent ''Ghostbusters'' fiction includes similar equipment to aid in the capture and containment of ghosts. In addition to the main technology used in the series, a script draft for ''Ghostbusters III'' includes the Ghostbusters developing a machine to transport themselves to an alternate [[Manhattan]] to save New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |date=May 16, 2006 |title=Ramis on ''Ghostbusters 3'' |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/708/708806p1.html |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main equipment used by the Ghostbusters to capture ghosts is the ''[[proton pack]]'': a reportedly unlicensed nuclear accelerator which fires a [[proton]] stream that polarizes with the negatively charged energy of a ghost, allowing it to be held in the stream while active. The proton packs' particle throwers were originally portrayed as wands worn on each arm. In current versions, it consists of a hand-held wand (''[[neutrino]] wand'' as described and scripted by Aykroyd, also called a ''proton gun'' or ''particle thrower'' within the franchise) connected to a backpack-sized [[particle accelerator]]. The Proton Stream can also fire a hard-hitting boson dart which can be fired alone or collided with the Proton Stream to fire a Boson Collider.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The ''Slime Blower'' is seen and developed in the movie ''Ghostbusters II''; this piece of equipment is a metal tank strapped to the back of its user, with an attached sprayer used to project streams of the ''psychomagnetheric mood slime'' that has been reinforced with positive emotions so as to neutralize its negatively reinforced counterparts. In ''Ghostbusters: The Video Game'', the slime blower is modified to shoot positively charged slime, and can also shoot slime tethers, the slime tether in turn can be attached to one object, then the other end to another solid surface to pull that heavy object (also used to open heavy doors) which usually would be difficult to move without use of some tremendous amount of force, so the slime tether helps get the job done. The Ghostbusters can also attach one end of a slime tether to a ghost, then attach the other end to a nearby already deployed ghost trap allowing for a quicker trapping of a ghost. A toy slime blower was released with the Kenner Real Ghostbusters toy line. In the ''Ghostbusters'' comics, the ''Ecto-Splat'' is a [[flamethrower]]-like device that fires a hard jet of [[Ectoplasm (parapsychology)|ectoplasm]], which can damage or dissipate ghosts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

The ''Shock Blaster'' is the close-range weapon of the Ghostbusters arsenal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} It fires a blast of stripped dark matter particles that diffuse quickly when they come in contact with the outside world. The Ghostbusters use the Shock Blaster for fighting close-proximity entities and inhabiting swarmers. The Shock Blaster also fires a Stasis Stream which fires a high-capacity stream that hypobond to ectoplasmic matter. If a Ghostbuster trains the stream on a ghost long enough, he can actually stop it entirely.

The Ghostbusters also use equipment to hunt and find ghosts. The ''PKE meter'' is a handheld device that locates and measures ''psycho-kinetic energy'' (PKE), which is an environmental byproduct emitted only by ghosts. The device's most prominent feature are winged arms that raise and lower in relation to the amount of PKE detected while a digital display gives an exact reading for the operator. The ''giga meter'' is a device similar to the PKE meter featured in ''Ghostbusters II''. As explained by Egon in the original script, the giga meter measures PKE in GeV, or giga-[[electronvolt]]s. ''Ecto-Goggles'', sometimes known as ''Spectro-Visors'', are a special pair of goggles that visually trace PKE readings. They are particularly useful in helping the wearer see normally invisible ghosts. There is also a ''Ghost Sniffer'' only seen used by Venkman in the first movie. A toy Ghost Sniffer was released as part of the Kenner Real Ghostbusters toyline.

In the ''Ghostbusters'' fiction, ghosts cannot simply be destroyed. Instead, they become temporarily destabilized. However, from their encounter with the Gray Lady in the first movie, Egon devises several pieces of equipment that are used to trap and contain ghosts.

The ''trap'' is a box with a split, hinged lid, remote-controlled by a simple pedal switch, attached to the end of the box by a long cable. When a ghost is brought close to the trap (usually by means of the proton pack), the ghost trap is activated by the foot switch. Its lid then opens, and a [[force shield|force field]] draws the ghost inside. When the ghost is captured, the trap emits smoke and a strong, bad smell. Characters are advised to refrain from looking directly at the trap when it is activated. The ghost can then be transported to the larger, more permanent containment unit. More than one ghost can be stored in a trap, but a maximum number has never been established, nor for how long a ghost can be held. A captured ghost can be released from the trap by opening it.

The ''Ecto-Containment Unit'', also referred to as the ''Containment System'', is the large facility in the basement of the Ghostbusters' headquarters. It was developed after Dr. Spengler and Dr. Stantz made their first actual contact in the basement of the New York Public Library with the ghost of its librarian Eleanor Twitty, who is referred by them as the Gray Lady. Data from that experience indicates they could capture and hold ghosts indefinitely. This idea makes the Ghostbuster business possible. All captured ghosts are stored in the containment unit. The unit itself utilizes a high-voltage grid of lasers to do its job. Turning off the protection grid without following proper procedures will result in a catastrophic and explosive release of all ectoplasmic entities and psycho-kinetic energy stored in the unit. The containment unit has an easy-access slot, where the ghost can be transferred from the trap into the unit's containment field.

===Transportation===
[[File:Cadillac Miller-Meteor - Moteur ! @ Mondial auto 2016.jpg|thumb|right|The Ectomobile or Ecto-1 is a modified 1959 Cadillac Miller-Meteor ambulance.]]
The '''Ectomobile''', or '''Ecto-1''' is a 1959 [[Cadillac Miller-Meteor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_1936-Cadillac-Ambulance-1959.html |title=1959 Cadillac Ambulance Miller-Meteor Futura in "Ghost Busters, 1984" |publisher=IMCDb.org |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; limo-style endloader [[combination car]] (ambulance conversion) used in the 1984 film ''Ghostbusters'' and other ''Ghostbusters'' fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_24706-Cadillac-Ambulance-1959.html |title=1959 Cadillac Ambulance Miller-Meteor Futura in "Ghostbusters II, 1989" |publisher=IMCDb.org |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_28131-Cadillac-Ambulance-1959.html |title=1959 Cadillac Ambulance Miller-Meteor in "The Real Ghostbusters, 1986–1991" |publisher=IMCDb.org |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original vehicle design was the creation of Steven Dane, credited as a Hardware Consultant in the credits.

In the original movie, Stantz pays $4800 (over $9900 in 2012 dollars) for it and claims it needs a plethora of repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl |title=United States Bureau of Labor and Statistics Inflation Calculator |publisher=United States Bureau of Labor and Statistics |accessdate=June 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Stantz's own words, it needs "[[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] work and [[shock absorbers|shocks]], [[Vehicle brake|brakes]], [[brake pads]], lining, steering box, [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], [[Rear-end (automobile)|rear end]]... new rings, [[muffler]]s, a little [[wiring]]...."

After the necessary reconstruction, it is used to carry the Ghostbusters and their ghost-capturing equipment through New York City. Its features include a special pull-out rack in the rear containing the staff's proton packs. There are also various gadgets mounted on the top, whose function is never revealed in the movies. A cartoon episode features the ''proton cannon'', presumably a more powerful version of a proton pack, mounted on top for use against extra large or even giant sized paranormal entities.

Earlier versions of scripts written by Aykroyd for the first ''Ghostbusters'' also include mentions of the Ectomobile having the power of [[Dimension#Science fiction|interdimensional]] travel. The shooting script for the movie describes the Ectomobile as being black, with purple and white strobe lights that gave the vehicle a "purple aura".

A miniature replica of the vehicle was mass-produced as a children's toy. Polar Lights released a 1/24 scale model kit of the Ecto-1 in 2002. In 2010, [[Hot Wheels]] released a "Ghostbusters Ecto-1" as part of the "2010 Hot Wheels Premiere" series.

Hot Wheels Elite released a highly detailed 1/18 diecast of the Ecto-1 in 2010 and in early 2013, they released a 1/18 Ecto-1A as seen in ''Ghostbusters II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotwheels-elite.com/model-cars-miniature/cult-classics-collection/573/ecto-1-ghostbusters.php |title=Hot Wheels Elite Ghostbusters 1/18 Ecto-1 |publisher=Hot Wheels |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotwheels-elite.com/model-cars-miniature/cult-classics-collection/735/ghostbusters-ecto-1a.php |title=Hot Wheels Elite Ghostbusters 1/18 Ecto-1A |publisher=Hot Wheels |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout other ''Ghostbusters'' fiction, a number of other Ectomobiles are introduced.
* In the 1984 computer game adaptation, players are given the choice between the 1959 hearse (which looked the most like Ecto-1), a cheap [[VW Beetle]], a spacious [[station wagon]] and a high performance (but low-capacity) sports car.
* Ecto-1a is an upgraded version of the Ecto-1, seen only in ''Ghostbusters II'', which includes more technical equipment on the vehicle's roof and digital announcement boards on each side of it. The logo is updated and added to the hood. The vehicle also sports strips of yellow and black along either side.
* A new Ecto-1 appears in the 2016 reboot, originating as a hearse borrowed by Patty Tolan from her uncle's funeral home. Even after being repainted, modified to carry the team's equipment, and fitted with a nuclear reactor, it retains its original pink roof color. They deliberately destroy it by overloading its systems with beams from their proton packs, in order to force a swarm of invading ghosts back through the portal they had used to enter the material world.
* Ecto-1b is featured in ''Ghostbusters: The Video Game''; the 1b is similar to the 1a, but features upgraded equipment and the addition of the ''Super Slammer Trap'', an enhanced capacity ghost trap, on its roof.
* Ecto-2 is a small open-topped two-seater [[autogyro]] is seen in the cartoons and the comic based on them, and was released as a toy.
** In the 2016 film, Ecto-2 is a white motorbike.
* Ecto-3 has been the name of three different vehicles:
** a motorized [[unicycle]] and [[sidecar]] that slips into the Ecto-1's rear fender in the ''Real Ghostbusters'' episode "The Joke's on Ray"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ectos|url=http://www.ectocontainment.com/ectos.htm|website=Ecto Containment|accessdate=December 4, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629073909/http://www.ectocontainment.com/ectos.htm|archivedate=June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source is a fansite.|date=December 2017}}
** a time-distortion [[jet aircraft|jet]]-like vehicle invented by Egon in the comics that is renamed Ecto-4 after the cartoon's unicycle version debuted
** a [[go-kart]]-like vehicle sold as a toy
* Ecto-Bomber is an airplane based on the Kenner toy.
* Extreme Ecto-1 is seen in the ''Extreme Ghostbusters'' TV series. The vehicle is equipped with new detection equipment and emergency lights, and has wheelchair access for Garrett Miller.  It is mentioned that before the adaptations were made it was a 1970s Cadillac hearse.
* Ecto-Ichi (''ichi'' means "one" in Japanese) is an extremely [[high tech]] six-wheeled Ectomobile supplied to the Ghostbusters by the Japanese government for a job in Tokyo. It can fly and travel on water, but is destroyed when a [[Godzilla]]-esque monster stepped on it.
* Ecto-8 is featured in the 2009 video game, and is a [[tugboat]] used to transport the team to Shandor island. It is driven by Ray, who refers to it as "Marine Ecto-8". Ecto-8 is identical in body to a traditional tugboat, but has a white paint scheme and the logo on the side.
* A [[Ghostbusters (2007 game)|''Ghostbusters'' video game]] in development in 2007 featured a more modern version of the Ectomobile based on a stretched Chrysler 300C.
The repaired Ectomobile is named on-screen with the license plate shown reading "Ecto-1". The word ''Ectomobile'' was only used in the song "Cleaning Up The Town" from the film's soundtrack. The filmmakers planned to have the Ecto-1 painted black, but the color of the vehicle was changed to white when it was decided a black car would be too difficult to see during night scenes. Three cars have played the vehicle in the movies; the third 1959 Miller-Meteor was purchased after the second died during shooting of ''Ghostbusters II''. The black Miller-Meteor seen at the beginning of the first movie was leased and used only for that scene and never converted for filming, though it was later purchased by the studio and completely converted to a full Ecto-1 for touring. Both of the other Ectomobiles are currently sitting in a Sony pictures backlot, having undergone a full restoration after years of deterioration.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Cultural impact==
According to the director commentary on the ''Ghostbusters'' DVD, the movie's cultural impact was felt almost immediately. The building that was Dana Barrett's apartment building in ''Ghostbusters'' has, since the release of the film, been known as the Ghostbusters Building,&lt;ref name=nymag&gt;{{cite web |last=Gaines |first=Steven |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/realestate/vu/14943/ |title=75 Years in the Life of a Central Park West Penthouse |website=Nymag.com |date=November 7, 2005 |accessdate=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and along with the Hook and Ladder Firehouse, has become a real world New York City tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |date=May 1, 2005 |title=New York City |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCQ/is_6_20/ai_n13681257 |work=Travel America |accessdate=August 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304165403/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCQ/is_6_20/ai_n13681257 |archivedate=March 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, the group Improv Everywhere, at the invitation of the New York Public Library, staged a ''Ghostbusters''-themed "mission" in the same reading room used in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Charlie|title=Who You Gonna Call?|url=http://improveverywhere.com/2010/05/18/who-you-gonna-call/|website=Improv Everywhere|accessdate=January 11, 2011|date=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video game ''[[Burnout Paradise]]'' pays homage to the franchise with a car titled the 'Manhattan Spirit', which is based on the Ecto-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Burnout Paradise: Legendary Cars |url=http://www.joystiq.com/screenshots/burnout-paradise-legendary-cars#1273026 |accessdate=February 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920190536/http://www.joystiq.com/screenshots/burnout-paradise-legendary-cars#1273026 |archivedate=September 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie ''[[Be Kind Rewind]]'' includes a sequence in which [[Jack Black]], [[Mos Def]], and others re-create the first movie using props and costumes made by themselves, a guest appearance by [[Sigourney Weaver]], and a version of the theme sung by Jack Black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fred Topel |date=November 28, 2006 |title=Jack Black and Michel Gondry Remake "King Kong," "Robocop," and More '80s Classics |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1647875/ |work=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 2013, a trailer for a documentary called ''Spook Central'', featuring clips from ''Ghostbusters'' alongside discussions of the perceived meanings in the film, mimicking the style of the documentary ''[[Room 237]]'', was uploaded to YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Haglund |date=June 11, 2013 |title=What Is Ghostbusters Really About? |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/06/11/spook_central_trailer_ghostbusters_fan_film_is_a_pretty_good_joke_video.html |work=Slate |accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malefic Time''' is a visual project created by Spanish artists [[Luis Royo]] and [[Romulo Royo]]. It is set in a post apocalyptic world that mixes reality led to the decay of the society with real manifestations of mythological beliefs and superstitions of different cultures.

The main plot is presented in a trilogy of graphic novels with illustration made by both artists. The protagonist Luz travels through the universe of Malefic Time and meets different people, allies, enemies and their way of surviving in this broken world.

The project has been carried to other media (comics, novels, RPG, music, shorts) that much develop  different aspects of the universe expanding and making it deeper.

==Fictional setting==
Malefic Time is a fantasy universe where humanity is not alone in creation: there are other creatures, called in many ways over the years, now known as [[Angel|Celestials]] and [[Fallen angel|Fallen]].

These creatures of immense power have been influencing, manipulating us and waging a war in which each side tries to crush the other. In 2019 the world began to sink: social structures crumbled, the world economy disappeared and riots began due to a disease that began to spread worldwide. It was then in 2020 when Celestials and The Fallen showed openly to the world.

This is 2033, and everyone has in mind that it is the end of an era. According to astrology the [[Age of Aquarius]] comes, a shift to inward development of individuals and the rejection of imposed laws that will strongly influence human behavior.

== Plot summary ==

=== Luz – Malefic ===

She is presented for the first time on the cover of the illustrated book with the same title more than 20 years ago. But it is not until in 2010 when [[Luis Royo]] and [[Romulo Royo]] retake the character, her story is told and the “Malefic Time” project is founded. Malefic is the protagonist, all the plot consists of her development and in the search for her identity.

Her real name is Luz. She moves through [[New York City]] looking for libraries and museums, she knows that there, in the old books and ancient paintings are all the keys to understand this new world and to find out who she is.

In the dilapidated warehouse where she lives there are hundreds of books and papers that she brings from her walks through the city libraries, all of them with apocalyptic themes, [[Romanesque art|Romanesque paintings]] books, [[Freemasonry|books of Masons]], [[witchcraft]], [[alchemy]], notes of prophets and seers, oriental writings, [[Aztec]] and [[Culture of Africa|African]] art, reproductions of paintings from ancient times, [[Greek mythology]] or [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]] studies. All part of a puzzle about the [[final judgment]].

The search for identity, answer her questions, the cracks and falls are what determine her. It is a broken character built on the [[Bipolar disorder|bipolarity]] between her power, determination, great resolute and combat skills, and her apparent role in the future destiny against the huge fragility supposed by the doubts, questions, and frequent states of obsession, disease, collapse and trance. She is a charismatic character with multiple layers that make her an atypical heroine/anti-heroine through which the deep folds and nuances of the story are known.

The course of his journey is from [[New York City]] to [[Tokyo]] and [[Paris]]. On a trip of spiritual quest. A road full of [[mysticism]] and forbidden topics by the current culture. A symbol of change for the man. An uprising against the oppression of the laws and regulations that govern the world.

=== Celestials and The Fallen ===

These beings have the easy association with the [[Angels]] and [[Demons]] in the [[Judeo-Christian | Judeo-Christian biblical tradition]] in appearance but are much more. They have been the origin of all gods for all cultures, they changed names throughout history, but their conflict and their intervention goes back to the earliest days of mankind. The first indications of their existence are dated back in the [[Sumerian mythology]] (cradle of human civilization) and then extends, altered, contaminated, adapted to all forms of religion in the ancient Mediterranean and soon after to other societies of the world.

The initial conflict, represented biblically with [[Lucifer|angel Lucifer's]] rebellion against [[God]] establishes an unbridgeable rift between these two positions that have continued settling their disputes over human existence. Both positions represent two diametrical ways of understanding existence with the following association, among others, these inherent values:

*Celestials: The Sun, the masculine, the Authority, order, the standard, foreign, Age of Pisces.
*The Fallen: The Moon, the Feminine, Nature, Spirituality, instinct, the inside, Age of Aquarius.

== Adaptations ==
*''Plenilunio'' is a [[role playing game]] set in the Malefic Time universe

A '''Production Assistant''', also known as a '''PA''',  is a member of the [[film crew]] and is a job title used in [[filmmaking]] and [[television]] for a person responsible for various aspects of a [[Filmmaking#Production|production]].  The job of a PA can vary greatly depending on the budget and specific requirements of a production as well as whether the production is [[trade union|unionized]].

Production Assistants on films are sometimes attached to individual [[actor]]s or [[filmmaker]]s.

==Tasks==
In the [[United States]], Production Assistants in union and non-union workplaces face various tasks on the movie set of a [[filmmaking]] project. Most union PAs are asked to complete tasks with a certain focus. Union PAs only are asked to do a few tasks that may be related to one another and they normally receive tasks concentrated on the actual making of the movie. For example, union Production Assistants may be asked to evaluate a movie's daily rushes for a [[film director]] or help the [[film editor]] decipher ways to alter a scene. Those who are non-union Production Assistants are usually asked to complete a variety of tasks by a department head on a film set. The tasks of a non-union PA can match those of a union PA. These tasks asked to be completed by either a union or non-union PA are requirements that are related to the movie's production, such as setting up props on set and negotiating with the director on how a scene should be shot. However, non-union PAs commonly may be asked to complete a wider array of tasks since these tasks may not necessarily be associated with the film. For example, non-union PAs may be asked to input data in a computer, wash dishes, sort letters in the mail room, and buy coffee for department heads. Basic duties of non-union PAs can be classified as running errands for any person in the production department.&lt;ref&gt;{{production assistant; PA. (2014). In R. W. Kroon, A/V a to z: An encyclopedic dictionary of media, entertainment and other Audiovisual terms. Jefferson, NC: McFarland. Retrieved from http://libproxy.sfc.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/mcfav/production_assistant_pa/0?institutionId=5266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most PAs work with many people since their job requires them to complete generic obligations. Therefore, PAs must be proficient with their communication skills. Traditionally, PAs communicate with department heads by [[walkie-talkies]] on and around the films set. However, PAs can be asked by any member of the film crew to complete a job via interpersonal communication (talking to each other in person) or across technological devices such as a [[cell phone]]. Aspiring PAs must also expect to be attentive on set since they may be asked to complete any job for anyone at any time through any medium of communication. Former Production Assistant Caleb Clark recommends that people who want to be PAs must avoid sitting down, remaining alert at all times. Clark elucidates that PAs must be vigilant because they could be asked for help by any other person at any time of the day. In addition to their improving their skills pertaining to communication and readiness, PAs must adapt to their film set environment. Many movie sets that Production Assistants work on may vary in terms of luxuries. Since movie sets are given different amounts of amenities, not all of them may have the properties and resources that a Production Assistant will need to complete certain assignments. Therefore, PAs should be able to familiarize themselves with the movie set in order to increase their success rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Caleb|title=The Production Assistant's Pocket Handbook|url=https://mnfilmtv.org/files/2914/2428/3783/Production_Assistants_Pocket_Handbook.pdf|publisher=Inkslinger Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAs also must be aware that they may need to bring their own form of transportation on the set. Due to the little resources some sets may have, PAs should consider bringing their own cars or trucks to the set so that more of their long-distance tasks can be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griesinger|first1=Justin|title=Movie Crew Job Titles|url=http://filmincolorado.com/resources/job-descriptions/|website=Film In Colorado|publisher=Film In Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people that normally ask PAs for help are usually superior to them within the film crew. Those that ask a Production Assistant for help typically include people at the top of the film crew's structure, such as the [[production coordinator]], [[screenwriter]], producer, and especially the film's director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Caleb|title=The Production Assistant's Pocket Handbook|url=https://mnfilmtv.org/files/2914/2428/3783/Production_Assistants_Pocket_Handbook.pdf|publisher=Inkslinger Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television and feature film==
In unionized [[television]] and [[feature film]], production assistants are usually divided into different categories: "Set PA", "Truck PA", "Locations PA", "Office PA", or "Set Runner"  and "Extra PA or Daily" - Variations exist depending on a show's structure or region of the United States or Canada.

''Office PAs'' usually spend most hours in the respective show's production office handling such tasks as phones, deliveries, script copies, lunch pick-ups, and related tasks in coordination with the [[production manager]] and [[production coordinator]].

''Set PAs'' work on the physical set of the production, whether on location or on a sound stage. They report to the [[assistant director]] (AD) department and key set PA if one is so designated. Duties include echoing (calling out) "rolls" and "cuts", locking up (making sure nothing interferes with a take), wrangling talent (actors) and background, facilitating communication between departments, distributing paperwork and radios, and related tasks as mandated by the ADs. Set PAs usually work 12- to 16-hour days with the possibility at the end of a shoot to work more than 20 hours a single day and are regularly the "first to arrive and the last to leave".

==Commercials==
Commercial Set PAs share the same responsibilities as their Television and Feature Film counterparts (see "Set PAs" above), but also inherit additional responsibilities traditionally encompassed by other departments in the television and feature film structure. These responsibilities range from providing both critical and mundane production support equipment such as dollies, cranes, director's chairs and pop-up tents to standing in for talent and even filling in for other departments who might be shortstaffed.  It is not atypical for a commercial set PA to be seen handling trash one minute, and the next minute assisting the electricians or grips with a set-up. A select group of commercial set PAs are given the responsibility of driving and managing the production and camera cube trucks. This responsibility is often given to the more senior PAs because it provides several extra days of pay.

Set PAs in commercials are more commonly hired by the production coordinator and/or production manager as opposed to an AD or key set PA. However, many commercial ADs will.

Standard rate for a commercial PA in the Los Angeles area is a flat rate of [[United States dollar|$]]200 per day. On February 1, 2008, benefits for qualifying freelance PAs became available through the Producer's Health Benefits Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phbp.org/ Producer's Health Benefits Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Union vs. non-union==
In [[North America]], no union currently exists for production assistants, but the affiliation of a production with a union (or ''unions'') can affect the job responsibilities of a PA. Less unionized film productions have more positions that can be serviced by non-union personnel; consequently, PAs on such productions may take on a greater variety of non-traditional duties. Examples of this would be a PA setting a light bounce ([[grip (job)|grip]] department) or driving a passenger van ([[teamster]]/transportation department). PAs on a union production generally have less variety in their job duties whereas a non-union PA can be asked to perform any kind of task by a department head.&lt;ref&gt;{{production assistant; PA. (2014). In R. W. Kroon, A/V a to z: An encyclopedic dictionary of media, entertainment and other Audiovisual terms. Jefferson, NC: McFarland. Retrieved from http://libproxy.sfc.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/mcfav/production_assistant_pa/0?institutionId=5266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[British Columbia]], which has the third largest film and television production sector in North America, PAs are represented by the Director's Guild of Canada. Production Assistants represented by the DGC work in the Locations Department and work both on and off set with duties including locking up the set, traffic control, echoing rolls, firewatching, and liaising with the public and location owners. The Key-PA is in charge of all the PAs and is the 1st ADs' right-hand man when it comes to do with the on set aspects regarding a location. From this position DGC PA's can move up through the Locations Department or the Assistant Direction (AD) Department as either a Training Locations Manager (TAL) or a Training Assistant Director (TAD), respectively. Office Production Assistants work in the production office as an Office PA and they work for the Production Manager, Production Coordinator, Assistant Production Coordinator, and / or other office staff in maintaining the work-flow in the office. From this position, Office PAs can work their way up through the office by becoming an Assistant Production Coordinator (APOC), which is unionized under IATSE 891. Pay for PAs according to the DGC Collective Agreement in BC is [[Canadian dollar|$]]205.00 (non-members) to $215.00 (members) for a 15-hour day. An 8-hour day is approximately $118.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dgcbc.com/ie4/files/Minimum_Wage_Joint_Comm_Nov_2011_with_rate_sheet.pdf|date=October 21, 2011|publisher=[[Director's Guild of Canada]]|title=British Columbia Minimum Wage increase|archivedate=April 24, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424192605/http://www.dgcbc.com/ie4/files/Minimum_Wage_Joint_Comm_Nov_2011_with_rate_sheet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Quebec]], the Set PA is part of what is called the "Unit Department" or "Régie". Usually, there is a Unit Manager, Assistant Unit Manager, Set PA, Truck PA, Set Runner, and the "dailies" as needed for street blocking and extra set ups. In other states and provinces these duties are often taken care of by the AD Department, Locations or Transport. The Unit Manager and his/her team are the ones who deal with the daily logistics of shooting on location and/or in studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Online|first1=Maria|url=http://www.maria-online.com/information/article.php?lg=en&amp;q=Production_assistant|website=Maria-Online|publisher=Maria-Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two film unions in Quebec: [http://www.iatse514.net/ IATSE 514] and [http://www.aqtis.qc.ca/ AQTIS: L’Alliance québécoise des techniciens de l’image et du son].  In both cases the PA's are unionized.

== Publication ==
Production assistants are also present in fields other than film and television, as publication businesses also have a need for PAs to regulate the production process of making professional written pieces such as articles, books, records or any other kind of production involving the preparation of written words.

=== Educational and publishing companies ===
The tasks taken on by a PA will depend on the type of educational and/or publishing company that employs them. If the assistant works at a textbook or publishing company, they may oversee the art and composition of written works. P.A.s at educational companies may also oversee work in proofreading departments, as well as for freelance copy editors and authors. When looking at documents and other materials uploaded by the author the production assistant has to make sure everything falls within the requirements of the company they work for. This includes items such as the format, correct file types, positioning, captions and obtaining copyright forms from authors.

If the assistant is part of a publications department for a scientific or professional organization, they have daily jobs that which involve keeping records that are important for their company. They may take care of editing, sending or reading information in databases or manuscripts. Production assistants may also team up with Information Technology workers to help streamline the tasks of the publications departments since it involves keeping track of large amounts of data and information. Working with an I.T. department to create a specific sorting program can improve the speed at which documents are proofed and organized.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas-Medwid, Rachel S. "Lauren Foster." Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, vol. 89, no. 10, Oct. 2008, pp. 1592-1593. EBSCOhost&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entertainment Companies ===
In entertainment companies, production assignments may have to do technical work such as typesetting, printing and binding. They must also be good communicators and be good with deadlines. When working for magazines or newspapers, production assistants may need to keep track of things like individual teams and the cost of producing a physical product. Clients and stakeholders may be involved in a magazine, so P.A.'s have to be professional. There may also be journalists who are on deadlines or need extensions. There are also creative processes that a production assistant can be involved with. They can work with book designers or magazines to ensure a client's specifications are followed properly and may then have to send a copy of the draft for approval to clients. This can last until the final piece has been completed. When printing a piece of work, production assistants may deal with is how files are supposed to be submitted to printers, along with publication dates, and any printing or copy issues. Even after a final piece is complete, the PA may need to ask a client their thoughts on final product.&lt;ref&gt;“Types of Publishing Job.” ''The Society of Young Publishers'', The Publishers Association, thesyp.org.uk/types-of-publishing-job/.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Distinguish|Travesti|Travesty (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Bernhardt Hamlet2.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Sarah Bernhardt]] as [[Hamlet]]]]

'''''Travesti''''' (literally "disguised" in French) is a theatrical term referring to the portrayal of a character in an [[opera]], [[Play (theatre)|play]], or [[ballet]] by a performer of the opposite sex.  Depending on sources, the term may be given as '''travesty''',&lt;ref&gt;*Budden, Julian (1992), 'Travesty' in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', p 799&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anne Hermann|title=Travesty and Transgression: Transvestism in Shakespeare, Brecht, and Churchill|journal=Theatre Journal|year=1989|volume=41|issue=2|pages=133–154|doi=10.2307/3207855|url=http://jstor.org/stable/3207855|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''travesti''''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p 899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', p 716&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''en travesti'''''. The ''Oxford Essential Dictionary of Foreign Terms in English'' explains the origin of the latter term as "pseudo-[[French language|French]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to Speake and LaFlaur (1999), the phrase itself is not recorded in French, and derives from the misinterpretation of ''travesti'' (the [[past participle]] of the French verb ''travestir'') as a noun.&lt;/ref&gt; although French sources from the mid-19th century have used the term, e.g. ''Bibliothèque musicale du Théâtre de l'opéra'' (1876),  ''La revue des deux mondes '' (1868), and have continued the practice into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example Duron (2008) p. 231 and Coste (2004) pp. 26 and 141&lt;/ref&gt;

For social reasons, female roles were played by boys or men in many early forms of theatre, and ''travesti'' roles continued to be used in several types of context even after actresses became accepted on the stage. The popular British theatrical form of the [[pantomime]] traditionally contains a role for a "[[principal boy]]", a [[breeches role]] played by a young woman, and also one or more [[pantomime dame]]s, female comic roles played by men.  Similarly, in the formerly popular genre of [[Victorian burlesque]], there were usually one or more breeches roles.

==Men in female roles==
[[File:Farinelli female caricature edited.jpg|thumb|170 px|left|The famous castrato [[Farinelli]] caricatured in one of his female roles]]
Until the late 17th century in England and the early 19th century in the [[Papal States]]—although not elsewhere in Europe—women were conventionally portrayed by male actors (usually adolescents) in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] because the presence of actual women on stage was considered immoral.

===In theatre===
As a [[boy player]], [[Alexander Cooke]] is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's principal female roles, as well as [[Agrippina the Elder|Agrippina]] in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Sejanus His Fall]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964'', Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 114-15.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660, women began to appear on the English stage, although some female roles continued to be played by boys and young men, including romantic leads. [[Edward Kynaston]], whose roles included the title role in Ben Jonson's ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|Epicoene]]'' and Evadne in [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher's]] ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]'', was one of the last of the era's boy players.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

London's [[Shakespeare's Globe]] theatre, a modern reconstruction of the original [[Globe Theatre]], continues the practice of casting men in female Shakespearean roles. Toby Cockerell played Katherine of France in the theatre's opening production of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/audience-plays-its-part-in-shakespeares-wooden-o-1254497.html "Audience plays its part in Shakespeare's wooden O"]. ''[[The Independent]]'',  7 June 1997&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Mark Rylance]] played Cleopatra in the 1999 production of ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264171.stm "Meet Mr Cleopatra"]. [[BBC News]], 27 January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

''Travesti'' roles for men are still to be found in British [[pantomime]], where there is at least one humorous (and usually older) female character traditionally played by a male actor, the [[pantomime dame]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/12/14/btpanto14.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2005/12/14/ixartleft.html "Panto's merriest widow"]. ''The Telegraph'', 14 December 2005, accessed 7 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===In opera===
[[Castrato|Castrati]], adult males with a female singing voice (usually produced by castration before puberty), appeared in the earliest operas &amp;ndash; initially in female roles. In the first performance of [[Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo|Orfeo]]'' in 1607 the roles of [[Eurydice]] and [[Proserpina]] were both sung by castrati. However, by 1680 the castrati had become the predominant singers for leading male roles as well. The use of castrati for both male and female roles was particularly strong in the [[Papal States]], where women were forbidden from public stage performances until the 19th century.

An exception to this practice was in 17th and 18th century French opera where it was traditional to use uncastrated male voices both for the hero and for malevolent female divinities and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Senelick (2000) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s 1686 opera ''[[Armide (Lully)|Armide]]'' the hero (Renaud) was sung by a [[haute-contre]] (a type of high [[tenor]] voice) while the female spirit of hatred (La Haine) was sung by a tenor. In [[Rameau]]'s 1733 ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'', the hero ([[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolyte]]) was sung by an haute-contre, while the roles of the three [[Parcae|Fates]] and [[Tisiphone]] were scored for [[bass (voice type)|basses]] and tenors. The remaining female roles in both operas were sung by women. The title role of the vain but ugly marsh nymph in Rameau's ''[[Platée]]'' is also for an haute-contre.

Female roles in opera sung by men can still be found, although they are not common. The role of the witch in [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Humperdinck]]'s 1890 opera ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'' was originally written for a [[mezzo-soprano]], but was sung by the tenor [[Philip Langridge]] in the [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s 2009 production directed by [[Richard Jones (director)|Richard Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Metropolitan Opera]] (2009). [http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/news/interviews/detail.aspx?id=10678 "Sweet and Low-Down"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azio Corghi]]'s 2005 opera ''Il dissoluto assolto'', which incorporates story elements from Mozart's ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', casts a [[counter-tenor]] in the role of the [[mannequin]] of Donna Elvira.&lt;ref&gt;Moiraghi, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

===In dance===
The portrayal of women by male dancers was very common in [[Renaissance]] court ballet&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2202) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued into more modern times, although primarily restricted to comic or malevolent female characters. The use of male dancers for all the female roles in a ballet persisted well into the 18th century in the Papal States, when women dancers had long been taking these roles elsewhere in Italy. Abbé Jérôme Richard who travelled to Rome in 1762 wrote: "Female Dancers are not permitted on the stages in Rome. They substitute for them boys dressed as women and there is also a police ordinance that decreed they wear black bloomers."&lt;ref name = "HW38"&gt;quoted in Harris-Warrick (2005) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Another French traveller that year, Joseph-Thomas, comte d'Espinchal, asked himself: "What impression can one have of ballet in which the prima ballerina is a young man in disguise with artificial feminine curves?"&lt;ref name = "HW38" /&gt;

In the original production of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' in 1890, a male dancer, [[Enrico Cecchetti]], created the role of the evil fairy Carabosse, although the role has subsequently been danced by both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Brillarelli (1995) p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Frederick Ashton]]'s 1948 choreography of  ''[[Cinderella (Ashton)|Cinderella]]'', [[Robert Helpmann]] and Ashton himself danced the roles of the two stepsisters. [[Ben Stevenson (dancer)|Ben Stevenson]] later continued the practice of casting male dancers as the stepsisters in his own choreography of the ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Upper (2004) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Other female ballet characters traditionally performed by male dancers are Old Madge, the village sorceress in ''[[La Sylphide]]'' and the Widow Simone in ''[[La fille mal gardée]]''.

==Women in male roles==
[[File:Eugénie Fiocre as a matador.jpg|thumb|180 px|The ballerina [[Eugénie Fiocre]] as a [[matador]] circa 1860]]
With the [[English Restoration|Restoration of Charles II]] in 1660 women started appearing on the English stage, both in the female roles that in Shakespeare's day had been portrayed by men and boys, and in male roles. It has been estimated that of the 375 plays produced in London between 1660 and 1700, nearly a quarter contained one or more roles for actresses dressed as men.&lt;ref&gt;See Howe (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the 19th century actresses who made a mark in ''travesti'' roles were [[Mary Anne Keeley]] who portrayed Smike in the stage adaptation of ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'' and the robber [[Jack Sheppard]] in [[John Baldwin Buckstone|Buckstone]]'s play based on his life; [[Maude Adams]] who played [[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]] in the American premiere of [[J. M. Barrie|Barrie]]'s play and went on to play the role over 1,500 times;&lt;ref&gt;Harbin, Marra, and Schanke (2005) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sarah Bernhardt]] who created the role of [[Napoleon II of France]] in [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''[[L'Aiglon]]'', played [[Lorenzino de' Medici]] in [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]]'s ''Lorenzaccio'', Pelléas in [[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[Pelléas and Mélisande]]'' and perhaps most famously played the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]''. In the [[Victorian era]], [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]] generally included several breeches roles.  According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', although "an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in travesty roles ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency."&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the specialists in these roles was [[Nellie Farren]] who created the title roles in numerous burlesques and pantomimes, including ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'', ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' and ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Culme, John. [http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html Information "Nellie Farren (1848-1904) English burlesque actress"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012233616/http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html |date=12 October 2009 }} at Footlight Notes, 2003, accessed 8 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In British [[pantomime]], which is still regularly performed, the young male protagonist or [[Principal boy]] is traditionally played by an actress in boy's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2007) pp. 117 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of women performing ''en travesti'' in operas became increasingly common in the early 19th century as [[castrato]] singers went out of fashion and were replaced by [[mezzo-soprano]]s or [[contralto]]s in the young masculine roles. For example, the title role of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s 1813 ''[[Tancredi]]'' was specifically written for a female singer. However, ''travesti'' mezzo-sopranos had been used earlier by both [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and [[Mozart]], sometimes because a castrato was not available, or to portray a boy or very young man, such as Cherubino in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. In 20th-century opera, composers continued to use women to sing the roles of young men, when they felt the mature tenor voice sounded wrong for the part. One notable example was [[Richard Strauss]], who used a mezzo-soprano for Octavian in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and the Composer in ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]''.

From 1830 to 1850, female ballet dancers were increasingly seen in the ''[[corps de ballet]]'' portraying [[matador]]s, [[hussar]]s, and cavaliers, and even as the [[prima ballerina]]'s 'leading man', a practice which was to last well into the 20th century in France.&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1985) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Although both [[Fanny Elssler]] and her sister Thérèse danced ''travesti'' roles at the Paris Opera, Thérèse, who was very tall by the standards of the day, danced them more frequently, often partnering Fanny as her leading man.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1998) p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; The French ballerina [[Eugénie Fiocre]], who created the role of Franz in ''[[Coppélia]]'',  was particularly known for her ''travesti'' performances.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1992) p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tron''' is an American science fiction [[media franchise]]. It began in 1982 with the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] film ''[[Tron]]''. It was followed by various film tie-ins, a comic series and the 2010 sequel ''[[Tron: Legacy]]''. More sequels were planned but have now been suspended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3902476/disney-tron-3/|title= Disney Is Not Moving Forward With Tron 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Tron: Uprising|television series]] premiered on [[Disney XD]] in June 2012.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8549869.stm|title=TV version of Tron 'being made' |work=BBC News | date=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TRON also existed as the [[TRON command]] in the early versions of the computer programming language [[BASIC]].  TRON stood for TRace ON, which prompted the program to print or display line numbers for each command line of a program as it ran, in order to assist in the [[debugging]] of the program.  In the TRON film, TRON became a character who worked in programs to defeat evil elements trying to subvert the program.

===''Tron'' (1982)===
{{Main|Tron}}
''Tron'' is a 1982 American action science fiction film by Walt Disney Pictures. It stars [[Jeff Bridges]] as Kevin Flynn, [[Bruce Boxleitner]] as Tron and his User Alan Bradley, [[Cindy Morgan]] as Yori and Dr. Lora Baines, and [[Dan Shor]] as Ram. [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] plays all three main antagonists: the program [[Sark (Tron)|Sark]], his User Ed Dillinger, and the voice of the [[Master Control Program]]. It was written and directed by [[Steven Lisberger]]. ''Tron'' has a distinctive visual style, as it was one of the first films from a major studio to use [[computer graphics]] extensively.

Jeff Bridges returns as Kevin Flynn and also, in a digitally de-aged form, plays the film's antagonist, a new version of his CLU program.  [[Bruce Boxleitner]] also returns as Alan Bradley and, likewise de-aged, as Tron.  They are joined by [[Garrett Hedlund]] as Sam Flynn, Kevin's son, the film's primary protagonist; [[Olivia Wilde]] as digital warrior Quorra; [[Michael Sheen]] as Castor, owner of a nightclub within the Grid; and [[Beau Garrett]] as Gem, a program that works within the digital world.  The film deals with Sam investigating the disappearance of his father twenty years earlier, a quest that ultimately leads him into an isolated digital world created by his father after the events of the first film.  Original film director Steven Lisberger acted as a producer and consultant on the film, which was written by [[Adam Horowitz (screenwriter)|Adam Horowitz]] and [[Edward Kitsis]] and directed by first-time director [[Joseph Kosinski]].

===Untitled ''Tron: Legacy'' sequel (TBA)===
While never officially approved, it was announced that a third ''Tron'' film was in the works as of March 2015. It was also reported that Joseph Kosinski would return to direct and Olivia Wilde and Garrett Hedlund would reprise their roles from ''Tron: Legacy''.

However, in May of the same year, the film was abruptly cancelled. It was reported that at the time of the cancellation, pre-production had almost been completed, with production having been planned to begin Fall 2015, likely in Vancouver, British Columbia. Disney had also been interested in adding [[Jared Leto]] to the cast, but an offer and negotiations never commenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disney-not-moving-forward-tron-798941|title=Disney Not Moving Forward With 'Tron 3' (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2017, during a Q&amp;A session with Joseph Kosinski, he revealed that Tron 3 isn't totally dead, instead saying it was in "cryogenic freeze".{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

On October 15, 2017, Jared Leto, in a recent interview with Collider, gave an update on the potential Tron reboot, confirming that the project does exist and he is involved. However, since it is in early planning stages, no other details have been said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/tron-3-reboot-jared-leto-update/|title=Jared Leto Offers Update On Potential TRON Reboot |work=Screen Rant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television series==

===''Tron: Uprising''===

Since video games play a central role in the film, many video games based on ''Tron'' have been produced over the years. [[Atari, Inc.]] had plans to develop a real ''Space Paranoids'' game, but this was canceled due to the [[video game crash of 1983]], along with arcade adaptations of ''[[Superman III]]'' and ''[[The Last Starfighter]]''. In 1982, [[Midway Games]] released the ''[[Tron (video game)|Tron]]'' [[arcade game]], which consisted of four mini-games based on sequences in the film. This game earned more than the film's initial release. In 1983, Midway released ''[[Discs of Tron]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tips.retrogames.com/gamepage/dot.html |title=Discs Of Tron |publisher=Tips.retrogames.com |date=June 14, 2000 |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sequel that focused on disc combat.

===Mattel games===

A special joystick resembling the ''Tron'' arcade game joystick was also created as a free giveaway in a special pack that included both Atari 2600 ''Tron'' video games.

===''Tron 2.0''===
{{Main|Tron 2.0}}
A [[PC game]] sequel released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] was released on August 26, 2003. In this [[first person shooter]] game, the player takes the part of Alan Bradley's son Jet, who is pulled into the computer world to fight a computer virus. A separate version of this game, called ''[[Tron 2.0#Ports|Tron 2.0 Killer App]]'', is available for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and features new multiplayer modes. An almost completely different game of the same name is also available for the [[Game Boy Advance]], where Tron and a Light Cycle program named Mercury (first seen in ''Tron 2.0'' for the PC) fight their way through the ENCOM computer to stop a virus called The Corruptor. This game includes light cycle, battle tank, and recognizer battle modes, several security-related minigames, and the arcade games ''Tron'' and ''Discs of Tron''. While the Game Boy Advance game is only minimally connected to the PC game, one of the 100 unlockable chips shows a picture of Jet Bradley.

===''Space Paranoids''===
{{Main|Space Paranoids}}
In 2009, 42 Entertainment released eight, real-life ''Space Paranoids'' arcade machines during the 2009 San Diego Comic Con. They were placed in a recreated Flynn's Arcade near the convention center. The object of the game is to go through the levels and to achieve as many points as possible by destroying Recognizers. The total number of points a person can achieve is 999,000 pts, which is a reference to the score Flynn got in the film, and is a record currently held by the gamer with the initials FLN. You use a pilot-like joystick and a ball to move the turret and tank.

===''Tron: Evolution''===
{{Main|Tron: Evolution}}
A tie-in video game based upon ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'', titled ''[[Tron: Evolution]]'', released in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/61591|title='Tron Evolution' Game Coming Holiday 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaser trailers were released in November 2009, with a longer trailer airing during the [[Spike Video Game Awards]] on December 12, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spike.com/video/tron-video-game-to/3294095 |title=TRON Video Game to Premiere at Video Game Awards 2009! &amp;#124; Free Video Clips |publisher=SPIKE |date=November 24, 2009 |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Evolution'' was made at the same time as the film, and features heavy cross-over references, with members of the video game developers stating that some of the facts in film have more depth if the game is played first, as the game reveals more about that scene. It will also allow you to explore further parts of the Tron world.

===''Tron Evolution: Battle Grids''===
{{Main|Tron Evolution: Battle Grids}}
Unlike ''Tron: Evolution'', made for PS3, PSP, Xbox 360 and PC, ''Tron Evolution: Battle Grids'' is made exclusively for the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS, and its storyline predates that of the other versions. In this game you create your own program, this program will meet Quorra and Tron before the events of ''Tron: Legacy'' and they will train him to be the first ISO to win the Grid Games, but before that can happen you will have to battle and defeat the enemies that kidnapped Quorra and threatened that if you participate in the games she would be Derezzed. The video game is developed by n-Space and published by Disney Interactive Studios.

===Tron RUN/r===
{{main|Tron RUN/r}}

==Theme parks==
From 1982 to 1995, ''Tron'' was featured in [[Disneyland]]'s [[PeopleMover]] attraction, as part of ''The World of Tron'', in which the light cycle sequence from the film was projected around park guests as their vehicle passed through a tunnel on the upper level of the Carousel Theater, placing the PeopleMover in the role of a light cycle. The attraction was known as PeopleMover Thru the World of Tron after this sequence was added. From 1977 to 1982, this segment was previously home to the "SuperSpeed Tunnel," in which race cars were projected around the vehicles.

In 2010, the [[Epcot]] Monorail on the [[Walt Disney World Monorail System]] received [[Wrap advertising|wrap advertisements]] featuring blue and yellow light cycles on either side of the train to promote ''Tron Legacy''.

[[ElecTRONica]] was announced on the Disney Parks Blog for [[Disney California Adventure]] in Anaheim, California. Disney's "ElecTRONica" is an interactive nighttime dance party in Hollywood Pictures Backlot. It is a similar experience to Glow Fest, but with a focus on ''Tron: Legacy''. ElecTRONica features lights, lasers, music, and projections to promote the film. On October 29, 2010, the nighttime show ''[[World of Color]]'' began soft-openings after its second show for a ''Tron: Legacy'' themed encore using [[Daft Punk]]'s original music from [[Tron: Legacy (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]], using new effects and projections on Paradise Pier attractions, The segment was added on November 1, 2010 and ended on March 23, 2011.

==Literature==

===Books===
A novelization of ''Tron'' was released in 1982, written by American science fiction novelist [[Brian Daley]]. It included eight pages of color photographs from the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Daley|first=Brian|title=Tron|publisher=New English Library Ltd|date=October 1, 1982|isbn=0-450-05550-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Disney Senior Staff Publicist Michael Bonifer authored a book entitled ''The Art of Tron'' which covered aspects of the pre-production and post-production aspects of Tron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bonifer|first=Michael|title=The Art of Tron|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|date=November 1982|isbn=0-671-45575-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tron-sector.com/bios/michaelbonifer.aspx Tron Sector Biography of Mike Bonifer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609041007/http://www.tron-sector.com/bios/michaelbonifer.aspx |date=June 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To support the film's release in 1982, Disney also published several books targeting children including ''Tron: A Pop-Up Book'', ''Tron: The Storybook'', and ''The Story of Tron'', a book and audio combination (with either 33 RPM 7 inch record or audio cassette).

A nonfiction book about the making of the original film, called ''The Making of Tron: How Tron Changed Visual Effects and Disney Forever'' was published in 2011 and written by William Kallay.

In 2010, to coincide with the release of ''Tron: Legacy'', a range of new books have been released; including a range of junior novels – "''Tron the Junior Novel''" by Alice Alfonsi, "''Tron: Legacy: Derezzed''" by James Gelsey, "''Tron: Legacy: Out of the Dark''" by Tennant Redbank, "''Tron: Legacy: It's Your Call: Initiate Sequence''" by Carla Jablonski. Additional books include "''The Art of Tron: Legacy''" by Justin Springer, Joseph Kosinski, and Darren Gilford, and "''Tron Legacy: The Movie Storybook''" by James Ponti.

===Comics===

To support the release of the film in 1982, Disney briefly ran a Sunday comic strip adaptation of the film.

In 2003, 88 MPH solicited a mini-series titled ''Tron 2.0: Derezzed''. This comic was canceled before any issues were released.

In 2005, [[Slave Labor Graphics]] announced its six-issue limited series comic, ''[[Tron: The Ghost in the Machine]]''. The first issue was released in April 2006, the second issue in November of the same year. The comic book explores the concept of making a backup copy of a User within the computer system, and how that artificial intelligence might be materialized into the real world. The comic book was written by Landry Walker and Eric Jones, with art in the first two issues by Louie De Martinis. The artist on the last three issues is Mike Shoykhet.

The comic from Slave Labor Graphics opens with a detailed history of the ''Tron'' universe, providing this previously unseen background on the events that allowed Ed Dillinger and the MCP to rise to power:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the early 1970s, a small engineering company called ENCOM introduced a revolutionary type of software designed to direct and streamline the transfer of data between networked machines. Ed Dillinger, the lead programmer on this project, realized the enormous potential of his team's creation and secretly encoded a secondary function to be activated upon installation: to copy the sub-routines of other programs and absorb their functions. This alteration allowed Dillinger to appropriate research and claim it as his own, and he rose quickly through ENCOM’s corporate ranks. This was the beginning of the Master Control Program.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Marvel Comics]] released a two issue mini-series entitled ''[[Tron: Betrayal]]'' in October 2010. The story takes place a year after the original film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=16681 |title=Tron: Betrayal (2010) No. 1 &amp;#124; Comic Books &amp;#124; Comics |publisher=Marvel.com |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To coincide with the release of the sequel ''Tron: Legacy'', Marvel also released in 2010 a comic adaptation of the original 1982 film.  It was written by Peter David with art by Mirco Pierfederici.

A manga version of ''Tron: Legacy'' was released by [[Earth Star Entertainment]] in Japan on June 30, 2011.

==Light cycles==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tron Lightcycles.jpg|right|thumbnail|240px|Two light cycles racing head to head.]] --&gt;
'''Light cycles''' were originally fictional vehicles designed by [[Syd Mead]] for the simulated world of the ''Tron'' universe.  5 real-life replica light cycles were created by Parker Brothers Concepts in Florida, one of which was sold by Sotheby's for a reported $77,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/07/25/this-man-spent-his-life-savings-on-a-tron-light-cycle-theres-just-one-slight-problem-4810519/|title=This  Chinese man owns a real life Tron light cycle. Except he's been banned from riding it - Metro News|work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmauctions.com/lots/lot.cfm?lot_id=1072889|title=2011 Custom Electric Motorcycle|work=RM Sotheby's}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Sobey's reports it was sold for $77k but the news article reports it was sold for $55k --&gt;

These futuristic two-wheeled vehicles resemble motorcycles and create walls of colored light. The vehicles were primarily used in a competition between humanoid computer programs, similar to the 1976 arcade game ''[[Blockade (video game)|Blockade]]'', which was the first of a genre called ''[[Snake (video game)|Snake]]''. Players are in constant motion on a playfield, creating a wall of light behind them as they move. If players hit a wall, their light cycle explodes, placing them out of the game; the last player in the game wins. Since the original display in ''Tron'', there have been numerous adaptations, as well as references in popular culture.

A light cycle toy, in red and yellow versions, was produced by [[TOMY]] as part of the merchandising for the ''Tron'' film, along with action figures scaled to fit inside the toy cycles. [[Counterfeit|Bootleg]] versions of TOMY's design were produced by other toy manufacturers that came in a wide variety of colors, including blue and silver, but were noticeably smaller than the TOMY-produced toy, too small in fact to accommodate one of the TOMY action figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyarchive.com/Tron/Tron.html Tron], Rare and Unique toys of the 70's, 80's, and 90's. – Alex Bickmore's SUPER TOY ARCHIVE&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said to be very fast, and has the unique ability to go off the grid on its own power. We also get a glimpse at Kevin Flynn's own cycle, a "Second Generation Light Cycle" designed in 1989 by Flynn and “rumor has it it's still the fastest thing on the grid.” It incorporates some of the look of both films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/07/23/comic-con-tron-2-retitled-tron-legacy-imax-3d-concept-art-and-new-scene-revealed/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120911153107/http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/07/23/comic-con-tron-2-retitled-tron-legacy-imax-3d-concept-art-and-new-scene-revealed/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 11, 2012 |title=Comic-Con: Tron 2 Retitled TRON Legacy; IMAX 3D; Concept Art and New Scene Revealed &amp;#124; /Film |publisher=Slashfilm.com |date=August 25, 2008 |accessdate=July 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tie-in]] video game ''[[Tron: Evolution]]'', which is set between the events of ''Tron'' and ''Tron: Legacy'', features light cycles in sections of the single-player mode and in certain game maps for the multiplayer mode.  Light cycle use in multiplayer gives players the option to shift back and forth between cycle and foot travel at will, and provides multiple attack and defensive options beyond the classic "boxing in" of an opponent. In addition, the light cycles of ''Evolution'' can pass through their own light trails (and the trails of allied players) unharmed.

A more classic interpretation of the lightcycle game is shown in the Wii-Game ''[[Tron: Evolution - Battle Grids]]'', which is primarily based on offline multiplayer or singleplayer matches. These lightcycle battles don't allow the player to pass through his own trail but do allow passage through teammates' trails. There is also no option to travel on foot.

A vehicle within ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'', the X-2 Phantom, is actually based upon a Light Cycle, with a slight variation as it bears a Purple theme.

A motorcycle introduced for ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'''s ''Bikers'' update, the ''Shotaro'', heavily resembles a Light Cycle, with its name acting as an allusion to the 1988 Anime film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|AKIRA]]''.

==Online voice casting==
There has been a shift to online voice over casting in recent years. With many professional voice talent utilizing home studios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterdrewvo.com/html/home_voiceover_studio.html|title=Home Voiceover Studios-Equipping Yours-Peter Drew Voiceovers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; clients are able to cut out traditional bricks and mortar agents. Websites devoted exclusively to pre-screened professional voice over talent are servicing international clients often faster and cheaper than the traditional casting process of voice talent physically being required to be in a studio.
