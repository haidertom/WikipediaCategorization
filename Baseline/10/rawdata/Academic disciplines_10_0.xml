{{Redirect|A. B.|other uses|AB (disambiguation)}}


A '''Bachelor of Arts''' ('''BA''' or '''AB''', from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|baccalaureus artium}}'' or ''{{lang|la|artium baccalaureus}}'') is a [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] course or program in either the [[liberal arts education|liberal arts]], sciences, or both. Bachelor of Arts programs generally take three to four years depending on the country, institution, and specific specializations, majors, or minors. The word ''{{lang|la|baccalaureus}}'' (from the Latin ''{{lang|la|bacca}}'', a berry, and ''{{lang|la|laureus}}'', "of the [[bay laurel]]") should not be confused with ''{{lang|la|baccalaureatus}}'' (translatable as "gold-plated [[sceptre|scepter]]" by using the Latina ''{{lang|la|bacum}}'' and ''{{lang|la|aureatus}}''), which refers to the one- to two-year postgraduate ''Bachelor of Arts [[honors degree|with Honors]]'' degree (''{{lang|la|Baccalaureatus in Artibus Cum Honore}}'') in some countries.

[[Diploma]]s generally give the name of the institution, signatures of officials of the institution (generally the president or rector of the [[university]] as well as the secretary or dean of the component [[college]]), type of degree conferred, conferring authority, and location at which the degree is conferred. Diplomas generally are printed on high-quality [[paper]] or [[parchment]]; individual institutions set the preferred abbreviation for their degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvard.edu/degree-abbreviations An Explanation of Degree Abbreviations - Harvard University Commencement]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Bachelor of Arts is usually attained in four years in [[Afghanistan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Armenia]], [[Kenya]], [[Canada]], [[Greece]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Lithuania]], [[Nigeria]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Russia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[South Korea]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Turkey]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[United States]], and most of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uta.fi/FAST/US5/REF/gpa.html FAST-US-5 United States Education Reference File&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Degree attainment generally takes three years in nearly all of the [[European Union]] and [[Albania]], [[Australia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[New Zealand]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Singapore]], [[the Caribbean]], [[South Africa]], [[Switzerland]] and the Province of [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]]. In [[Pakistan]], the Bachelor of Arts can also be attained within two years as an ''[[external degree]].''

==Australia, Canada, India, Nepal, New Zealand, South Africa==
In colleges and universities in Australia, New Zealand, [[Nepal]] and South Africa, the BA degree can be taken over three years of full-time study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cass.anu.edu.au/node/144 Bachelor of Arts degrees] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401072859/http://cass.anu.edu.au/node/144 |date=2010-04-01 }}, [[Australian National University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Students must pursue at least one [[academic major|major]] area of study, and units from that subject are usually studied in each year, though sometimes students may choose to complete upper-level classes in the same year and as a result, can leave space for elective subjects from a different field. At some universities students may choose to pursue a second major; alternatively, the remainder of the degree is taken up with a minor area of study (in the first two years) and other individual or stream-based subjects make up the degree.

Unlike in other countries, students do not receive an overall grade for their Bachelor of Arts degree with varying levels of honours ("honours" is a distinction but not part of the degree itself). Qualified students may be admitted, after they have achieved their (general) Bachelor's program with a high overall grade point average, to a further one year Bachelor (with) Honours degree program (''(with) Honours'' is part of the degree itself). Thus, to achieve a Bachelor (with) Honours degree (abbr. e.g. BA (Hons.) or BA hons.), an extra "[[postgraduate]]" year and a high research honour's thesis must be completed; see [[Honours Degree]]s. A student who holds a (with) Honours degree is eligible for direct entry to either a Doctorate (Ph.D.) or a very high research master's degree program.

Education in [[Canada]] is controlled by the Provinces and can be very different depending on the province in Canada.  Canadian universities typically offer a 4-year Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees. In many universities and colleges, Bachelor of Arts degrees are differentiated either as Bachelors of Arts or as honours Bachelor of Arts degree. The term "Honours" is an academic distinction, which indicates that students must achieve their Bachelor of Arts degree with a sufficiently high overall grade point average; in addition, some programs may require more education than non-honours programs.

The honours degrees are sometimes designated with the abbreviation in brackets of '(Hon(s))'. It should not be confused with the consecutive [[honours degree|Bachelor of Arts degree "with Honours"]], Latin "Baccalaureatus in Artibus Cum Honore", abbr. 'BA hon.' ''de jure'' without brackets and with a dot. It is a "postgraduate" degree. Going back in history, a three-year Bachelor of Arts degree (also known e.g. in Québec as grade de bachelier ès arts) was also called a ''pass degree'' or ''general degree''.

A student who first achieves a general Bachelor of Arts degree with a sufficiently high overall average may be admitted to a "postgraduate" Baccalaureatus cum Honore degree in the same field; it requires a minimum of one year but may also take longer; it typically does not exceed two years. Students may be required to undertake a long high-quality research empirical thesis (Honours Seminar Thesis) combined with a selection of courses from the relevant field of studies. The consecutive B. cum Honore degree is essential if students ultimate goal is to study towards a two- or three-year very high research master's degree qualification. A student holding a Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree also may choose to complete a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program without the requirement to first complete a master's degree. Over the years, in some universities certain Baccalaureatus cum Honore programs have been changed to corresponding master's degrees.

In general, in all four countries, the B.A. degree is the standard required for entry into  a [[Master of Arts|master's]] programme. In science, a BA hons degree is generally a prerequisite for entrance to a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] program or a very-high-research-activity master's programme. As such, for example the UK awarded ''honours'' are designed and should not be confused with Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and South African awarded BA hons/BA (Hons) degree.

For further clarification, in other countries the so-called ''honours'' bachelor may not be an actual degree, but the name of a (vocational) programme which can be completed through specified course work, a high grade average, and the completion of possibly a short paper or project; students who completed such a ''honours'' BA programme sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' after the degree abbreviation without a space, in parentheses and after the 'Hon(s)' without a dot, for example 'B.A.(Hon)'. The 3 and 4 year B.A. degree is also accepted for entry into graduate professional programmes such as [[LLB#Structure of LL.B. programmes|law]] or a [[M.B.A.|Master of Business Administration]] program.

==Netherlands / Europe==
In the [[Netherlands]], the Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees were introduced in 2002. Until then there was a single program which led to the [[doctorandus]] degree. This comprised the same course load as the Bachelor and Master programs combined. The title ''doctorandus'' was used in almost all fields of study; other titles were used for legal studies (''meester'', Dutch for master, abbreviated ''Mr.'') and engineering (''[[ingenieur]]''). Those who had already started the doctorandus program could, on completing it, opt for the doctorandus degree (entitling them to use "Drs." in front of their name), or could use the master's degree (post-nominal letters) in accordance with the new standard.
A similar practice has been introduced in other EU countries, according to the [[Bologna Process]].

==Germany==
In Germany, university-level education usually happens in either a ''Universität'' (plural: ''Universitäten'') or a ''[[Fachhochschule]]'' (plural: ''Fachhochschulen''); both can be referred to as a ''Hochschule'', which is the generic term in Germany for all institutions awarding academic degrees. Fachhochschule is often translated as "University of Applied Sciences". Universitäten place greater emphasis on fundamental science and theoretical background, while Fachhochschulen are generally designed with a focus on teaching professional skills. Degrees earned at Universitäten and Fachhochschulen are legally equivalent.

In Germany, the B.A. normally lasts between 3 and 3 ½ years – 6 or 7 semesters – and is awarded after the student earns between 180 and 210 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]].

==United Kingdom and Ireland==
{{Main|British undergraduate degree classification}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] (excluding [[Scotland]]) and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the first degree course normally lasts three years, but nomenclature varies: 19th-century and later universities usually distinguish between arts and sciences subjects by awarding either a B.A. or B.Sc. degree. However, some older or [[ancient universities]], such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and [[University of Dublin|Dublin]] traditionally award B.A.s to undergraduates having completed the final examinations, e.g. Part II [[Tripos]] (Cambridge), Final Honour Schools (Oxford), Moderatorship (Dublin), in most subjects including the sciences. Some new [[plate glass university|plate glass universities]] established in the 1960s, such as [[University of York|York]] and [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] originally followed the practice of Oxford and Cambridge by awarding B.A.s in all subjects, but have since changed to awarding B.Sc. degrees in science subjects. At Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin the degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] can be claimed, usually 21 terms after [[matriculation]]. For many centuries, the bachelor's degree was an intermediate step and was awarded for much of the work carried out in later times at secondary schools. The names of the final secondary school exams in France and Spain (and increasingly in the UK—the [[International Baccalaureate]]) come from this: le [[Baccalauréat]] and el ''Bachillerato'', respectively.

The [[Ancient Universities of Scotland]] award a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degree to humanities or arts graduates, but a B.Sc. to science graduates. This course takes four years for an honours degree and three for an ordinar.  In Scotland, it is possible to opt to take an ordinary degree rather than this simply ranking below a third class honours (for example, B.A. with distinction, merit or pass).

A Bachelor of Arts is entitled to the designation B.A. for an ordinary/pass degree and B.A. (Hons) for an honours degree. Students who completed an honours B.A. sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' or '(Hons)' after the degree abbreviation in parentheses. An honours degree is always awarded in one of four classes depending upon the marks gained in the final assessments and examinations. The top students are awarded a first-class degree, followed by an upper second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:1), a lower second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:2), and those with the lowest marks gain a third-class degree. An ordinary or unclassified degree (which does not give the graduate the right to add '(Hons)') may be awarded if a student has completed the full honours degree course but has not obtained the total required passes sufficient to merit a third-class honours degree. Typically these degrees lack the last year requirement of a dissertation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="110620">'''Bahá'í studies''' refers to the scholarly study of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], its [[Bahá'í teachings|teachings]], [[History of the Bahá'í Faith|history]] and [[Bahá'í literature|literature]].  Bahá'í studies are currently conducted in a variety of venues, including institutes of the [[Bahá'í administration]] as well as non-affiliated universities.  Some scholars study some aspect of the Bahá'í Faith as part of research on related matters while others engage in Bahá'í studies as a primary focus of their research. Scholars' comments on the religion and its predecessor [[Bábism]] date back to the at least 1845, the year after its founding. Initially they were often [[Orientalism|Orientalist]]s or [[Christian missionaries]] but through time both Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'í researchers have addressed the religion especially in tune with the [[Growth of religion#Bahá'í Faith|growth of the religion]], which has been called significant.

==Bahá'í review==
{{main|Bahá'í review}}
Bahá'í scholars who are also members of the faith must submit their work for [[Bahá'í review|review]] by the [[Bahá'í administration]] and obtain prior approval. According to the administration of the religion, the purpose of the review is threefold:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lights of Guidance|page=101|url=http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance.html&amp;chapter=2|editor=Helen Hornby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* To ensure the accuracy of the presentation of the teachings of the religion
* To protect the religion from misrepresentation by its own followers
* To ensure dignity of the form

[[Juan Cole]], a former Bahá'í who had disagreements with the Bahá'í administration on account of the [[Bahá'í review|review]] describes it as "a system of in-house censorship" which "has provoked many conflicts between Bahá'í officials and writers over the years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first= Juan R.I. | authorlink = Juan Cole | last2= |first2= |date= June 1998 |title= The Baha’i Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963-1997 | url= http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/1999/jssr/bhjssr.htm |journal= The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |publisher= |volume= 37 |issue= 2 |pages= |doi= |access-date= September 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several conflicts originating from the practice of review, and a number of prominent academics, including [[Juan Cole]], [[Denis MacEoin]] and [[Abbas Amanat]], have either been excommunicated or forced to resign due to academic disagreements with the religious hierarchy.

A '''bioassay''' is an analytical method to determine concentration or potency of a substance by its effect on living cells or tissues.&lt;ref name="Hoskins 437–464"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoskins|first=W. M.|last2=Craig|first2=R.|date=1962-01-01|title=Uses of Bioassay in Entomology|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.en.07.010162.002253|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=437–464|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.07.010162.002253|issn=0066-4170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioassays were used to estimate the potency of agents by observing their [[animal testing|effects on living animals]] (in vivo) or tissues (in vitro).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A bioassay experiment can either be qualitative or quantitative, direct or indirect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laska|first=E M|last2=Meisner|first2=M J|date=1987-04-01|title=Statistical Methods and Applications of Bioassay|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.pa.27.040187.002125|journal=Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology|volume=27|issue=1|pages=385–397|doi=10.1146/annurev.pa.27.040187.002125|issn=0362-1642}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the measured response is binary, the assay is qualititative, if not, it is quantitative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is also used to assess the environmental impact and safety of new technologies and facilities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Principle ==
Bioassay is a biochemical test to estimate the relative potency of a sample compound to a standard compound.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoskins 437–464"/&gt; Typical bioassay involves a ''stimulus'' (ex. drugs) applied to a ''subject'' (ex. animals, tissues, plants) and a ''response'' (ex. death) of the subject is triggered and measured.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The intensity of stimulus is varied by doses and depending on this intensity of stimulus, a change/response will be followed by a subject.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== History ==
The first uses of bioassay dates back to as early as the late 19th century, when the foundation of bioassays was laid down by a German physician, Paul Ehrlich.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He introduced the concept of standardization by the reactions of living matter.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Noordwijk|first=Jacobus|title=Bioassays in whole animals|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0731708589800779|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis|volume=7|issue=2|pages=139–145|doi=10.1016/0731-7085(89)80077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design and Analysis for Bioassays|last=Saha|first=G. M|date=29 November 2002|publisher=Indian Statistical Institute|year=|isbn=|location=Kolkata|pages=61–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; His bioassay on diphtheria antitoxin was the first bioassay to receive recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9682930|title=Analysis of foods and beverages : modern techniques|date=1984|publisher=Academic Press|others=Charalambous, George, 1922-1994.|isbn=0121691608|location=Orlando|oclc=9682930}}&lt;/ref&gt; His use of bioassay was able to disocover that administration of gradually increasing dose of diphteria in animals stimulated production of antiserum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosch|first=F&amp;egrave;lix|last2=Rosich|first2=Laia|date=2008|title=The Contributions of Paul Ehrlich to Pharmacology: A Tribute on the Occasion of the Centenary of His Nobel Prize|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/149583|journal=Pharmacology|language=english|volume=82|issue=3|pages=171–179|doi=10.1159/000149583|issn=0031-7012|pmc=2790789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the early bioassays consisted of using animals to test carcinogenicity of chemicals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beyer|first=L. A.|last2=Beck|first2=B. D.|last3=Lewandowski|first3=T. A.|date=2011-04-01|title=Historical perspective on the use of animal bioassays to predict carcinogenicity: Evolution in design and recognition of utility|url=https://doi.org/10.3109/10408444.2010.541222|journal=Critical Reviews in Toxicology|volume=41|issue=4|pages=321–338|doi=10.3109/10408444.2010.541222|issn=1040-8444}}&lt;/ref&gt; One well known example is a "canary in the coal mine" experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ei.cornell.edu/toxicology/bioassays/Uses.html|title=Environmental Inquiry - How Are Bioassays Used in the Real World?|website=ei.cornell.edu|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; To test for methane, miners would take methane-sensitive canaries to coal mines to ensure safe air. In 1915, [[Yamagiwa Katsusaburō|Yamaigiwa Katsusaburo]] and Koichi Ichikawa tested the carcinogenicity of coal tar using inner surface of rabbit's ears.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Through 1940s and 1960s, animal bioassay was primarily used to test for toxicity and safety of drugs, food additives and pesticides.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In late 1960s and 1970s, reliance on bioassay increased as the public concern for occupational and environmental hazards increased.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While before this health risks of certain chemicals such as pesticide was tested in animal bioassay, it was still rare and testing was not seen often.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Classifications ==

=== Direct assay ===
- The stimulus/standard sufficiently produces measurable and specific response.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The response must be clear, easily recognized, and directly measured.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Indirect assay based on quantitative response ===
- The relationship between the dose and the response is first ascertained.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Then the dose corresponding to a given response is obtained from the relation for each preparation separately.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Indirect assay based on quantal response ===
- The assay involves 'all or none' response (ex. life or death).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The response is produced by threshold effect.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== [[ELISA]] (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) ===
- quantitative analytical method that measures absorbance of color change from antigen-antibody reaction (ex. Direct, indirect, sandwich, competitive).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aydin|first=Suleyman|title=A short history, principles, and types of ELISA, and our laboratory experience with peptide/protein analyses using ELISA|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S019697811500131X|journal=Peptides|volume=72|pages=4–15|doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2015.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ELISA is used to measure variety of substances in human body from cortisol levels for stress to glucose level for diabetes.

=== Home pregnancy test ===
Home pregnancy test involves ELISA to detect the increase of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/897825792|title=Bioanalytical chemistry.|others=Manz, A.

[[File:Cotton boll opening following defoliation during the 2010 crop year. (24821524380).jpg|thumb|281x281px|Defoliants are used as an aid in the harvesting of certain crops such as cotton.]]

A '''defoliant''' is any [[Herbicide|herbicidal]] chemical sprayed or dusted on plants to cause their [[Leaf|leaves]] to fall off. Defoliants are widely used for the selective removal of weeds in managing croplands and lawns. Worldwide use of defoliants, along with the development of other herbicides and [[Pesticide|pesticides]], allowed for the [[Green Revolution]], an increase in agricultural production in mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invention of Ecocide|last=Zierler|first=David|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=2011|isbn=9786613110404|location=Athens, Georgia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoliants have also been used in warfare as a means to deprive an enemy of food crops and/or hiding cover, most notably by the [[United States]] [[Agent Orange|in the Vietnam War]].

== Use and application ==
A primary application of defoliants is the selective killing of plants. Two of the oldest chemical [[Herbicide|herbicides]] used as defoliants are [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D) and [[2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T). 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are absorbed by broad-leafed plants, killing them by causing excessive hormonal growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These [[Phenoxy herbicide|phenoxy herbicides]] were designed to selectively kill weeds and unwanted plants in croplands. They were first introduced at the beginning of [[World War II]] and became widespread in use in agriculture following the end of the War.

Defoliants have a practical use in the harvesting of certain crops, particularly [[cotton]], in the [[United States]] as well as a number of other cotton-producing countries. The use of defoliants aids in the effective harvesting of cotton and finer lint quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snipes|first=Charles E.|last2=Cathey|first2=George W.|date=1992|title=Evaluation of defoliant mixtures in cotton|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0378429092900185|journal=Field Crops Research|volume=28|issue=4|pages=327–334|doi=10.1016/0378-4290(92)90018-5|issn=0378-4290|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of defoliant use in cotton harvesting depends on the type of defoliant(s) used, the number of applications, the amount applied, and environmental variables. Common harvest-aiding chemical defoliants include tribufos, dimethipin, and [[thidiazuron]]. According to a 1998 report by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] [[National Agricultural Statistics Service]] (NASS), tribufos and thidiazuron accounted for 60% of crop area that was treated by defoliants during that crop year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=Thomas L.|last2=Marti|first2=Luz|last3=Belflower|first3=Sally|last4=Truman|first4=Clint C.|date=2000|title=Multiresidue Analysis of Cotton Defoliant, Herbicide, and Insecticide Residues in Water by Solid-Phase Extraction and GC−NPD, GC−MS, and HPLC−Diode Array Detection|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf9909104|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|language=en|volume=48|issue=9|pages=4103–4108|doi=10.1021/jf9909104|issn=0021-8561|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASS (1999). ''Agricultural Chemical Usage 1998 Field Crops Summary''. Washington, D.C.: U. S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics and Economic Research Service. pg 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health and environmental effects ==
In 1998, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (U.S. EPA) concluded that the use of agricultural defoliants led to increased risks of water contamination and dangers to freshwater and [[marine life]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; High doses of tribufos were labeled as a possible [[carcinogen]] and a toxin to freshwater and marine [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]]. Dimethipin has also been labeled as a possible human carcinogen.

A published study in the ''Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry'' reported that through successive [[surface runoff]] events in defoliated cotton fields, defoliant concentrations decreased exponentially within the test area and could negatively affect marine life in the runoff zones.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Agent Orange]], a defoliant used by the U.S. Military during the [[Vietnam War]] to defoliate regions of Vietnam from 1961 to 1971,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3798581.stm|title=Vietnam's war against Agent Orange|author=Tow Fawthrop|date=June 14, 2004|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/news_articles/agent_orange_linked_skin_cancer_risk-128602|title=Agent Orange Linked To Skin Cancer Risk|work=Science 2.0|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been linked to several long-term health issues. Agent Orange contains a mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T as well as [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxin]] contaminants. Members of the Air Force Ranch Hand and the [[Chemical Corps|Army Chemical Corps]] who served in the [[Vietnam War]] were occupationally exposed to [[Agent Orange]] have a higher incidence of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and chronic respiratory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kang|first=Han K.|last2=Dalager|first2=Nancy A.|last3=Needham|first3=Larry L.|last4=Patterson|first4=Donald G.|last5=Lees|first5=Peter S.J.|last6=Yates|first6=Katherine|last7=Matanoski|first7=Genevieve M.|date=2006|title=Health status of Army Chemical Corps Vietnam veterans who sprayed defoliant in Vietnam|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajim.20385|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|language=en|volume=49|issue=11|pages=875–884|doi=10.1002/ajim.20385|issn=0271-3586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital rhetoric''' is a way of informing, persuading, and inspiring action in an audience through [[digital media]]. It is an advancing form of communication composed, created, and distributed through [[multimedia]] platforms. [[Rhetoric]] combines multiple methods such as [[persuasion]], effective writing, and effective speaking to present information in inventive ways.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, G. (n.d.). What is Rhetoric? Retrieved December 3, 2014, from [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/encompassing%20terms/rhetoric.htm What is Rhetoric?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105226/http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/rhetoric.htm |date=2014-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of rhetoric has changed over time, developing with changes in technologies. Online media are increasingly used as communication and information platforms, and since more text is placed online, there is more opportunity for persuasion through innovative and creative means. Because of this shift in rhetoric, the relationship between writers and readers has changed in form, communication style, and effectiveness. Digital rhetoric is advancing and changing how people choose to communicate their ideas with broader audiences. Both rhetoric and digital rhetoric hold various meanings and definitions depending upon who is looking at it; for example, the online journal ''[http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot Harlot of the Arts]'' holds a competition through Twitter for people to define rhetoric, and the submissions are extremely varied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot/article/view/242/153/|title=#DefineRhetoric 2014|work=Harlot of the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Definition===

The term digital rhetoric was coined by [[rhetoric]]ian Richard A. Lanham in his 1993 essay collection, ''The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo3661152.html|title=The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts|author=Lanham, R. A.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1994|isbn=9780226468853}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, rhetorician [[Elizabeth Losh]]&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[http://losh.ucsd.edu/ Elizabeth Losh]&lt;/ref&gt; offered this four-part definition of digital rhetoric in her book, ''Virtualpolitik'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Losh, E.|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/virtualpolitik|title=Virtualpolitik|year=2009|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262123044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The conventions of new digital genres that are used for everyday discourse, as well as for special occasions, in average people's lives.
# [[Public rhetoric]],  often in the form of political messages from government institutions, is represented or recorded through digital technology and disseminated via electronically distributed networks.
#  The emerging scholarly discipline concerned with the rhetorical interpretation of computer-generated media as objects of study.
# Mathematical theories of communication from the field of information science, many of which attempt to quantify the amount of uncertainty in a given linguistic exchange or the likely paths through which messages travel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Losh|first1=Elizabeth|title=Virtualpolitik: An Electronic History of Government Media-Making in a Time of War, Scandal, Disaster, Miscommunication, and Mistakes|date=2009|publisher=MIT|pages=47–48|url=http://gossettphd.org/library/losh_hackingaristotle.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023101108/http://gossettphd.org/library/losh_hackingaristotle.pdf|archivedate=23 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Losh's definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric is a heterodoxical field, one that relies on different methods to study various permutations of information: as code, as text, as visuals, as videos, and so on.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Though influenced by Lanham and Losh, Douglas Eyman also offers a definition of digital rhetoric in his 2015 book ''Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice'': “... the application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/13030181.0001.001/1:5/--digital-rhetoric-theory-method-practice?g=dculture;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;xc=1|title=Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice|last=Eyman|first=Douglas|date=2015|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472052684|language=en|doi=10.3998/dh.13030181.0001.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|44}} Eyman’s definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric can be applied in two ways: 1) as an analytic method, digital rhetoric can be used to analyze a digital text, and 2) as a heuristic for production. It offers rhetorical questions that a composer can use to create digital texts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Eyman locates the emerging field of digital rhetoric as interdisciplinary in nature, enriched by related fields such as, but not limited to: [[digital literacy]], visual rhetoric, new media, human-computer interaction and critical code studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|45}}

===Scope of influence===
As the power of technology grows, so too do the uses and scope of digital rhetoric. This includes schools offering online classes and test-taking, online news sources including scholarly journals and online editions of newspapers, and people searching for information online rather than consult a more traditional means such as an [[encyclopedia]]. Teachers can use [[podcast]]s, YouTube videos, and [[social media]] sites like Facebook and LinkedIn to facilitate discussions and increase students' interest in a topic. In addition, they can make use of distance learning modules, as a form of online teaching. In academia, online journals allow for information to be more accessible due to the use of digital rhetoric. Writers also have more opportunities to write in various formats instead of a traditional linear format. In social media, people come into contact with digital rhetoric on a daily basis whether it be an updated Facebook status, a 140 character tweet, or even the use of [[visual rhetoric]] on websites such as Instagram. Social media is being used universally to allow for people to connect from all places. The choice of one's rhetoric can influence and alter other peoples opinions and thoughts on certain subjects impacting the ideology of collective identity vs. individual identities.&lt;ref name="Sparby"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sparby|first=Erika|date=April 2018|title=Digital Social Media and Aggression: Memetic Rhetoric in 4chan’s Collective Identity|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S8755461516300810|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scope of influence that digital rhetoric obtains can also be seen in commercial branding and politics.

====Education====
The urge for digital rhetoric to be introduced to classrooms is the fact that in the era of Web 2.0, quite a proportion of school managements and instructors stick to the traditional rhetoric and resist the pervasiveness of technology. For the first time, the knowledge taught at and the methods employed by the academia are far behind the social and cultural advancement, rather than leading it. As Clark (2010) argues, "...the traditional essayistic literacy ... needs to be replaced by an intentional pedagogy of digital rhetoric that emphasizes the civic importance of education...".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=J. Elizabeth|date=2010|title=The Digital Imperative: Making the Case for a 21st-Century Pedagogy|url=|journal=Computers and Composition: An International Journal for Teachers of Writing|volume=27|pages=27–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In universities, courses on digital rhetoric are taught at the graduate and undergraduate level as courses in English, Communication, and Media Studies departments. Courses in digital rhetoric study the interactions between users and digital texts, as well as how different backgrounds such as age, ethnicity, gender and more can affect these interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=Teaching Digital Rhetoric: Community, Critical Engagement, and Application|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/197069/pdf|journal=Pedagogy|volume= 6| issue =  2|pages=231–259|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; By studying digital rhetoric in this way, students are able to better understand the uses and purpose of digital rhetoric in the modern world.

Scholars like Jeff Grabill contribute to the use of digital rhetoric by pushing for its use in the classroom. Grabill embraces the age of technology and encourages his contemporaries to do so as well. His backgrounds in English, education, and technology and work in those fields make him a gateway between the scholarly field of digital rhetoric and its implementation. Another scholar, Cheryl Ball,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ceball.com/ Cheryl Ball]&lt;/ref&gt; specializes in areas that consist of [[wikt:multimodal|multimodal]] composition and editing practices, digital media scholarship, and digital publishing. She also focuses on university writing [[pedagogy]]. Ball teaches people to write and compose multimodal texts by analyzing rhetorical options and choosing the most appropriate genres, technologies, media, and modes for a particular situation. During her own education, Ball made significant advances in the digital rhetoric field by completing her school's first electronic and interactive thesis. She also received tenure at another university using the first all-digital tenure portfolio. For her undergraduate course, Clark created and employed a set of practices, including ePortfolios, digital stories, online games, ''Second Life,'' and blogs. In doing so, she managed to "engage(s) students in the interactivity, collaboration, ownership, authority, and malleability of texts".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In another approach, Douglas Eyman recommends a course in web authoring and design that provides undergraduates more practical instruction in the production and rhetorical understanding of digital texts. Moreover, he explains that web authoring and design for digital rhetoric instruction provides opportunities for students to learn fundamentals of web writing and design conventions, rules and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Digital rhetoric: Theory, Method, and Practice|last1=Eyman|first=Douglas|first2=|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-472-07268-2|location=|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention to multimodality has &amp;nbsp;also influenced ''Understanding Rhetoric: A Graphic Guide to Writing''  by Elizabeth Losh and Alexander Jonathan, which emphasized engaging the comic form of literacy.

Digital rhetoric pedagogy has been further developed in the secondary level of education due to support at the university level. This allows for students to create and edit projects simultaneously through the internet. Collaboration is seen as one of the biggest advantages to digital rhetoric, as it gives students and teachers the ability to collaborate and critique anywhere anytime. By being educated in various forms of technology, students are exposed to a more multimodal world and teachers foster a more well-rounded learning environment. Through digital writing, students have a broader choice of composing to fit their needs.  Students can have people see their work anywhere, which reflects the accessibility of social media that students are used to in their everyday lives.

==== Politics ====
The increase in [[Digitization|digitalization]] of media has amplified the importance of digital rhetoric in politics as it has introduced a new relationship between politicians and the citizenry. Digital communication platforms and social networking sites (SNS) are means of allowing citizens to share information and engage in debate with other people of similar or distinct political ideologies. The topics and ideas communicated through digital rhetoric have been shown to influence and predict the political behavior of individuals outside the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;Itai Himelboim , Ruthann Weaver Lariscy , Spencer F. Tinkham &amp; Kaye D.Sweetser (2012) Social Media and Online Political Communication: The Role of Interpersonal informational Trust and Openness, Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, 56:1, 92-93, DOI:10.1080/08838151.2011.6486821&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians have been known to use digital rhetoric as a tool to communicate information to the citizens. Likewise, digital rhetoric  has enabled  increasing political participation. Theoretical political research on digital rhetoric has attributed to the increase of political participation to three models; these include the motivation model, learning model, and attitude model. In 2008, the first wide scale political campaign through Twitter was utilized by President Obama. This success is measured in the over half a billion dollars raised through the internet. This use of social media has become a large asset for all political candidates and is currently utilized by all. The 2016 elections brought social media to the forefront and all presidential candidates utilized different forms of persuasion in their 140 character tweets.

* The motivation model proposes that digital rhetoric has decreased the opportunity costs of participating in politics since it makes information readily available to the people. 
* The learning model established the increase in political participation to the vast amount of political information available in the internet which increases the inclusion of the citizens in the political process. 
* The attitude model extended from the previous two by suggesting that digital rhetoric has changed the perception of citizens towards politics, particularly by providing interactive tools that allow people to engage in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Liang|last1=Jiang|title=Why context matters: the role of campaign context in the relationship between digital media use and political participation|journal=[[Australian Journal of Political Science]]|volume=52|number=4|pages=580–598|doi=10.1080/10361146.2017.1373064|date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media incorporates numerous characteristics of interactions between people in the public sphere. Social media is not  characterized as an ideal public sphere because it fails to provide equitable access to information and participation for women and minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Lisa M.|last1=Kruse|first2=Dawn R.|last2=Norris|first3=Jonathan R.|last3=Flinchum|title=Social Media as a Public Sphere?

These firms have influenced the political process by providing strategic information about people [[demographics]], behaviors, attitudes, and interests, all of which have increased the efficiency of political discourse — especially for political campaigns. In 2013, Twitter released a manual targeted towards politicians that outlined the main features of their platform and how they can be used to increase political communications. In 2018, Facebook devoted $62,500 dollars to create a space for politicians to learn ways in which they can use digital rhetoric in Facebook to increase the impact of there campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Daniel|last1=Kreiss|first2=Shannon C.|last2=McGregor|title=Technology Firms Shape Political Communication: The Work of Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, and Google With Campaigns During the 2016 U.S. Presidential Cycle|journal=[[Political Communication (journal)|Political Communication]]|volume=35|issue=2|pages=156–157|doi=10.1080/10584609.2017.1364814|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steir conducted a study to analyze the different types of rhetoric that took place in social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter; during the 2013 election campaign for the German [[Bundestag]], he found that the types  of information that politicians share on both platforms varied — Facebook was found to be the preferred medium for campaign rhetoric while Twitter was mostly utilized for rhetoric regarding political debates, infrastructure discussions, and  law and order.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Stier, Arnim Bleier, Haiko Lietz &amp; Markus Strohmaier (2018) Election Campaigning on Social Media: Politicians, Audiences, and the Mediation of Political Communication on Facebook and Twitter, Political Communication, 35:1, 50-74, DOI: 10.1080/10584609.2017.1334728&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Trump often lacks factual references and has bombastic language that leads to a heavy emphasis on emotional rhetoric. Majority of his tweets lack factual basis that can withstand empirical verification.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McConnell|first=Stephen J.|date=December 2015|title=TWITTER AND THE 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: A RHETORICAL ANALYSIS OF TWEETS AND MEDIA COVERAGE|url=http://sjmcconnell.com/donaldtrumptwitter/|journal=New York University, Master's Thesis|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If taken a position the language used is vague and abstract. Nearly a quarter of Trump's tweets are Ad Hominem. Mostly, utilizing pathos Trump's twitter is now a major play in the world of politics.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Bernie Sanders uses Twitter in response to political events, issues, or fact. 82% of Sanders tweets state a position.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Through these position-based tweets he also makes claim of "values" of himself, his political party, or Americans. While values are not a truth, they are considered a pseudo-truth. These blend together the strong uses of logos as well as pathos.

Hillary Clinton's tweets are mainly driven by facts, logos. This increases the validation through empirical means. Her tweets are written with direct reference to evidence or concrete situation. However, can contain ambiguous language that makes the merit of degree of truth less clear. Clinton also lacks emotive language in her messages, sticking only to the facts.

Jeb Bush employs rhetoric that is mainly fact oriented, with occasional ambiguity. Bush mostly Tweets with ethos through pseudo-concepts. Unlike other candidates, he makes moral statements. Bush's rhetoric mixes logos, pathos, and ethos.

[[Digital media]] has increased its domination of the political sphere, especially with social media. [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Instagram]] have become a significant part of the political engagement process with regard to elections, campaigns, or elected officials trying to connect with their constituencies. Social media globalizes communication. Especially political communication, fostering discussions and connecting communities as it reaches a significant amount of people.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Wendy|last2=Tinati|first2=Ramine|last3=Jennings|first3=Will|date=2018-01-05|title=From Brexit to Trump: Social Media’s Role in Democracy|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8267982/|journal=Computer|language=en-US|volume=51|issue=1|pages=18–27|doi=10.1109/mc.2018.1151005|issn=0018-9162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst all of these outlets, Twitter is the form of social media that’s primarily used by candidates running for public office, elected officials, and government agencies.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

* Currently, in the 115th Congress, 428 out of 435 members of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] have Twitter.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2017-05-23-congress-seed-list|title=A List of Twitter Handles for Members of Congress|work=Social Feed Manager|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On the [[United States Senate|Senate]] side, all 100 members are active on Twitter.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Members of Congress use Twitter, and other forms of social media, to connect with their constituency. Members use social media to convey their stances on important issues, bills they have sponsored or have positions on. They use it to post about events they are hosting and the work they do in Congress. This includes meetings with constituents in Washington and back in their districts. According to former [[George Miller (California politician)|Congressman George Miller]], Twitter is a mechanism to answer questions from people in his district.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Rolfe Daus|date=December 2012|title=To tweet or not to tweet: Exploring the determinants of early adoption of Twitter by House members in the 111th Congress|journal=The Social Science Journal|volume=49|issue=4|pages=430–438|doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2012.07.002|issn=0362-3319|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[John Culberson|Representative John Culberson]] said he uses Twitter to assist people in engaging themselves in their government.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Many of these sites provide features for people to connect with their elected officials. For example, on Facebook the Town Hall feature connects users with their federal, and state officials. According to [[Pew Research Center|PEW Research center]] 20% of people who use social media have taken advantage of the fact that they can connect very easily with their officials by a simple “like” or “follow.”&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2012/PIP_SocialMediaAndPoliticalEngagement_PDF.pdf|title=Social Media and Political Engagement|last=Rainie, Smith, Schlozman, Brady, Verba|first=Lee, Aaron, Kay Lehman, Henry, Sidney|date=October 2012|website=PEW Research Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In addition, there have also been various trends in the differences of uses between political parties in the United States and their usage of social media. In the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]], when Twitter was still fairly new; over half of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] members of the House of Representatives were active on twitter.
* When it comes to citizens, according to PEW, 32% of conservatives follow their elected officials on Twitter, and 27% of Democrats follow their officials.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/10/19/social-media-and-political-engagement/|title=Social Media and Political Engagement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media has a significant influence on political campaigns. The use of social media helps both candidates and constituents connect with one another. During the 2016 election cycle, candidates would post 5-7 times and would tweet 11-12 times a day.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Christine|date=July 2017|title=Introduction : Social Media, Political Marketing and the 2016 U.S. Election|journal=Journal of Political Marketing|volume=16|issue=3–4|pages=207–211|via=|doi=10.1080/15377857.2017.1345828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For candidates, Facebook brings publicity and enables them to communicate effectively to the voters.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; This information has become very valuable for candidates. One super Political Action Committee that was anti-Trump, spent $9.9 million dollars in digital media. For candidates, social media provides them with a platform to highlight their ideas, and curate what they would like voters to see.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to the PEW research center, 35% of users of social media have taken advantage of sites like Facebook, in getting out to vote.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Therefore, it has become a valuable tool for candidates. In the 2012 reelection campaign for [[Barack Obama|President Obama]], the campaign used over 15 different methods of social media.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This was to reach out to a broader audience. Social media provides a mechanism for candidates to directly engage with society and potential voters. In Romania, during the elections for Mayor in a town called [[Bacău|Bacau]] only 3/10 candidates used Facebook in 2012. In 2016 all of the candidates engaged in the use of social media and Facebook.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

Social media also provided candidates with an insight into predicting the outcome of votes, which are more accurate than normal polling methods.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Social media is a tool for campaigns as it provides an analysis as to the political climate, as well as the levels of engagement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

For potential voters, social media is a way to get information. According to the PEW research center, 44% of the voting population surveyed used social media as a way to get information about the 2016 election.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/14/facts-about-the-changing-digital-news-landscape/|title=10 facts about the changing digital news landscape|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was significantly more than print newspapers at the local and national level. Furthermore, 24% of those surveyed claimed that they directly got information about the election at the national level from the two candidates; [[Donald Trump]], and [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==History==

===Rhetoric to digital rhetoric===
[[Rhetoric]] is defined as the art of [[discourse]], and is the root of digital rhetoric. As technology has changed, so have rhetorical situations. While the five canons of rhetoric&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://maryvican.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/cicero%e2%80%99s-classical-canons-of-rhetoric-their-relevance-and-importance-to-the-corporate-workplace/|title=Cicero's Classical Canons of Rhetoric: Their Relevance and Importance to the Corporate Workplace|date=2008-04-23|website=Mary|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed for oratory print still apply, they are reconfigured to work in new contextual forms like the [[database]], the [[hypertext]], the [[cybertext]], and other [[born-digital]] texts. [[Inventio]]n,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Delagrange, Susan|year=2009|title=Wunderkammer, Cornell, and the Visual Canon of Arrangement|journal=Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy|volume=13|issue=2|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/delagrange/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dispositio|arrangement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yancey, Kathleen Blake|year=2004|title=Looking for sources of coherence in a fragmented world: Notes toward a new assessment design|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=21|issue=1|pages=89–102|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2003.08.024|url=http://rhetcomp.gsu.edu/~bgu/8121/Reading-Yancey.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813015840/http://rhetcomp.gsu.edu/~bgu/8121/Reading-Yancey.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elocutio|style]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brooke, Collin|year=2002|title=''Enculturation: Special Multi-journal Issue on Electronic Publication''|volume=4|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; take on new meanings while [[Pronuntiatio|delivery]]&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; is elevated to new importance, and [[Memoria|memory]] comes to refer to textual forms like search engines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Wysocki|author2=Johndan Johnson-Eilola|author3=Cynthia L.

Ideas evolve as technology evolves, because one way of studying digital rhetoric is to trace the ways that the affordances and constraints of technology "support and enable the transformation of the old rhetoric of persuasion into a new digital rhetoric that encourages self-expression, participation, and creative collaboration".&lt;ref name=Zappen&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zappen, James|title=Digital Rhetoric: Toward an Integrated Theory|year=2005|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=14|issue=3|pages=319–325|url=http://homepages.rpi.edu/~zappenj/Vita/DigitalRhetoric2005.pdf|doi=10.1207/s15427625tcq1403_10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many trace the transformation of old rhetoric into digital rhetoric through the classical rhetorical canons.

===Shift from print to digital===
Dennis Baron states, "The first writing technology was writing itself." While previous writing technologies involved pencils and [[hieroglyphics]], the evolution of communication technology now allows for online and immediate rhetorical conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Baron, D. (n.d.)|title=From Pencils to Pixels: The Stages of Literacy Technology|accessdate=January 1, 2014|publisher=english.illinois.edu|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/faculty/debaron/essays/pencils.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of communicative technologies started with the chisel, then the book, the quill, the [[Greek alphabet]], and the pencil, onto more modern technology such as the computer. The origins of modern computing are to be found in the techno-military context of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=What is Digital Rhetoric?|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebsoslgfgts|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the pencil was originally intended as a marking utensil for builders and is now used for writing, the computer was originally intended to compute advanced math problems, but is now used for word-processing and a myriad of other tasks. Technology continues to modify itself to meet the needs of people; in the case of digital rhetoric, technology has become more prevalent to match people's usage of the Internet and computers, which creates a [[technoculture]]. 
Another scholar who highlights the changing landscape from print to digital is Jay Bolter. He argues that the computer is the most significant development since the start of the alphabetic/print tradition and that digital texts will continue to move print to the "margins of literate culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bolter, J.|year=1991|title=Writing space: The computer, hypertext, and the history of writing|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts==

===Appropriation===
In the digital age most everything is considered appropriation. Scholars pull their information from a myriad of sources and are constantly redefining terms in order to apply them to the digital world. Appropriation carries both positive and negative connotations. In some ways appropriation is a tool that can be used for the reapplication of outdated ideas to make them better. In other ways appropriation is seen as a threat to creative and cultural identities. Social media receives the bulk of this scrutiny due to the lack of education of its users. Most "contributors are often unaware of what they are contributing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reyman, J.|year=2013|title=User Data on the Social Web: Authorship, Agency, and Appropriation|journal=College English, |volume=75|issue=5|pages=513–532|accessdate=November 1, 2014|via=ncte.org|url=http://www.ncte.org/library/NCTEFiles/Resources/Journals/CE/0755-may2013/CE0755User.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which perpetuates the negative connotation. Many scholars in digital rhetoric explore this topic and its effects on society such as Jessica Reyman, Amy Hea, and Johndan Johnson-Eilola.

===Avatar===
James E. Porter defines avatar as a "virtual body".&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt; With developments in technology, there are new ways to present oneself online. This online presentation of one's own identity is an avatar. While scholars such as Beth Kolko hoped for an online world without physical barriers, making it a "realm of ideas", there are still [[social issue]]s, such as [[gender discrimination]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref name="Kolko"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kolko, Beth E.|year=1999|title=Representing bodies in virtual space: The rhetoric of avatar design|journal=Information Society|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177–186|doi=10.1080/019722499128484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beth E. Kolko believes that an idealistic online world would be a "realm of ideas", without definitive factors such as gender, race, or age. Kolko argues that a non-gendered online world would not garner enough attention, because individuals could not relate to each other without [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name="Kolko" /&gt; Victoria Woolums found in a study of the video game World of Warcraft that the gender identity of the avatar affected behaviors of other characters, showing a bias even in a realm where gender identity of an avatar may not be physically accurate to its user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Woolums, V.|date=Fall 2011|title=Gendered Avatar Identity. Kairos|volume=16|issue=1|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/16.1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circulation===
[[Rhetorical circulation|Circulation]] theorizes the ways that texts and discourses move through time and space. Any kind of media can be circulated.  Henry Jenkins "sticky vs. spreadable media" applies to circulation.  Essentially, "sticky" media is media that can be spread. 
A new form of communication is composed, created, and distributed through digital technologies. Explained by Henry Jenkins, there is a shift from distribution to circulation which signals a move toward an increasingly participatory model of culture in which people shape, share, reframe and remix media content in ways not previously possible within the traditional rhetorical elements like print.

"A number of scholars have seen delivery in networked systems as circulation of digital texts, following John Trimbur's (2000) argument that circulation should be re-introduced in writing instruction; however, his definition of circulation is as an element or result of delivery. Trimbur suggests that neglecting delivery has led writing teachers to equate the activity of composing with writing itself and to miss altogether the complex delivery systems through which writing circulates. By privileging composing as the main site of instruction, the teaching of writing has taken up what [[Karl Marx]] calls a "one-sided" view of production and thereby has largely erased the cycle that links the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of writing. This cycle of interlocked moments is what Marx calls circulation. (190)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eyman|first=Douglas|date=2015|title=Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/13030181.0001.001/1:5/--digital-rhetoric-theory-method-practice?g=dculture;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;xc=1|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.3998/dh.13030181.0001.001|via=|isbn=978-0-472-05268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration===
Collaboration in digital rhetoric does not mean a [[collaborative writing|co-authorship]] directly, even though this could be constituted as that as well, but collaboration looks more like an outlet that scholars can share their work and receive feedback as well. Instead of using solely the individual and their work, scholars use each other to spur on each other's ideas and build their concepts upon another. Collaboration takes on a much more broad meaning in terms of content on the internet. Not only does it offer the opportunity for scholars to collaborate with each other, but it also gives readers the chance to share their reactions with creators of content on the internet. In this way, digital rhetoric allows the audience to interact and work with creators of content. In Braun's book "Cultivating Ecologies for Digital Media Work: The case of English studies", she suggests a collaborative work by interdisciplinary scholars.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultivating ecologies for digital media work: The case of English studies|last=Braun|first=Chaterine, C|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Carbondale|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This is scholarship", a digital article published in Kairos 12.3,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=Catherine, C|last2=Gilbert|first2=Kenneth, L|date=|title=This is Scholarship|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/12.3/topoi/braun_gilbert/index.html|journal=Kairos|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the example of collaborative multimedia text by Catherine Braun as a rhetorician and compositionist, and Kenneth Gilbert as an audio-technician. The shared authorship from this work is shown in the editorial process including writing, digital production, display, and design to produce a final piece of a scholarly article in the form of webtext.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Crowdsourcing===
Daren Brabham defines [[Crowdsourcing]] as, "using an online, ... model to leverage the collective intelligence of online communities to serve specific organizational goals."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Brabham, Daren. ''Crowdsourcing''. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;  As a concept within digital rhetoric, it is a utilization of modern technology to collaborate and create collectively. Companies and organizations use crowdsourcing to build creativity, by acquiring information other than what their immediate employees know. However, there are several concerns that come up when crowdsourcing tactics are used. Issues relating to [[Intellectual property|Intellectual Property]] and [[Copyright]] are some of the foremost problems when crowdsourced ideas are used for commercial problems. Because the business did not conceive the idea, terms of use must be clearly set while fielding responses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ethical concerns have been raised as well when engaging in crowdsourcing without a clear set of compensation practices or protections in place to secure personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bashayr|first=A. (Et al.)|date=|title=Legal and Ethical Issues of Crowdsourcing|url=http://www.ijcaonline.org/archives/volume167/number10/alqahtani-2017-ijca-914324.pdf|journal=International Journal of Computer Applications|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delivery===
For the general scholar, the term delivery means the way in which a form of information is conveyed to a particular audience or group of people. These ideas of delivery could mean hearing information spoken at a conference or reading the newspaper. The forms can range from podcasts to videos, pictures to text, or even songs and newspapers. Delivery is the modem in which information is given in order for the topic to be best understood and related to. The term "delivery" is often aligned with the term "performance".  The Forest of Rhetoric states that delivery is not only the fifth canon of rhetoric, but it is also a translation of the word "hypokrisis", or "acting". This Greek word was translated into delivery in the standpoint of spoken or recited information rather than newspapers or essays. Performance of plays, speeches, skits, etc. turns into the delivery of information in the piece being performed or spoken. This is the same as a piece of literature or rhetoric delivering its information through word choice, layout, and structure.&lt;ref name="Burton" /&gt;

===Electracy===
[[Electracy]] is a term developed by Gregory Ulmer describing the emerging digital age.&lt;ref&gt;''Electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print'' —Gregory Ulmer.&lt;/ref&gt; Electracy is often discussed as being in transition, advancing along with digital rhetoric. Electracy explains the full communicative potentials of new electronic media. Electracy is embedded in the approach of digital rhetoric and covers a large paradigm of literacy which is enhanced through Ulmer's idea of 'electracy'. The recent decades observes a sound effect of 'electracy' in the field of digital media. According to Arrayo, "Participatory Compositions begins by exploring the apparatus of electracy in many of its manifestation while focus on the participatory practices found in online video culture. As research suggests the concept of 'electracy' has changed through the very idea of Ulmer who once articulated in the orientation of analogue video that serves rhetorical dimension of &amp;nbsp;'Teletheory'. But his vision of 'electracy' changed by bringing in a more broader literary concept that enterprise writing—coding, hypertext etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Participatory Composition: Video Culture, Writing and Electracy.|last=Arroyo|first=Sarah|publisher=SIU Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0809331468|location=|pages=1–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Kairos ===
''[[Kairos]],'' in the traditional rhetorical canon, is defined as catching the opportune moment. Traditionally, Kairos relates to rhetorical time (versus Kronos, or chronological time). It relates to the occasion and context when a text is written or a speech is given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheard|first=Cynthia|date=1993|title=Kairos and Kenneth Burke's Psychology of Political and Social Communication|url=|journal=College English|volume=55|pages=291–310|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Kairos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aristotles Rhetorical Situation|url=https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/625/03/|accessdate=2018-04-22|first1=Ethan|last1=Sproat|first2=Dana Lynn|last2=Driscoll|first3=Allen|last3=Brizee|date=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the elements of a speech that acknowledge and draw support from the particular setting, time, and place when and where a speech occurs. It is imperative that the speaker knows when and where to place the argument and, if it is appropriate. However, in the digital age, this is changing. Although Aristotle considers Kairos as related to [[ethos]], [[pathos]], and [[logos]],&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; a more modern definition expands that view to include [[Multimodality|multimodal]] texts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Sheridan, Ridolfo, and Michel offer an expanded definition of Kairos that asks rhetors to consider the ramifications of circulation, production and re-production, and distribution of compositions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Kairos has been put on the rhetorical back burner, but has become more theorized in the digital age to discuss the ecology of multimodal texts. Digital scholars like Douglas Eyman, Jim Ridolfo, David Sheridan, Anthony Michel, Ellen Cushman, and Isabel Pedersen are on the forefront of reviving the concept of Kairos and applying its use in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David M. Sheridan|author2=Jim Ridolfo|author3=Anthony J. Michel|lastauthoramp=y|date=March 19, 2012|title=The Available Means of Persuasion: Mapping a Theory and Pedagogy of Multimodal Public Rhetoric|location=Anderson, South Carolina|publisher=Parlor Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory ===
"At first, Memory seemed to have to do solely with [[mnemonics]] (memory aids) that would assist a budding orator in retaining his speech. However, it clearly had to do with more than simply learning how to memorize an already composed speech for re-presentation. The practice of storing up information or other material arrived at through the topics of invention can be called for in a given occasion in order to redistribute information that is already known or given. The canon of Memory also suggests that scholars consider the psychological aspects of preparing to communicate and the performance of communicating itself, especially in an oral or impromptu setting. Typically Memory has to do only with the orator, but invites consideration of how the audience will retain things in mind."&lt;ref name="Burton"&gt;{{cite web|author=Burton, G. (n.d.)|title=What is Rhetoric?|accessdate=December 3, 2014|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/encompassing%20terms/rhetoric.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105226/http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/rhetoric.htm|archivedate=December 20, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mind sharing ===
Mind sharing is a way to get [[collective intelligence]]—crowd wisdom that is comparable to expert wisdom. The methodology for this is simple. One would look for a consensus from the crowd—the answer that most minds are suggesting is the best answer. If it's a numeric question (like guessing the weight of an ox), it's a calculated average or median. If it's an open question (like "what car should I buy?"), it's the most common answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindsharing: The Art of Crowdsourcing Everything|last=Zoref|first=Lior|publisher=Portfolio|year=2015|isbn=978-1591846659|location=|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multimodality===
[[Multimodality]] means having several modes, modalities, or maxima—in simpler terms, it is a form of communication that uses multiple methods (or modes) to inform audiences of an idea. It can involve a mix of written text, pictures, audio, or videos. Online journals often embrace multimodality in their issues and articles by publishing works that use more than just written text to communicate the message. While the digital turn in rhetoric and composition has encouraged more discussion, theorization, and pedagogical application of multimodality and multimodal texts, the history of the field demonstrates a continuous concern with multimodal communication beginning with classical rhetoric's concern with delivery, gesture, and memory. All writing and all communication is, theoretically, multimodal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Naming What We Know: Threshold Concepts of Writing Studies|last=Ball|first=Cheryl|last2=Charlton|first2=Colin|publisher=Utah State University Press|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Adler-Kassner|editor-first=Linda|location=|pages=|chapter=All Writing is Multimodal|editor2-last=Wardle|editor2-first=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remix===
[[Remix]] is a method of digital rhetoric that manipulates and transforms an original work to convey a new message. The usage of remix can help the creator make an argument by connecting seemingly unrelated ideas into a convincing whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuhn|first=Virginia|date=|title=The Rhetoric of Remix|url=http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/358/279|journal=Transformative Works|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As modern [[technology]] develops, self-publication sites like YouTube, SoundCloud, and WordPress have stimulated remix culture, allowing for easier creation and dissemination of reworked content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Rhetoric/Remediation_and_Remix|title=Digital Rhetoric/Remediation and Remix - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike appropriation, which is the use and potential recontextualization of existing material without significant modification, remix is defined in ''Kairos'' as "the process of taking old pieces of text, images, sounds, and video and stitching them together to form a new product."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/ridolfo_devoss/remix.html|title=Composing for Recomposition: Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery|last=DeVoss|first=Jim Ridolfo and Dànielle Nicole|date=2009-01-15|website=kairos.technorhetoric.net|language=English|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A popular example of remixing is the creation and sharing of [[meme]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

===Rhetorical velocity===
[[Rhetorical velocity]] is the concept of authors writing in a way in which they are able to predict how their work might be recomposed. With the advancement of technology, there is no limit to the speed and distance at which an author's work is able to travel. Therefore, it is important for them to be able to predict how their audience will recompose their works. Jim Ridolfo and Danielle DeVoss first coined this idea in 2009 when they describe rhetorical velocity as "a conscious rhetorical concern for distance, travel, speed, and time, pertaining specifically to theorizing instances of strategic appropriation by a third party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ridolfo, J.|author2=Devoss, D.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Composing for Recomposition: Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery|journal=Kairos|volume=13|issue=2|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/ridolfo_devoss/intro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual rhetoric ===
[[Visual rhetoric]] relates to digital rhetoric because they can act together to communicate ideas in a way that is not bound by a linear format. Mary Hocks, a visual rhetoric scholar, states "the screen itself is a tablet that combines words, interfaces, icons, and pictures that invoke other modalities like touch and sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hocks, M.|year=2003|title=Understanding Visual Rhetoric in Digital Writing Environments|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=54|issue=4|pages=629–656|jstor=3594188|doi=10.2307/3594188}}&lt;/ref&gt; By manipulating the tools described by Hocks, a writer in the digital world has access to influence a broader audience, and an influx of modes to communicate their ideas. This in turn creates a way for writers to communicate The use of visual images in rhetoric allows for a writer to convey an idea that may be so abstract that the written linear word will not suffice. Abstract ideas in rhetorical images, as Charles Hill states, that not only are abstract ideas represented in images acceptable but they are prominent, images "do not necessarily have to portray an object, or even a class of objects, that exists or ever did exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Handa, C.|year=2004|chapter=Reading the Visual in College Writing Classes By Charles Hill|title=Visual rhetoric in a digital world: A critical sourcebook|location=Boston|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images allow for the writer to depict the closest representation of their thought possible since they can blend abstract and tangible thoughts. Hill uses the peace sign, swastika, and the confederate flags as examples of abstract ideas represented by images. Ironically the image of a peace sign, which seems to be universally accepted as a call from the 1970s 'hippie' movement, originated as an anti-Christian symbol. The original graphic was used to show an upside down broken cross symbolizing the despair of man and the crucifixion of the Apostle Peter. This shows how visual images can change over time and be adapted in such powerful ways that it actually changes the meaning completely. Images are versatile, and coupled with the motive of the author can provide key components to an argument. By being informed on how visual rhetoric interacts with its different components a reader/viewer can reduce abstract ideas to a more tangible state.

==Controversies==

===Access===
Referred to as the [[digital divide]], issues of economic access and user-level access are recurring issues in digital rhetoric. These issues show up most prevalent in [[computers and writing]] circles. Access can refer to inequality in the access of information, access to a reading public, and access to means of communicating. For those that teach digital rhetoric in schools and universities, student access to technologies at home and in school is an operative concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reynolds, Thomas J.|author2=Charles R. Lewis|lastauthoramp=y|title=The changing topography of computer access for composition students|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=14|issue=2|pages=269–278|year=1997|doi=10.1016/S8755-4615(97)90027-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate about whether mobile computing devices like smartphones make technology access more equitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hea, Amy C.K.|year=2009|title=Going Wireless: A Critical Exploration of Wireless and Mobile Technologies for Composition Teachers and Researchers|location=Cresskill, N.J.|publisher=Hampton Press|pages=15–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright issues===
Copyright controversies in online and digital texts affect the way digital rhetoric is utilized. Many of these arguments deal with the problem of cost for the publishers and consumers of scholarly text. Copyrighting materials is an expensive task, especially when the materials can be translated into many other forms of digital sources that are freely found by the public. Because of this ease of transformation, copyright laws are undermined as scholars lose predication in their online materials through maneuvers as simple as copy and paste or translating hyperlinks. In James P. Zappen's piece "Digital Rhetoric: Toward an Integrated Theory", he refers to transferring material in ways that create misapplication of a work that a scholar has written. "A media database, for example, can produce an almost infinite variety of end-user objects, which can be customized for different users, manipulated through hyperlinks, periodically updated, and scaled upon demand." Zappen's statement of "infinite" is in no way subjective or an over statement. Many digital pieces are infringed upon, stolen, or misused by the avoidance of copyright.  These many forms of copyright avoidance lend to the controversy of digital rhetoric and media as a whole.&lt;ref name="Zappen" /&gt; 

=== Cyberbullying ===
One controversy that has been steady on the rise since the transition of utilizing digital rhetoric in social media is [[Cyberbullying]].  An example can be seen in the TLC television series, [[Here Comes Honey Boo Boo]]. Viewers have the opportunity to post their opinions and responses on sites such as Twitter and Instagram. The trend that people posting about the characters and their lifestyles, it reinforces the iconography of stereotypes (such as "hillbillies") is successful because of the way in which the rhetoric of difference is a naturalized component of the ethnic and racial identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=Carissa|date=Spring 2018|title=The rhetoric of the real: stereotypes of rural youth in American reality television and stock photography|url=|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The challenge with social media is that since there is a limited amount of characters to convey the message the digital rhetoric tends to be oversimplified and stereotypes flourish. Erika Sparby evaluated that due to the increase of social media users people have found this stronger sense of confidence from the ability from being anonymous and using pseudonymous in digital social media for them to address either someone or something in a negative light.&lt;ref name="Sparby"/&gt;

===Legitimacy===

There is controversy regarding the innovative nature of digital rhetoric. Arguments opposed to legitimizing webtext are Platonically-based in that they reject the new form of scholarship, web text, and praise the old form, print, in the same way that oral communication was originally favored over written communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Borgman, Christine|title=Scholarship in a Digital Age: Information, Infrastructure, and the Internet|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press|year=2007|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally some traditionalists didn't regard online open-access journals with the same legitimacy as print journals for this reason; however, digital arenas have become the primary place for disseminating academic information in many areas of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dunham, Gary|title=What are Trends in Scholarly Publishing?|url=http://www.asha.org/Academic/questions/Trends-Scholarly-Publishing/}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=MiguelAngelFimbres |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars struggle to "claim academic legitimacy" in these new media forms, as the tendency of pedagogy is to write about a subject rather than actively work in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ball, Cheryl E.|year=2004|title=Show, not tell: The value of new media scholarship|journal=Computers &amp; Composition|volume=21|issue=4|pages=403–425|url=http://gossettphd.org/library/ball_shownottell.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2004.08.001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023081524/http://gossettphd.org/library/ball_shownottell.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the past decade, more scholarly texts have been openly accessible, which provides an innovative way for students to gain access to textual materials online for free, in the way that many scholarly journals like ''Kairos'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/ Kairos]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Harlot of the Arts'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot Harlot of the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Enculturation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enculturation.net/ Enculturation]&lt;/ref&gt; are already available through open access.

===Open access===
Open access has removed the barriers of fees associated with accessing a work and restrictions of copyright and licensing. The matter of eliminating fees is most prevalent to digital rhetoric, because it allows for more access to works. Open access and digital rhetoric do not eliminate copyright, but eliminates restrictions by giving authors the choice to maintain their right to copy and distribute their materials however they choose, or they may turn the rights over to a specific journal. Digital rhetoric involves works that are found online and open access is allowing more people to be able to reach these works.

'''Limerence''' is a state of mind which results from a [[Romance (love)|romantic attraction]] to another person and typically includes obsessive thoughts and fantasies and a desire to form or maintain a relationship with the object of love and have one's feelings reciprocated.

==Origin and meaning of the term==
[[Psychologist]] [[Dorothy Tennov]] coined the term "limerence" for her 1979 book, ''Love and Limerence:  The Experience of Being in Love'', to describe a concept that had grown out of her work in the mid-1960s, when she interviewed over 500 people on the topic of love.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tennov|first=Dorothy|authorlink=Dorothy Tennov|title=Love and Limerence: the Experience of Being in Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPsDAAAACAAJ|accessdate=12 March 2011|year=1999|publisher=Scarborough House|isbn=978-0-8128-6286-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence, which is not exclusively sexual, has been defined in terms of its potentially inspirational effects and in relation to [[attachment theory]]. It has been described as being "an involuntary potentially inspiring state of adoration and attachment to a limerent object (LO) involving [[Intrusive thought|intrusive]] and obsessive thoughts, feelings and behaviors from euphoria to despair, contingent on perceived emotional reciprocation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Willmott|first=Lynn|title=Love and Limerence: Harness the Limbicbrain| year= 2012| publisher= Lathbury House|isbn= 978-1481215312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attachment theory emphasizes that "many of the most intense [[emotion]]s arise during the formation, the maintenance, the disruption, and the renewal of attachment relationships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first= John |last= Bowlby| title= Attachment| editor-first= Richard |editor-last= Gregory |work= The Oxford Companion to the Mind| publisher= Oxford |year= 1987| page= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that "the state of limerence is the conscious experience of sexual incentive motivation" during attachment formation, "a kind of subjective experience of sexual incentive motivation"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agmo|2007|pp=173, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the "intensive ... pair-forming stage"&lt;ref name="Morris1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; of human affectionate bonding.

==Characteristics==
The concept of 'limerence' "provides a particular carving up of the semantic domain of love",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=V. C. |editor-last=De Munck|title=Romantic Love and Sexual Behavior |year=1998 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents an attempt at a scientific study of the nature of love. Limerence is considered as a [[cognitive]] and emotional state of being emotionally attached to or even obsessed with another person, and is typically experienced involuntarily and characterized by a strong desire for reciprocation of one's feelings—a near-obsessive form of [[Romance (love)|romantic love]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite journal

|title=Let's Fall in Limerence
|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]
|publisher=Time Inc.
|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952554,00.html
|accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Tennov, "sexual attraction is an essential component of limerence ... the limerent is a potential sex partner".&lt;ref name="Tennov"&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence is sometimes also interpreted as [[infatuation]], or what is colloquially known as a "crush".  However, in common speech, infatuation includes aspects of immaturity and extrapolation from insufficient information, and is usually short-lived.  Tennov notes how limerence "may dissolve soon after its initiation, as in an early teenage buzz-centered crush",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she is more concerned with the point when "limerent bonds are characterized by 'entropy' crystallization as described by [[Stendhal]] in his 1821 treatise ''On Love'', where a new love infatuation perceptually begins to transform ... [and] attractive characteristics are exaggerated and unattractive characteristics are given little or no attention ... [creating] a 'limerent object'".

According to Tennov, there are at least two types of love: limerence, which she describes as, among other things, "loving attachment", and "loving affection", the bond that exists between an individual and their parents and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/dec/14/features.magazine47 |work= The Guardian |title= That crazy little thing called love |date= 14 December 2003 |accessdate= 15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that one form may evolve into the other: "Those whose limerence was replaced by affectional bonding with the same partner might say ... 'We were very much in love when we married; today we love each other very much'".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is comparable to that drawn by [[ethologists]] "between the pair-forming and pair-maintaining functions of sexual activity",&lt;ref name="Morris1994" /&gt; just as "the attachment of the attachment theorists is very similar to the emotional reciprocation longed for in Tennov's limerence, and each is linked to sexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence is characterized by [[Intrusive thoughts|intrusive thinking]] and pronounced sensitivity to external events that reflect the disposition of the limerent object towards the individual. It can be experienced as intense [[joy]] or as extreme [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], depending on whether the feelings are reciprocated. Basically, it is the state of being completely carried away by unreasoned [[passion (emotion)|passion]] or [[love]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} even to the point of [[Addiction|addictive]]-type behavior. Usually, one is inspired with an intense passion or admiration for someone. Limerence can be difficult to understand for those who have never experienced it, and it is thus often dismissed by non-limerents as ridiculous fantasy or a construct of romantic fiction.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt;

Tennov differentiates between limerence and other emotions by asserting that [[love]] involves concern for the other person's welfare and feeling. While limerence does not require it, those concerns may certainly be incorporated. [[Affection]] and fondness exist only as a disposition towards another person, irrespective of whether those feelings are reciprocated, whereas limerence deeply desires reciprocation, but it remains unaltered whether or not it is returned. Physical contact with the object is neither essential nor sufficient to an individual experiencing limerence, unlike with one experiencing [[sexual attraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa|title=Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=13|page=2|url=http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003453/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where early, unhealthy attachment patterns or [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] influence limerence, the limerent object may be construed as an idealization of the figure or figures involved in the original unhealthy attachment or trauma. Lack of reciprocation may in such instances serve to reinforce lessons learned in earlier, unhealthy bonding experiences, and hence strengthen the limerence.

==Components==
Limerence involves intrusive thinking about the limerent object.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; Other characteristics include acute longing for reciprocation, fear of rejection, and unsettling shyness in the limerent object's presence. In cases of unrequited limerence, transient relief may be found by vividly imagining reciprocation from the limerent object. Tennov suggests that feelings of limerence can be intensified through adversity, obstacles, or distance—'Intensification through Adversity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; A limerent person may have acute sensitivity to any act, thought, or condition that can be interpreted favorably. This may include a tendency to devise, fabricate, or invent "reasonable" explanations for why neutral actions are a sign of hidden passion in the limerent object.

A person experiencing limerence has a general intensity of feeling that leaves other concerns in the background. In their thoughts, such a person tends to emphasize what is admirable in the limerent object and to avoid any negative or problematic attributes.

===Intrusive thinking and fantasy===
During the height of limerence, thoughts of the limerent object (or person) are at once persistent, involuntary and intrusive. Such 'intrusive thoughts about the LO ... appear to be genetically driven':&lt;ref name="moore268"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, limerence is first and foremost a condition of cognitive obsession. This may be caused by low serotonin levels in the brain, comparable to those of people with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Marazziti D, Akiskal HS, Rossi A, Cassano GB. "Alteration of the platelet serotonin transporter in romantic love." ''Psychol Med.'' 2000&lt;/ref&gt; All events, associations, stimuli, and experiences return thoughts to the limerent object with unnerving consistency, while conversely the constant thoughts about the limerent object define all other experiences. If a certain thought has no previous connection with the limerent object, immediately one is made. Limerent fantasy is unsatisfactory unless rooted in reality,&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; because the fantasizer may want the fantasy to seem realistic and somewhat possible.  At their most severe, intrusive limerent thoughts can occupy an individual's waking hours completely, resulting—like severe addiction—in significant or complete disruption of the limerent's normal interests and activities, including work and family.  For serial limerents, this can result in debilitating, lifelong underachievement in school, work, and family life.  Comparisons{{which|date=December 2013}} made between limerence and substance addiction may draw attention to the constant, free availability of the limerent's "drug of choice".

Fantasies that are concerned with far-fetched ideas are usually dropped by the fantasizer.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; Sometimes fantasizing is retrospective: actual events are replayed from memory with great vividness. This form predominates when what is viewed as evidence of possible reciprocation can be re-experienced (a kind of selective or revisionist history). Otherwise, the long fantasy is anticipatory; it begins in the everyday world and climaxes at the attainment of the limerent goal. A limerent fantasy can also involve an unusual, often tragic, event.

The long fantasies form bridges between the limerent's ordinary life and that intensely desired ecstatic moment. The duration and complexity of a fantasy depend on the availability of time and freedom from distractions. The bliss of the imagined moment of consummation is greater when events imagined to precede it are possible (though they often represent grave departures from the probable). Not always is it entirely pleasant, and when rejection seems likely the thoughts focus on despair, sometimes to the point of [[suicide]]. The pleasantness or unpleasantness of the state seems almost unrelated to the intensity of the reaction. Although the direction of feeling, i.e. happy versus unhappy, shifts rapidly, with 'dramatic surges of buoyancy and despair',&lt;ref name=moore268/&gt; the intensity of intrusive and involuntary thinking alters less rapidly, and only in response to an accumulation of experiences with the particular limerent object.

Fantasies are occasionally dreamed by the one experiencing limerence. Dreams give out strong emotion and happiness when experienced, but often end with despair when the subject awakens. Dreams can reawaken strong feelings toward the limerent object after the feelings have declined.

=== Fear of rejection ===
Along with an emphasis on the perceived exceptional qualities, and devotion to them, there is abundant doubt that the feelings are reciprocated: [[social rejection#Romantic rejection|rejection]]. Considerable self-doubt is encountered, leading to "personal incapacitation expressed through unsettling timidity in the presence of the person",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; something which causes misery and galvanizes desire.

In most cases, what destroys limerence is a suitably long period of time without [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocation]]. Although it appears that limerence advances with adversity, personal discomfort may foul it.  This discomfort results from a fear of the limerent object's opinions.

=== Hope ===
Limerence develops and is sustained when there is a certain balance of hope and uncertainty. The basis for limerent hope is not in objective reality but in reality as it is perceived. The inclination is to sift through nuances of speech and [[wikt:subtleties|subtleties]] of behavior for evidence of limerent hope. "Lovers, of course, are notoriously frantic [[epistemologist]]s, second only to paranoiacs (and analysts) as readers of signs and wonders."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Adam. ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; "Little things" are noticed and endlessly analyzed for meaning. Such excessive concern over trivia may not be entirely unfounded, however, as body language can indicate reciprocated feeling. What the limerent object said and did is recalled with vividness. Alternative meanings for the behaviors recalled are sought. Each word and gesture is permanently available for review, especially those interpreted as evidence in favor of reciprocated feeling. When objects, people, places or situations are encountered with the limerent object, they are vividly remembered, especially if the limerent object  interacted with them in some way.

The belief that the limerent object does not and will not reciprocate can only be reached with great difficulty. Limerence can be carried quite far before acknowledgment of rejection is genuine, especially if it has not been addressed openly by the limerent object.

==Effects==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

===Physical effects===
The physiological correlations of intense limerence can include [[seizure]]-like [[trembling]], [[pallor]], [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[heart palpitations]], [[pupil dilation]] and general [[Muscle weakness|weakness]]. [[Awkwardness]], [[stuttering]], [[shyness]], and [[confusion]] predominate at the behavioral level. Less common effects include [[insomnia]], [[loss of appetite]],  and [[Syncope (medicine)|passing out]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

If there is extensive [[anxiety]], incorrect behaviour may torpedo the relationship, which may cause physical responses to manifest intensely. Some people acutely feel these effects either immediately or following contact with the limerent object.  Blended is dire ecstasy or keen despair, depending on the turn of events.

The sensitivity that stems from fear of rejection can darken limerent objects' perceived body language. Conflicted signs of [[desire]] may be emitted that confuse judgment.  Often the limerent object is currently involved with another or is in some other way unavailable.

A condition of sustained alertness, a heightening of awareness and an enormous fund of energy to deploy in pursuit of the limerent aim is developed. The sensation of limerence is felt in the midpoint of the chest, bottom of the throat, guts, or in some cases in the abdominal region.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; This can be interpreted as ecstasy at times of mutuality, but its presence is most noticeable during [[Broken heart|despair at times of rejection]].

===Psychological effects===
Sufferers complain of abandonment, despair, and diabolically humiliating disappointment. A sense of paralyzing ambiguity predominates, punctuated by pining. The fact of intermittent or nonreciprocal response lends to labile vacillation. This [[limbo]] is the threshold for mental prostration.

== Sexuality ==
Awareness of [[physical attraction]] plays a key role in the development of limerence,&lt;ref name="Tennov" /&gt; but is not enough to satisfy the limerent desire, and is almost never the main focus; instead, the limerent focuses on what could be defined as the "beneficial attributes". Nevertheless, Tennov stresses that "the most consistent result of limerence is mating, not merely sexual interaction but also commitment".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence can be intensified after a sexual relationship has begun, and with more intense limerence there is greater desire for sexual contact. However, while sexual surrender at one time indicated the end of uncertainty felt by the limerent object – because in the past, a sexual encounter more often led to a feeling of obligation to commit – in modern times this is not necessarily the case.

The sexual aspect of limerence is not consistent from person to person.  Most limerents experience limerent sexuality as a component of romantic interest.  Some limerents, however, may experience limerence as a consequence of hyperarousal. In such cases, limerence may form as a [[defense mechanism]] against the limerent object, who is not perceived initially as a romantic ideal, but as a physical threat to the limerent.

[[Sexual fantasy|Sexual fantasies]] are distinct from limerent fantasies. Limerent fantasy is rooted in reality and is intrusive rather than voluntary. Sexual fantasies are under more or less voluntary control and may involve strangers, imaginary individuals, and situations that could not take place. Limerence elevates body temperature and increases relaxation{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}, a sensation of viewing the world with [[Optimism|rose-tinted glasses]], leading to a greater receptiveness to sexuality, and to daydreaming.

People can become aroused by the thought of sexual partners, acts, and situations that are not truly desired, whereas every detail of the limerent fantasy is passionately desired actually to take place. Limerence sometimes increases sexual interest in other partners when the limerent object is unreceptive or unavailable.

== Limerent reaction ==
The limerent reaction is a composite reaction – that is, it is composed of a series of separate reactions.  These reactions occur only where misperceptions meet adversity in the context of a romance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  Perhaps because of this unique specificity, limerent reactions can be uniquely quantified and predicted according to the schema described below.

Involvement increases if obstacles are externally imposed or if the limerent object’s feelings are doubted. Only if the limerent object were to be revealed as highly undesirable might limerence subside. The presence of some degree of doubt causes the intensity of the feelings to increase further.  The stage is reached at which the reaction is virtually impossible to dislodge. This adversity may be superficial or deep, internal or external, so that an individual may sometimes generate deep adversity where none exists.  Also "romance", as it were, need not be present in any genuine way for a limerent reaction to occur.

The course of limerence results in a more intrusive thinking pattern. This thinking pattern is an expectant and often joyous period with the initial focusing on the limerent object’s admirable qualities: [[crystallization (love)|crystallization]]. Then, under appropriate conditions of hope and uncertainty, the limerence intensifies further.

With evidence of reciprocation (real or imagined) from the limerent object, a state of extreme pleasure, even euphoria, is enjoyed. Thoughts are mainly occupied with considering and reconsidering what is attractive in the limerent object, replaying whatever events may have thus far transpired with the limerent object, and appreciating personal qualities perceived as possibly having sparked interest in the limerent object. At peak crystallization, almost all waking thoughts revolve around the limerent object. After this peak, the feelings eventually decline.

Fantasies are preferred to virtually any other activity with the exception of activities that are believed to help obtain the limerent object, and activities that involve actually being in the presence of the limerent object. The motivation to attain a "relationship" continues to intensify so long as a proper mix of hope and uncertainty exist.

== Limerent duration ==

Tennov estimates, based on both questionnaire and interview data, that the average limerent reaction duration, from the moment of initiation until a feeling of neutrality is reached, is approximately three years. The extremes may be as brief as a few weeks or as long as several decades. When limerence is brief, maximum intensity may not have been attained. According to David Sack, M.D., limerence lasts longer than romantic love, but is shorter than a healthy, committed partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Others suggest that 'the biogenetic sourcing of limerence determines its limitation, ordinarily, to a two-year span',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; that limerence generally lasts between 18 months and three years; but further studies on unrequited limerence have suggested longer durations. In turn, a limerent may only experience a single limerent episode, or may experience "serial" episodes, in which nearly one's entire mature life, from early puberty through late adulthood, can be consumed in successive limerent obsessions.

== Bond varieties ==
{{Main|Human bonding}}
Once the ''limerent reaction'' has initiated, one of three varieties of bonds may form, defined over a set duration of time, in relation to the experience or non-experience of limerence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa|title=Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=13|page=1|url=http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003453/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The constitution of these bonds may vary over the course of the relationship, in ways that may either increase or decrease the intensity of the limerence.

The basis and interesting characteristic of this delineation made by Tennov, is that based on her research and interviews with people, all human bonded relationships can be divided into three varieties being defined by the amount of limerence or non-limerence each partner contributes to the relationship.

With an affectional bond, neither partner is limerent. With a Limerent-Nonlimerent bond, one partner is limerent. In a Limerent-Limerent bond, both partners are limerent.

Affectional bonding characterize those affectionate sexual relationships where neither partner is limerent; couples tend to be in love, but do not report continuous and unwanted intrusive thinking, feeling intense need for exclusivity, or define their goals in terms of reciprocity.  These types of bonded couples tend to emphasize compatibility of interests, mutual preferences in leisure activities, ability to work together, and in some cases a degree of relative contentment.

The bulk of relationships, however, according to Tennov, are those between a limerent person and a nonlimerent other, i.e. ''limerent-nonlimerent bonding''.  These bonds are characterized by unequal reciprocation.

Lastly, those relationship bonds in which there exists mutual reciprocation are defined as ''limerent-limerent bondings''.  Tennov argues that since limerence itself is an "unstable state", mutually limerent bonds would be expected to be short-lived; mixed relationships probably last longer than limerent-limerent relationships. Some limerent-limerent relationships evolve into affectional bondings over time as limerence declines.  Tennov describes such couples as "old marrieds" whose interactions are typically both stable and mutually gratifying.

==Mitigation==
In her study Tennov identified three ways in which limerence subsides: 
;Consummation (reciprocation)
:Each limerent has a slightly different view of acceptable reciprocation, and the reactions to reciprocation vary.  Some limerents remain limerent (as documented by Tennov), while for others the limerence subsides as the certainty of reciprocity grows.  Other limerents do not achieve any "real" consummation (e.g. physical, or in the form of an actual relationship) but find their limerence waning after a limerent object professes similar feelings.
;Starvation
:In this process, a lack of ''any'' notice (i.e. starvation, described by Tennov as "the onslaught of evidence that LO does not return the limerence") causes the limerent to gradually desensitize. This desensitization may take a long time, in which case a limerent's latent hypersensitivity may cause any attention given by a former LO, regardless of how slight, to be interpreted as a reason for hope, precipitating a resurgence of limerence.
;Transference
:The limerent transfers their romantic feelings to another person, thereby ending the initial limerence; the limerence is sometimes transferred as well.

==Continuing research==
Tennov's research has been continued{{when|refers to 2008 articles|date=January 2018}} by Albert Wakin, who knew Tennov at the [[University of Bridgeport]] but did not assist in her research, and Duyen Vo, a graduate student of [[Southern Connecticut State University]].&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their goal is to refine the term limerence so that it refers mostly to the negative aspects.

The term "limerence" has been invoked in many popular media,{{according to whom|date=January 2018}} including self-help books, popular magazines, and websites.  However, according to a paper by Wakin and Vo, "In spite of the public’s exposure to limerence, the professional community, particularly clinical, is largely unaware of the concept."&lt;ref name="Wakin-Vo"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Wakin and Vo presented their updated research to the American Association of Behavioral and Social Sciences.  They reported that more research must be gathered before the condition is suitable for inclusion in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (''DSM'').&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;

Critics point out that Tennov's account "is based on interviews rather than on direct observation", but conclude that "despite its shortcomings, Tennov's work may constitute a basis for informed hypothesis formulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agmo|2007|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Term and typical meanings ==
"Melody type" is a fundamental notion for understanding a nature of Western and non-Western musical [[Mode (music)|modes]], according to [[Harold Powers|Harold Powers']] seminal article "Mode" in the first edition of the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' {{harv|Powers|1980|loc=12:376–77, 379, et passim}}.

Melody types are used in the [[musical composition|composition]] of an enormous variety of [[music]], especially [[music of Asia|non-Western]] and [[early music|early Western music]]. Such music is generally composed by a process of [[centonization]], either freely (i.e. improvised) or in a fixed pattern.

"Melody type" as used by the ethmnomusicologist [[Mark Slobin|Mark]] {{harvtxt|Slobin|1982|loc=186}}&lt;ref&gt;Slobin, Mark (1982). ''Tenement Songs: The Popular Music of the Jewish Immigrants''. Music in American Life. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. {{ISBN|0-252-00893-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as a "group of melodies that are related, in that they all contain similar modal procedures and characteristic [[rhythm]]ic and melodic contours or patterns".&lt;ref&gt;Koskoff, Ellen (2000). ''Music in Lubavitcher Life'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press), p.&amp;nbsp;86. {{ISBN|978-0-252-02591-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most cultures which compose music in this way organize the patterns into distinct melody types. These are often compared to modern Western [[musical scale|scale]]s, but they in fact represent much more information than a sequence of permissible [[pitch (music)|pitches]], since they include how those pitches should function in the music, and indicate basic formulas which serve as a basis for [[improvisation]]. In non-improvised music, such as codified liturgical music, it is still usually clear how the melody developed from set patterns.

{{quote|On one end of the continuum, the right, the melody type is a schema that is quite definite—a specific melody or a tune. When a musician improvises on this schema, he [or she] plays the melody with only slight variations. The basic outline is preserved and is clearly recognized by the listener. The best example&amp;nbsp;... on this end of the continuum is a folk song. A genuine folk song performance is a kind of improvisation. No one person sings it exactly as it came to him [or her]. One of the challenges of folk song research, of course, is to find all the variants of the tune and to try to trace the family relationships.&lt;br/&gt; On the left side of the continuum is the melody type as a [[musical mode|mode]]. Here the melody type is similar to a [[Gregorian mode|church mode]]: a scalar configuration with a preferential order of tones.&lt;br/&gt; ...The closer we get to the pole where a melody type is a tune, the more definite and literal is the schema.|May (1983)&lt;ref&gt;May, Elizabeth (1983).

{{quote|A melodic formula, ranging length from a short motif of a few notes to an entire melody, which is used as the basis for musical compositions. It differs from a mode, which simply sets forth a sequence of [[interval (music)|intervals]] (in Western music, half tones and whole tones), and from a scale (the notes of a mode in rising order of pitch), in that it is more specific: a melody type spells out actual sequences of tones, just as they are to appear in a piece, as well as particular beginnings and endings, [[ornament (music)|ornaments]], and other details.

Pseudo-liturgical verses with initial numerals (''primum..., secundum..., tertia...'' etc.) helped singers to associate a current model with a 'real' chant (such as antiphon) of the same tone.

The '''neuroscience of music''' is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying [[music]]. These behaviours include music [[listening]], [[Performance|performing]], [[Musical composition|composing]], reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for [[Aesthetics of music|musical aesthetics]] and musical emotion. Scientists working in this field may have training in cognitive neuroscience, [[neurology]], [[neuroanatomy]], [[psychology]], [[music theory]], [[computer science]], and other relevant fields.

The cognitive neuroscience of music represents a significant branch of [[music psychology]], and is distinguished from related fields such as [[cognitive musicology]] in its reliance on direct observations of the brain and use of such techniques as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

== Neurological bases ==

===Pitch===
Successive parts of the [[tonotopy|tonotopically]] organized [[basilar membrane]] in the [[cochlea]] resonate to corresponding [[frequency]] [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidths]] of incoming sound. The [[hair cell]]s in the cochlea release [[neurotransmitter]] as a result, causing [[action potentials]] down the [[auditory nerve]]. The auditory nerve then leads to several layers of [[synapses]] at numerous [[Nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] in the [[Auditory system#Central auditory system|auditory brainstem]]. These nuclei are also tonotopically organized, and the process of achieving this tonotopy after the cochlea is not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn.2332 |title=Tonotopic reorganization of developing auditory brainstem circuits |year=2009 |last1=Kandler |first1=Karl |last2=Clause |first2=Amanda |last3=Noh |first3=Jihyun |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=711–7 |pmid=19471270 |pmc=2780022}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tonotopy is in general maintained up to [[primary auditory cortex]] in [[mammals]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(82)90118-3 |title=Cortical magnetic fields evoked by frequency glides of a continuous tone |year=1982 |last1=Arlinger |first1=S |last2=Elberling |first2=C |last3=Bak |first3=C |last4=Kofoed |first4=B |last5=Lebech |first5=J |last6=Saermark |first6=K |journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=642–53 |pmid=6183097}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it is often found that cells in primary and non-primary auditory cortex have [[Spatio temporal receptive field|spatio-temporal receptive fields]], rather than being strictly responsive or phase-locking their action potentials to narrow frequency regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/cercor/11.3.183 |title=Feature Article: The Structure and Function of Dynamic Cortical and Thalamic Receptive Fields |year=2001 |last1=Ghazanfar |first1=A.

A widely postulated mechanism for pitch processing in the early central auditory system is the [[Circle map|phase-locking]] and [[Arnold tongue#Mode locking|mode-locking]] of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus. Phase-locking to stimulus frequencies has been shown in the auditory nerve,&lt;ref name="Koppl 1997 3312–3321"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Köppl |first1=Christine |title=Phase Locking to High Frequencies in the Auditory Nerve and Cochlear Nucleus Magnocellularis of the Barn Owl, ''Tyto alba'' |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |pmid=9096164 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9096164 |year=1997 |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=3312–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/jn.00326.2006 |title=Phase Locking of Auditory-Nerve Fibers to the Envelopes of High-Frequency Sounds: Implications for Sound Localization |year=2006 |last1=Dreyer |first1=A. |last2=Delgutte |first2=B. |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology |volume=96 |issue=5 |pages=2327–41 |pmid=16807349 |pmc=2013745}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[cochlear nucleus]],&lt;ref name="Koppl 1997 3312–3321"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/jn.00070.2009 |title=Mode-Locked Spike Trains in Responses of Ventral Cochlear Nucleus Chopper and Onset Neurons to Periodic Stimuli |year=2009 |last1=Laudanski |first1=J. |last2=Coombes |first2=S. |last3=Palmer |first3=A.

=== Melody processing in the secondary auditory cortex ===

Studies suggest that individuals are capable of automatically detecting a difference or anomaly in a [[melody]] such as an out of tune [[pitch (music)|pitch]] which does not fit with their previous music experience. This automatic processing occurs in the secondary auditory cortex. Brattico, Tervaniemi, Naatanen, and Peretz (2006) performed one such study to determine if the detection of tones that do not fit an individual's expectations can occur automatically.&lt;ref name="Brattico"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2006.08.023 |title=Musical scale properties are automatically processed in the human auditory cortex |year=2006 |last1=Brattico |first1=Elvira |last2=Tervaniemi |first2=Mari |last3=Näätänen |first3=Risto |last4=Peretz |first4=Isabelle |journal=Brain Research |volume=1117 |pages=162–74 |pmid=16963000 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They recorded [[event-related potential]]s (ERPs) in nonmusicians as they were presented unfamiliar melodies with either an out of tune pitch or an out of key pitch while participants were either distracted from the sounds or attending to the melody. Both conditions revealed an early frontal negativity independent of where attention was directed. This negativity originated in the auditory cortex, more precisely in the supratemporal lobe (which corresponds with the secondary auditory cortex) with greater activity from the right hemisphere. The negativity response was larger for pitch that was out of tune than that which was out of key. Ratings of musical incongruity were higher for out of tune pitch melodies than for out of key pitch.  In the focused attention condition, out of key and out of tune pitches produced late parietal positivity. The findings of Brattico et al. (2006) suggest that there is automatic and rapid processing of melodic properties in the secondary auditory cortex.&lt;ref name="Brattico"/&gt; The findings that pitch incongruities were detected automatically, even in processing unfamiliar melodies, suggests that there is an automatic comparison of incoming information with long term knowledge of musical scale properties, such as culturally influenced rules of musical properties (common chord progressions, scale patterns, etc.) and individual expectations of how the melody should proceed. The auditory area processes the sound of the music. The auditory area is located in the temporal lobe. The temporal lobe deals with the recognition and perception of auditory stimuli, memory, and speech (Kinser, 2012).

=== Role of right auditory cortex in fine pitch resolution ===

[[File:Brodmann 41 42.png|right|250px|thumb|The [[primary auditory cortex]] is one of the main areas associated with superior pitch resolution.]]

The right secondary auditory cortex has finer pitch resolution than the left. Hyde, Peretz and Zatorre (2008) used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in their study to test the involvement of right and left auditory cortical regions in frequency processing of melodic sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.09.004 |title=Evidence for the role of the right auditory cortex in fine pitch resolution |year=2008 |last1=Hyde |first1=Krista L. |last2=Peretz |first2=Isabelle |last3=Zatorre |first3=Robert J. |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=632–9 |pmid=17959204}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as finding superior pitch resolution in the right secondary auditory cortex, specific areas found to be involved were the [[planum temporale]] (PT) in the secondary auditory cortex, and the [[primary auditory cortex]] in the medial section of Heschl's gyrus (HG).

Many neuroimaging studies have found evidence of the importance of right secondary auditory regions in aspects of musical pitch processing, such as melody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(02)01060-7 |title=The Processing of Temporal Pitch and Melody Information in Auditory Cortex |year=2002 |last1=Patterson |first1=Roy D |last2=Uppenkamp |first2=Stefan |last3=Johnsrude |first3=Ingrid S |last4=Griffiths |first4=Timothy D |journal=Neuron |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=767–76 |pmid=12441063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these studies such as one by Patterson, Uppenkamp, Johnsrude and Griffiths (2002) also find evidence of a hierarchy of pitch processing. Patterson et al. (2002) used spectrally matched sounds which produced: no pitch, fixed pitch or melody in an fMRI study and found that all conditions activated HG and PT. Sounds with pitch activated more of these regions than sounds without. When a melody was produced activation spread to the [[superior temporal gyrus]] (STG) and planum polare (PP). These results support the existence of a pitch processing hierarchy.

===Rhythm===
The belt and parabelt areas of the right hemisphere are involved in processing [[rhythm]]. When individuals are preparing to tap out a rhythm of regular intervals (1:2 or 1:3) the left [[frontal cortex]], left [[parietal cortex]], and right [[cerebellum]] are all activated.  With more difficult rhythms such as a 1:2.5, more areas in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum are involved.&lt;ref name="Tramo"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1126/science.10.1126/science.1056899|title=BIOLOGY AND MUSIC: Enhanced: Music of the Hemispheres |year=2001 |last1=Tramo |first1=M. J. |journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5501 |pages=54–6 |pmid=11192009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[EEG]] recordings have also shown a relationship between brain electrical activity and rhythm perception. Snyder and Large (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2004.12.014 |title=Gamma-band activity reflects the metric structure of rhythmic tone sequences |year=2005 |last1=Snyder |first1=Joel S. |last2=Large |first2=Edward W. |journal=Cognitive Brain Research |volume=24 |pages=117–26 |pmid=15922164 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed a study examining rhythm perception in human subjects, finding that activity in the [[gamma wave|gamma band]] (20 – 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) corresponds to the [[Beat (music)|beats]] in a simple rhythm. Two types of gamma activity were found by Snyder &amp; Large: induced gamma activity, and [[Evoked potential#Auditory evoked potential|evoked]] gamma activity. Evoked gamma activity was found after the onset of each tone in the rhythm; this activity was found to be phase-locked (peaks and troughs were directly related to the exact onset of the tone) and did not appear when a gap (missed beat) was present in the rhythm. Induced gamma activity, which was not found to be phase-locked, was also found to correspond with each beat. However, induced gamma activity did not subside when a gap was present in the rhythm, indicating that induced gamma activity may possibly serve as a sort of internal metronome independent of auditory input. The motor and auditory areas are located in the cerebrum of the brain.  The motor area processes the rhythm of the music (Dean, 2013).{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}  The motor area of the brain is located in the parietal lobe. The parietal lobe also deals with orientation, recognition, and perception.

===Tonality===
[[Tonality]] describes the relationships between the elements of melody and [[harmony]] – tones, [[Interval (music)|intervals]], [[Chord (music)|chords]], and [[Scale (music)|scales]]. These relationships are often characterised as hierarchical, such that one of the elements dominates or attracts another. They occur both within and between every type of element, creating a rich and time-varying percept between tones and their melodic, harmonic, and [[Chromatic scale|chromatic]] contexts. In one conventional sense, tonality refers to just the [[Major scale|major]] and [[Minor scale|minor]] scale types – examples of scales whose elements are capable of maintaining a consistent set of functional relationships. The most important functional relationship is that of the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] note and the tonic chord with the rest of the scale. The tonic is the element which tends to assert its dominance and attraction over all others, and it functions as the ultimate point of attraction, rest and resolution for the scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krumhansl |first=Carol |title=Cognitive Foundations of Musical Pitch |year=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-514836-7}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right auditory cortex is primarily involved in perceiving  pitch, and parts of harmony, melody and rhythm.&lt;ref name="Tramo"/&gt; One study by Petr Janata found that there are tonality-sensitive areas in the [[medial prefrontal cortex]], the [[cerebellum]], the [[Superior temporal sulcus|superior temporal sulci]] of both hemispheres and the [[Superior temporal gyrus|superior temporal gyri]] (which has a skew towards the right hemisphere).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1076262 |title=The Cortical Topography of Tonal Structures Underlying Western Music |year=2002 |last1=Janata |first1=P. |journal=Science |volume=298 |issue=5601 |pages=2167–70 |pmid=12481131 |last2=Birk |first2=JL |last3=Van Horn |first3=JD |last4=Leman |first4=M |last5=Tillmann |first5=B |last6=Bharucha |first6=JJ|bibcode = 2002Sci...298.2167J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music production and performance==

===Motor control functions===

Musical performance usually involves at least three elementary motor control functions: timing, sequencing, and spatial organization of motor movements.  Accuracy in timing of movements is related to musical rhythm. Rhythm, the pattern of temporal intervals within a musical measure or [[musical phrase|phrase]], in turn creates the perception of stronger and weaker beats.&lt;ref name= Zatorre&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zatorre | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Halpern | first2 = A. R. | year = 2005 | title = Mental concerts: musical imagery and auditory cortex | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 9–12 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.06.013 | pmid=15996544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequencing and spatial organization relate to the expression of individual notes on a [[musical instrument]].

These functions and their neural mechanisms have been investigated separately in many studies, but little is known about their combined interaction in producing a complex musical performance.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;  The study of music requires examining them together.

====Timing====
Although neural mechanisms involved in timing movement have been studied rigorously over the past 20 years, much remains controversial.  The ability to phrase movements in precise time has been accredited to a neural [[metronome]] or clock mechanism where time is represented through oscillations or pulses.&lt;ref name= Buhusi &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buhusi | first1 = C.

[[Functional neuroimaging]] studies, as well as studies of brain-damaged patients, have linked movement timing to several [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] and sub-cortical regions, including the [[cerebellum]], [[basal ganglia]] and [[supplementary motor area]] (SMA).&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt; Specifically the basal ganglia and possibly the SMA have been implicated in interval timing at longer timescales (1 second and above), while the cerebellum may be more important for controlling motor timing at shorter timescales (milliseconds).&lt;ref name="Buhusi"/&gt;&lt;ref name= Lewis&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = P.

====Sequencing====
Motor sequencing has been explored in terms of either the ordering of individual movements, such as finger sequences for key presses, or the coordination of subcomponents of complex multi-joint movements.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt; Implicated in this process are various cortical and sub-cortical regions, including the basal ganglia, the SMA and the pre-SMA, the cerebellum, and the premotor and prefrontal cortices, all involved in the production and learning of motor sequences but without explicit evidence of their specific contributions or interactions amongst one another.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt; In animals, neurophysiological studies have demonstrated an interaction between the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia during the learning of movement sequences.&lt;ref name= Graybiel&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graybiel | first1 = A.

Chunking, defined as the re-organization or re-grouping of movement sequences into smaller sub-sequences during performance, is thought to facilitate the smooth performance of complex movements and to improve [[motor memory]].&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;  
Lastly, the premotor cortex has been shown to be involved in tasks that require the production of relatively complex sequences, and it may contribute to motor prediction.&lt;ref name= Janata&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janata | first1 = P. | last2 = Grafton | first2 = S.

====Spatial organization====
Few studies of complex motor control have distinguished between sequential and spatial organization, yet expert musical performances demand not only precise sequencing but also spatial organization of movements. Studies in animals and humans have established the involvement of [[parietal lobe|parietal]], sensory–motor and premotor cortices in the control of movements, when the integration of spatial, sensory and motor information is required.&lt;ref name= Johnson&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = P.

Clin. Neurophysiol. | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 283–296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Few studies so far have explicitly examined the role of spatial processing in the context of musical tasks.

===Auditory-motor interactions===

====Feedforward and feedback interactions====
An auditory–motor interaction may be loosely defined as any engagement of or communication between the two systems.  Two classes of auditory-motor interaction are "feedforward" and "feedback".&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;  In feedforward interactions, it is the auditory system that predominately influences the motor output, often in a predictive way.&lt;ref name= Large&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Large | first1 = E. W. | last2 = Palmer | first2 = C. | year = 2002 | title = Perceiving temporal regularity in music. | url = | journal = Cogn Sci | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 1–37 | doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2601_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the phenomenon of tapping to the beat, where the listener anticipates the rhythmic accents in a piece of music. Another example is the effect of music on movement disorders: rhythmic auditory stimuli have been shown to improve walking ability in [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[stroke]] patients.&lt;ref name= Thaut&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thaut | first1 = M. H. | last2 = McIntosh | first2 = G. C. | last3 = Rice | first3 = R. R. | year = 1997 | title = Rhythmic facilitation of gait training in hemiparetic stroke rehabilitation | url = | journal = J. Neurol. Sci. | volume = 151 | issue = | pages = 207–212 | doi=10.1016/s0022-510x(97)00146-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= McIntosh&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McIntosh | first1 = G. C. | last2 = Brown | first2 = S. H. | last3 = Rice | first3 = R. R. | last4 = Thaut | first4 = M. H. | year = 1997 | title = Rhythmic auditory-motor facilitation of gait patterns in patients with Parkinson's disease | url = | journal = J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 22–26 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.62.1.22| pmc = 486690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feedback interactions are particularly relevant in playing an instrument such as a violin, or in singing, where pitch is variable and must be continuously controlled. If auditory feedback is blocked, musicians can still execute well-rehearsed pieces, but expressive aspects of performance are affected.&lt;ref name= Repp&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Repp | first1 = B. H. | year = 1999 | title = Effects of auditory feedback deprivation on expressive piano performance | url = | journal = Music Perception | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 409–438 | doi=10.2307/40285802}}&lt;/ref&gt; When auditory feedback is experimentally manipulated by delays or distortions,&lt;ref name= Pfordresher&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pfordresher | first1 = P. Q. | last2 = Palmer | first2 = C. | year = 2006 | title = Effects of hearing the past, present, or future during music performance | url = | journal = Percept. Psychophys. | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 362–376 | doi=10.3758/bf03193683}}&lt;/ref&gt; motor performance is significantly altered: asynchronous feedback disrupts the timing of events, whereas alteration of pitch information disrupts the selection of appropriate actions, but not their timing. This suggests that disruptions occur because both actions and percepts depend on a single underlying mental representation.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;

====Models of auditory–motor interactions====
Several models of auditory–motor interactions have been advanced. The model of Hickok and Poeppel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hickok | first1 = G. | last2 = Poeppel | first2 = D. | year = 2004 | title = Dorsal and ventral streams: a framework for understanding aspects of the functional anatomy of language | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 67–99 | doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2003.10.011 | pmid=15037127}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is specific for speech processing, proposes that a ventral auditory stream maps sounds onto meaning, whereas a dorsal stream maps sounds onto articulatory representations. They and others&lt;ref name= Scott&gt;Scott, S. K. &amp; Johnsrude, I. S. "The neuroanatomical and functional organization of speech perception. ''Trends Neurosci''. 26, 100–107 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that posterior auditory regions at the parieto-temporal boundary are crucial parts of the auditory–motor interface, mapping auditory representations onto motor representations of speech, and onto melodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hickok | first1 = G. | last2 = Buchsbaum | first2 = B. | last3 = Humphries | first3 = C. | last4 = Muftuler | first4 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Auditory–motor interaction revealed by fMRI: speech, music, and working memory in area SPT | url = | journal = J. Cogn. Neurosci. | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 673–682 | doi=10.1162/089892903322307393 | pmid=12965041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mirror/echo neurons and auditory–motor interactions====
The [[mirror neuron]] system has an important role in neural models of sensory–motor integration. There is considerable evidence that neurons respond to both actions and the accumulated observation of actions.  A system proposed to explain this understanding of actions is that visual representations of actions are mapped onto our own motor system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rizzolatti | first1 = G. | last2 = Fogassi | first2 = L. | last3 = Gallese | first3 = V. | year = 2001 | title = Neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the understanding and imitation of action | doi = 10.1038/35090060 | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience| volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 661–670 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mirror neurons are activated both by the observation of goal-directed actions, and by the associated sounds produced during the action.  This suggests that the auditory modality can access the motor system.&lt;ref name= Kohler&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohler | first1 = E. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2002 | title = Hearing sounds, understanding actions: action representation in mirror neurons | url = | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = | pages = 846–848 | doi=10.1126/science.1070311 | pmid=12161656|bibcode = 2002Sci...297..846K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Keysers&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keysers | first1 = C. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2003 | title = Audiovisual mirror neurons and action recognition.

Results point to a broader involvement of the dPMC and other motor areas.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;

==Music and language==
{{See also|Musical semantics|Musical syntax}}
Certain aspects of [[language]] and melody have been shown to be processed in near identical functional brain areas.  Brown, Martinez and Parsons (2006) examined the neurological structural similarities between music and language.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.04785.x |title=Music and language side by side in the brain: A PET study of the generation of melodies and sentences |year=2006 |last1=Brown |first1=Steven |last2=Martinez |first2=Michael J. |last3=Parsons |first3=Lawrence M. |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=2791–803 |pmid=16817882}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Utilizing positron emission tomography (PET), the findings showed that both linguistic and melodic phrases produced activation in almost identical functional brain areas.  These areas included the [[primary motor cortex]], [[supplementary motor area]], [[Broca's area]], anterior insula, primary and secondary auditory cortices, temporal pole, [[basal ganglia]], ventral [[thalamus]] and posterior [[cerebellum]].  Differences were found in lateralization tendencies as language tasks favoured the left hemisphere, but the majority of activations were bilateral which produced significant overlap across modalities.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

Syntactical information mechanisms in both music and language have been shown to be processed similarly in the brain.  Jentschke, Koelsch, Sallat and Friederici (2008) conducted a study investigating the processing of music in children with [[Speech and language pathology in school settings#Specific language impairment|specific language impairments]] (SLI).&lt;ref name="Jentschke"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.2008.20135 |title=Children with Specific Language Impairment Also Show Impairment of Music-syntactic Processing |year=2008 |last1=Jentschke |first1=Sebastian |last2=Koelsch |first2=Stefan |last3=Sallat |first3=Stephan |last4=Friederici |first4=Angela D. |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=1940–51 |pmid=18416683}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children with typical language development (TLD) showed ERP patterns different from  those of children with SLI, which reflected their challenges in processing music-syntactic regularities.  Strong correlations between the ERAN (''Early Right Anterior Negativity''—a specific ERP measure) amplitude and linguistic and musical abilities provide additional evidence for the relationship of syntactical processing in music and language.&lt;ref name="Jentschke"/&gt;

However, production of melody and production of speech may be subserved by different neural networks.  Stewart, Walsh, Frith and Rothwell (2001) studied the differences between speech production and song production using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb05762.x |title=Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Produces Speech Arrest but Not Song Arrest |year=2006 |last1=Stewart |first1=Lauren |last2=Walsh |first2=Vincent |last3=Frith |first3=UTA |last4=Rothwell |first4=John |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=930 |pages=433–5 |pmid=11458860 |issue=1|bibcode = 2001NYASA.930..433S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stewart et al. found that TMS applied to the left [[frontal lobe]] disturbs speech but not melody supporting the idea that they are subserved by different areas of the brain.  The authors suggest that a reason for the difference is that speech generation can be localized well but the underlying mechanisms of melodic production cannot.  Alternatively, it was also suggested that speech production may be less robust than melodic production and thus more susceptible to interference.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;

Language processing is a function more of the left side of the brain than the right side, particularly Broca's area and [[Wernicke's area]], though the roles played by the two sides of the brain in processing different aspects of language are still unclear. Music is also processed by both the left and the right sides of the brain.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mb1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/nimg.2002.1154 |title=Bach Speaks: A Cortical "Language-Network" Serves the Processing of Music |year=2002 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Gunter |first2=Thomas C. |last3=v Cramon |first3=D.Yves |last4=Zysset |first4=Stefan |last5=Lohmann |first5=Gabriele |last6=Friederici |first6=Angela D. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=956–66 |pmid=12377169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence further suggest shared processing between language and music at the conceptual level.&lt;ref name=Daltrozzo09&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21113 |title=Conceptual Processing in Music as Revealed by N400 Effects on Words and Musical Targets |year=2009 |last1=Daltrozzo |first1=Jérôme |last2=Schön |first2=Daniele |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=1882–92 |pmid=18823240}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that, among music conservatory students, the prevalence of absolute pitch is much higher for speakers of tone language, even controlling for ethnic background, showing that language influences how musical tones are perceived.&lt;ref name="phil-43"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.2151799 |title=Absolute pitch among American and Chinese conservatory students: Prevalence differences, and evidence for a speech-related critical period |year=2006 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |last2=Henthorn |first2=Trevor |last3=Marvin |first3=Elizabeth |last4=Xu |first4=Hongshuai |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=719–22 |pmid=16521731|bibcode = 2006ASAJ..119..719D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-388"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.3081389 |title=Absolute pitch among students in an American music conservatory: Association with tone language fluency |year=2009 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |last2=Dooley |first2=Kevin |last3=Henthorn |first3=Trevor |last4=Head |first4=Brian |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=125 |issue=4 |pages=2398–403 |pmid=19354413|bibcode = 2009ASAJ..125.2398D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musician vs. non-musician processing ==

[[File:Player piano keyboard.jpg|right|thumb|Professional pianists show less cortical activation for complex finger movement tasks due to structural differences in the brain.]]

=== Differences ===

Brain structure within musicians and non-musicians is distinctly different.  Gaser and Schlaug (2003) compared brain structures of professional musicians with non-musicians and discovered [[Grey matter|gray matter]] volume differences in motor, auditory and visual-spatial brain regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14534258 |year=2003 |last1=Gaser |first1=C |last2=Schlaug |first2=G |title=Brain structures differ between musicians and non-musicians |volume=23 |issue=27 |pages=9240–5 |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, positive correlations were discovered between musician status (professional, amateur and non-musician) and gray matter volume in the primary motor and [[Somatosensory system|somatosensory areas]], [[Premotor cortex|premotor areas]], anterior superior parietal areas and in the inferior temporal gyrus bilaterally.  This strong association between musician status and gray matter differences supports the notion that musicians' brains show use-dependent structural changes.&lt;ref name="DoifpsygMissing"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00393 |title=Music, Neuroscience, and the Psychology of Well-Being: A Précis |year=2012 |last1=Croom |first1=Adam M. |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the distinct differences in several brain regions, it is unlikely that these differences are innate but rather due to the long-term acquisition and repetitive rehearsal of musical skills.

Brains of musicians also show functional differences from those of non-musicians.  Krings, Topper, Foltys, Erberich, Sparing, Willmes and Thron (2000) utilized fMRI to study brain area involvement of professional pianists and a control group while performing complex finger movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0304-3940(99)00930-1 |title=Cortical activation patterns during complex motor tasks in piano players and control subjects. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study |year=2000 |last1=Krings |first1=Timo |last2=Töpper |first2=Rudolf |last3=Foltys |first3=Henrik |last4=Erberich |first4=Stephan |last5=Sparing |first5=Roland |last6=Willmes |first6=Klaus |last7=Thron |first7=Armin |journal=Neuroscience Letters |volume=278 |issue=3 |pages=189–93 |pmid=10653025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Krings et al. found that the professional piano players showed lower levels of cortical activation in motor areas of the brain.  It was concluded that a lesser amount of neurons needed to be activated for the piano players due to long-term motor practice which results in the different cortical activation patterns.  Koeneke, Lutz, Wustenberg and Jancke (2004) reported similar findings in keyboard players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.wnr.0000127463.10147.e7 |title=Long-term training affects cerebellar processing in skilled keyboard players |year=2004 |last1=Koeneke |first1=Susan |last2=Lutz |first2=Kai |last3=Wüstenberg |first3=Torsten |last4=Jäncke |first4=Lutz |journal=NeuroReport |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=1279–82 |pmid=15167549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled keyboard players and a control group performed complex tasks involving unimanual and bimanual finger movements. During task conditions, strong hemodynamic responses in the cerebellum were shown by both non-musicians and keyboard players, but non-musicians showed the stronger response. This finding indicates that different cortical activation patterns emerge from long-term motor practice. This evidence supports previous data showing that musicians require fewer neurons to perform the same movements.

Musicians have been shown to have significantly more developed left planum temporales, and have also shown to have a greater word memory.&lt;ref&gt;(Chan et al.){{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan's study controlled for age, grade point average and years of education and found that when given a 16 word memory test, the musicians averaged one to two more words above their non musical counterparts.

=== Similarities ===

Studies have shown that the human brain has an implicit musical ability.&lt;ref name="KoelschGunter"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/089892900562183 |title=Brain Indices of Music Processing: "Nonmusicians" are Musical |year=2000 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Gunter |first2=Tomas |last3=Friederici |first3=Angela D. |last4=Schröger |first4=Erich |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=520–41 |pmid=10931776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KoelschSchroger"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1469-8986.3910038 |title=Music matters: Preattentive musicality of the human brain |year=2002 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Schroger |first2=Erich |last3=Gunter |first3=Thomas C. |journal=Psychophysiology |volume=39 |pages=38–48 |pmid=12206294 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Koelsch, Gunter, Friederici and Schoger (2000) investigated the influence of preceding musical context, task relevance of unexpected [[Chord (music)|chord]]s and the degree of probability of violation on music processing in both musicians and non-musicians.&lt;ref name="KoelschGunter"/&gt; Findings showed that the human brain unintentionally extrapolates expectations about impending auditory input. Even in non-musicians, the extrapolated expectations are consistent with music theory.  The ability to process information musically supports the idea of an implicit musical ability in the human brain.  In a follow-up study, Koelsch, Schroger, and Gunter (2002) investigated whether ERAN and N5 could be evoked preattentively in non-musicians.&lt;ref name="KoelschSchroger"/&gt; Findings showed that both ERAN and N5 can be elicited even in a situation where the musical stimulus is ignored by the listener indicating that there is a highly differentiated preattentive musicality in the human brain.

== Gender differences ==

Minor neurological differences regarding hemispheric processing exist between brains of males and females.  Koelsch, Maess, Grossmann and Friederici (2003) investigated music processing through EEG and ERPs and discovered gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001756-200304150-00010 |title=Electric brain responses reveal gender differences in music processing |year=2003 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Maess |first2=Burkhard |last3=Grossmann |first3=Tobias |last4=Friederici |first4=Angela D. |journal=NeuroReport |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=709–13 |pmid=12692468}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Findings showed that females process music information bilaterally and males process music with a right-hemispheric predominance.  However, the early negativity of males was also present over the left hemisphere.  This indicates that males do not exclusively utilize the right hemisphere for musical information processing.  In a follow-up study, Koelsch, Grossman, Gunter, Hahne, Schroger and Friederici (2003)  found that boys show lateralization of the early anterior negativity in the left hemisphere but found a bilateral effect in girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.2003.15.5.683 |title=Children Processing Music: Electric Brain Responses Reveal Musical Competence and Gender Differences |year=2003 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Grossmann |first2=Tobias |last3=Gunter |first3=Thomas C. |last4=Hahne |first4=Anja |last5=Schröger |first5=Erich |last6=Friederici |first6=Angela D. |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=683–93 |pmid=12965042}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This indicates a developmental effect as early negativity is lateralized in the right hemisphere in men and in the left hemisphere in boys.

== Handedness differences ==

It has been found that subjects who are lefthanded, particularly those who are also ambidextrous, perform better than righthanders on short term memory for the pitch.&lt;ref name="phil-4"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.622558 |title=Pitch memory: An advantage for the left-handed | volume=199 | issue=4328 |journal=Science |pages=559–560 |pmid=622558 |date=February 1978|bibcode = 1978Sci...199..559D  | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-25"&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutsch |first=Diana |chapter=Handedness and Memory for Tonal Pitch |editor1-first=Jeannine |editor1-last=Herron |title=Neuropsychology of Lefthandedness |pages=263–71 |year=1980 |chapterurl=http://philomel.com/pdf/Ch-Handedness-1980.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was hypothesized that this handedness advantage is due to the fact that lefthanders have more duplication of storage in the two hemispheres than do righthanders. Other work has shown that there are pronounced differences between righthanders and lefthanders (on a statistical basis) in how musical patterns are perceived, when sounds come from different regions of space.  This has been found, for example, in the [[Octave illusion]]&lt;ref name="phil-85"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/251307a0 |title=An auditory illusion |year=1974 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |journal=Nature |volume=251 |issue=5473 |pages=307–9 |pmid=4427654|bibcode = 1974Natur.251..307D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(83)90047-7 |title=The octave illusion in relation to handedness and familial handedness background |year=1983 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=289–93 |pmid=6877583}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Scale illusion]].&lt;ref name="phil-6"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.380573 |title=Two-channel listening to musical scales |year=1975 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=1156–60 |pmid=1127169|bibcode = 1975ASAJ...57.1156D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-22"&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutsch |first=D. |chapter=Grouping mechanisms in music |editor1-first=D. |editor1-last=Deutsch |title=The psychology of music |edition=2nd |pages=299–348 |year=1999 |chapterurl=http://philomel.com/pdf/PsychMus_Ch9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical imagery==
{{See also|Audiation}}
Musical imagery refers to the experience of replaying music by imagining it inside the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb05733.x |title=Cerebral Substrates of Musical Imagery |year=2006 |last1=Halpern |first1=Andrea R. |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=930 |pages=179–92 |pmid=11458829 |issue=1|bibcode = 2001NYASA.930..179H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Musicians show a superior ability for musical imagery due to intense musical training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06515.x |title=Neural basis of music imagery and the effect of musical expertise |year=2008 |last1=Herholz |first1=Sibylle C. |last2=Lappe |first2=Claudia |last3=Knief |first3=Arne |last4=Pantev |first4=Christo |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=28 |issue=11 |pages=2352–60 |pmid=19046375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Herholz, Lappe, Knief and Pantev (2008) investigated the differences in neural processing of a musical imagery task in musicians and non-musicians.  Utilizing magnetoencephalography (MEG), Herholz et al. examined differences in the processing of a musical imagery task with familiar melodies in musicians and non-musicians.  Specifically, the study examined whether the [[mismatch negativity]] (MMN) can be based solely on imagery of sounds.  The task involved participants listening to the beginning of a melody, continuation of the melody in his/her head and finally hearing a correct/incorrect tone as further continuation of the melody.  The imagery of these melodies was strong enough to obtain an early preattentive brain response to unanticipated violations of the imagined melodies in the musicians.  These results indicate similar neural correlates are relied upon for trained musicians imagery and perception.  Additionally, the findings suggest that modification of the imagery mismatch negativity (iMMN) through intense musical training results in achievement of a superior ability for imagery and preattentive processing of music.

Perceptual musical processes and musical imagery may share a neural substrate in the brain.  A PET study conducted by Zatorre, Halpern, Perry, Meyer and Evans (1996) investigated [[cerebral blood flow]] (CBF) changes related to auditory imagery and perceptual tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.1996.8.1.29 |title=Hearing in the Mind's Ear: A PET Investigation of Musical Imagery and Perception |year=1996 |last1=Zatorre |first1=Robert J. |last2=Halpern |first2=Andrea R. |last3=Perry |first3=David W. |last4=Meyer |first4=Ernst |last5=Evans |first5=Alan C. |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=8 |pages=29–46 |pmid=23972234 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tasks examined the involvement of particular anatomical regions as well as functional commonalities between perceptual processes and imagery. Similar patterns of CBF changes provided evidence supporting the notion that imagery processes share a substantial neural substrate with related perceptual processes. Bilateral neural activity in the secondary auditory cortex was associated with both perceiving and imagining songs. This implies that within the secondary auditory cortex, processes underlie the phenomenological impression of imagined sounds.  The [[supplementary motor area]] (SMA) was active in both imagery and perceptual tasks suggesting covert vocalization as an element of musical imagery.  CBF increases in the inferior frontal polar cortex and right thalamus suggest that these regions may be related to retrieval and/or generation of auditory information from memory.

== Absolute pitch ==

[[File:A C D notes.svg|right|150px|thumb|Musicians possessing perfect pitch can identify the pitch of musical tones without external reference.]]

{{Main|Absolute pitch}}

[[Absolute pitch]] (AP) is defined as the ability to identify the pitch of a musical tone or to produce a musical tone at a given pitch without the use of an external reference pitch.&lt;ref name="phil-494"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Absolute pitch In D. Deutsch (Ed.) | journal=The psychology of music, 3rd Edition | volume= | pages=141–182 | year=2013 |doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-381460-9.00005-5 | isbn=9780123814609 }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/PsyMus_3_Ch5_Absolute_Pitch.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.113.2.345 |title=Absolute pitch |year=1993 |last1=Takeuchi |first1=Annie H. |last2=Hulse |first2=Stewart H. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=345–61 |pmid=8451339}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neuroscientific research has not discovered a distinct activation pattern common for possessors of AP.  Zatorre, Perry, Beckett, Westbury and Evans (1998) examined the neural foundations of AP using functional and structural brain imaging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert J. |last1=Zatorre |first2=David W. |last2=Perry |first3=Christine A. |last3=Beckett |first4=Christopher F. |last4=Westbury |first5=Alan C. |last5=Evans |pmid=9501235 |year=1998 |title=Functional anatomy of musical processing in listeners with absolute pitch and relative pitch |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=3172–7 |pmc=19714 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |bibcode=1998PNAS...95.3172Z |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.6.3172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Positron emission tomography (PET) was utilized to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) in musicians possessing AP and musicians lacking AP.  When presented with musical tones, similar patterns of increased CBF in auditory cortical areas emerged in both groups.  AP possessors and non-AP subjects demonstrated similar patterns of left dorsolateral frontal activity when they performed relative pitch judgments.  However, in non-AP subjects activation in the right inferior frontal cortex was present whereas AP possessors showed no such activity.  This finding suggests that musicians with AP do not need access to working memory devices for such tasks.  These findings imply that there is no specific regional activation pattern unique to AP.  Rather, the availability of specific processing mechanisms and task demands determine the recruited neural areas.

== Emotion ==
{{Main|Music and emotion}}
[[Emotion]]s induced by music activate similar frontal brain regions compared to emotions elicited by other stimuli.&lt;ref name="DoifpsygMissing"/&gt; Schmidt and Trainor (2001) discovered that valence (i.e. positive vs. negative) of musical segments was distinguished by patterns of frontal EEG activity.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02699930126048 |title=Frontal brain electrical activity (EEG) distinguishes valence and intensity of musical emotions |year=2001 |last1=Schmidt |first1=Louis A. |last2=Trainor |first2=Laurel J. |journal=Cognition &amp; Emotion |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=487–500}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joyful and happy musical segments were associated with increases in left frontal EEG activity whereas fearful and sad musical segments were associated with increases in right frontal EEG activity.  Additionally, the intensity of emotions was differentiated by the pattern of overall frontal EEG activity.  Overall frontal region activity increased as affective musical stimuli became more intense.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

Music is able to create an incredibly pleasurable experience that can be described as "chills".&lt;ref name="Blood"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.191355898 |title=Intensely pleasurable responses to music correlate with activity in brain regions implicated in reward and emotion |year=2001 |last1=Blood |first1=A. J. |last2=Zatorre |first2=R. J. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=98 |issue=20 |pages=11818–11823|bibcode = 2001PNAS...9811818B |pmid=11573015 |pmc=58814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood and Zatorre (2001) used PET to measure changes in cerebral blood flow while participants listened to music that they knew to give them the "chills" or any sort of intensely pleasant emotional response. They found that as these chills increase, many changes in cerebral blood flow are seen in brain regions such as the [[amygdala]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]], [[ventral striatum]], [[midbrain]], and the ventral medial [[prefrontal cortex]]. Many of these areas appear to be linked to reward, motivation, emotion, and arousal, and are also activated in other pleasurable situations.&lt;ref name="Blood"/&gt; [[Nucleus accumbens#Research|Nucleus accumbens]] (a part of [[striatum]]) is involved in both music related emotions, as well as rhythmic timing.

When unpleasant melodies are played, the posterior [[cingulate cortex]] activates, which indicates a sense of conflict or emotional pain.&lt;ref name="Tramo"/&gt; The right hemisphere has also been found to be correlated with emotion, which can also activate areas in the cingulate in times of emotional pain, specifically social rejection (Eisenberger). This evidence, along with observations, has led many musical theorists, philosophers and neuroscientists to link emotion with tonality. This seems almost obvious because the tones in music ''seem'' like a characterization of the tones in human speech, which indicate emotional content. The [[vowels]] in the [[phonemes]] of a song are elongated for a dramatic effect, and it seems as though musical tones are simply exaggerations of the normal verbal tonality.

== Memory ==
{{Main|Music-related memory}}

=== Neuropsychology of musical memory ===

[[Music-related memory|Musical memory]] involves both explicit and implicit memory systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11065-009-9085-2 |title=Memory for Music in Alzheimer's Disease: Unforgettable? |year=2009 |last1=Baird |first1=Amee |last2=Samson |first2=Séverine |journal=Neuropsychology Review |volume=19 |pages=85–101 |pmid=19214750 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explicit musical memory is further differentiated between episodic (where, when and what of the musical experience) and semantic (memory for music knowledge including facts and emotional concepts). Implicit memory centers on the 'how' of music and involves automatic processes such as procedural memory and motor skill learning – in other words skills critical for playing an instrument. Samson and Baird (2009) found that the ability of musicians with Alzheimer's Disease to play an instrument (implicit procedural memory) may be preserved.

=== Neural correlates of musical memory ===

A PET study looking into the neural correlates of musical [[Semantic memory|semantic]] and [[episodic memory]] found distinct activation patterns.&lt;ref name="Platel"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00287-8 |title=Semantic and episodic memory of music are subserved by distinct neural networks |year=2003 |last1=Platel |first1=Hervé |last2=Baron |first2=Jean-Claude |last3=Desgranges |first3=Béatrice |last4=Bernard |first4=Frédéric |last5=Eustache |first5=Francis |journal=NeuroImage |volume=20 |pages=244–56 |pmid=14527585 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semantic musical memory involves the sense of familiarity of songs. The semantic memory for music condition resulted in bilateral activation in the medial and orbital frontal cortex, as well as activation in the left angular gyrus and the left anterior region of the middle temporal gyri. These patterns support the functional asymmetry favouring the left hemisphere for semantic memory. Left anterior temporal and inferior frontal regions that were activated in the musical semantic memory task produced activation peaks specifically during the presentation of musical material, suggestion that these regions are somewhat functionally specialized for musical semantic representations.

Episodic memory of musical information involves the ability to recall the former context associated with a musical excerpt.&lt;ref name="Platel"/&gt; In the condition invoking episodic memory for music, activations were found bilaterally in the middle and superior frontal gyri and precuneus, with activation predominant in the right hemisphere. Other studies have found the precuneus to become activated in successful episodic recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001756-199510020-00014 |title=Functional role of the prefrontal cortex in retrieval of memories: A PET study |year=1995 |last1=Kapur |first1=Shitij |last2=Craik |first2=Fergus I. M. |last3=Jones |first3=Corey |last4=Brown |first4=Gregory M. |last5=Houle |first5=Sylvain |last6=Tulving |first6=Endel |journal=NeuroReport |volume=6 |issue=14 |pages=1880–4 |pmid=8547589}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was activated in the familiar memory condition of episodic memory, this activation may be explained by the successful recall of the melody.

When it comes to memory for pitch, there appears to be a dynamic and distributed brain network subserves pitch memory processes. Gaab, Gaser, Zaehle, Jancke and Schlaug (2003) examined the functional anatomy of pitch memory using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00224-6 |title=Functional anatomy of pitch memory—an fMRI study with sparse temporal sampling |year=2003 |last1=Gaab |first1=Nadine |last2=Gaser |first2=Christian |last3=Zaehle |first3=Tino |last4=Jancke |first4=Lutz |last5=Schlaug |first5=Gottfried |journal=NeuroImage |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=1417–26 |pmid=12948699}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An analysis of performance scores in a pitch memory task resulted in a significant correlation between good task performance and the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) as well as the dorsolateral cerebellum.  Findings indicate that the dorsolateral cerebellum may act as a pitch discrimination processor and the SMG may act as a short-term pitch information storage site.  The left hemisphere was found to be more prominent in the pitch memory task than the right hemispheric regions.

=== Therapeutic effects of music on memory ===
Musical training has been shown to aid [[memory]].  Altenmuller et al. studied the difference between active and passive musical instruction and found both that over a longer (but not short) period of time, the actively taught students retained much more information than the passively taught students. The actively taught students were also found to have greater cerebral cortex activation. It should also be noted that the passively taught students weren't wasting their time; they, along with the active group, displayed greater left hemisphere activity, which is typical in trained musicians.&lt;ref name="Strickland"/&gt;

==Attention ==
Treder et al.&lt;ref name="Treder"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1741-2560/11/2/026009 |title=Decoding auditory attention to instruments in polyphonic music using single-trial EEG classification |year=2014 |last1=Treder |first1=Matthias |last2=Purwins |first2=Hendrik |last3=Miklody |first3=Daniel |last4=Sturm |first4=Irene |last5=Blankertz |first5=Benjamin |journal= Journal of Neural Engineering |volume=11| number=2 |pages=026009|bibcode = 2014JNEng..11b6009T }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified neural correlates of attention when listening to simplified polyphonic music patterns. In a musical oddball experiment, they had participants shift selective attention to one out of three different instruments in music audio clips, with each instrument occasionally playing one or several notes deviating from an otherwise repetitive pattern. Contrasting attended versus unattended instruments, ERP analysis shows subject- and instrument-specific responses including P300 and early auditory components. The attended instrument could be classified offline with high accuracy.  This indicates that attention paid to a particular instrument in polyphonic music can be inferred from ongoing EEG, a finding that is potentially relevant for building more ergonomic music-listing based brain-computer interfaces.&lt;ref name="Treder"/&gt;

==Development==
Musical four-year-olds have been found to have one greater left hemisphere intrahemispheric coherence.&lt;ref name="Strickland"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00094056.2002.10522714 |title=Review of Research: Music and the Brain in Childhood Development |year=2001 |last1=Burriss |first1=Kathleen Glascott |last2=Strickland |first2=Susan J. |journal=Childhood Education |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians have been found to have more developed anterior portions of the [[corpus callosum]] in a study by Cowell et al. in 1992.  This was confirmed by a study by Schlaug et al. in 1995 that found that classical musicians between the ages of 21 and 36 have significantly greater anterior corpora callosa than the non-musical control. Schlaug also found that there was a strong correlation of musical exposure before the age of seven, and a great increase in the size of the corpus callosum.&lt;ref name="Strickland"/&gt; These fibers join together the left and right hemispheres and indicate an increased relaying between both sides of the brain. This suggests the merging between the spatial- emotiono-tonal processing of the right brain and the linguistical processing of the left brain. This large relaying across many different areas of the brain might contribute to music's ability to aid in memory function.

== Impairment ==
{{Main|Music-specific disorders}}

=== Focal hand dystonia ===

Focal hand [[dystonia]] is a task-related movement disorder associated with occupational activities that require repetitive hand movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9646753 |year=1998 |last1=Chen |first1=R |last2=Hallett |first2=M |title=Focal dystonia and repetitive motion disorders |issue=351 |pages=102–6 |journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Focal hand dystonia is associated with abnormal processing in the premotor and primary sensorimotor cortices.  An fMRI study examined five guitarists with focal hand dystonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/nimg.2000.0615 |title=Brain Cortical Activation during Guitar-Induced Hand Dystonia Studied by Functional MRI |year=2000 |last1=Pujol |first1=J. |last2=Roset-Llobet |first2=J. |last3=Rosinés-Cubells |first3=D. |last4=Deus |first4=J. |last5=Narberhaus |first5=B. |last6=Valls-Solé |first6=J. |last7=Capdevila |first7=A. |last8=Pascual-Leone |first8=A. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=257–67 |pmid=10944408}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study reproduced task-specific hand dystonia by having guitarists use a real guitar neck inside the scanner as well as performing a guitar exercise to trigger abnormal hand movement.  The dystonic guitarists showed significantly more activation of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex as well as a bilateral underactivation of premotor areas.  This activation pattern represents abnormal recruitment of the cortical areas involved in motor control.  Even in professional musicians, widespread bilateral cortical region involvement is necessary to produce complex hand movements such as [[Musical scale|scales]] and [[arpeggio]]s.  The abnormal shift from premotor to primary sensorimotor activation directly correlates with guitar-induced hand dystonia.

=== Music agnosia ===

Music [[agnosia]], an [[auditory agnosia]], is a syndrome of selective impairment in music recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1076/jnmr.28.3.209.3108 |title=Music Agnosias: Selective Impairments of Music Recognition After Brain Damage |year=1999 |last1=Dalla Bella |first1=Simone |last2=Peretz |first2=Isabelle |journal=Journal of New Music Research |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=209–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three cases of music agnosia are examined by Dalla Bella and Peretz (1999); C.N., G.L., and I.R.. All three of these patients suffered bilateral damage to the auditory cortex which resulted in musical difficulties while speech understanding remained intact. Their impairment is specific to the recognition of once familiar melodies. They are spared in recognizing environmental sounds and in recognizing lyrics. Peretz (1996) has studied C.N.'s music agnosia further and reports an initial impairment of pitch processing and spared temporal processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.1996.8.6.481 |title=Can We Lose Memory for Music? A Case of Music Agnosia in a Nonmusician |year=1996 |last1=Peretz |first1=Isabelle |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=481–96 |pmid=23961980}}&lt;/ref&gt; C.N. later recovered in pitch processing abilities but remained impaired in tune recognition and familiarity judgments.

Musical agnosias  may be categorized based on the process which is impaired in the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/brain/123.9.1926 |title=Patterns of music agnosia associated with middle cerebral artery infarcts |year=2000 |last1=Ayotte |first1=J. |journal=Brain |volume=123 |issue=9 |pages=1926–38 |pmid=10960056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apperceptive music agnosia involves an impairment at the level of perceptual analysis involving an inability to encode musical information correctly. Associative music agnosia reflects an impaired representational system which disrupts music recognition. Many of the cases of music agnosia have resulted from surgery involving the middle cerebral artery. Patient studies have surmounted a large amount of evidence demonstrating that the left side of the brain is more suitable for holding long-term memory representations of music and that the right side is important for controlling access to these representations. Associative music agnosias tend to be produced by damage to the left hemisphere, while apperceptive music agnosia reflects damage to the right hemisphere.

=== Congenital amusia ===
Congenital [[amusia]], otherwise known as [[tone deafness]], is a term for lifelong musical problems which are not attributable to mental retardation, lack of exposure to music or deafness, or brain damage after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00600.x |title=Musical Disorders: From Behavior to Genes |year=2008 |last1=Peretz |first1=Isabelle |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=329–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amusic brains have been found in fMRI studies to have less white matter and thicker cortex than controls in the right inferior frontal cortex. These differences suggest abnormal neuronal development in the auditory cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, two areas which are important in musical-pitch processing.

Studies on those with [[amusia]] suggest different processes are involved in speech [[tonality]] and musical tonality. [[Congenital]] amusics lack the ability to distinguish between pitches and so are for example unmoved by dissonance and playing the wrong key on a piano. They also cannot be taught to remember a melody or to recite a song; however, they are still capable of hearing the intonation of speech, for example, distinguishing between "You speak French" and "You speak French?" when spoken.

=== Amygdala damage ===
[[File:Amgydala.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Damage to the [[amygdala]] may impair recognition of scary music.]]

Damage to the amygdala has selective emotional impairments on musical recognition.  Gosselin, Peretz, Johnsen and Adolphs (2007) studied S.M., a patient with bilateral damage of the [[amygdala]] with the rest of the temporal lobe undamaged and found that S.M. was impaired in recognition of scary and sad music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.07.012 |title=Amygdala damage impairs emotion recognition from music |year=2007 |last1=Gosselin |first1=Nathalie |last2=Peretz |first2=Isabelle |last3=Johnsen |first3=Erica |last4=Adolphs |first4=Ralph |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=236–44 |pmid=16970965}}&lt;/ref&gt; S.M.'s perception of happy music was normal, as was her ability to use cues such as tempo to distinguish between happy and sad music. It appears that damage specific to the amygdala can selectively impair recognition of scary music.

=== Selective deficit in music reading ===

Specific musical impairments may result from brain damage leaving other musical abilities intact.  Cappelletti, Waley-Cohen, Butterworth and Kopelman (2000) studied a single case study of patient P.K.C., a professional musician who sustained damage to the left posterior temporal lobe as well as a small right occipitotemporal lesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13554790008402780 |title=A selective loss of the ability to read and to write music |year=2000 |last1=Cappelletti |first1=M. |last2=Waley-Cohen |first2=H. |last3=Butterworth |first3=B. |last4=Kopelman |first4=M. |journal=Neurocase |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=321–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After sustaining damage to these regions, P.K.C. was selectively impaired in the areas of reading, writing and understanding musical notation but maintained other musical skills. The ability to read aloud letters, words, numbers and symbols (including musical ones) was retained. However, P.K.C. was unable to read aloud musical notes on the staff regardless of whether the task involved naming with the conventional letter or by singing or playing. Yet despite this specific deficit, P.K.C. retained the ability to remember and play familiar and new melodies.

=== Auditory arrhythmia ===

[[Auditory Arrhythmia|Arrhythmia in the auditory modality]] is defined as a disturbance of rhythmic sense; and includes deficits such as the inability to rhythmically perform music, the inability to keep time to music and the inability to discriminate between or reproduce rhythmic patterns.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0028-3932(01)00198-1 |title=Modelling rhythmic function in a musician post-stroke |year=2002 |last1=Wilson |first1=Sarah J |last2=Pressing |first2=Jeffrey L |last3=Wales |first3=Roger J |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=40 |issue=8 |pages=1494–505 |pmid=11931954}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study investigating the elements of rhythmic function examined Patient H.J., who acquired arrhythmia after sustaining a right temporoparietal infarct.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;  Damage to this region impaired H.J.'s central timing system which is essentially the basis of his global rhythmic impairment.  H.J. was unable to generate steady pulses in a tapping task.  These findings suggest that keeping a musical beat relies on functioning in the right temporal auditory cortex.
