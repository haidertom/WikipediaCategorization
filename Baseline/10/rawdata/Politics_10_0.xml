'''Catholic Church and politics''' aims to cover subjects of where the [[Catholic Church]] and [[politics]] share common ground.

==Background==
According to the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], "the separation of church and state does not require division between belief and public action, between moral principles and political choices, but protects the right of believers and religious groups to practice their faith and act on their values in public life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/faithful-citizenship/church-teaching/catholics-in-political-life.cfm "Catholics in Political Life", United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
As a program and a movement, political Catholicism - a political and cultural conception which promotes the ideas and social teaching of the [[Catholic Church]] (''[[Catholic social teaching]]'') in public life through government action - was started by [[Prussia]]n Catholics in the second half of the 19th century, as a response to [[secular]] social concepts. The main reason were the measures by Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] to limit the influence of Catholic Church, first in Prussia, and then in united Germany. That struggle is known in history as the ''[[Kulturkampf]]''.

From Germany, political Catholic social movements spread in [[Austria-Hungary]], especially in today's Austria, [[Christian Social Movement in Ukraine|Ukraine]], Slovenia and [[Croatian Catholic movement|Croatia]]. [[Catholic Action]] was the name of many groups of [[Laity|lay]] Catholics who were attempting to encourage a Catholic influence on political society.

After the 1891 [[encyclical]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' ''(Of New Things)'' by [[Pope Leo XIII]], political Catholic movements got a new impulse for development, and they spread the area of their involvement. With this encyclical, the Catholic Church expanded its interest in social, economical, political and cultural issues, and it called for a drastic conversion of Western society in the 19th century in the face of [[capitalist]] influences. Following the release of the document, the [[labour movement]] which had previously floundered began to flourish in Europe and later in North America. Catholic believers, both lay and clergy alike, had a desire for active social and political engagement in order to deal with acute social problems according to Catholic Christian principles, as opposed to a purely secular approach.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} For example, [[Mary Harris Jones]], better known as "Mother Jones", and the [[National Catholic Welfare Council]] were central in the campaign to end [[child labour]] in the [[United States]] during the early 20th century.

==Catholic movements in the 20th century==
{{more citations needed|date=July 2013}}

In the 20th century, Catholic political movements became very strong in Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Ireland, France and Latin America. What these movements had in common was a defense of the acquired rights of the Catholic Church (attacked by [[anticlerical]] politicians) and a defense of Christian faith and moral values (threatened by increasing [[secularization]]).  Members of opposing schools of thought called such attempts [[clericalism]].

These Catholic movements developed various forms of [[Christian democratic]] ideology, generally promoting a morally and socially conservative agenda whilst supporting a middle ground third way between unrestrained capitalism and state socialism.  [[Freemasons]] were seen mainly as enemies and vehement opponents of political Catholicism. A special situation occurred in Mexico, where an atheistic president ruled in the 1920s and oppressed the Church and Catholics.  This led to the open Christian revolution of 1926 to 1929, known as the [[Cristero War]].

Some of the earliest important political parties were:

*[[Conservative Catholic Party of Switzerland]] – 1848;
*[[Catholic Party (Belgium)]] – 1869;
*[[Centre Party (Germany)]] – with origins in 1870;
*[[Christian Social Party (Austria)]] – 1893;
*[[Popular Liberal Action]] in France – 1901;
*[[General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses]] ([[Netherlands]]) – 1904, transformed into the [[Roman Catholic State Party]] in 1926;
*[[Slovak People's Party]] – 1918;
*[[Croatian Popular Party (1919)|Croatian Popular Party]] – 1919;
*[[Italian People's Party (1919–1926)|Italian People's Party]] – 1919;
*[[Polish Christian Democratic Party]] – 1919;
*[[Bavarian People's Party]] – 1919;
*[[National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty]] in Mexico – 1924.
*[[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)]] - 1955

Most of these parties in Europe joined together in [[White International]] (1922). [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s mixture of Catholicism and nationalism received its own brand of [[National Catholicism]] and it inspired similar movements throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Payne1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley G. Payne|title=Spanish Catholicism: An Historical Overview|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGoqcg22N4gC&amp;pg=PR13|year=1984|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-09804-9|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to political parties, Catholic/Christian [[trade unions]] were created, which fought for [[worker's rights]]: the earliest include:

*[[Typographic Workers Trade Union]] in Spain (1897);
*[[Solidarity (South African trade union)|Solidarity]] in South Africa (1902);
*[[Confederation of Christian Trade Unions]] in Belgium (1904);
*[[Catholic Workers Union]] in  Mexico (1908);
*[[International Federation of Christian Trade Unions]] (IFCTO), in The Hague in 1920 (which was preceded by the [[International Secretariat of Christian Trade Unions]] founded in Zürich in 1908, led through the [[World Confederation of Labour]] (WCL) to today's [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC));
*[[French Confederation of Christian Workers]] (1919);
*[[Luxembourg Confederation of Christian Trade Unions]] (1921);
*[[Canadian Catholic Federation of Labour]] (1921)
*[[Young Christian Workers]] in Belgium (1924);
*[[Catholic Worker Movement]] in the USA (from 1933).

After World War II, more unions were formed, including:

*[[Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions]] (from 1950);
*[[Christian Trade Union Federation of Germany]] (from 1959);
*[[Christian Workers' Union]] in Belize (from 1963);
*[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] in Poland (from 1980).

Until the [[Second Vatican Council]], the Church did not always accept the model of modern democracy and its expansion into social and economic realms because it was wary of anticlerical socialistic tendencies. When Catholic social activists were perceived to be too extreme in social conflicts, the Church hierarchy tried to stop their excesses; occasions of this included the [[Worker-priest]] movement in France in the 1940s and 1950s, and [[liberation theology]] in Latin America in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. But some movements were strongly supported by the Church - in Australia the [[Catholic Social Studies Movement]] during the 1940s and 1950s, from which the [[National Civic Council]] has developed.

Catholic clergy and lay activists sometimes tended to support far-right leaders such [[Francisco Franco]] and [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], as well as the military regimes in [[Latin America]]. As a result, many workers involved in the [[labor movement]] joined [[social democratic]] and [[communist]] parties, which were sometimes secular and called for revolution against old values, which included religion and the Church.

In recent times, after the Second World War, Christian engagement in politics became weaker and even "Demo-Christian" parties by name lost some of their Christianity. Stronger Christian involvement in Europe on the beginning of the 21st century has produced some new small parties, for example those joined in the [[European Christian Political Movement]]. According to ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' columnist [[Ross Douthat]], part of the younger generation of Catholics are now showing a renewed interest in forms of political Catholicism such as a revived [[Integralism#Catholic Integralism|Catholic Integralism]] or [[Tradinista!]] socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Douthat, Ross (October 8, 2016).

'''Degressive proportionality''' is an approach to the allocation (between regions, states or other subdivisions) of seats in a legislature or other decision-making body. Degressive proportionality means that while the subdivisions do not each elect an equal number of members, smaller subdivisions are allocated more seats than would be allocated strictly in proportion to their population.

This is an alternative to, for instance,

* Each subdivision electing the same number of members (as in the [[United States Senate|US Senate]]),
* Each subdivision electing a number of members strictly proportional to its population (as in the [[US House of Representatives]]).

Degressive proportionality is intermediate between those two approaches. As a term it does not describe any one particular formula.

== Uses ==
=== Germany ===
Each German state has three to six seats in the [[Bundesrat of Germany]] depending on its population. This means the least populous state, Bremen (with 663,000 inhabitants), has three seats while the most populous one, North Rhine-Westphalia (with 18,058,000 inhabitants), has only six seats.

=== European Parliament ===
{{Main|Apportionment in the European Parliament}}
Under the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], the [[European Parliament]] uses a system of degressive proportionality to allocate its 750 seats among the member states of the [[European Union]]. Treaty negotiations, rather than a specific formula, determine the apportionment between member states.

== Minimum seats ==
[[File:State population per electoral vote.png|thumb|right|300px|State population per [[Electoral College (United States)|U.S. electoral college vote]] for the 50 states and Washington D.C.. States are ranked from left to right based on total population.]]
Any system that reserves a minimum number of seats for a sub-body is to some extent degressively proportional. One example is the election of the [[Electoral College (United States)|US presidential Electoral College]]. As each state has a minimum of three members of the college, voters in smaller states have disproportionally more say in the election than the national average.
Like the US Electoral College, Spain's Congress of Deputies adds two extra seats to the otherwise proportional number allocated to each Province.

== Advantages ==
* There may be a real or perceived danger that one or more of the largest subdivisions will dominate the legislature. That danger reduces if the votes of these subdivisions are reduced.
* The smallest subdivisions, especially those on the periphery of the territory, may have significantly different interests from many of the other subdivisions. There is a danger that these interests will be ignored if they have a tiny number of representatives. That danger reduces if their representation is increased.
* More pragmatically, the smallest subdivisions may be in a position to cause disproportionate trouble for the whole territory, for example by threatening to secede. That danger reduces if they are seen to be well-represented in the legislature.

==Disadvantages==
* Degressive proportionality goes against the basic democratic principle that all votes should count equally.
* Many of the advantages listed above would also apply to certain smaller areas that are ''not'' recognised as separate subdivisions for electoral purposes. (It may have happened as an accident of history or as a result of [[gerrymandering]].) It is unfair if they are not accorded the same treatment as areas that are recognised electorally as separate subdivisions.

== Methods for allocating weights ==
* [[Penrose method]] (square root of the population)

'''Liberal corporatism''' is the application of economic [[corporatism]] by [[Liberalism|liberal]] political parties and organizations, that recognizes the bargaining interests of multiple groups within society, such as in the business, labour, and agricultural sectors and licenses them to engage in bargaining over economic policy with the state.&lt;ref name="Frank Bealey 1999. P36"&gt;Frank Bealey, Richard A. Chapman, Michael Sheehan. ''Elements in political science''. Edinburgh, UK: Edinburgh University Press, 1999. P36. {{ISBN|0748611096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal corporatism is often in conflict from proponents of liberal [[Ontological pluralism|pluralism]] that opposes the granting of power to organized [[interest group]]s.&lt;ref name="Frank Bealey 1999. P36"/&gt; English liberal philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] supported corporatist-like economic associations as needing to predominate in society to create equality for labourers and give them a voice in management through democratic economic rights.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Samuel. ''The commercial society: foundations and challenges in a global age''. Lanham,USA; Plymouth, UK: Lexington Books, 2007. Pp. 109. {{ISBN|073911994X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a number of other forms of corporatism, liberal corporatism does not reject capitalism or [[individualism]], but believes that the capitalist firm is a social institution that requires its managers to go beyond achieving the [[Net income|bottom line]], by recognizing the needs of their members.&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 193"&gt;Waring, Stephen P. ''Taylorism Transformed: Scientific Management Theory Since 1945''. University of North Carolina Press, 1994. Pp. 193. {{ISBN|0807844691}}&lt;/ref&gt; This liberal corporatist ethic was similar to [[Taylorism]] but called for democratization of the capitalism firm.&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 193"/&gt; Liberal corporatists believed that inclusion of all members in the election of management would bring them into the process of management and in effect "reconcile ethics and efficiency, freedom and order, liberty and rationality".&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 193"/&gt;

Liberal corporatism was an influential component of the [[progressivism in the United States]] that has been referred to as "interest group liberalism".&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 134"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J. ''Corporatism and comparative politics''. M.E. Sharpe, 1996. Pp. 134. {{ISBN|156324716X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The support by labour leaders' advocacy of liberal corporatism of the U.S. progressives is believed to have been influenced by an attraction to the [[syndicalism]] and particularly the [[anarcho-syndicalism]] at the time in Europe.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 134"/&gt; In the United States, economic corporatism involving capital-labour cooperation was influential in the [[New Deal]] economic program of the United States in the 1930s as well as in [[Fordism]] and [[Keynesianism]].&lt;ref name="J. Barry Jones 2001. Pp. 243"&gt;R. J. Barry Jones. ''Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries A-F''. Taylor &amp; Frances, 2001. Pp. 243. {{ISBN|0415243521}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal corporatism is commonly supported by proponents in [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="Frank Bealey 1999.

The '''Yat-Sen Suit''', also called the '''Mao suit, Chinese tunic suit''' or '''Zhongshan suit''', is a style of [[Chinese clothing|Chinese]] [[menswear]] associated in [[China]] with [[Sun Yat-sen]] (better known to mainland Chinese as "Sun Zhongshan"), although it is more commonly associated in [[western world|the West]] with [[Mao Zedong]]. 

Sun Yat-sen introduced the style shortly after the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] as a form of [[national dress]] with distinct political symbolism. Following the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, Mao and other leaders continued to wear the garment as a symbol of [[proletariat|proletarian]] unity and as an Eastern counterpart to the [[business suit]]. It became less popular after the [[Opening Up Policy|Opening Up of China]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] but is still commonly worn by Chinese leaders during important state ceremonies and functions.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90785/6775781.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20151007-from-red-guards-to-bond-villains-why-the-mao-suit-endures&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s the Mao suit became fashionable among Western European, Australian, and New Zealander socialists and intellectuals. It was sometimes worn over a [[turtleneck]].

==Origins==
When the Republic was founded in 1912, the style of dress worn in China was based on [[Manchu]] dress (''[[qipao]]'' and ''[[changshan]]''), which had been imposed by the [[Qing Dynasty]] as a form of social control. The majority-[[Han Chinese]] revolutionaries who overthrew the Qing were fueled by failure of the Qing to defend China and a lack of scientific advancement compared to the West. Even before the founding of the Republic, older forms of Chinese dress were becoming unpopular among the elite and led to the development of Chinese dress which combined the changshan and the Western hat to form a new dress. The Zhongshan suit is a similar development which combined Western and Eastern fashions. 

The Zhongshan suit was an attempt to cater to contemporary sensibilities without adopting Western styles wholesale. Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]] was personally involved, providing inputs based on his life experience in [[Japan]]: the Japanese [[cadet]] uniform became a basis of the Zhongshan suit. There were other modifications as well: instead of the three hidden pockets in Western suits, the Zhongshan suit had four outside pockets to adhere to Chinese concepts of balance and symmetry; an inside pocket was also available. Over time, minor stylistic changes developed. The suit originally had seven buttons, later reduced to five.

After repeated attempts to win support and recognition from Western countries failed, the Nationalist Party government in Canton led by Sun gained help (advisers and small arms) from Soviet Russia, which viewed it as a likely revolutionary ally against Western interests in the Far East; Chinese nationalism at the time (of treaty ports and extraterritoriality discriminations) was heavily infected with resentment against the West. As a result of this geopolitical alignment, Sun agreed to permit the nascent Chinese Communist Party to join the Nationalist Party — as individual members — not as a party-party union, combination or alliance. As a result, early Communist Party members adopted the attire as a mark of joining the Nationalist Party. From that practice during an attenuated political marriage of convenience which would soon be divorced in blood (in 1927), Asian [[Marxism|Marxist]] movements and governments henceforth would all consider this attire as a standard of political coloration, and it would continue to be appropriate dress for both sides of the bitter Chinese civil wars lasting decades.

After [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s death in 1925, popular mythology assigned a revolutionary and patriotic significance to the Zhongshan suit. The four pockets were said to represent the [[Four Virtues]] cited in the classic ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'': Propriety, Justice, Honesty, and Shame. The five center-front buttons were said to represent the five Yuans (branches of government)–[[legislation]], [[Regulation|supervision]], [[Inspection|examination]], [[Administration (government)|administration]] and [[jurisdiction]]–cited in the [[constitution of the Republic of China]] and the three cuff-buttons to symbolize Sun Yat-sen's [[Three Principles of the People]]: Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood. Finally, unlike Western-style suits that are usually composed of two layers of cloth, the jacket is in a single piece—symbolizing China's unity and peace.

==Historical development==
In the 1920s and 1930s, civil servants of the Chinese government were required to wear the ''Zhongshan zhuang''. A slightly modified version of the suit, adapted for combat, formed the basis for [[National Revolutionary Army]] [[Army uniforms|uniforms]] leading up through the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], although during the 1930s, as German military advice and assistance to the National Government increased, the formal military uniform in the professional elements and ranks essentially became that of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] and then [[Nazi Germany]] (including the [[Stahlhelm|famous helmet]]). 

After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]], and especially during the long Maoist era culminating with the [[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976, the suit came to be widely worn by the entire male population as a symbol of proletarian unity; it was regularly worn by [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] until the 1990s when it was largely replaced by the Western [[business suit]].   

The Mao suit remained the standard formal dress for the [[generations of Chinese leadership|first and second generations of PRC leaders]] such as [[Deng Xiaoping]]. During the 1990s, it began to be worn with decreasing frequency by leaders of [[Jiang Zemin]]'s generation as more and more Chinese politicians began wearing traditional Western-style suits with [[neckties]]. Jiang wore it only on special occasions, such as to state dinners. Hu Jintao still wore the Mao suit, but only on special occasions, such as the ceremony marking the [[60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China|60th anniversary of the People's Republic]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90785/6775781.html "Mao suit continued choice of China's top leaders for National Day ceremony"], Xinhua, 1 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Hu Jintao even showed up to a [[black tie]] state dinner in the United States wearing a business suit, attracting some criticism for being underdressed at a formal occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chow|first1=Jason|title=What to Wear to a State Dinner|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2011/01/20/what-to-wear-to-a-state-dinner/|work=Scene Asia|agency=Wall Street Journal|date=January 20, 2011|quote=But Wednesday night, Chinese President Hu Jintao did not wear a tuxedo. Instead, he opted for a dark suit and conservative blue tie.  On a sartorial level, the Chinese President was shown up by his American counterpart and the first lady. President Obama wore an elegant dinner jacket; his wife, Michelle, a flowing red dress by Alexander McQueen.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Macartney|first1=Jane|title=Hu’s lounge suit was wrong on all counts|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/americas/article2881685.ece|agency=The Times (London)|date=January 20, 2011|quote=Hu Jintao should have chosen a beautifully cut Mao suit instead of a blue spotted tie for his first White House state dinner.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Xi Jinping administration, however, the Mao suit made a comeback as a [[diplomatic uniform]] and [[wikt:evening dress|evening dress]].

In [[Taiwan]], the Zhongshan suit was seldom seen after the 1970s.  Moreover, given the subtropical weather much of the year in Taiwan, a modified version which dropped the buttoned-up collar original constriction in favor of a Western-style open dress shirt collar became standard for a time.

==Symbol of national sovereignty==

The Mao suit is worn at the most formal ceremonies as a symbol of national sovereignty.  Chinese [[paramount leader]]s always wear Mao suits for military parades in Beijing, even though the Vice President and other Politburo officials wear Western business suits.  It is customary for Chinese leaders to wear Mao suits when attending [[state dinner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China State Dinners|url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/galleries/china-state-dinners|website=The White House Historical Association|accessdate=30 January 2016|quote=Presidents Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon speak with Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping of China during the State Dinner on January 29, 1979.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House State Dinner for the President of China|url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/102997.html|quote=The President and Mrs. Clinton are hosting His Excellency President Jiang Zemin and Madame Wang Yeping at a White House State Dinner on Wednesday, October 29, 1997.

The Mao suit also serves as a [[diplomatic uniform]].  Although Chinese ambassadors usually wear Western business suits, many Chinese ambassadors choose to wear a Mao suit when they present their [[Letter of credence|credentials]] to the head of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.E. Ambassador Zhang Weidong Presents Credentials to the President of Iceland|url=http://is.china-embassy.org/eng/xwdt/t1197299.htm|website=Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Republic of Iceland|date=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ambassador to Sweden Chen Yuming Presents Credentials to His Majesty the King of Sweden|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zwjg_665342/zwbd_665378/t1109701.shtml|website=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|date=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ambassador to Iran Pang Sen Presents Credentials to President Hassan Rouhani of Iran|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zwjg_665342/zwbd_665378/t1169220.shtml|website=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|date=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The presentation ceremony is symbolic of the [[diplomatic recognition]] that exists between the two countries, so it carries a higher level of formality than other diplomatic meetings.

A '''political gaffe''' is an error made by a politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gaffe?q=gaffe |title=Definition for gaffe – Oxford Dictionaries Online (World English) |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gaffe'' is of French origin, originally a 'boat hook' as in '[[gaff rig]]' where the relation is apparent, but the sense association to a blundering remark is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gaffe|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinsley gaffe==
A Kinsley gaffe occurs when a political gaffe reveals some truth that a politician did not intend to admit.&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gaffe  | first=Merriam | last=Webster  |authorlink=Merriam Webster| date= June 3, 1972  | title=Merriam Webster definition of Gaffe |publisher=[[Merriam Webster Dictionary]] | accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goddard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politicaldictionary.com/index/g/ |first1=Taegan |last1=Goddard |work=Taegan Goddard's Political Dictionary |publisher=[[Political Wire]] |title=Kinsley Gaffe |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from journalist [[Michael Kinsley]], who said, "A gaffe is when a politician tells the truth – some obvious truth he isn't supposed to say."&lt;ref name="Kinsley"&gt;{{citation |first=Michael |last=Kinsley|date=April 23, 1988 |title= Commentary: The gaffer speaks |newspaper=[[The Times]] |accessdate =2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="friedman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2011/08/word-of-the-week-kinsley-gaffe.html |title=Word of the Week: Kinsley Gaffe |first1=Nancy |last1=Friedman |date=August 22, 2011 |work=Fritinancy |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66ouyRf44?url=http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2011/08/word-of-the-week-kinsley-gaffe.html |archivedate=April 10, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term gaffe may be used to describe an inadvertent statement by a politician that the politician believes is true while the politician has not fully analyzed the consequences of publicly stating it. Another definition is a statement made when the politician privately believes it to be true, realizes the dire consequences of saying it, and yet inadvertently utters, in public, the unutterable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brill makes a "Kinsley gaffe" |url=http://sheckymagazine.com/2012/01/brill-makes-a-kinsley-gaffe/ |first1=Brian |last1=McKim |first2=Tracy |last2=Skene |publisher=Shecky Magazine.com|date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition is a politician's statement of what is on his or her mind{{mdash}}this may or may not be inadvertent{{mdash}}thereby leading to a ritualized 'gaffe dance' between candidates. While exhibiting umbrage or shock, and playing on the mistake, the 'offended candidate' must not exhibit anything resembling glee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jon.smajda.com/2008/10/23/michael-kinsey-on-the-ritual-of-the-gaffe/ |first1=Jon |last1=Smajda |title=Michael Kinsley on the ritual of the gaffe |date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kinsley2"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/06/opinion/la-oe-kinsley-limbaugh-20120306 |date=March 6, 2012 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Kinsley: Limbaugh and the hypocrisy of the gaffe |first1=Michael |last1=Kinsley |accessdate=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A propensity to concentrate on so-called 'gaffes' in campaigns has been criticized as a journalistic device that can lead to distraction from real issues.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;". . . the episode is a perfect gaffe precisely because its content was so meaningless. . ." {{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/06/origins-of-the-gaffe-politics-idiot-maker.html  |title=The Origins of the Gaffe, Politics’ Idiot-Maker |first1=Jonathan |last1=Chait |work=[[New York Magazine]] |date=June 14, 2012 |accessdate=August 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinsley gaffe is said to be a species of the general 'political gaffe.'&lt;ref name="Amira"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/06/taxonomy-of-gaffes.html |date=June 14, 2012 |title=A Taxonomy of Gaffes |newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] |first1=Dan |last1=Amira |location=New York, NY USA|accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsley himself posed the question: "Why should something a politician says by accident automatically be taken as a better sign of his or her real thinking than something he or she says on purpose?"&lt;ref name="kinsley2"/&gt;

[[Steven Pinker]] says that politicians use vague and indirect language to avoid making concrete statements, and that lazy journalists base political coverage around "gaffe spotting" rather than analysis of political platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS4xVcko9qw|title=Political Rhetoric, Explained - Steven Pinker|date=14 October 2008|via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Internet activism]] has created a new generation of [[negative campaigning]] where a political campaign can create [[attack ad]]s within an hour of a politician making a gaffe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/the-man-who-will-watch-every-word-tony-abbott-says-20130731-2qysi.html|title=Matthew McGregor Kevin Rudd Attack Dog, Mitt Romney Gaffe Video|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/rudd-flies-in-team-obama-20130730-2qxet.html|title=Rudd flies in Team Obama|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''raised fist''', or the '''clenched fist''', is a [[symbol]] of [[Social solidarity|solidarity]] and support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/02/22/every-movement-needs-a-symbol-enter-the-wisconsin-fist-of-solidarity/ |title=Every Movement Needs a Symbol: Enter The Wisconsin Fist of Solidarity |first=Megan |last=Gibson |publisher=Time |date=February 22, 2011 }}{{rs|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a [[salute]] to express unity, strength, defiance, or [[Resistance movement|resistance]]. 

==History==

[[File:Spanish War Children (restored).png|thumb|right|Children preparing for evacuation during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1930s), some giving the Republican salute. The Republicans showed a raised fist whereas the Nationalists gave the [[Roman salute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Calleja |first1=Eduardo Gonzále |chapter=The symbolism of violence during the Second Republic in Spain, 1931–1936 |title=The Splintering of Spain |chapterurl={{Google books|ypBS6N0aFJgC|page=23|plainurl=yes}} |pages=23–44 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511497025.005 |editor1-first=Chris |editor1-last=Ealham |editor2-first=Michael |editor2-last=Richards |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-511-49702-5 |quote=The Roman salute characteristic of Italian fascism was first adopted by the PNE and the JONS, later spreading to the Falange and other extreme right groups, before it became the official salute in Franco's Spain. The JAP salute, which consisted of stretching the right arm horizontally to touch the left shoulder enjoyed only relatively little acceptance. The gesture of the raised fist, so widespread among left-wing workers' groups, gave rise to more regimented variations, such as the salute with the fist on one's temple, characteristic of the German  ''[[Rotfrontkämpferbund|Rotfront]]'', which was adopted by the republican Popular Army. }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A raised fist was used as a [[logo]] by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]&lt;ref&gt;Joyce L. Kornbluh, Solidarity, 1917; Rebel Voices: An IWW Anthology, Charles H. Kerr Publishing, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; (IWW) in 1917. However, it was popularised during the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936-1939, when it was used by the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]] as a greeting, and was known as the "[[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] salute" or the "[[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] salute". The salute subsequently spread among leftists and anti-fascists across Europe.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17739105 |title=Breivik: What's behind clenched-fist salutes? |last=Kelly |first=Jon |date=17 April 2012 |website=[[bbc.co.uk]] |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphic symbol was popularised in 1948 by [[Taller de Gráfica Popular]], a print shop in [[Mexico]] that used art to advance revolutionary social causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Bancroft/BANC_PIC_2001_206.html|title=Mexican posters on social and educational themes|work=docspopuli.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use spread through the United States in the 1960s after artist and activist [[Frank Cieciorka]] produced a simplified version for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]]: this version was subsequently used by [[Students for a Democratic Society]] and the [[Black Power movement]].&lt;ref name=aiga&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aiga.org/not-your-grandparent-s-clenched-fist |title=Not Your Grandparent’s Clenched Fist |last=Patton |first=Phil |date=10 January 2006 |website=[[American Institute of Graphic Arts]] |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The raised fist was frequently used in propaganda posters produced during the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 revolt in France]], such as ''La Lutte continue'', depicting a factory chimney topped with a clenched fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rfi.fr/20180404-culture-france-may-68-posters-show-where-they-were-made-beaux-arts-paris |title=France May 68: the art of revolution |last=Hird |first=Alison |date=4 April 2018 |website=[[rfi.fr]] |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Considine |first1=Liam |date=Autumn 2015 |title=Screen Politics: Pop Art and the Atelier Populaire |url=https://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/24/screen-politics-pop-art-and-the-atelier-populaire |journal=Tate Papers |issn=1753-9854 |issue=24 |access-date=7 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/arts/design/may-1968-paris.html |title=Printing a Revolution: The Posters of Paris ’68 |last=Rubin |first=Alissa J. |author-link=Alissa J.

The symbol has been picked up and incorporated around the world by various [[oppression|oppressed]] groups. In 2015 it has emerged in the southeast area of Ukraine among the [[separatists]] battling the Ukraine Kiev government forces, along with the phrase "¡No Pasarán!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Senesi |first=Vauro |date=19 January 2015 |title=Viaggio in Ucraina: al fronte di Lugansk con i ribelli filorussi.

The image gallery shows how a raised fist is used in [[visual communication]]. Combined with another [[graphic design|graphic element]], a raised fist is used to convey [[polysemous]] [[gesture]]s and opposing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hat4PMRx7lUC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=raised%20fist&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=raised%20fist&amp;f=false|title=Elements of Meaning in Gesture|first=Geneviève|last=Calbris|date=1 January 2011|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|accessdate=16 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the elements combined, the meaning of the gesture changes in [[Tone (literature)|tone]] and [[intention]]. For example, a [[hammer and sickle]] combined with a raised fist is part of [[communist symbolism]], while the same fist combined with a [[Venus symbol]] represents [[Feminism]], and combined with a [[book]], it represents [[librarian]]s.

A raised-fist icon appears prominently as a feminist symbol on the covers of two major books by [[Robin Morgan]], ''[[Sisterhood is Powerful]]'', published in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robinmorgan.us/robin_morgan_bookDetails.asp?ProductID=9 Author's website], as accessed September 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sisterhood Is Forever'', in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robinmorgan.us/robin_morgan_bookDetails.asp?ProductID=7 Author's website], as accessed September 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol had been popularised in the feminist movement during the [[Miss America protest]] in 1968 which Morgan co-organised.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

The raised fist logo may represent unity or solidarity, generally with oppressed peoples. The black fist, also known as the [[Black Power]] fist is a logo generally associated with [[black nationalism]] and sometimes [[socialism]]. Its most widely known usage is by the [[Black Panther Party]] in the 1960s. A black fist logo was also adopted by the [[northern soul]] music [[subculture]]. The white fist, also known as the Aryan fist or the [[White Supremacy|White Power]] fist is a logo generally associated with [[white nationalism]].

A white fist holding a red rose is used by the [[Socialist International]] and some socialist or [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties, such as the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party in France]] and the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

[[Ulster loyalism|Loyalists]] in [[Northern Ireland]] occasionally use a red clenched fist on [[Northern Irish murals|murals]] depicting the [[Red Hand of Ulster]]. However, this is considered rare; the red hand is usually depicted with a flat palm.

[[Irish Republicans]] often have the raised fist as a symbol of resistance against British rule.

The Gonzo fist emblem is characterized by two thumbs and four fingers holding a [[peyote]] button, was originally used in [[Hunter S. Thompson|Hunter S. Thompson's]] 1970 campaign for sheriff of [[Aspen, Colorado]]. It has become a symbol of Thompson and [[gonzo journalism]] as a whole.

The [[Unicode]] character for the raised fist is {{unichar|270A}}.

The raised fist salute consists of raising one arm in the air with a clenched fist. The meaning can vary based on context.

[[Image:Raised Fist at antiwar demo.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|February 15, 2003]]: A woman raises her fist in solidarity with protestors opposing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].]]

Different movements sometimes use different terms to describe the raised fist salute: amongst communists and socialists, it is sometimes called the red salute, whereas amongst some African-American activists, especially in the United States it has been called the [[Black Power]] salute. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], it was sometimes known as the [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] salute.

The clenched fist gesture is sometimes thought to have originated in the [[Spanish Civil War]], where the Popular Front salute was at one time the standard salute of Republican forces. A letter from the Spanish Civil War stated: "...the raised fist which greets you in Salud is not just a gesture—it means life and liberty being fought for and a greeting of solidarity with the democratic peoples of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe, Mary. Letter to Leo Hurwitz and Janey Dudley, 25 November 1938. Reprinted in Cary Nelson and Jefferson Hendricks, eds. "Madrid 1937: Letters of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade from the Spanish Civil War," Routledge: 1996. Reprinted online [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/scw/letters.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rotfrontkämpferbund]] [[paramilitary]] organization of [[Communist Party of Germany]] used the salute before [[World War II]] as a probable counter-gesture to the fascist salute.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, Gottfried: "Symbolgeschichte als Sozialgeschichte? Zehn vorläufige Notizen zu den Bild- und Zeichensystemen sozialer Bewegungen in Deutschland", in: Warneken, Bernd Jürgen (Hg.): "Massenmedium Strasse. Zur Kulturgeschichte der Demonstrationen." Frakfurt/Main 1991. S. 27–28. Cited in: Schulte-Rummel, Sven "Die politische Symbolik der Kommunistischen Partei Deutschlands in der Weimarer Republlik" [http://www.hausarbeiten.de/faecher/vorschau/95026.html].
"Im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Symbolen der Kommunisten beginnt die Geschichte der geballten Faust in der Ära der Weimarer Republik. Sie war prägendes Symbol bei Straßenaufmärschen, Spiegel der gewaltbereiten Demonstranten, die voller Frust über das System dem Staat die geballte Faust zeigten." Translation: "Unlikely the most of other Communists symbols, the history of Raised fist started in the era of Weimar Republic. It was a definitive symbol of street marches, reflection of the marchers who were ready for violence, who were disappointed by the whole system of the state and showed their clenched fists to it."&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]], medal winners [[John Carlos]] and [[Tommie Smith]] [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|gave the raised fist salute]] during the American [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] as a sign of black power, and as a protest on behalf of the Olympic Project for Human Rights. For this, they were banned from further Olympic activities. The event was one of the most overtly political statements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2393575,00.html | publisher=[[The Sunday Times]] | last=Lewis | first=Richard | date=2006-10-08 | title=Caught in Time: Black Power salute, Mexico, 1968 | accessdate=2008-11-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the history of the modern [[Olympic Games]]. Tommie Smith stated in his autobiography, "Silent Gesture", that the salute was not a Black Power salute, but in fact a [[human rights]] salute.

[[Nelson Mandela]] also used the clenched fist salute upon his release from [[Victor Verster Prison]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

A raised White fist is also a popular [[White nationalism#White power|White Power]] symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/raised-fist-salute-has-varied-meanings/ |title=Raised-Fist Salute Has Varied Meanings |first=J.

Similarly [[Carlos the Jackal]] used the gesture in court, and [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] raised his fist to photographers after his arrest for the [[assassination of John F.

The raised fist is used by officials in Mainland China when being sworn into office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.gov.cn/premier/news/2016/09/18/content_281475445040096.htm|title=State Council holds first swearing-in ceremony to uphold Constitution|work=english.gov.cn|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] has suggested that the appeal of the salute is that it allows the individual to indicate that they "intend to meet malevolent, massive institutional force with force of (their) own", and that they are bound in struggle with others against common oppression.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

'''Theories of political behavior''', as an aspect of [[political science]], attempt to quantify and explain the influences that define a person's political views, [[ideology]], and levels of political participation. Broadly speaking, behavior is political whenever individuals or groups try to influence or escape the influence of others. Political behavior is the subset of human behavior that involves politics and powers.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, William Roberts, Matt Golder, and Sona N. Golder. 2013. “Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game.”&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists who have had an influence on this field include [[Karl Deutsch]] and [[Theodor Adorno]].

==Long-term influences on political orientation==
Interaction with the political views of parental figures is often thought of as the primary long-term influence on political orientation and willingness to take part in the political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gidengil|first=Elisabeth|last2=Wass|first2=Hanna|last3=Valaste|first3=Maria|date=June 2016|title=Political Socialization and Voting: The Parent-Child Link in Turnout|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44018017|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=69|pages=373-383|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/14515/teens-stay-true-parents-political-perspectives.aspx|title=Teens Stay True to Parents' Political Perspectives|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Teacher]]s and other educational authority figures are also often thought to have a significant impact on political orientation. During the 2003-2004 school year, In the United States, students spent an average of 180.4 days in primary and secondary education each year, with a school day being defined as approximately 6.7 class hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/tables/table_2004_06.asp|title=Private School Universe Survey (PSS)|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that on average a student will spend around 1,208.68 hours in class each year. [[Post-secondary education]] appears to have an impact on both voting rates and political identification; as a study of 9,784,931 college students found that they voted at a rate of 68.5% in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://idhe.tufts.edu/nslve/2016|title=2016 NSLVE National Data|last=|first=|date=2017-09-18|website=Institute for Democracy &amp; Higher Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to the average of 46.1% for citizens aged 18-29 who voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html|title=Voting in America:  A Look at the 2016 Presidential Election|last=Bureau|first=US Census|work=The United States Census Bureau|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Peers also affect political orientation. Friends often, but not necessarily, have the advantage of being part of the same generation, which collectively develops a unique set of societal issues; Eric L. Dey has argued that "socialisation is the process through which individuals acquire knowledge, habits, and value orientations that will be useful in the future."&lt;ref&gt;Dey, Eric L., ''Undergraduate Political Attitudes: Peer Influence in Changing Social Contexts'', Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 68, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to relate on this common level is what fuels and enables future ideological growth.

Sociologists and political scientists debate the relationship between age and the formation of political attitudes. The [[impressionable years hypothesis]] postulates that political orientation is solidified during early adulthood. By contrast, the "increasing persistence hypothesis" posits that attitudes become less likely to change as individuals become older, while the "life-long openness hypothesis" proposes that the attitudes of individuals remain flexible regardless of age.&lt;ref name="krosnick1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krosnick|first1=Jon A.|last2=Alwin|first2=Duane F.|title=Aging and Susceptibility to Attitude Change|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1989|volume=57|issue=3|pages=416–425|url=https://pprg.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/1989-Aging-and-Att-Change-Krosnick-and-Alwin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short-term influences on political orientation==
Short-term factors also affect [[voting behavior]]; the [[mass media|media]] and the impact of individual [[election]] issues are among these factors. These factors differ from the long-term factors as they are often short-lived. However, they can be just as crucial in modifying political orientation. The ways in which these two sources are interpreted often relies on the individuals specific political ideology formed by the long-term factors.

Most [[political scientist]]s agree that the mass media have a profound impact on voting behavior. One author asserts that "few would argue with the notion that the institutions of the mass media are important to contemporary politics ... in the transition to liberal democratic politics in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Europe]] the media was a key battleground."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://guidetowinningelections.com/do-mass-media-influence-the-political-behavior-of-citizens/|title=Do Mass Media Influence the Political Behavior of Citizens|date=2013-11-26|work=The Guide to Winning Elections|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, there are election issues. These include campaign issues, debates and commercials. Election years and political campaigns can shift certain political behaviors based on the candidates involved, which have different degrees of effectiveness in influencing voters.

==The influence of social groups on political outcomes==
Recently, some political scientists have been interested in many studies which aimed to analyze the relation between the behavior of social groups and the political outcomes. Some of the social groups included in their studies have been age demographics, [[gender]], and [[ethnic groups]].

For example, in [[U.S. politics]], the effect of ethnic groups and gender has a great influence on the political outcomes.

[[Latin Americans]] have a profound social impact on the political outcome of their vote and are emerging as a strong up-and-coming political force. The most noticeable increase in Latin American voting was in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], although the votes did not share a socially common political view at that time. In the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 election]], the Latin American vote aided tremendously in the election of [[Florida]] [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Mel Martinez]], although in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], about 44% of Latin Americans voted for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[George W. Bush]]. However, Latin Americans have the lowest voting rate in the United States, with only 47.6% voting in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html|title=Voting in America:  A Look at the 2016 Presidential Election|last=Bureau|first=US Census|work=The United States Census Bureau|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently illegal immigration has been claiming the most attention and Latin Americans, although not completely unanimous, are concerned with the education, employment and deportation of illegal immigrants in the United States. Although the majority of Latin Americans vote for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates, [[Cuban Americans]] are likely the most conservative of Latinos, with 54% of Cuban American voters casting ballots for [[Donald Trump]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]], compared to an average of 35% of all Latinos who voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/15/unlike-other-latinos-about-half-of-cuban-voters-in-florida-backed-trump/|title=About half of Cuban voters in Florida backed Trump|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was represents a net decrease in support for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] among Cuban Americans, it continues a trend created by the [[Cuban exile|exile of many Cubans]] after the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/op-ed/articles/2016-11-16/2016-highlighted-the-growing-complexity-of-the-cuban-american-vote|title=The Complex Cuban Vote|last=Lopez-Gottardi|first=Cristina|date=2016-11-16|work=U.S. News|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[African Americans]] have the second highest voting rates in the United States and even surpassed white voters in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential Election]], although this has declined in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]]. In the 2008 Presidential Election and [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 Presidential election]], African Americans voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidate, [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-2008/|title=How Groups Voted in 2008 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-2012/|title=How Groups Voted in 2012 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend of African Americans voting for candidates of the Democratic Party continued into the 2016 Presidential Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/groups-voted-2016/|title=How Groups Voted 2016 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in the United States have, in the past 30 years, surpassed male voting rates, with the 2016 Presidential Election having a ratio between females and males of 52 to 48.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-1980/|title=How Groups Voted in 1980 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-1984/|title=How Groups Voted in 1984 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-1988/|title=How Groups Voted in 1988 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/groups-voted-2016/|title=How Groups Voted 2016 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend is often referred to as the Gender Gap and when combined with the tendency of women to vote for Democratic candidates, their effect on political outcomes is extremely important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/opinion/trump-midterms-gender-gap.html|title=Opinion {{!}} What Happens if the Gender Gap Becomes a Gender Chasm?|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
== Biology and political science ==
Interdisciplinary studies in [[biology and political science]] aim to identify correlates of political behavior with biological aspects, for example the linkage of [[biology and political orientation]], but also with other aspects like [[partisanship]] and [[voting behavior]].&lt;ref name="SomitPeterson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Somit|author2=Steven A. Peterson|title=Biology and Political Behavior: The Brain, Genes and Politics - The Cutting Edge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__M0gG5kWg8C&amp;pg=PA232|year=2011|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=978-0-85724-580-9|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field of study is typically referred to [[genopolitics]] although it is sometimes referred to as [[biopolitics]],&lt;ref name="Blank2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Blank|title=Biology and Political Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAXYIkbWxawC|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-20436-1|quote=This book demonstrates the increasing convergence of interest of some social scientists in the theories, research and findings of the life sciences in building a more interdisciplinary approach to the study of politics. It discusses the development of biopolitics as an academic perspective within political science, reviews the growing literature in biopolitics, and presents a coherent view of biopolitics as a framework for structuring inquiry across the current subfields of political science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the term has other meanings.

The study of possible genetic bases of political behavior has grown since the 1980s. The term [[genopolitics]] was coined by political scientist [[James H. Fowler|James Fowler]] in the early-2000s to describe research into identifying specific transporter/receptor genes responsible for ideological orientation beyond the sociopsychological realm of political socialisation.

==Political participation==

Political scientists also aim to understand what drives individuals to participate in the democratic process, either by voting, volunteering for campaigns, signing petitions or protesting. Participation cannot always be explained by rational behavior. The [[voting paradox]], for example, points out that it cannot be in a citizen's self-interest to vote because the effort it takes to vote will almost always outweigh the benefits of voting, particularly considering a single vote is unlikely to change an electoral outcome. Political scientists instead propose that citizens vote for psychological or social reasons. Studies show, for example, that individuals are more likely to vote if they see their friends have voted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Corbyn |first1=Zoe |title=Facebook experiment boosts US voter turnout |url=https://www.nature.com/news/facebook-experiment-boosts-us-voter-turnout-1.11401 |website=Nature |accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if someone in their household has received a nudge to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nickerson |first1=David |title=Is Voting Contagious? Evidence from Two Field Experiments |journal=American Political Science Review |date=February 2008 |volume=102 |issue=1 |jstor=27644497}}&lt;/ref&gt;
