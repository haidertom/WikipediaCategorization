[[File:Baseball diamond marines.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The baseball diamond of the [[San Diego]] [[San Diego Padres|Padres]]' [[Petco Park]], seen from the left-field stands.]]

A '''baseball field''', also called a '''ball field''', '''sandlot''' or a '''baseball diamond''', is the [[playing field|field]] upon which the game of [[baseball]] is played. The term can also be used as a [[metonym]] for a [[baseball park]].

==Specifications==
:''Unless otherwise noted, the specifications discussed in this section refer to those described within the [[Official Baseball Rules]], under which Major League Baseball is played.''&lt;ref name="Rule1" /&gt;
[[File:Baseball diamond.svg|thumb|500px|Diagram of a baseball field.]]
The starting point for much of the action on the field is [[home plate]] (officially "home base"), which is a five-sided slab of whitened rubber, {{convert|17|in|cm}} square with two of the corners removed so that one edge is 17 inches long, two adjacent sides are {{convert|8.5|in|cm}} and the remaining two sides are {{convert|12|in|cm}} and set at an angle to make a point. The plate is set into the ground such that its surface is level with the surrounding ground. Adjacent to each of the two parallel 8.5-inch sides is a batter's box. The point of home plate where the two 12-inch sides meet at right angles is at one corner of a {{convert|90|ft|m|2|adj=on}} square. The other three corners of the square, in counterclockwise order from home plate, are called [[first base|first]], [[second base|second]], and [[third base]]. Three canvas or rubber bases {{convert|15|in|cm}} square and {{convert|3|-|5|in|cm}} in thickness made of soft material mark the three bases.

Near the center of the square is an artificial hill known as the pitcher's mound, atop which is a white rubber slab known as the pitcher's plate, colloquially the "rubber." The specifications for the pitcher's mound are described [[#Pitcher's mound|below]].

All the bases, including home plate, lie entirely within fair territory. Thus, any batted ball that touches those bases must necessarily be in fair territory. While the first and third base bags are placed so that they lie inside the 90-foot square formed by the bases, the second base bag is placed so that its center (unlike first, third and home) coincides exactly with the "point" of the ninety-foot square. Thus, although the "points" of the bases are 90 feet apart, the physical distance between each successive pair of base markers is closer to {{convert|88|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=DIAGRAM NO 2|page=5|title=Official Rules of Major League Baseball, 2013 Edition|publisher=Triumph Books|isbn=978-1-60078-797-3|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2013/official_baseball_rules.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines from home plate to first and third bases extend to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction and are called the foul lines. The portion of the playing field between (and including) the foul lines is fair territory; the rest is "foul territory." The area within the square formed by the bases is officially called the infield, though colloquially this term also includes fair territory in the vicinity of the square; fair territory outside the infield is known as the outfield. Most baseball fields are enclosed with a fence that marks the outer edge of the outfield. The fence is usually set at a distance ranging from {{convert|300|to|420|ft|m|-1}} from home plate. Most professional and college baseball fields have a right and left foul pole. These poles are at the intersection of the foul lines and the respective ends of the outfield fence and, unless otherwise specified within the [[ground rules]], lie in fair territory. Thus, a batted ball that passes over the outfield wall in flight and touches the foul pole is a fair ball and the batter is awarded a home run.

==First base==
{{main|First baseman}}
[[File:Chris Davis, Kevin Pillar (34422505340).jpg|thumb|right|[[Kevin Pillar]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] reaches first base safely as Chris Davis of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] attempts to scoop a bouncing ball thrown by one of the other infielders during a game in May 2017]] 

First base is the first of four bases that must be touched by a player on the batting team in order to score a run. Unlike when an offensive player reaches second or third base, it is permissible for a batter-runner to overrun first base without being in jeopardy of being put out. After contact is made with the base, the batter-runner may slow down and return to first base at his leisure, so long as he makes no move or attempt to advance to second base.

The first baseman is the defensive player responsible for the area near first base. A professional first baseman is often a slow runner and tall.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  A tall first baseman presents a large target to which other fielders can throw, and his height gives him a larger range in reaching and catching errant throws. Players who are left-handed are marginally preferable for first base because: first, it is easier for a left-handed fielder to catch a [[Pickoff|pick-off]] throw from the pitcher and tag the baserunner; and, second, it is easier for a left handed thrower to make the throw to second base to start a 3–6–3, 3–6–4, or a 3–6–1 double play.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Also, a right-handed first baseman must, when setting himself up to receive a throw from an infielder, execute a half-pivot near the base; this is a move that a left-hander need not make (this advantage is very marginal, however). There are three infield positions that can only effectively be occupied by right-handed players: 2nd base, 3rd base, and shortstop. This is because of the time it takes to pivot and set to throw. It takes a left-handed thrower more time to make that pivot and in the fast-paced major league game, that time is critical. As a result, there are fewer positions a left-handed player can occupy, and if that player is not fast, the outfield may not be a good fit.

In the [[Baseball scorekeeping|numbering system]] used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.

==Second base==
{{main|Second baseman}}
[[File:Second baseman Brian Dozier trying to turn double play.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brian Dozier]] of the [[Minnesota Twins]] leaps over a sliding [[Jonathan Schoop]] of the Baltimore Orioles attempting to turn a [[double play]]]]

Second base is the second of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a base runner in order to score a run for that player's team. Second base is typically defended by the second baseman and the [[shortstop]]. Second base is also known as the keystone sack. A runner on second base is said to be in "scoring position," owing to the high likelihood of reaching home plate and scoring a run from second base on most base hits. Since second is the farthest base from home plate, it is the most common target of [[base stealing]].

Ideally, the second baseman and shortstop possess quick hands and feet and the ability to release the ball rapidly and with accuracy. One will usually cover second base when the other attempts to field the ball. Both players must communicate well to be able to make a [[double play]]. Particular agility is required of the second baseman in double play situations, which usually forces the player to throw towards first while his momentum carries him in the opposite direction. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4, and the shortstop 6.

==Third base==
[[File:Andy Wilkins rounds the bases.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Andy Wilkins rounds third base following a home run for the [[2010 Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team]].]]
{{main|Third baseman}}
Third base is the third of four bases a base runner must touch in a counterclockwise succession in order to score a run. Many batted balls that result in the batter being put out (such as a [[sacrifice fly]]) may nevertheless allow a runner to reach home plate and score a run from third base, provided that the third and final out is not recorded before he can do so. A runner on third base is therefore particularly valuable to the batting team when fewer than two outs have been recorded.

The third baseman is the defensive player whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base. A third baseman ideally possesses quick reaction to batted balls and a strong arm to make the long throw to first base. The distance from 3rd to 1st is about {{convert|127|ft|m}}. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number 5.

==Home plate==
{{redirect|Home plate}}
[[File:Home base of baseball field in Třebíč, Czech Republic.jpg|thumb|Home plate of a baseball field]]
Home plate, formally designated home base in the rules, is the final base that a player must touch to score. Unlike the other bases, home plate is a [[pentagon|five-sided]] slab of whitened rubber that is set at ground level. The use of rubber was developed by [[Bob Keating|Robert Keating]], who pitched one game for the 1887 Baltimore Orioles. Previously the plate was made of stone, iron, or wood.&lt;ref&gt;James, B. New Historical Baseball Abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dimensions of home plate are {{convert|17|in|cm}} across the front, {{convert|8.5|in|cm}} down each side, with a triangular rear of two sides of {{convert|12|in|cm}}. The rear edges are at 45 degrees to the sides, making a point at the back.&lt;ref name="Rule1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/objectives_1.jsp|title=Official Rules: 1.00 Objectives of the Game|publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plate is white and surrounded by a black strip {{convert|3/4|in|cm}} in width. The plate sits entirely in "fair" territory, with the two rear edges aligned with the right and left field foul lines. The length and angle requirements for home plate mandate that it is not a regular pentagon; it is a 17 by 8.5 inches rectangle with an isosceles triangle of base 17 inches and equal sides of 12 inches attached to the back.

{{convert|50|to|100|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} behind home plate is the [[backstop (baseball)|backstop]], which is a wall/fence that will stop [[wild pitch]]es, [[passed ball]]s, and [[foul ball]]s. In enclosed stadiums, the backstop is often composed of a lower part, which is like any other part of the wall, and an upper netting to protect spectators seated behind it; in recreational baseball fields, there is usually a tall [[chain-link fence]], including an angled top section, composing the entire backstop.

==Batter's box and catcher's box==&lt;!---"Catcher's box" and variations of that spelling redirect here. Additionally, it has been recommended to merge "Batter's box" and various spellings in this section ---&gt;
[[File:David-ortiz-batters-box.JPG|right|thumb|300px|[[David Ortiz]] (in gray) of the [[Boston Red Sox]] stands in the left-handed hitters' batter's box at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] against the [[Chicago White Sox]] on July 7, [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006]].]]
The batter's box is the place where the [[batting (baseball)|batter]] stands when ready to receive a [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]] from the [[pitcher]]. It is usually drawn in [[chalk]] on the dirt surrounding [[home plate]], and the insides of the boxes are watered down before each game.

The chalk lines delineating the two foul lines are rarely extended through the batter's boxes. However, those lines exist conceptually for the purpose of judging a batted ball fair or foul. In addition, inside edges of the batter's boxes are often not laid-in with chalk. Similarly, though not marked, those lines continue to exist for the purpose of the rules pertaining to the batter's box and the batter's position relative thereto.

There are two batter's boxes, one on each side of home plate. The batter's boxes are {{convert|4|ft|m|2}} wide and {{convert|6|ft|m|2}} long. The batter's boxes are centered lengthwise at the center of home plate with the inside line of each batter's box {{convert|6|in|cm}} from the near edge of home plate. A [[handedness|right-handed]] batter would stand in the batter's box on the left side of home plate from the perspective of the [[catcher]] and umpire. A left-handed batter would stand in the batter's box to their right. A batter may only occupy one batter's box at a time and may not legally leave the batter's box after the pitcher has come set or has started his windup. Should the batter wish to leave the batter's box once the pitcher has engaged the [[pitcher's plate|rubber]], he must first ask the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] for [[Time-out (sport)|time-out]]. Time will not be granted if the pitcher has already started his pitching motion. For playing rules relating to the batter's box, see Rules 6.05 and 6.06 of the [[Official Baseball Rules]].

==Foul poles==
[[File:Dsc03277.JPG|right|thumb|250px|One of two foul poles at [[Citizens Bank Park]], Philadelphia.]]
Foul poles, if present, help umpires judge whether a fly ball hit above the fence line is [[Foul ball|foul]] (out of play) or fair (a [[home run]]). The poles are a vertical extension of the foul lines at the edge of the field of play. The outer edge of the foul lines and foul poles define foul territory. Both the lines and the poles are in fair territory, in contrast to American football and basketball, where the lines marking the playing boundaries are out of bounds. The minimum distance to hit a home run (along either foul line) is set by baseball rules, generally at {{convert|325|feet|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/glossary/rules/field-dimensions |title=Field Dimensions |publisher=MLB.com |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1920,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} the foul lines extended indefinitely; a batter was awarded a home run only if a fly ball out of the field was fair where it landed, or "when last seen" by the umpire. Now, a batted ball that leaves the field in flight is judged fair or foul at the point it leaves the field. Thus, such a fly ball passing on the fair side of a foul pole, or hitting a foul pole, is a home run regardless of where the ball goes thereafter.

Foul poles are typically much higher than the top of the outfield fence or wall, and often have a narrow screen running along the fair side of the pole. This further aids the umpires' judgment, as a ball that bounces off this screen is a home run. It can still be a difficult call, especially in ballparks with no outfield stands behind the poles to provide perspective. [[Wrigley Field]] is notorious for arguments over long, curving flies down a foul line (most notably in left field) that sail higher than the foul pole.

At Major League Baseball fields, foul poles are usually yellow. Those at [[Citi Field#Features|Citi Field]] are orange. At the [[Rogers Centre]], there are no foul poles, but large nets suspended from the roof that serve the same purpose. At [[Petco Park]], there is no foul pole in left field; the pole's function is served by a yellow metal strip along the corner of the Western Metal Supply Co. building.

==Pitcher's mound==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[San Francisco Giants]] --&gt;
[[File:Baseball pitch release.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The pitcher moves forward off the rubber as the pitch is released.]]
In roughly the middle of the square, equidistant between first and third base, and a few feet closer to home plate than to second base, is a low artificial hill called the pitcher's mound. This is where the [[pitcher]] stands when throwing the [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]]. Atop the mound is a white rubber slab, called the pitcher's plate or pitcher's rubber. It measures {{convert|6|in|cm}} front-to-back and {{convert|2|ft|cm}} across, the front of which is exactly {{convert|60|ft|6|in|m}} from the rear point of home plate. This peculiar distance was set by the rule makers in 1893, not due to a clerical or surveying error as popular myth has it, but intentionally (further details under ''[[#History|History]]'').

In [[Major League Baseball]], a regulation mound is {{convert|18|ft|m}} in diameter, with the center {{convert|59|ft|m}} from the rear point of home plate, on the line between home plate and [[second base]]. The front edge of the ''pitcher's plate'' or ''rubber'' is {{convert|18|in|cm}} behind the center of the mound, making the front edge's midpoint 60 feet 6 inches from the rear point of home plate. Six inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) in front of the pitcher's rubber the mound begins to slope downward. The top of the rubber is to be no higher than ten inches (25&amp;nbsp;cm) above home plate. From 1903 through 1968, this height limit was set at {{convert|15|in|cm}}, but was often slightly higher, sometimes as high as {{convert|20|in|cm}}, especially for teams that emphasized pitching, such as the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], who were reputed to have the highest mound in the majors.

A pitcher will push off the rubber with his foot in order to gain velocity toward [[home plate]] when pitching. In addition, a higher mound generally favors the pitcher. With the height advantage, the pitcher gains more leverage and can put more downward velocity on the ball, making it more difficult for the batter to strike the ball squarely with the [[baseball bat|bat]]. The lowering of the mound in 1969 was intended to "increase the batting" once again, as pitching had become increasingly dominant, reaching its peak the prior year; 1968 is known among baseball historians as "The Year of the Pitcher." This restrictive rule apparently did its job, contributing to the hitting surge of modern baseball.

A pitcher's mound is difficult for [[groundskeeper]]s to maintain. Usually before every game it is watered down to keep the dust from spreading. On youth and amateur baseball fields, the mound may be much different from the rule book definition due to erosion and repair attempts. Even in the major leagues, each mound gains its own character, as pitchers are allowed to kick away pieces of dirt in their way, thereby sculpting the mound a bit to their preference.

The pitcher may keep a [[rosin]] bag on the rear of the mound to dry off his hands. Major League Baseball teams are also permitted [[Cleat (shoe)|cleat]] cleaners on the back of the mound. This may be a flat grate-style plate, or simply a hand tool such as a piece of wood used to remove mud and dirt from cleats. These items are allowed to remain on the backside of the mound at the discretion of the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]], thus reducing the probability that they will affect a live play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/pitcher_8.jsp|title=Official Rules|work=Major League Baseball|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseline==
A baseline is the straight line between two adjacent bases. Baselines are not drawn on the field, although the foul lines serve to mark the baseline between home plate and first base, and between third base and home.

===Running baseline===
Generally, [[baserunner|base runner]]s are not required to follow the baseline. A base runner seeking to advance more than one base typically "rounds" the base, following a more circular path. However, a base runner's left-right motion is constrained when the defense tries to [[Tag out|tag]] him. At the moment the defense begins the attempt, the baserunner's running baseline is established as a direct line from his current position to the base he is trying for. A runner straying more than {{convert|3|ft|m|0|spell=in}} away from this baseline to avoid a tag may be called out.

===Running lane===
Beginning halfway between home and first base, and ending at first base, there is a second chalk line to the right of the foul line. This second line and the part of the foul line it runs parallel to, form the running lane that defines the path in which a batter-runner must run as he is advancing to first base. Rule 6.05(k) of the [[Official Baseball Rules]] states that, if a batter-runner running to first base runs outside the running lane, and "in doing so" interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first, then the batter-runner is automatically out. First base itself is not located in the running lane, but Rule 6.05 lets the batter-runner leave the running lane "by means of a step, stride or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base" to step on first base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Baseball Explained|author=Mahony, Phillip|publisher=McFarland Books|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grass line==
[[File:Metrodome ALDS Oct 2004.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], showing a white "grass" line. ]] The grass line, where the dirt of the infield ends and the grass of the outfield begins, has no special significance to the rules of the game, but it can influence the outcome of a game. Dirt running paths between the bases (and, at one time and still in some parks, between the pitcher and the catcher) have existed since the beginning of the game, although they were not mentioned in the rule books until around 1950, and their specifications are flexible. In addition to providing a running path, the grass lines act as a visual aid so that players, [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]] and fans may better judge distance from the center of the diamond. Occasionally the ball may take a tricky bounce off the dirt area or the edge between the dirt and the grass. Multiple [[World Series]] championships (including 1924, 1960 and 1986) have been decided or heavily influenced by erratic hops of [[ground ball]]s.

In [[artificial turf]] stadiums, infield dirt was originally only placed around the bases and around the pitcher's and batting areas, which are referred to as "sliding pits."  In this configuration, the "grass line" is usually designated with a white arc. Among Major League Baseball fields, [[Rogers Centre]] was the last stadium to maintain this type of configuration and was reconfigured with a full dirt infield starting in the 2016 MLB season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto Blue Jays' new dirt infield under construction at Rogers Centre|date=February 10, 2016|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/construction-begins-new-dirt-infield-rogers-centre-1.3442659|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[college baseball]] parks with artificial turf fields, the entire field (along with possibly the pitcher's mound) is made up of turf, with parts of the field mainly containing dirt instead merely being clay-colored turf.

==Outfield==
{{anchor|outfield}}The [[outfield]] is made from thick grass or artificial turf. It is where the outfielders play. The positions to play in the outfield are right, center, and left field (named in relation to the batter's position; thus left field is beyond third base and right field is beyond first base). Outfields vary in size and shape depending on the overall size and shape of the playing field. The outfield stretches from the infield to the outfield wall and it contains the warning track. Outfields especially vary from Little League to Major League fields. Little League outfields vary more in size than Major League outfields. Outfields often differ from infields in the specific type of grass used, but most Major League outfields are grass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballpilgrimages.com/grass-at-major-league-ballparks.html|title=Major League Baseball Ballpark Grass and Turf|website=www.baseballpilgrimages.com|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warning track==
[[File:Outfield warning track from the right field line, Husky Field - Baseball.JPG|thumb|right|The warning track abutting the outfield fence of Husky Field, used by the Houston Baptist Huskies baseball team]]
The warning track is the strip of dirt at the edges of the baseball field (especially in front of the home run fence and along the left and right sides of a field). Because the warning track's color and feel differ from the grass field, a fielder can remain focused on a fly ball near the fence and measure his proximity to the fence while attempting to catch the ball safely.

A warning track's width is not specified in the rules. It is generally designed to give about three steps of warning to the highest-level players using the field. Typical widths run from about six feet for Little League fields to about {{convert|10|-|15|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} for college- or professional-level play. A warning track this wide also lets groundskeepers avoid driving maintenance vehicles on the grass.

The track can be composed of finely ground rock particles such as cinders, which is why announcer [[Bob Wolff]] called it the "cinder path" rather than the "warning track."

The idea of a warning track originated in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], where an actual running track was built for use in track and field events. When ballpark designers saw how the track helped fielders, it soon became a feature of every ballpark.

Single-minded fielders often crash into a wall trying to make a catch despite the warning track. For this reason, outfield walls are typically padded for extra safety. [[Wrigley Field]]'s brick wall is covered only by ivy, which is not especially soft. However, there are pads on the walls of the tight left and right field corners in foul ground.

''Warning-track power'' is a derogatory term for a batter who seems to have just enough power to hit the ball to the warning track for an out, but not enough to hit a home run. The term more generally refers to someone or something that is almost but not quite good enough for something.

==Outfield wall==
[[File:Green Monster 2006.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Green Monster]] in 2006, showing the manual scoreboard and Green Monster seating, and more recent additions, including charity advertisements along the top, billboards above the Green Monster seating, and the [[American League East]] standings.]]
[[File:Jacob's Field Fultz and Betancourt in the Bullpen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pitchers warming up in the bullpen]]

The outfield wall or outfield fence is the wall or fence that marks the outer boundary of the outfield. A ball passing over the wall is [[dead ball|dead]]; if it passes over the wall in [[fair territory]] while [[in flight]], it is a home run. The official rules do not specify the shape, height, or composition of the wall, or a specific mandatory distance from home plate (though Major League Baseball mandates a minimum distance of {{convert|250|ft|m}} and recommends a minimum distance of {{convert|320|ft|m}} at the foul poles and {{convert|400|ft|m}} at center field). As a result, baseball fields can vary greatly along those lines. The wall has numbers affixed or painted on it that denote the distance from that point on the wall to home plate. In most modern major league ballparks, the wall is made of some hard material (e.g., concrete, plywood, sheet metal) with padding on the field side to protect players who may collide with the wall at high speed while trying to make a play. [[Chain link fencing]] may also be incorporated into the wall in areas where the wall needs to be transparent, e.g., an outfield [[bullpen]], a spectator area behind the wall, or to protect a [[scoreboard]] incorporated into the wall. Many ballparks feature a yellow line denoting the top of the wall to aid umpires in judging whether the ball passed over the wall or if the ball is fair or foul.

==Bullpen==
{{main|Bullpen}}
The bullpen (sometimes referred to as simply "the 'pen") is the area where pitchers warm up before entering a game. Depending on the ballpark, it may be situated in foul territory along the baselines or just beyond the outfield fence. Relief pitchers usually wait in the bullpen when they have yet to play in a game, rather than in the [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] with the rest of the team. The starting pitcher also makes his final pregame warmups in the bullpen. Managers can call coaches in the bullpen on an [[hotline|in-house telephone]] from the dugout to tell a certain pitcher to begin his warmup tosses.
"Bullpen" is also used [[metonymy|metonymically]] to describe a team's collection of relief pitchers.

==On-deck circles==
{{main|On-deck}}
There are two on-deck circles in the field, one for each team, positioned in foul ground between home plate and the respective teams' benches. They are technically known as next-batter's boxes. The on-deck circle is where the next scheduled batter, or "on-deck" batter, warms up while waiting for the current batter to finish his turn. The on-deck circle is either an area composed of bare dirt; a plain circle painted onto artificial turf; or often, especially at the professional level, a mat made from artificial material, with the team or league logo painted onto it.

==Coach's boxes==
The [[coach's box]]es, located behind first and third base, are where the first and third base [[coach (baseball)|coaches]] are supposed to stand, although coaches often stand outside the box. This is permissible as long as the coach does not interfere with play and the opposing team does not object (in which case the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] shall ensure that all coaches on both teams must abide by the boundaries of the coach's boxes). The coach's boxes are marked with chalk or paint. In the early days of baseball, the term "coacher's box" was used, as "coach" was taken to be a verb. As the term "coach" evolved into a noun, the name of the box also changed.

==History==
{{Original research section|date=May 2012}}
The basic layout of the diamond has been little changed since the original [[Knickerbocker Rules]] of the 1840s. The distance between bases was already established as {{convert|90|ft|m|2}}, which it remains. Through trial and error, 90 feet had been settled upon as the optimal distance. 100 feet would have given too much advantage to the defense, and 80 feet too much to the offense.

The original Knickerbocker Rules did not specify the pitching distance explicitly. By the time major league baseball began in the 1870s, the pitcher was compelled to pitch from within a "box" whose front edge was {{convert|45|ft|m}} from the "point" of home plate. Although he had to release the ball before crossing the line, as with bowlers in [[cricket]], he also had to start his delivery from within the box; he could not run in from the field as bowlers do. Furthermore, the pitcher had to throw underhand. By the 1880s, pitchers had mastered the underhand delivery—in fact, in 1880, there were two [[perfect game]]s within a week of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/boxscore/06121880.shtml|title=Lee Richmond Perfect Game Box Score by Baseball Almanac|work=baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to "increase the batting," the front edge of the pitcher's box was moved back 5 feet in 1881, to {{convert|50|ft|m}} from home plate. The size of the box was altered over the following few years. Pitchers were allowed to throw overhand starting in 1884, and that tilted the balance of power again. In 1887, the box was set at {{convert|4|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|5.5|ft|m}} deep, with the front edge still 50 feet from the plate. However, the pitcher was compelled to deliver the ball with his back foot at the {{convert|55.5|ft|m|adj=on}} line of the box, thus somewhat restricting his ability to "power" the ball with his overhand delivery.&lt;ref name=Lansch&gt;{{cite book|title=Glory Fades Away|author=Lansch, Jerry}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96}}

In 1893, the box was replaced by the pitcher's plate, although "the box" is still used today as a slang term for the pitcher's location on the field. Exactly 5 feet was added to the point the pitcher had to toe, again "to increase the batting" (and hopefully to increase attendance, as fan interest had flagged somewhat), resulting in the seemingly peculiar pitching distance of {{convert|60.5|ft|m|2}}.&lt;ref name=Lansch/&gt;{{rp|230}}

Many sources suggest that the pitching distance evolved from 45 to 50 to 60.5 feet. However, the first two were the "release point" and the third is the "pushoff point," so the 1893 increase was not quite as dramatic as is often implied; that is, the 1893 rule change added only 5 feet to the release point, not 10.5 feet.

Originally the pitcher threw from flat ground, but over time the raised mound was developed, somewhat returning the advantage to the pitchers. Before the mid-20th century, it was common for baseball fields to include a dirt pathway between the pitcher's mound and home plate. This feature is sometimes known as the "keyhole" due to the shape that it makes together with the mound. The keyhole was once as wide as the pitcher's box and resembled a [[cricket pitch]]. Sometimes this path extended through the batting area and all the way to the backstop. Once the rounded pitcher's mound was developed, the path became more ornamental than practical, and was gradually thinned before being largely abandoned by the 1950s. In recent years some ballparks, such as [[Comerica Park]] and [[Chase Field]] in the major leagues, have revived the feature for nostalgic reasons.

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2007}}
'''Beginner's luck''' refers to the supposed phenomenon of [[novice]]s experiencing disproportionate frequency of success or succeeding against an expert in a given activity. One would expect experts to outperform novices - when the opposite happens it is [[counter-intuitive]], hence the need for a term to describe this [[phenomenon]]. The term is most often used in reference to a first attempt in [[sport]] or [[gambling]], but  is also used in many other diverse contexts. The term is also used when no skill whatsoever is involved, such as a first-time [[slot machine]] player winning the [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]]  .

==Causes==
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2015}}
{{originalresearch|section|date=October 2015}}
Whether or not beginner's luck as a statistical phenomenon actually occurs varies by the situation. There are many explanations:

# Beginner's luck arises from a disconnect between the player and the pressure of the game. A novice player is inexperienced and consequently is not expected to do well. This means that there is no pressure on the player to excel; this lack of pressure allows the player to concentrate more than a pressured veteran player. This contradicts the [[Rosenthal effect]] which states that students who are expected to perform better usually perform better.
# In a competitive game, a skilled player will expect certain actions to be taken by an opponent in a given situation and prepares his strategy using that prediction. This is especially true in card games, chess, etc. However, the beginner does not have the skill and will often not take the best action. The skilled player is caught off guard and cannot correctly predict or interpret his opponent's action and he loses a large part of his advantage.
# The experts of a game will believe in beginner's luck because they themselves experienced disproportionate good fortune as novices. Suppose that 100 beginners play a game for the first time, and half win by random chance. The half that won is more likely to take an interest in the game and become experts, while the half that lose is more likely to lose interest and never play again. Thus, in any game, the "experts" will believe in beginner's luck, simply because they disproportionately experienced good fortune as novices themselves.
# Another explanation begins by noting that the acquisition of a new skill imposes limitations on the number of actions available to an agent. In the early stages of this process, an almost unlimited number of actions are possible. Though almost all of these are ineffectual, the probability of unusually effective actions manifesting by chance is still greater than when one has attained a moderate degree of skill, since, as one’s ability improves, the scope of possible actions becomes both more lawful and more limited, subtending freakish deviations from the mean both directions. Due to the [[availability heuristic]], these runs of flukish proficiency will stand out against the base rate of general ineptitude.
# Belief in beginner's luck may result from [[confirmation bias]] - occasions when a beginner performs unusually well are likely to be remembered, while occasions where a beginner performed badly are forgotten.

Beginner's luck is thought to end once a player gets involved with a game, and the "innocent" psychological mindset is replaced by one that is concerned with the nuances of the game.

[[File:Basil D'Oliveira 1968.tiff|thumb|200px|[[Basil D'Oliveira]], the [[England cricket team|England]] player of South African [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] background around whom the controversy centred, pictured in 1968]]
The '''D'Oliveira affair''' was a prolonged political and sporting controversy relating to the scheduled 1968–69 tour of South Africa by the [[England cricket team]], who were officially representing the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC).{{refn|group=note|name=MCC}} The point of contention was whether or not the England selectors would include [[Basil D'Oliveira]], a mixed-race South African player who had represented England in [[Test cricket]] since 1966, having moved there six years earlier. With South Africa under [[apartheid]], the potential inclusion by England of a non-white South African in their tour party became a political issue.

A [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] of Indian and Portuguese ancestry, D'Oliveira left South Africa primarily because the era's [[apartheid legislation]] seriously restricted his career prospects on racial grounds and barred him from the all-white Test team. He qualified for [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club]] through residency in 1964 and first played for England two years later. The consequences of D'Oliveira's possible inclusion in the 1968–69 MCC tour of South Africa were discussed by English and South African cricketing bodies as early as 1966. Manoeuvring by cricketing and political figures in both countries did little to bring the matter to a head. The MCC's priority was to maintain traditional links with South Africa and have the series go ahead without incident. South Africa's Prime Minister [[B.&amp;nbsp;J. Vorster]] sought to appease international opinion by publicly indicating that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be acceptable, but secretly did all he could to prevent it.

D'Oliveira was omitted from the England team for part of 1968 amid a slump in his batting form, but he marked his return in late August with a score of 158 runs in England's final Test match of the year, against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] at [[The Oval]]. Days later, the MCC selectors omitted D'Oliveira from the team to tour South Africa; they insisted that this was based entirely on cricketing merit, but many in Britain voiced apprehension and there was a public outcry. After [[Tom Cartwright]]'s withdrawal because of injury on 16 September, the MCC chose D'Oliveira as a replacement, prompting accusations from Vorster and other South African politicians that the selection was politically motivated. Attempts to find a compromise followed, but these led nowhere. The MCC announced the tour's cancellation on 24 September.

[[Sporting boycott of South Africa during the Apartheid era|Sporting boycotts]] of South Africa were already under way by 1968, but the D'Oliveira controversy was the first to have a serious effect on South African cricket. The [[South African Cricket Board of Control]] announced its intention to remove racial barriers in South African cricket in 1969, and formally integrated the sport in 1976. Meanwhile, the boycott movement escalated sharply, leading to South Africa's near-complete isolation from international cricket from 1971, though the country continued to play international rugby into the 1980s, twice allowing mixed-race [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand rugby teams]] into the country during the 1970s. D'Oliveira played for England until 1972, and for Worcestershire until 1979. South Africa returned to international cricket in 1991, soon after apartheid began to be dismantled.

==Background==

===South Africa===

[[File:ApartheidSignEnglishAfrikaans.jpg|thumb|An [[apartheid]]-era sign in English and [[Afrikaans]] designating a public space as "for the exclusive use of white persons"|alt=A sign with text in English and Afrikaans. The English text reads: "For Use By White Persons. These public premises and the amenities thereof have been reserved for the exclusive use of white persons. By Order Provincial Secretary".]]
From the time that European settlers first arrived in South Africa in 1652, the country was divided on racial lines, in common with similar settlements. In contrast to other European colonies, racial distinction and segregation intensified during the early 20th century, and the various ethnic groups became more sharply defined and divided.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Following its general election victory [[South African general election, 1948|in 1948]], the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], led by [[Daniel François Malan|Daniel Malan]], formalised this racism under a government policy called [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "You've got to be Carefully Taught", Location 741&lt;/ref&gt; Under apartheid, different races were kept apart in all aspects of life.&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "You've got to be Carefully Taught", Location 800.&lt;/ref&gt; This system was thoroughly enforced during the 1950s; any resistance from non-white races was put down and [[apartheid legislation|laws]], supposedly to prevent the rise of communism, were passed to prevent political agitation.&lt;ref name="O14-15"/&gt;

From a cricketing viewpoint, the apartheid policy made little difference.&lt;ref name="O14-15" /&gt; Although cricket was played widely among the different racial groups in South Africa, the [[South Africa national cricket team|Test team]], which represented the country in international matches, had always been all white.{{refn|group=note|Controversy exists regarding the ancestry of [[Charlie Llewellyn|C. B. Llewellyn]], who played for South Africa between 1896 and 1912;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlie Llewellyn|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/player/45996.html|publisher=ESPNCricinfo|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a biographical article published in 1976 contending that he was [[coloured]] was vehemently refuted by his descendants, who insisted that he had been of "pure British stock".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Patrick|title=Charles Llewellyn—An early D'Oliveira|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketer/content/story/139324.html|publisher=''The Cricketer'', reprinted by ESPNCricinfo|accessdate=25 March 2014|date=February 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 17–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="W54" /&gt; Under apartheid, this became official policy under the government reasoning that black, [[coloured]] (mixed race) and [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] players were inherently inferior and not worthy of selection. Different races were forbidden from competing against each other.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 114–19.&lt;/ref&gt; South African cricket teams did not compete against [[India national cricket team|India]], [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] or the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], but teams from [[England cricket team|England]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] continued to visit the country. English cricketers particularly enjoyed tours to South Africa owing to the hospitality they received and the quality of living. The political writer and historian [[Peter Oborne]] commented: "Relations between the cricket establishments of the two countries were exceptionally warm. Only few visitors noticed, and even fewer cared, that there was something wrong."&lt;ref name="O14-15"&gt;Oborne, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1948–49|tour of South Africa during 1948–49]],{{refn|group=note|name=MCC|At the time official English touring teams played under the name, colours and badge of the MCC and were only styled "England" during Test matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lords.org/history/mcc-heritage/mcc-history/ |title=MCC History |publisher=MCC |accessdate=15 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607222859/http://www.lords.org/history/mcc-heritage/mcc-history/ |archivedate=7 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Peebles | first = I.

This prompted him to visit several [[Township (South Africa)|townships]] where he found black people living in very poor conditions. He contrasted this unfavourably with the luxury of the homes where he was entertained by white families.&lt;ref name="O16"&gt;Oborne, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Billy Griffith]], one of the touring team, accompanied him on one visit to a township, and was similarly appalled, but did not speak out against it. Arlott later condemned apartheid, during a 1950 BBC broadcast,&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "You've got to be Carefully Taught", Location 829.&lt;/ref&gt; and refused to commentate during future tours to the country. His example was followed by the England batsman and clergyman [[David Sheppard]], who declined to tour South Africa, refused to play the team in 1960, and spoke out publicly against the policies of the South African government despite efforts by the MCC to silence him.&lt;ref name="O16" /&gt; Otherwise, there was little protest in England against South African cricket during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="W54"&gt;Williams, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain and the England cricket team===
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-1-11.jpg|thumb|UK Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] ''(left)'' visits Nigeria in 1960. British attitudes towards race and apartheid were shifting greatly at this time.|alt=A white man in a business suit shakes hands with a black man in white robes.]]
From the mid-1950s, the [[United Nations]] began to express concern over apartheid, and there was a growing general awareness in Britain of its effects. In 1960 the [[UK Prime Minister]], [[Harold Macmillan]], criticised apartheid in his "[[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]]" speech to the South African parliament.{{refn|Macmillan stressed the rising black nationalist ambitions across Africa, made clear Britain's intent to grant independence to its remaining colonies and urged the South African government to work towards eventually creating a society "in which individual merit, and individual merit
alone, is the criterion for a man's advancement". The speech and its theme had been widely anticipated in South Africa, but the frank tone of Macmillan's delivery surprised many. The parliamentarians received the speech coldly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1960: Macmillan speaks of 'wind of change' in Africa|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/3/newsid_2714000/2714525.stm|location=London|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"|name="woc"}} However, the British government was cautious; the large number of British passport holders and businesses based in South Africa made them reluctant to force the issue and provoke a confrontation. Additionally, there was support for the policy among some right-wing politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "Waiting for Godot", Location 3472.&lt;/ref&gt; When the MCC team [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1956–57|toured South Africa in 1956–57]], the players observed and were shocked by what they considered to be injustices against the black population. As many players and officials had family and friends in the country, they were disinclined to take a stand, but several condemned the situation in print at the time or later.&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "The Tribe that Lost its Head", Location 4285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall attitudes in Britain towards South African cricket began to change in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="W54" /&gt; At the time, race was becoming a more emotive matter in Britain and [[Immigration to the United Kingdom since Irish independence|immigration from Asia and the Caribbean]] became an issue in general elections.&lt;ref name="Williams53" /&gt; Racial tensions had risen throughout the 1950s, and race riots had occurred. Tim Quelch, in his review of English cricket in the 1950s, suggests that "[England's] record on race relations had hardly been exemplary".&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "The Tribe that Lost its Head", Location 4342.&lt;/ref&gt; But Jack Williams, in his book ''Cricket and Race'', suggests that cricket was a force for racial harmony in England given the influx of African-Caribbean and Asian overseas players and the mingling of white and African-Caribbean supporters during several Test series between England and the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]].&lt;ref name="Williams53"&gt;Williams, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Against this background, when [[South African cricket team in England in 1960|the South African team toured England in 1960]], there were some protests against apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Duffus | first1 = Louis | last2=Owen-Smith | first2=Michael | last3=Odendaal |first3=Andre| editor1-last=Swanton | editor1-first=E.

===International sport===

Within South Africa, there was growing realisation among opponents of apartheid that sport could play a role in pressuring the government.&lt;ref name="W54" /&gt; During the 1950s, South Africa competed freely in international competition; the governing bodies of the major international sports recognised only the official, all-white South African institutions. By the end of the decade, this began to change. Several non-white sporting organisations within South Africa united and began to influence international opinion. The resulting pressure brought about the suspension of the all-white [[South African Football Association|Football Association of South Africa]] from [[FIFA]]—for two years from 1961, then after a brief reinstatement, again from 1964—which prevented [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] from participating in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]].&lt;ref name=O119/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of Race and International Sport: the Case of South Africa|last=Lapchick|first=Richard E.|date=April 1975|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-8371-7691-8|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa was also excluded from international fencing in 1964. However, because neither fencing nor football was closely followed in white South Africa, the impact was limited. [[Apartheid-era South Africa and the Olympics|Suspension from the Olympics]] had a greater effect;&lt;ref name=W64&gt;Williams, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; another campaign from within South Africa and the consequent change in international opinion resulted in South Africa being barred from the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics]] and those that followed.&lt;ref name=O119&gt;Oborne, pp. 119–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, before a tour by the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand rugby team]], the South African government asked New Zealand to field an all-white team (thereby excluding [[Māori people|Māori]] players); the [[New Zealand Rugby Union|New Zealand Rugby Football Union]] refused and cancelled the tour.&lt;ref name=O134/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 5, Location 976.&lt;/ref&gt; As rugby was very popular among white South Africans, this caused concern in that community.&lt;ref name="W64"&gt;Williams, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The England cricket team was in New Zealand at the time, and Billy Griffith, by then the secretary of the MCC, when questioned said that the MCC would also cancel in similar circumstances.&lt;ref name=O134&gt;Oborne, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these events in other world sports, South Africa continued to play international cricket.&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "The Tribe that Lost its Head", Location 4330.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to put pressure on the [[International Cricket Council|International Cricket Conference]] (ICC) failed, and even when South Africa withdrew from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961 (theoretically forfeiting the national team's Test status), their traditional opponents continued to play official Tests against them despite opposition from India, Pakistan and the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basil D'Oliveira===

[[Basil D'Oliveira]] was born in [[Cape Town]] in 1931 and, coming from a mixed Indian-Portuguese background, formed part of the [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/sports/cricket/basil-doliveira-a-symbol-for-cricket-and-for-equality-dies-at-80.html?_r=0|title=Basil D'Oliveira, a Symbol for Cricket and for Equality, Dies at 80|first=Douglas|last=Martin|location=New York|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 November 2011|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated skill in cricket from an early age, but as the apartheid system classified him as non-white, he was barred from playing [[first-class cricket]] in South Africa or representing the national team.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/568146.html | title = Basil D'Oliveira (Obituary)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 2012 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London |accessdate = 23 June 2013 | isbn=978-1-4081-5634-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He represented and captained a "non-white" South African team which played unofficial international matches.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; He was left distraught by the cancellation in 1959, at the behest of South African anti-apartheid campaigners, of a proposed visit by a West Indies team which was to compete against non-white sides. Realising that he had achieved all he could as a non-white sportsman in South Africa, he wrote to John Arlott in England to ask for help finding employment as a cricketer.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name=O5564/&gt;

Arlott enlisted the help of [[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]], a cricket journalist with expertise in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire leagues]], to find a job for D'Oliveira as a club professional. No teams were initially interested, but when [[Middleton Cricket Club|Middleton]]'s professional withdrew at the last minute, the club employed D'Oliveira for the 1960 season.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name=O5564&gt;Oborne, pp. 55–64.&lt;/ref&gt; After a poor start, he prospered for Middleton. He established a wider reputation by playing televised matches for a team called the "Cavaliers", and took part in overseas tours with some leading cricketers. Several English [[county cricket club]]s expressed an interest in him, and he eventually joined [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]]. Qualifying for the county team through residency,{{refn|group=note|At the time, cricketers had to have lived in a county for a year to qualify to play for that team.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;}} he made his debut in 1964 and scored a [[century (cricket)|century]] on his first appearance. By the 1966 season, he had progressed to the point that he was picked for England Test team. D'Oliveira was immediately successful for England; by the following year he was well-established in the team.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

==Build-up==

===Anticipation===

From early in his England career, D'Oliveira and his supporters saw the MCC tour of South Africa in 1968–69 as potentially being a key moment in his career.&lt;ref name=O134/&gt; Guy Fraser-Sampson suggests: "Nobody could be in any doubt that the possibility of D'Oliveira being chosen as a member of the England touring party would raise massive political complications".&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 5, Location 973.&lt;/ref&gt; When D'Oliveira visited South Africa to work as a  coach in 1966, the subject was raised continually. People speculated whether D'Oliveira would be selected and, if so, whether the South African government would allow him to play. Some of his supporters worried that his acceptance of a place on a tour to South Africa might be interpreted as approval of the political situation there, but D'Oliveira was determined to play, aware of what it would mean to the non-white people of South Africa.&lt;ref name="O126-28"&gt;Oborne, pp. 126–28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Griffith flew to South Africa to discuss the forthcoming tour and to seek a solution to any potential problems—the MCC wanted the tour to go ahead without any political trouble. Little came of the meetings; Oborne suggests that both sides simply "agreed to hope that the whole issue went away".&lt;ref name="O134–35"&gt;Oborne, pp. 134–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a successful season for England in 1967, D'Oliveira was chosen to tour the West Indies in 1967–68;&lt;ref name="O126-28"/&gt; this raised awareness in England and South Africa that he was a realistic contender to tour South Africa a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his opportunities to excel were few in the West Indies; circumstances were against him in several matches, and he had a statistically poor tour. Any mitigating circumstances were offset by problems off the field. D'Oliveira took full advantage of the social opportunities available on a tour of the West Indies and frequently disappeared to parties and other events, often not reappearing until after breakfast. Rumours to this effect reached the press and the MCC tour manager spoke to D'Oliveira about his responsibilities on tour. D'Oliveira said that his behaviour and poor form were partly a result of the pressure placed on him. He was frequently questioned about the South African tour and about race—some groups in the West Indies accused him of "selling out" by playing for England's "white" team.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 129–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa's position===

The position of the South African government towards mixed-race teams was well established by 1967. It was stated explicitly after the visit of Griffith when, in February 1967, the Interior Minister [[P.&amp;nbsp;K. Le Roux]] said in a speech: "We will not allow mixed teams to play against our white teams here. That is our policy. It is well known here and overseas."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; These comments caused a public row in Britain, and some commentators wanted the tour to be called off; the MCC informed the British government that players would be selected on ability alone and that any attempts from within South Africa to interfere would cause the tour to be cancelled. [[Denis Howell, Baron Howell|Denis Howell]], the [[Minister for Sport and the Olympics|Minister for Sport]], informed the House of Commons of the MCC position and stated that the government expected that the MCC would cancel the tour if any player were to be rejected. Privately, the MCC committee were unhappy to have been forced into so unequivocal a position.&lt;ref name="O135-38"&gt;Oborne, pp. 135–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B. J. Vorster]], the [[Prime Minister of South Africa]], was embarrassed by Le Roux's public comments and forced him to deny having made them. However, the British government's intervention cemented in Vorster's mind the idea that it and the MCC were closely connected.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1298.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1967 he gave a speech in which he said that while sport between white and non-white teams could not take place in South Africa, the government would be prepared to send mixed teams to play abroad and to accommodate mixed teams from South Africa's "traditional" opponents. This change of direction was aimed at entering a team in the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], to avoid a repeat of the cancelled New Zealand rugby tour and with D'Oliveira's selection in mind.&lt;ref name="O135-38"/&gt; The MCC decided later in 1967 to clarify that Vorster's government would impose no limitations on the players chosen for the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1968, Griffith wrote on behalf of the MCC to the [[Cricket South Africa|South African Cricket Association]] (SACA) with the implication that the tour would be cancelled if a free selection was not guaranteed.&lt;ref name="O135-38"/&gt;

According to Oborne, Vorster was a pragmatic politician who wanted to maintain apartheid and to make it appear acceptable to the outside world. To this end, attempting to broaden South Africa's international connections, he accepted black foreign diplomats in the country and began to plan a policy to allow mixed-race sport to prevent South Africa's international isolation. However, such policies were unpopular with his domestic supporters and he was careful not to go too far.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 142–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne writes: "Vorster knew that there was a limit to how far he could go without imperilling his own position. That limit was Basil D'Oliveira."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Oborne, Vorster never intended to allow D'Oliveira to play with the MCC team; his supporters would not have accepted a non-white South African benefiting from this change of policy and demonstrating his ability at a high level. Vorster therefore worked to give the impression overseas that D'Oliveira would be welcome, while at the same time doing his utmost to stop him from playing. He courted the British ambassador, Sir John Nicholls, and told him that a tour party including D'Oliveira would be acceptable. Nicholls passed this on to the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 145–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Vorster meanwhile monitored D'Oliveira's progress closely; from his debut in 1966, South Africa kept a security file on him.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===MCC manoeuvres===

[[File:Alec Douglas-Home (c1963).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alec Douglas-Home|Sir Alec Douglas-Home]] met Vorster in March 1968, and told the MCC afterwards that South Africa would probably let D'Oliveira play.|alt=A photograph of Sir Alec Douglas-Home]]
In March 1968, having received no response from the SACA to Griffith's letter, the MCC asked [[Alec Douglas-Home]] to intervene. Douglas-Home, a former British Prime Minister and then the [[Shadow Foreign Secretary|Opposition spokesman for foreign affairs]], had just finished his term as MCC president and was visiting [[Rhodesia]] and South Africa; he agreed to raise the question of D'Oliveira during a meeting with Vorster that was part of his itinerary.&lt;ref name=O138&gt;Oborne, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas-Home believed that the best way to deal with apartheid was through dialogue and that contact between the countries should be increased, not reduced&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;—as he described it, "precept and example must be better than ostracism".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Williams, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; When he met Vorster, Douglas-Home was reluctant to press him for an unequivocal answer, but discussed D'Oliveira. He also sounded out other figures in South Africa and returned to England to tell the MCC,&lt;ref name=O138/&gt; in the words of the cricket writer [[E.&amp;nbsp;W. Swanton]], that "if D'Oliveira were to be chosen the odds were 5/4 on his being allowed in".&lt;ref name=S289&gt;Swanton, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of Fraser-Sampson: "While Douglas-Home's motives remain obscure, it is clear that he muddied the waters dreadfully. By allowing the MCC to believe they could continue happily fudging the issue, and by misleading them as to Vorster's true intentions, he delivered the worst of both worlds."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1346.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Douglas-Home's advice, the MCC let the matter drift throughout the 1968 season.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 138–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Conscious of D'Oliveira's poor form in the West Indies and continued lack of success during early 1968, the MCC committee kept in mind that it was far from certain that he would even make the team to tour South Africa.&lt;ref name=S289/&gt;

Meanwhile, with the knowledge of Vorster and the South African government, the SACA carefully devised its answer to the MCC letter. The reply, which avoided directly answering the MCC question, was hand-delivered to the MCC secretary [[Gubby Allen|George "Gubby" Allen]] in March 1968 by the former South African Test captain [[Jack Cheetham]], a close associate of several MCC officials. By this point, the MCC had accepted Douglas-Home's advice and no longer wanted a reply to their letter—Oborne records that when Cheetham "cheerily produced his laboriously produced document, a panic-stricken Gubby Allen waved it away."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was never presented to the full MCC Committee, and Cheetham returned to South Africa with news that a reply was not required—preparations for the tour could proceed as normal. This allowed Vorster to conceal his intentions regarding D'Oliveira for a further six months.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Allen later justified his actions by suggesting that he was concerned that the SACA letter would be leaked to the press if it went any further. Oborne believes that Allen wished to hide from the full committee the MCC hierarchy's change of mind over the approach to take with the South Africans; he suggests that Allen and Griffith were effectively acting as a secret MCC subcommittee from this point.&lt;ref name="O149-50"/&gt;

===South African plan===

Vorster and the SACA followed D'Oliveira's form closely throughout the tour of West Indies and into the 1968 season. D'Oliveira's lack of success prompted press speculation that he might lose his England place for entirely non-political reasons, but Vorster was convinced that the MCC were committed to selecting him under any circumstances.&lt;ref name="O149-50"&gt;Oborne, pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore conceived a two-pronged plan to prevent D'Oliveira's selection for the 1968–69 tour. He and the SACA would attempt to bribe D'Oliveira to make himself unavailable, while simultaneously persuading the English selectors—or more specifically the MCC, who Vorster believed would determine selection policy—not to choose him.&lt;ref name="O149-50"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1306.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the plan depended on the MCC realising that picking D'Oliveira would mean no tour, but in making such attempts the South Africans risked public discovery, which would cause the tour to be cancelled anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1309.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bribery was planned from an early stage, but had to be postponed when D'Oliveira did not return to South Africa before the 1968 season.&lt;ref name="O151-3"/&gt; The second part of the plan was put into operation in March 1968. Vorster resolved to send a secret message to the MCC through [[Charles Lyttelton, 10th Viscount Cobham|Lord Cobham]], a member and former president of the MCC with close links to D'Oliveira's county side Worcestershire.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="O151-3"/&gt; Cobham was visiting South Africa at Griffith's request to meet [[Arthur Coy]], an official of the SACA. Cobham told Coy that he wanted the tour to go ahead, but agreed with him that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be "disastrous". Cobham seems to have promised Coy that he would attempt to dissuade D'Oliveira from touring, but never actually did so. Cobham then met Vorster, who told him that if D'Oliveira were chosen, the tour would be cancelled.&lt;ref name=S289/&gt;&lt;ref name="O151-3"&gt;Oborne, pp. 151–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to England, Cobham kept this information from the full MCC committee, knowing that they would be forced to cancel the tour if they became aware of it. Instead, he wrote a letter to a committee member, whose identity has never been made public. The letter's recipient passed it on to Griffith, who in turn showed it to Allen and [[Arthur Gilligan]], at that time the MCC president. These three men chose to hide the information from the full committee,&lt;ref name=S289/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 153–54.&lt;/ref&gt; and nobody informed Denis Howell.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; Allen later defended these actions, setting out his reasoning in his biography, which was written by his close friend Swanton&lt;ref name="O154-55"/&gt;—Allen argued that the advice given by Douglas-Home, an international diplomat, took precedence over Cobham's information and had already been accepted by the MCC. He further suggested that, as the four England selectors had to choose the team "without any other consideration", and two of them sat on the MCC committee, it would have been unfair to burden them with Cobham's information.&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne dismisses Allen's reasoning as "disastrously muddled",&lt;ref name="O154-55"/&gt; pointing out that Cobham's advice was far more up-to-date than Douglas-Home's, and that there would have been no burden of conscience for the team selectors as the new information would have caused the tour to be cancelled.&lt;ref name="O154-55"&gt;Oborne, pp. 154–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira and it would be better not to press the issue. Even so, three key members of the MCC were aware of the reality of the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.&lt;ref name="O154-55"/&gt;

===D'Oliveira in 1968===

D'Oliveira was aware of the political discussions surrounding him during 1968, and the pressure on him was intensified by the scrutiny of his supporters and opponents in England and South Africa. Conscious of his failure in the West Indies, he made a concerted effort to improve his batting. He scored runs consistently and was chosen for England's first Test of 1968, against Australia in early June. He was very successful, scoring 87 [[not out]] and taking two wickets.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 139–41.&lt;/ref&gt; After England lost, however, D'Oliveira was blamed in some sections of the press.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' noted that he failed as a bowler, and his innings was difficult to evaluate as England had effectively lost the match by that stage.&lt;ref name=Lords&gt;{{cite web|title=England v Australia (First Test)| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150224.html| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1969 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, most observers expected him to retain his place, including the watching South Africans.&lt;ref name=O15558&gt;Oborne, pp. 155–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the second Test, played at Lord's, a series of events took place that Fraser-Sampson later described as "so bizarre as to be totally unbelievable, and yet [they] happened".&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1320.&lt;/ref&gt; The evening before play began, Griffith suggested to D'Oliveira that, to save the 1968–69 series, he should withdraw himself from consideration for the tour, and announce that he wished in future to play for South Africa rather than England. D'Oliveira angrily declined. The next day, E.&amp;nbsp;W. Swanton—a journalist technically unconnected with the MCC, but a close friend of Allen and a member of the "Establishment"—approached the player with a similar proposition, which D'Oliveira again dismissed.&lt;ref name=O15558/&gt; Both Griffith and Swanton were opposed to apartheid—Swanton had refused to report on the 1964–65 MCC tour of South Africa because of his objections to the system, and he supported D'Oliveira from a cricketing standpoint.&lt;ref name=O158/&gt; This plan probably originated from one of the several South Africans present at Lord's with an interest in the D'Oliveira question, including Coy and the private cricket tour organiser Wilfred Isaacs; according to Fraser-Sampson, there is evidence to suggest that it first came from the SACA.&lt;ref name=O158/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1328.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne writes that Griffith and Swanton were probably well-intentioned, and posits that they might have been caught up in a South African scheme in their search for a solution to the D'Oliveira problem.&lt;ref name=O158&gt;Oborne, pp. 158–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser-Sampson suggests that they and other MCC figures may have felt forced into this course of action by the vigour of the South Africans' protests that they would not tolerate a team including D'Oliveira.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1330.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of the second Test, D'Oliveira was told by [[Colin Cowdrey]], the England captain, that he had been left out of the team and was instead [[Glossary of cricket terms#T|twelfth man]].&lt;ref name=O160/&gt; In his place, England chose a fast bowler to strengthen their bowling attack.&lt;ref name="Wisden version"&gt;{{cite web|last=Melford|first=Michael|title=The D'Oliveira case| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152399.html| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1969 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the game was taking place, [[Doug Insole]], the chairman of the England selectors, introduced D'Oliveira to Isaacs, who offered him warm hospitality if he toured South Africa during the English winter. Deeply upset with his omission, D'Oliveira returned to play for Worcestershire once his twelfth man duties ended. Oborne suggests that, from a cricketing viewpoint, the decision to drop D'Oliveira looks odd, and that it may have been connected to the South African presence at Lord's.&lt;ref name=O160&gt;Oborne, pp. 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement for D'Oliveira, [[Barry Knight (cricketer)|Barry Knight]], performed well in the second Test; D'Oliveira, by contrast, lost all batting form. From mid-June until August, bothered by the pressure over South Africa, he struggled to score, managing just 205 runs at an average of 12.81. He maintained his form as a bowler, but critics believed his chance had gone. In July, as part of a standard procedure, the MCC wrote to 30 leading players to ask if they were available to tour South Africa; D'Oliveira was not contacted.&lt;ref name="Wisden version"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 162–63.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fraser-Sampson, the idea that D'Oliveira was not then one of England's best 30 players was absurd; he writes that the selectors must therefore have been aware that Vorster would not accept his selection and they had consequently decided not to choose him.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1387.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his slump in form, D'Oliveira was contacted by Tienie Oosthuizen, a director at the tobacco company [[Carreras Tobacco Company|Carreras]], which was, alongside [[Rothmans International|Rothmans]], part of the South African [[Rembrandt Group|Rembrandt Tobacco Corporation]]. Rembrandt had set up a group known as the South African Sports Foundation (SASF) to promote amateur sport. Oosthuizen told D'Oliveira that he represented Rothmans, who had sponsored matches featuring D'Oliveira while he was waiting to qualify for Worcestershire. He offered D'Oliveira work as a coach for the SASF on an annual salary of £4,000—a vast sum for a professional cricketer at the time—on the condition that he took up this role immediately at the end of the 1968 season, and thereby made himself unavailable for the MCC tour before selection took place.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 162–65.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Oliveira tentatively declined, but Oosthuizen persisted, first offering to find out if he would be included in the MCC team,&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; then telling him that his presence in that side would embarrass Vorster. D'Oliveira was aware that accepting the offer could cause many to lose respect for him as he would be abandoning the opportunity to play against South Africa, but nevertheless considered it over the following weeks. Oosthuizen repeatedly pressured him to accept. Shortly before the final Test of 1968, he offered personally to match the money that D'Oliveira told him he had been offered to make himself available for the MCC team. D'Oliveira stalled, and involved his agent, Reg Hayter. After further conversations with Oosthuizen, D'Oliveira decided to try to postpone a decision until after the team to tour South Africa was announced—Hayter had established from a source close to the selectors that D'Oliveira had a good chance of being picked.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 172–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a later press investigation, Oosthuizen claimed to have acted independently. [[Anton Rupert]], the head of Rembrandt, endorsed this version, asserting that Oosthuizen had acted in his capacity as an employee of the SASF. Rupert said this was an autonomous organisation,&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 166–68.&lt;/ref&gt; but according to Oborne the SASF constitution made it totally dependent on Rembrandt. Oborne writes that Oosthuizen's offers were rooted in the plans made by Vorster and Coy to bribe D'Oliveira indirectly by offering him work that would prevent him from playing for the MCC.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 150–51, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne surmises that the position and salary offered to D'Oliveira did not come from the SASF, but were actually part of a scheme involving Vorster and Rupert to remove the controversial player from the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also concludes that the offer was effectively a bribe to stop D'Oliveira playing.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early August, D'Oliveira returned to form with an innings of 89 against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the fifth and final England–Australia Test match, played between 22 and 27 August, Cowdrey batted at [[the Oval]], where the match was to be played, and deduced that medium-paced bowlers would be very effective given the condition of the cricket pitch. Consequently, when the England team was chosen, he asked for a medium-paced bowler to be placed in reserve in case conditions warranted their selection. The two first-choice selections, Knight and [[Tom Cartwright]], were unavailable, so D'Oliveira was called up by Cowdrey as a reserve on account of his bowling. On the day before the game, one of the England batsmen, [[Roger Prideaux]], withdrew from the team, saying he had an infection.{{refn|group=note|Prideaux later admitted that he could have played, but was concerned that if he had failed in that game, it might have cost him his place on the winter tour of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The team was duly re-arranged and the new version included D'Oliveira as a batsman. He heard no more from Oosthuizen, who was transferred from the London office soon after.&lt;ref name=O179&gt;Oborne, pp. 179–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The intervention of Oosthuizen became public knowledge when it was reported in the press in April 1969.&lt;ref name="Williams 58"&gt;Williams, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Height of controversy==

===Oval Test match===

[[File:The Oval test match - geograph.org.uk - 915211.jpg|thumb|[[The Oval]], pictured in 2008]]
Feeling much more confident, D'Oliveira expected to be successful in the Oval Test match. Before the game, an unnamed MCC official circulated a story that D'Oliveira had been offered thousands of pounds to keep himself available for the South Africa tour. This was a similar story to that which D'Oliveira had told Oosthuizen; it had probably travelled back to the MCC via South Africa, but was not true. When the game began, Australia held a 1–0 lead after four Tests; England needed a win to level the series. England made a reasonable start on the first day, but a late wicket brought D'Oliveira in to bat with the game delicately poised. Oborne observes that D'Oliveira was under huge pressure, both for simple cricketing reasons and because the world was watching to see if he would be successful.&lt;ref name="O180-83"&gt;Oborne, pp. 180–83.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' reported: "In the last hour D'Oliveira began his fine effort. He hooked the short ball superbly".&lt;ref name=Oval&gt;{{cite web|last=Preston|first=Norman|title=England v Australia (Fifth Test)| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150228.html| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1969 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the first day, he had scored 23 runs.&lt;ref name="O180-83"/&gt;

Early on the second day, D'Oliveira batted with less certainty. He was dropped by the opposition wicket-keeper with his score on 31, but he was encouraged by the umpire [[Charlie Elliott]] and his batting partner [[John Edrich]].&lt;ref name="O183-84"&gt;Oborne, pp. 183–84.&lt;/ref&gt; As his score reached fifty, Elliott whispered, "Well played—my God you're going to cause some problems."&lt;ref name="O183-84"/&gt; D'Oliveira went on to score 158 runs before he was out, although he was dropped a few more times after passing three figures.&lt;ref name=Oval/&gt; He received a prolonged ovation from the crowd when he was out, and congratulations from [[John Gleeson (cricketer)|John Gleeson]], one of the opposing Australians.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 6, Location 1168.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne assesses the innings as one of the best ever: despite the relatively weak attack and easy batting conditions, Oborne believes that no other cricketer had faced so much pressure and so many outside forces conspiring against him.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 184–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the game, D'Oliveira also contributed with the ball. After rain had reduced the amount of playing time and caused further delays through the subsequent clean-up, England faced a race against time to win the match. D'Oliveira took a crucial wicket with his 12th ball to break a long partnership and open the way for [[Derek Underwood]] to bowl England to victory in the game and a share in the series.&lt;ref name=Oval/&gt;

Off the field, manoeuvres started immediately. Vorster followed the innings closely, with Oosthuizen in attendance. On the second day of the match, [[Geoffrey Howard (British Army officer)|Geoffrey Howard]], the secretary of [[Surrey County Cricket Club]] (who played at the Oval), received a call from Oosthuizen, who informed Howard that he had been trying without success to contact Billy Griffith. He told Howard to pass along to Griffith the message that if "today's centurion is picked, the tour will be off".&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 185–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Insole asked D'Oliveira if he was available to tour South Africa, and Cowdrey questioned him about how he would handle the inevitably tense situations. Cowdrey also said that he wanted him in the team. D'Oliveira was left in little doubt that he would be selected to tour South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 186–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The selectors, after a six-hour meeting, chose the team to tour South Africa on 27 August 1968.{{refn|group=note|The meeting began at 8&amp;nbsp;pm on that date, but did not finish until 2&amp;nbsp;am on 28 August.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The official records of the meeting are incomplete and of those present, no one left an account of what happened. Oborne believes that at least ten men were present—the four selectors, Insole, [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]], [[Don Kenyon]] and [[Alec Bedser]]; the England captain Colin Cowdrey; Gubby Allen, Billy Griffith, Arthur Gilligan and [[Donald Carr]] for the MCC; and possibly [[Maurice Allom]], another MCC member. Oborne suggests that one of those present might have been acting for the South African government, as Vorster was well-informed about what happened at the meeting and followed events closely.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 189–95.&lt;/ref&gt; He also observes that, of those present, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan knew from the Cobham letter what would happen if D'Oliveira were selected; he argues that they may have passed the information on to other selectors. Coy, who had been at the Lord's Test, may also have made the South African position clear at the meeting. According to Oborne, "Everyone in the room, with the possible exception of the Worcestershire skipper Don Kenyon, would have been aware that the selection of D'Oliveira could at best cause difficulties and at worst cause the tour to be cancelled."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser-Sampson goes further, suggesting that Insole, and possibly also May, knew the whole story from an early stage.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1396.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a cricketing viewpoint, most critics agreed that D'Oliveira should probably have been selected based on his score at the Oval, his past record, and the usefulness of his bowling. The selectors left him out, however, deciding that his bowling was not strong enough to classify him as an all-rounder. Oborne points out that, judged in cricketing terms, this was "not an outrage".&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Oliveira had several rivals as a batsman, and of the places available, one went to [[Ken Barrington]], who had a good Test record, and the other to [[Keith Fletcher]], who was much younger than D'Oliveira. Oborne judges both of these decisions fair.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody at the selection meeting supported including D'Oliveira. Some of those present said later that, despite his prior assurances to D'Oliveira, Cowdrey opposed his selection at the meeting, which influenced others there.&lt;ref name=O200/&gt; Fraser-Sampson suggests that Cowdrey, who later tried to justify his role in events, may have inwardly supported D'Oliveira's inclusion, but spoken against it out of a lack of confidence and decisiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1414.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible, argues Fraser-Sampson, that if May had been aware of the true state of affairs, he may have confided in Cowdrey, a close friend; this would have left Cowdrey, who was very keen to lead a team to South Africa, in a difficult and conflicted position. Fraser-Sampson concludes: "Far from being the villain of the piece, Cowdrey may simply have been an honourable man pushed beyond the limits of his character and overwhelmed by events."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1437.&lt;/ref&gt;

As is customary at such selection meetings, there was no vote. Insole recalled that there was no hostility towards D'Oliveira at the meeting, and pointed out that although he was not chosen in the main team, he was made a reserve.&lt;ref name=O200&gt;Oborne, pp. 200–01.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams, while acknowledging that there were several worthy batsmen as candidates for places in the team, asserts that even if those at the meeting had only discussed the players' respective cricketing abilities, "every selector must have known that by not selecting D'Oliveira they would improve the prospects of the tour going ahead."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The full MCC Committee met to formally approve the selected team on the afternoon of 28 August.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody voiced opposition.&lt;ref name=O212/&gt;

D'Oliveira, who learned of his omission over the radio in the Worcestershire dressing room having just scored 128 runs against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]], was deeply upset and faced intense press attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Moment of Heartbreak |work=[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]] |location=Johannesburg |url=http://heritage.thetimes.co.za/memorials/WC/BasilDOliveira/Article.aspx?id=570449 |pages=1, 3 |date=29 August 1968 |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206215115/http://heritage.thetimes.co.za/memorials/WC/BasilDOliveira/Article.aspx?id=570449 |archivedate=6 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=O204205&gt;Oborne, pp. 204–05.&lt;/ref&gt; Insole and Griffith defended the decision to omit D'Oliveira to the press, saying that there had been no pressure from South Africa and that the chosen team simply included better players than D'Oliveira.&lt;ref name=O212&gt;Oborne, pp. 212–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne writes that Insole considered the events surrounding the selection meeting as among the worst of his life, but that "he and the other selectors were victims of the decision, reached on the advice of Alec Douglas-Home early in 1968, not to press for an answer to the MCC demand there should be 'no preconditions' for the tour. Once that decision had been made, everything else followed: the bribery attempt, the secret pressure and the nobbling of the MCC. Had the matter been dealt with&amp;nbsp;... Insole would never have been subject to the innuendo and accusations of racism and betrayal that have haunted him ever since."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction===

While the general public were baffled that a man who just scored a century against Australia could be left out of the team, the English cricketing press were divided on the decision.&lt;ref name="Williams 58"/&gt; Some journalists supported the MCC on cricketing grounds, including the cricket correspondents of ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.{{refn|group=note|[[John Woodcock (cricket writer)|John Woodcock]], the ''Times'' correspondent, supported the selectors at the time, but later changed his mind, saying he had misjudged the situation surrounding D'Oliveira.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1505.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 217–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, prominently the former England captain [[Ted Dexter]], the former Test player [[Trevor Bailey]] and E.&amp;nbsp;W. Swanton, all of whom generally sided with the cricket establishment, contended that D'Oliveira deserved to be in the team on merit.&lt;ref name=O213/&gt; Swanton said he had received no letters which actually agreed with the omission.&lt;ref name=W59/&gt; Other commentators, such as the Worcestershire club secretary and the former West Indies Test player [[Learie Constantine]], openly stated that D'Oliveira was omitted either because of his race or because the MCC supported apartheid.&lt;ref name=O213&gt;Oborne, pp. 213–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politicians also expressed concern.&lt;ref name=O213/&gt; John Arlott, while asserting that D'Oliveira deserved to be included, suggested that to demonstrate opposition to apartheid, the MCC should perhaps have selected him even if this were not the case.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 216–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The general press took a wider view, with several newspaper columns reporting that the decision appeared to have been made to avoid offending the South African government.&lt;ref name=W59&gt;Williams, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Williams, the public positions held by much of the MCC committee towards South Africa led to suspicions that D'Oliveira may have been left out simply to save the tour.&lt;ref name=W59/&gt;

More recent commentators suggest that the MCC members were not directly motivated by support of apartheid. Oborne argues that the MCC establishment, without favouring apartheid, wished to maintain traditional links with white South Africa.&lt;ref name=O212/&gt; Williams suggests that the committee were politically naive, and that they ignored the political dimensions of D'Oliveira's non-selection. Williams writes that the committee seemed unaware that its decision made it appear to support apartheid.&lt;ref name=W64/&gt; Fraser-Sampson believes that those involved "acted for what they thought were the best of motives, namely what they saw as the good of the game."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1572.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the right-wing links of some individuals—Gilligan had been a member of the [[British Fascists]] during the 1920s,&lt;ref name=O194&gt;Oborne, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bedser later became a member of [[the Freedom Association]], which Fraser-Sampson classifies as "far-right"&lt;ref name=racism/&gt;—neither Oborne nor Fraser-Sampson suggests that the two men were racist, or that any of the selectors' actions regarding D'Oliveira were tainted by prejudice or support for apartheid.&lt;ref name=O194/&gt;&lt;ref name=racism/&gt; Fraser-Sampson does comment, however, that some individuals were "apologists" for Vorster, and that many of them firmly believed in the separation of politics and sport.&lt;ref name=racism&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1574.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all MCC members supported the selectors. Around 70 members met, including the clergyman and former England captain David Sheppard, and called for the tour to be abandoned. Sheppard's intervention shook Cowdrey, a religious man.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Within weeks, several MCC members had resigned in protest at the decision, and the MCC had received nearly 1,000 letters about it, mainly complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Cowdrey defends South African tour| newspaper = The Times  | location = London  | page =  1 | date = 9 September 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, whites received the news happily—one nationalist rally broke into cheers upon hearing the news&lt;ref name=O204205/&gt;—while the black community viewed the omission as a betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] sent telegrams to the Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], asking him to intervene, and to Gilligan, asking for the tour to be cancelled on the grounds that by playing in South Africa the England team would be "condoning apartheid".&lt;ref name=W59/&gt; D'Oliveira received many letters of support from the public. He also received sympathetic letters from Cowdrey, Insole, Griffith and Cobham. He responded with a burst of good form, and was not drawn into publicly criticising the MCC, even offering the team his support.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 219–20.&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a contract to cover the tour for the ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper, which drew criticism from other newspapers and shook Vorster.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 221–22.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, non-whites were not allowed into South African press boxes other than "in a menial capacity"—Vorster suggested that D'Oliveira may not even be allowed on the tour as a journalist.&lt;ref name=W61/&gt;

===Cancellation===

One of the MCC team, Tom Cartwright, had been struggling with an injury. He had considered withdrawing from the tour on moral grounds, owing to his reservations about involvement with the apartheid government.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1534.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different versions of what actually happened. According to Cowdrey, Cartwright played without discomfort on 14 September, passed a fitness test the following day, and suddenly withdrew after an overnight reaction to his exertions, prompting the selectors to take only ten minutes to choose D'Oliveira as a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1545.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser-Sampson records that Cartwright actually had two fitness tests, owing to pre-existing concerns over his health; the selectors tried to persuade him not to pull out, with Cowdrey particularly insistent, but Cartwright was adamant.&lt;ref name=Cartwright&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1542.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 September, he withdrew from the MCC team, citing his injury.&lt;ref name=O223/&gt; D'Oliveira was duly called up,&lt;ref name=Cartwright/&gt; a decision announced the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having been rejected as a bowler at the earlier meeting, he was now replacing a bowler in the team; the selectors stated that D'Oliveira's bowling might prove useful. Oborne's assessment of the decision is that "they had had enough and were bowing to public opinion."&lt;ref name=O223/&gt; Williams comments that the belated addition of D'Oliveira in the wake of outcry at his exclusion confirmed in the minds of many that politics had been involved in the team selection. Denis Howell felt the need to state publicly that the decision was the MCC's alone, and that there had been no pressure from the UK government.&lt;ref name=W61&gt;Williams, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Oliveira was pleased but suspected that the tour would no longer go ahead.&lt;ref name=O223&gt;Oborne, pp. 222–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa, Vorster heard that D'Oliveira had been added to the team shortly before addressing the Orange Free State National Party congress at [[Bloemfontein]] on 17 September.&lt;ref name=O223/&gt;&lt;ref name=cricinfotimeline/&gt; He immediately announced that the English team would not be allowed into South Africa if it included D'Oliveira. He told the gathering that while "we are and always have been prepared to play host to the MCC&amp;nbsp;... [we] are not prepared to receive a team thrust upon us by people whose interests are not the game, but to gain certain political objectives which they do not even attempt to hide".&lt;ref name=murray89&gt;{{cite book|title=Caught Behind: Race And Politics In Springbok Cricket |last1=Murray|first1=Bruce |last2=Merrett|first2=Christopher |publisher=Wits University Press |location=Johannesburg |year=2004|isbn=978-1-86914-059-5 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; To loud applause, he went on to describe the revised MCC team as "not the team of the MCC but the team of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, the team of SANROC [the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee] and the team of [[Ambrose Reeves|Bishop Reeves]] [a critic of apartheid]."&lt;ref name=murray89/&gt; Vorster expressed similar sentiments elsewhere, accusing the MCC of making a purely political decision.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 224–25.&lt;/ref&gt; He insisted that he "had taken a decision for South Africa".&lt;ref name=cricinfotimeline&gt;{{cite web|title=The D'Oliveira Affair|last=Williamson |first=Martin |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/356092.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo|date=13 September 2008|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South African press was mostly critical of Vorster, warning that his stand might lead to the country's exclusion from international sport,&lt;ref name=cricinfotimeline/&gt; but Professor Bruce Murray comments that the MCC's initial exclusion of D'Oliveira, only to then include him instead of a bowler, had given Vorster some ammunition to claim that the MCC selection was politically charged. Including D'Oliveira from the start would, by contrast, have forced Vorster to reveal that his plan to allow mixed teams was false.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Oborne, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, Griffith responded that the tour would be cancelled were D'Oliveira not allowed to play, and that he was in the team on merit having missed selection first time around by "a bee's whisker".&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 225–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Cowdrey, meanwhile, proposed flying to South Africa himself to safeguard the tour but the South African minister [[Ben Schoeman]] said that D'Oliveira had been chosen because of politics and that South Africa would make no deal to let him play.&lt;ref name=O226&gt;Oborne, pp. 226–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Coy and Cheetham flew secretly to London to try to find a compromise.&lt;ref name=O226/&gt; They held a four-hour meeting with the MCC committee on 24 September, directly after which the committee announced that "the side selected to represent MCC in South Africa is not acceptable for reasons beyond the control of the SACA. The MCC committee therefore decided unanimously that the tour will not take place."&lt;ref name=W61/&gt; Williams argues that the delay in cancelling the tour suggests that some in the MCC might still have hoped to find common ground with the South Africans.&lt;ref name="W61-2"&gt;Williams, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Oliveira briefly considered withdrawing from the team to save the series, but decided not to.&lt;ref name="W61-2"/&gt;

Sheppard and other MCC rebels called a Special General Meeting of the MCC;&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 220–21.&lt;/ref&gt; they wanted the MCC to state publicly that the team selection had been mishandled and that no further cricket should take place with South Africa until cricket there had been made non-racial. Before the meeting took place, the General Committee met the rebels and initially claimed that it would have been inappropriate to ask South Africa about D'Oliveira before the tour—although they had done so. The committee then admitted writing a letter but said that they had never received a reply. The Special General Meeting took place in December 1968, but the rebels were outvoted by the other members; Sheppard was criticised by members at the meeting, and his former friend Peter May refused to talk to him afterwards.&lt;ref name=O226/&gt; Those opposing Sheppard suggested that he opposed apartheid whereas the committee wanted to advance cricket. It was also suggested that the MCC should not act as the conscience of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=W62&gt;Williams, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams suggests that the vote indicated that a high proportion of the MCC favoured maintaining cricketing links with South Africa despite knowing that South African cricket operated racial segregation.&lt;ref name=W62/&gt;

==Aftermath==

Coming just after New Zealand abandoned their 1967 rugby tour over South Africa's refusal to accommodate a mixed team, the cancellation of the 1968–69 MCC series over D'Oliveira marked the second such incident in two years.&lt;ref name=W64/&gt; According to Oborne, the affair forced upon South African cricket a realisation that it had to change. In 1969, the [[South African Cricket Board of Control]] (SACBOC) announced that future teams would be racially integrated and selected purely on merit; efforts duly began to allow all races to compete against each other and share facilities. This led to some disagreement among non-white sports organisations between those who supported these incremental changes and those who wanted immediate disbanding of the old system. D'Oliveira, a member of the first group, was partly drawn into this conflict. He also faced criticism from those in South Africa and England who believed that, to oppose apartheid, he should have declared himself unavailable to tour in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 229–34.&lt;/ref&gt; With the tour to South Africa cancelled, the MCC hastily arranged for its team to play a Test series in Pakistan instead. D'Oliveira played and was very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 236–37.&lt;/ref&gt; He remained an England regular for four more years and played for Worcestershire until 1979.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In 1969, many of the events from the previous year became public knowledge, including the deceptions of Allen, Griffith and Gilligan. The MCC committee met and granted retrospective approval to the actions of the four men. Griffith's offer to resign was declined.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1591.&lt;/ref&gt; The press outcry of 1968 was not repeated; Fraser-Sampson speculates that the MCC may have applied pressure to journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1619.&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith and Allen later received [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]] from the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1631.&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy continued to flare in Britain and other countries regarding sporting links with South Africa. The [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa rugby team]]'s [[1969–70 South Africa rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland|1969–70 tour of Britain and Ireland]] was accompanied by mass demonstrations against apartheid, including an attempt by a protester in London to hijack the South African team bus, and a demonstration in Dublin where people tried to stop the South Africans from reaching the match venue by lying down in the middle of the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remembering bitter Springboks tour that paved a way for change |last=Inverdale |first=John |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/england/2346183/Remembering-bitter-Springboks-tour-that-paved-a-way-for-change.html | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=20 September 2006|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Africa cricket team was due to tour England shortly afterwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A last-gasp winner and a hijacked bus|last=Williamson|first=Martin|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/southafrica/rugby/story/165323.html|work=[[ESPNscrum]]|publisher=[[ESPN, Inc.]]|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the MCC remained keen for the series to go ahead. They cancelled the tour a week before the South Africans were due to arrive, following public protests and pressure from the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 234–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, pp. 292–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Virulent anti-apartheid demonstrations in Australia during the South Africa rugby team's [[1971 South Africa rugby union tour of Australia|1971 tour]] led to soaring police costs, matches played behind fences and barbed wire, and a [[state of emergency]] in [[Queensland]], all of which prompted the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Cricket Board]] to cancel the tour by the South Africa cricket team that had been scheduled to follow.{{refn|group=note|Both of these cancelled tours were replaced by pseudo-Test series pitting the host nation against "[[Rest of the World cricket team in England in 1970|Rest of the World]]" teams featuring leading cricketers from around the world, including several South Africans.&lt;ref name=peoplepower/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The best of the best? |last=Ryder-Whish |first=Matthew |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketer/content/story/220595.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo|date=July 2000 |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=peoplepower&gt;{{cite web |title=When people power sunk South Africa |last=Williamson |first=Martin |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/220550.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |date=1 October 2005 |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa was thereafter almost totally isolated from international cricket, but not from rugby. The [[Australian Rugby Union]] severed ties with South Africa after the turbulent 1971 series, but its counterparts in New Zealand, France and the [[Home Nations]] retained links into the 1980s. With Māori and [[Samoans|Samoan]] players officially designated "[[honorary white]]s" by the South African government, mixed-race New Zealand rugby teams toured South Africa in [[1970 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|1970]] and [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|1976]].&lt;ref name=nauright&gt;{{cite book |title=Sport, Cultures, and Identities in South Africa |last=Nauright|first=John |year=1997 |publisher=Leicester University Press |location=Leicester |isbn=978-0-7185-0072-6 |pages=143–147, 151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SACBOC formally integrated South African cricket in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of an African Game: Black Cricketers and the Unmasking of one of Cricket's Greatest Myths, South Africa, 1850–2003 |last=Odendaal |first=André |year=2003 |location=Cape Town |publisher=David Philip Publishers |isbn=978-0-86486-638-7 |pages=223–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; but enduring overseas opposition to South Africa's internal governance meant that the country did not play official international cricket again until 1991, after the start of the process to dismantle apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rewind to 1970: When politics killed a tour |last=Williamson |first=Martin

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4981">The '''Decamentathlon''' is a multi disciplined games event that was created as part of the first [[Mind Sports Olympiad]]. It was founded to try to find the best games all-rounder in the world and hence possibly the best games player. It was given a prize fund of [[pound sterling|£]]10,000 for the inaugural competition, that equalled
that of the highest funded event at the first MSO sponsored by [[Skandia]].&lt;ref name="mso1"&gt;"Mind Sports Olympiad Supplements", ''[[The Times]]'', July–August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the other events were spread over multiple playing sessions whereas the Decamentathlon was held over just a single session. This event was initially hailed as the MSO flagship event. Although, the Mind Sports Olympiad's other new event the [[Mind Sports Organisation#Pentamind|Pentamind]]  has since become regarded as the more significant event despite not having a fixed format.

== Format ==
The Mind Sports Olympiad was described as [[Olympic Games|the Olympics]] of the mind.&lt;ref name="mso1"/&gt; The Decamentathlon and Pentamind were an attempt to replicate the ideas of the [[decathlon]] and [[pentathlon]] from [[Track and field athletics|athletics]].
Unlike the Pentamind which has a free format allowing competitors to use different events to each other, the Decamentathlon has a fixed format. The Decamentathlon comprises
a 4 hour test which is split into 10 events (see below). Each event was either a reduced version of the full event when played in competition or a written paper. Each event carries a maximum score
of 100 points so the maximum possible score is 1000 points.
The complexity of setting the event and marking it  has meant that the only place to have held a Decamentathlon is the Mind Sports Olympiad where the annual world championship is held.

The Decamentathlon was originally divided into ten tests in the following events:&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;David Ward, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/22/davidward "Cerebral athletes play mind games"], ''[[The Guardian]]'',  22 August 2005, Retrieved on 31 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Contract bridge|bridge]], [[chess]], [[creative thinking]], [[draughts|draughts 8x8 / checkers]],  [[Go (game)|go]], [[intelligence]], [[Mastermind (board game)|mastermind]], [[memory skill]]s, [[mental calculation]]s, [[Reversi|othello]].

The memory section was initially run in a fixed format where competitors have to memorise a single [[deck of cards]] and a list of 48 random words (previously the second part was memorisation of a 96 digit number).
From 2008 the Decamentathlon world championships was held using a [[backgammon]] test in the place of bridge.

For 2011 the memory section was switched again, the random words section being replaced by a random 50 digit number to be memorised. The [[Reversi|othello]] and [[backgammon]] sections were also removed in favour of a [[Sudoku]] test and a Word puzzles test.

== Controversy ==

There has been controversy over the claim that the event had an inherent English language bias. This was especially on the sections of creative thinking and intelligence. This view is reinforced by there only having been one non-native English speaker to have won the World Championships, Gert Schnider from Austria. Although, the fact that three of the winners of the Decamentathlon have won the Pentamind in years other than when they won the Decamentathlon implies that this bias might be small.
There have also been issues of marking errors and the official answers not being accurate. This has resulted in medals being changed after they have been presented.

== Champions ==
The World Championships have taken place as part of the MSO since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;''Article about Decamentathlon'', http://www.boardability.com/game.php?id=decamentathlon, Retrieved on 13 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3969">The '''Deutsche Kampfspiele''' ([[English language|English]]: German Combat Games) were a [[Multi-sport event|national multi-sport event]] established in 1922 by the [[:de:Deutscher Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen|Deutscher Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen]] under [[Carl Diem]].

== Deutsche Kampfspiele ==

The events lasted from 1922 to 1934. According to Diem the games should promote "[[German art]], [[German song]] and German [[Volksgemeinschaft]]". In 1938 they were replaced by the [[Deutsches Turn- und Sportfest 1938]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Zentner]] and [[Friedeman Bedurftig]] ''[[The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich]]'' New York: Macmillan 1991 p.329&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film was made of the 1922 games, ''Die deutschen Kampfspiele 1922'', produced by [[Arnold Fanck]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmportal.de/film/die-deutschen-kampfspiele-1922_4d6a6df07687478fbc89f91c516a7c47  Die deutschen Kampfspiele 1922]&lt;/ref&gt; A two part documentary ''Zweite Deutsche Kampfspiele. 1. Tag''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmportal.de/film/zweite-deutsche-kampfspiele-1-tag_ca65f4f4031042beafa7d4b2d189d998  Zweite Deutsche Kampfspiele. 1. Tag]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Zweite Deutsche Kampfspiele. 2.

== NS-Kampspiele ==
During the Nazi regime, the fighting games continued as NS-fighting games. Since Germany had been allowed to participate in the Olympics since 1928, these games were no longer to be understood as a counter-movement to the Olympic idea, but rather as a propaganda platform for the regime. When, in 1935, the international boycott movement against the Olympic Games in Berlin in 1936 grew markedly, the replacement of German combat games in Berlin was Plan B of the [[Reichssportführer]]. On the order of Adolf Hitler on November 30, 1936, these games were held during the [[Reichsparteitage]] in Nuremberg from 1937 to 1938, with regional preliminary decisions for the main games. In addition to the NSDAP, the SA, SS, NSKK and HJ also participated in the predominantly military sports competitions, such as hand grenade targets, 30-meter swimming in a drizzle suit with a pack or 15-kilometer baggage in closed formations Wehrmacht and the police. The SA had the responsibility for these paramilitary events. The outbreak of war in 1939 ended the short episode of the NS combat games.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eckart Dietzfelbinger]] ''Nürnberg - Ort der Massen: Das Reichsparteitagsgelände. Vorgeschichte und schwieriges Erbe'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Zentner]] and [[Friedeman Bedurftig]] ''[[The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich]]'' New York: Macmillan 1991 p.627&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary was made of the 1937 edition of these games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmportal.de/film/ns-kampfspiele-1937_24e8e3652a0547cca4beaa6fafcc4fec  NS-Kampfspiele 1937]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22663">'''[[Tobacco]]''' usage in '''[[sport]]''' is a well documented and publicised occurrence. [[Tobacco advertising]] has connected itself to sports both for the connotations of health that sports provide, as well as the marketing potential of famous athletes.  Additionally, tobacco has played a role in the sport of [[baseball]] specifically and has affected both the rules affecting players and fan alike.  Agencies such as the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] have used sports as platforms for tobacco prevention programs, specifically targeted at younger people.

==Advertising==
[[File:White Borders baseball card reverse.JPG|thumb|Back of an old baseball card]]
For many years, [[Tobacco industry|tobacco companies]] have played a monumental role in advertising within the sports industry.  Major tobacco companies have employed the strategies of athletic endorsements, sponsorships of major athletic events, and creating powerful associations of tobacco and active lifestyles in order to advertise their products. The connection between sports and tobacco can be traced back to the origins of professional sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faverodental.com/2015/02/smokeless-tobacco-and-baseball/|title=Favero Family Dental {{!}}   Smokeless Tobacco and Baseball|website=www.faverodental.com|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after the [[National League|National Baseball League]]'s inception in 1876, [[Baseball card|trading cards]] with player's images emerged within cigarette packages.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/14/1/1.full#xref-ref-2-1 Tobacco in sport: an endless addiction?] Tob Control 2005;14:1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the oldest brands of [[chewing tobacco]], [[W. T. Blackwell and Company Tobacco Factory|Bull Durham]], advertised on outfield fences in [[baseball park]]s in the United States South.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  Despite this long-standing history, there have been many recent developments and changes in tobacco's relation to athletics.  Currently, trends have shifted as athletes today are more likely to endorse tobacco prevention efforts as opposed to tobacco products.

===Endorsements===
From the 1920s to 1940s baseball furthered its relation with tobacco.  Every major league team had a cigarette sponsor and baseball's greatest athletes such as [[Babe Ruth]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], and [[Ted Williams]], all appeared in cigarette advertisements.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; [[Lou Gehrig]] endorsed [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]]’ [[Camel (cigarette)|Camels]], saying he could smoke as many as he pleased and creating the slogan that Camels “don’t get your wind.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
|last= Brandt
|first= Allan
|title= The Cigarette Century
|publisher=[[Basic Books]]
|date=2007
|isbn=0-465-07047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As tensions mounted in the 1950s, with smoking's correlation to [[lung cancer]], the [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|Commissioner of Baseball]] prohibited players from wearing their uniforms in cigarette advertisements.  While baseball cracked down on endorsements, the [[National Football League]] not only permitted players to appear in tobacco advertisements but also signed [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]]’ [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] as its major television sponsor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  Of these players, one of the most prominent was [[Frank Gifford]].  Gifford played for the [[New York Giants]] in the 1950s and 1960s and later became a famous sportscaster.  In his prime, Gifford endorsed a wide range of products, including The [[American Tobacco Company]]'s [[Lucky Strike]] cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/?tag=tobacco-advertising-1960s |title=tobacco advertising 1960s |publisher=The Pop History Dig |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the tobacco industry began to anticipate increased federal regulation and voluntarily adopted the Cigarette Advertising Code, stating it would not “depict as a smoker any person well known as being, or having been, an athlete…[or] any person participating in, or obviously having just participated in, physical activity requiring stamina or athletic conditioning beyond that of normal recreation”. Under this code, athletes and celebrities were no longer allowed to give testimonials, but nonetheless the industry blatantly disregarded its own guidelines.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In October 2009, Baisha, [[China]]’s largest cigarette company, signed [[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]], an Olympic gold medalist hurdler, to endorse its cigarettes in both print advertisements and televised commercials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Sponsorships===
Traditionally, cigarette companies have had a strong relationship with [[Tobacco advertising#NASCAR auto racing|NASCAR events]].  After tobacco companies were forced to pull out of advertising in [[NASCAR]], [[Nicorette]] has entered the NASCAR arena and signed a three-year contract as part of an extension by GlaxoSmithKline, then the owner of Goody's Headache Powders, a long-time NASCAR sponsor.&lt;ref name="usatoday2005"&gt;{{cite web|last=Horovitz |first=Bruce |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2005-01-26-nascar-usat_x.htm |title=Nicorette, NASCAR sign sponsorship deal |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2005-01-27 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NASCAR's deal with Nicorette was only for one year. Winston stepped down after 33 years as title sponsor of NASCAR's championship series and was replaced by Nextel.&lt;ref name="usatoday2005"/&gt;  Nicorette sees a great market as NASCAR fans are 28% more likely to smoke than other adults. The firm also reported that they smoke 18% more cigarettes than other adults.&lt;ref name="usatoday2005"/&gt;  Since Nicorette has signed on as a sponsor, there has been a substantial decrease in the amount of NASCAR employees who smoke.  Nicorette began its quit smoking program in 2004, providing NASCAR members with training sessions and one-on-one counseling.

Cigarette companies have explored the sponsorship of rodeo since the early 1970s. From 1986 to 2009 the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] was sponsored by the [[U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company]] as well as the [[National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association]] (NIRA) since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ling|first=Pamela M.|last2=Haber|first2=Lawrence A.|last3=Wedl|first3=Stefani|title=Branding the Rodeo: A Case Study of Tobacco Sports Sponsorship|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2008.144097|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=100|issue=1|pages=32–41|doi=10.2105/ajph.2008.144097|pmid=19910357|pmc=2791245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association severed its ties with the tobacco industry in 2009, allowing [[rodeo]] culture to return to its status before tobacco's involvement in 1986.  “Cowboy Ted” Hallisey, a prominent print and broadcast journalist for rodeo events stated “Without [[big tobacco]], rodeos will move into mainstream sports because they will be more comfortable for children and families to attend”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobacco-facts.net/2009/12/professional-rodeo-cowboys-association-ends-tobacco-sponsorship |title=Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association Ends Tobacco Sponsorship &amp;#124; Tobacco Facts |publisher=Tobacco Facts. |date=2009-12-02 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertising strategies===
In the early 1900s the tobacco industry sought to pair smoking with active and healthy lifestyles.  Through its advertisements, the tobacco industry created associations between smoking and recreational and athletic activities like tennis, golf, swimming, football, track and field, skiing, and ice skating.  These activities were often depicted in cigarette advertising as activities demanding a cigarette for enhanced performance and even good health.  American Tobacco's Lucky Strikes ran a successful advertising campaign that urged men and women “To keep a slender figure, reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet.”

=== Advertising and Sponsorship in Australia ===
One of the first countries to ever legislate the end of tobacco advertising and sponsorship at sporting events was Australia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Quit Victoria in Australia, stated that the three major sponsors for sport in 1980 were the largest tobacco companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/fandi/fandi/c15s5.htm|title=15.5 Sponsorship|website=www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the tobacco industry put a whopping 34 million dollars into [[cricket]] and [[rugby league]]. Although advertisement of tobacco products on television had been banned in 1976, on ground advertising and naming rights to oppositions and events was tactically used by tobacco companies; for example, the [[Benson &amp; Hedges|Benson and Hedges]] logo would appear for approximately 90 minutes in a day’s play of [[test cricket]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clearinghouseforsport.gov.au/knowledge_base/organised_sport/sport_integrity/tobacco_sponsorship_and_advertising_in_sport|title=Clearinghouse for Sport|last=|first=|date=|website=Tobacco Sponsorship and Advertising in Sport|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tobacco advertising [[Prohibition Act|prohibition act]] 1992, prohibited nearly all of tobaccos advertising and sponsorships in sporting events. However, under section 18 of the Act, there was power to allow an exception to the general ban on tobacco advertising in Australia for sporting events of international significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00440|title=Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992|last=Health|website=www.legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, there was an amendment to remove this act and Australian sport became totally tobacco sponsorship and advertisement free in October 2006.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Smokeless tobacco ==
[[Smokeless tobacco]]: [[chewing tobacco]], [[Dipping tobacco|spit tobacco]], [[Snuff (tobacco)|dry snuff]], [[snus]], or ‘tabac à chiquer’ in France, is very common in some sports.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is little data on the number of athletes that use smokeless tobacco, but a study showed that approximately 45 percent of major league baseball players have been reported to use smokeless tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiamulera|first=Cristiano|last2=Leone|first2=Roberto|last3=Fumagalli|first3=Guido|date=2007-12-01|title=Smokeless tobacco use in sports: ‘legal doping’?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.01993.x/abstract|journal=Addiction|language=en|volume=102|issue=12|pages=1847–1848|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.01993.x|issn=1360-0443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athletes apparently used smokeless tobacco to enhance their performance because nicotine improved certain aspects of physiology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chagué|first=Frédéric|last2=Guenancia|first2=Charles|last3=Gudjoncik|first3=Aurélie|last4=Moreau|first4=Daniel|last5=Cottin|first5=Yves|last6=Zeller|first6=Marianne|title=Smokeless tobacco, sport and the heart|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1875213614002678|journal=Archives of Cardiovascular Diseases|volume=108|issue=1|pages=75–83|doi=10.1016/j.acvd.2014.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been found that smokeless tobacco can cause many harmful health effects such as [[cancer]], mouth and tooth problems, [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] and [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/tobaccocancer/smokeless-tobacco|title=Health Risks of Smokeless Tobacco|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball and tobacco==
Between 1920 until 1940, when baseball was Americas most popular sport, every team had a tobacco sponsor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; It is common perception that many baseball players use tobacco.  According to the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] however this practice is changing and declining.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mychael Urban&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;MLB.com |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080630&amp;content_id=3037249&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Tobacco use in baseball on the decline &amp;#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One source states that a reason chewing tobacco usage increased among baseball players was the misconception that it improved concentration, overall performance and was less harmful than smoking a cigarette. Contrary to this, chewing tobacco does not have an established connection to the performance of baseball players.&lt;ref name="publichealthgreybruce1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealthgreybruce.on.ca/Tobacco/Chewing/Sports.htm |title=Chewing Tobacco - Sports |publisher=Publichealthgreybruce.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As more information about [[Health effects of tobacco#Particular forms of tobacco use|the dangers of chewing tobacco]] has come to light it has become stigmatized within baseball itself with players, staff and managers often having to "sneak" off to partake.  These individuals understand that children will easily copy their actions and try to hide them now, as they are negative role models for youth.  Most players have made attempts to quit, but the majority struggle in breaking their addiction.&lt;ref name="costkids1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.costkids.org/tobacco/smokelesstobacco/smokelesstobacco.htm |title=Smokeless Tobacco |publisher=Costkids.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628060817/http://www.costkids.org/tobacco/smokelesstobacco/smokelesstobacco.htm |archivedate=2010-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lenny Dykstra]], the former [[Philadelphia Phillies]] center-fielder, started [[Dipping tobacco|dipping]] at a young age, unaware of how difficult quitting would be. He tells young children, "They call me "Nails" because they say I'm as tough as nails. But I'm not tough enough to beat the spit-tobacco habit. Copy my hustle, copy my determination. But don't copy my spit-tobacco habit."&lt;ref name="costkids1"/&gt;  In addition Major League Baseball has taken actions to lower tobacco usage amongst its players.  This includes a complete ban on tobacco with fines for players and their managers if it is discovered.  In the major leagues tobacco companies are no longer allowed to leave free products in stadium clubhouses for the players, with a ban effective December 5, 2016, in the new Collective Bargaining Agreement that prohibits players entering MLB for the first time from using tobacco.  (Players who had experience in MLB prior to the day are grandfathered.)  &lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  Baseball stadiums have stricter tobacco policies for patrons as well though the level of strictness varies per stadium.&lt;ref name="no-smoke1"&gt;[http://www.no-smoke.org/pdf/majorleaguebaseballstadiumpoliices.pdf Smoking Policies at Major League Baseball Stadiums], May 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tobacco prevention and sports==
The majority of tobacco smokers start smoking before they graduate high school.  The CDC has identified youth sports as an area where tobacco education and prevention will help limit the number of first time smokers and has begun a Tobacco Free Sports Movement to encourage non smoking practices in athletics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/youth/sports/index.htm |title=Smoking and Tobacco Use :: Youth Tobacco Prevention :: Tobacco-Free Sports Initiatives :: Office on Smoking and Health (OSH) :: CDC |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CDC has paired with many large organizations to achieve this goal. These include public health agencies such as the [[National Cancer Institute]], and sport regulatory bodies such as [[FIFA]] and the [[International Olympic Committee]] to further the efforts of tobacco elimination in sports.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;  The [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]] banned not only tobacco usage, but advertising, sponsorship, promotion and sale of tobacco products in Olympic venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpro.who.int/china/sites/tfi/tfo.htm |title=WHO China-Tobacco-free Olympics |publisher=Wpro.who.int |date=2010-05-27 |accessdate=2010-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713060044/http://www.wpro.who.int/china/sites/tfi/tfo.htm |archivedate=2010-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last Olympics with a tobacco company as a sponsor were in 1984, and control has gotten stricter since then (as can be seen from the Beijing regulations).&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;[http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/14/1/1.full Tobacco in sport: an endless addiction?] Tob Control 2005;14:1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  On a smaller scale there are regional efforts to create tobacco free sports initiatives such as the Tobacco-Free Athletes of Maine.  This organization seeks to have coaches educate their young athletes about the effects of tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccofreemaine.org/channels/educators/tobacco_free_athletes.php |title=Tobacco-Free Athletes - Tobacco Prevention for Youth in Sports &amp; Community Programs - Partnership For A Tobacco-Free Maine |publisher=Tobaccofreemaine.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many athletes have become spokespersons for [[Tobacco control movement|anti-tobacco]] and tobacco prevention efforts.  Early in the 20th century Hall of Fame baseball player [[Honus Wagner]] would not allow a cigarette company to use his picture on a tobacco trading card.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;  Since then famous athletes like skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; and baseball player [[Sammy Sosa]] have supported tobacco prevention.&lt;ref name="publichealthgreybruce1"/&gt;  Events such as the [[American Cancer Society]]'s [[Great American Smokeout]] also make use of athletes to support their anti-tobacco efforts.  In 2000, the American Cancer Society had [[Alonzo Mourning]] of the [[Miami Heat]] (with other athletes) speak to children about the dangers of smoking.&lt;ref name="cancer1"&gt;[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Athletes_Pitch_in_to_Send_Quit_Smoking_Message_during_Great_American_Smokeout.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025103726/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Athletes_Pitch_in_to_Send_Quit_Smoking_Message_during_Great_American_Smokeout.asp |date=October 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], the [[Canada women's national ice hockey team]] celebrated their gold medal victory on the ice with both cigars and tobacco.  As the Vancouver Olympics were a tobacco free event, the International Olympic Committee decided to look into the celebration since it was a breach of anti-tobacco rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CBSSports.com wire reports |url=http://www.cbssports.com/olympics/story/12978672/ioc-to-look-into-drinking-celebrations-on-ice-by-women-hockey-team |title=IOC to look into drinking celebrations on ice by women's hockey team - Olympics |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special needs of [[triathlon]] competitions have led to the development of a whole range of specialized clothing and equipment.

== Triathlon-specific swim equipment ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Triathlon]] --&gt;
Typical equipment for a swim includes a cap, goggles and a swimsuit and/or wetsuit.  Usually, participants must wear a swim cap provided by the event. For safety reasons, the swim caps are generally brightly colored for high visibility. The colors may categorize swimmers by event (e.g. Olympic, Sprint) or by heat.

Any artificial propulsion device, e.g. [[Swimfin|fin]], sock, glove, paddle or flotation device except a wet suit, is prohibited.  Snorkels, however, are a gray area. Triathlon Canada, Australia Triathlon, USAT and ITU do not specifically disallow snorkels. British Triathlon does not list snorkels as part of the accepted equipment, thus they are disallowed.&lt;ref name=PowerTri&gt;{{cite web|title=Are snorkels legal for racing?|url=http://www.powertri-blog.com/swimming/are-snorkels-legal-for-racing.html|publisher=PowerTri.com|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For safety reasons in open-water events, some federations permit special inflatable flotation devices; though activating the device will usually disqualify the swimmer, it can be used to float if the swimmer experiences difficulty.

Because most triathlon swim stages are conducted in open waters (lakes, rivers, or oceans) which are often cold, many early races allowed [[wetsuit]]s. However, typical wetsuits manufactured for [[snorkeling]] or [[water skiing]] are not optimal for triathlon, because the sleeves generally restrict the range of motion too much for comfortable stroking during the swim. Modern triathlon wetsuits were invented by [[Dan Empfield]] in 1987 and are customized to the needs of triathletes, and generally incorporate the following features:
* Thinner and/or more pliable rubber near the shoulders, sleeveless versions are also available.
* Long zippers and sometimes wrist/ankle zippers to facilitate quick removal during transition.

In addition, tri wetsuits have a very smooth, but often fragile, surface. This slick surface helps to reduce water friction and allow a faster swim, but it would be easily destroyed by contact with a sandy surfboard. Another advantage of a wetsuit is the added buoyancy. It provides triathletes with a considerable advantage.

Rules vary by event, but typically wetsuits are allowed only if the water temperature is below a specified threshold on the day of the event (e.g. 26&amp;nbsp;°C, 78&amp;nbsp;°F). Any athlete has the option of wearing another style of swimsuit allowed by the rules at any temperature.  As of 2013, triathlons sanctioned by USAT also have a wetsuit thickness rule.  No wetsuit with a thickness of greater than 5mm may be used.  Most triathlon wetsuits have thicknesses of 3mm to 5mm, but the new rule likely affects some models and older wetsuits.&lt;ref&gt;http://triathlonwetsuitstore.com/what-the-new-usat-wetsuit-thickness-rule-means-to-you/&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, most triathletes do not have the luxury of an open water swim environment near where they train, and year-round outside training can be difficult in cold climates.  Several swim training products have been created to address this issue including ergometers like the Vasa Swim Trainer or compact swimming treadmills like [[Endless Pools]].

Trisuits may also be used for the swim, bike, and run. They are made out of a swimsuit material and usually have some form of [[Cycling shorts|chamois]].

== Triathlon-specific cycling equipment ==

===Triathlon bicycles===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cyfac tri bike.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A triathlon bicycle with triathlon handlebar and aerodynamic wheelset.]] --&gt;
Triathlon [[bicycle]]s are a variant of road-[[racing bicycle]]s, designed primarily to optimize [[aerodynamics]]. Since in most triathlons, cyclists do not [[drafting (racing)|draft]] as in many other forms of road racing, triathletes can gain a significant advantage by riding a bicycle which reduces wind resistance. The most obvious features of a triathlon bicycle are the handlebars, commonly known as "aero-bars" (see below).

In addition, many components of a triathlon bicycle are designed with an aerodynamic profile: [[bicycle frame|frame tubes]] have an oval or teardrop (instead of circular) cross-section; [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]] may be flat instead of round; [[bicycle wheel|wheels]] may have fewer spokes, or even be [[Graphite-reinforced plastic|carbon fiber]] tri-spokes or discs rather than conventional spoked wheels.  Lastly, a number of "radical" bicycle frames that are illegal in road cycling are still legal in triathlon, so "nontraditional" frame designs are also common, including [[Zipp 2001]], [[Softride]], and [[Kestrel USA|Kestrel]].

Tri bikes generally have a very "aggressive" geometry, meaning steep (close to vertical) tube angles and a low stem and handlebars relative to the saddle. This position helps to improve aerodynamics by lowering the cyclist's torso and creating a smaller overall "drag profile". In addition, many triathletes feel cycling in this position helps preserve the muscles used in running by emphasizing pedaling with non-running muscle groups.

The concept of a tri specific bicycle was pioneered by [[Ralph Ray]] and [[Dan Empfield]] in the late 1980s. Tri bikes are generally very similar to [[time trial bicycle]]s used in [[Individual time trial|time trial]] races. In 1989, Empfield designed the [[Quintana Roo (company)|Quintana Roo]] Superform, a triathlon specific bicycle "built from the aerobars back" which provided an aerodynamic advantage as well as more power when in the "aero" position. Empfield's bike had 650c wheels and an 80 degree seat angle which was unique to the period. Many professional triathletes were skeptical of the "steep" design at first but when [[Ray Browning]] rode it at Ironman New Zealand breaking the bike and overall course records and left the bike leg with a 30-minute lead over rival [[Scott Tinley]], the concepts were here to stay.

The aerodynamic shape causes somewhat higher weight, even if carbon fiber is used. In very hilly races where a lot of time is spent in slow uphills, a low-weight traditional road bicycle might be preferred.

===Aerobars===
[[Triathlon bars|Aerobars]], also commonly referred to as "tri-bars," are [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]] designed to reduce the cyclist's wind profile. Triathlon played a key role in the development of cycling with an aero geometry during the 1980s. Aerobars are used in other forms of cycling, such as time trials and some events in track cycling.

Instead of the familiar curved "drop bars" of road bicycles, aerobars are mounted to a set of "pace bars" or "bull-horns". A pair of bars stretches straight forward from the center of these handlebars at the stem of the fork. Padded cups or pads in the middle of the bars support the athlete's elbows and/or forearms while the hands are stretched forward to hold the center bars. This position keeps the rider's elbows in close to the body and lowers his or her torso compared to the usual upright position.

The [[Bicycle brake systems#Brake levers|brake levers]] are mounted on the side horns; the rider will hold these instead of the center bars when braking or maneuvering is required. Often the [[Shifter (bicycle part)|shifters]] for the [[derailleur gears]] are mounted at the tips of the aero bars allowing the athlete to change gear ratios without compromising their aerodynamic position.

Riding with aerobars is facilitated by adopting a steep seat-tube angle, often referred to as an "aggressive" [[Bicycle frame#Road and triathlon bicycles|geometry]]. The forward nature of this positioning is not as easy to [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Rider control inputs|control]] as traditional seat tube angle and upright position. Maneuverability is compromised for an aerodynamic body position when a bike is fitted with low aerobars.

The [[International Triathlon Union]] regulates the size of aerobars used in competition for draft-legal races. Triathlons allowing [[Drafting (racing)|drafting]] promote cycling as a group on the cycle leg of the triathlon, allowing athletes to compete with a very aggressive geometry compromises safety as maneuverability is reduced. Professional triathletes competing in these races use "shorty" aerobars mounted on traditional drop handlebars.

===Triathlon shoes===
Triathlon shoes are similar to other forms of [[cycling shoe]] used in racing, with automatic binding cleats (clipless) that snap the cyclist's feet to the [[bicycle pedal|pedals]]. Tri shoes are often optimized for this approach: they may be padded to allow comfortable use without socks, have holes to allow water from the swim to drain easily, and have only one or two [[velcro]] straps for ease of fastening rather than the three straps, laces, or ratcheting buckles found on modern road racing shoes. It is not uncommon for the Velcro straps used to close from the outside of the foot inwards, this non-traditional configuration keeps the opened straps away from the chain and bicycles, preventing the possibility of entangling them if pedaling with unstrapped shoes early or late in the race.

Many competitive triathletes choose to leave their shoes clipped onto the pedals for the entire duration of the race in order to save time during transitions. This means the athlete is jumping onto the bicycle with wet, bare feet after the swim, and will pedal up to a reasonable speed, with his or her feet sitting on top of the shoes, before pausing to slip the feet inside the shoes and fasten them. Likewise, the athlete will pull his or her feet out of the shoes while coasting up to the bike-run transition area and run barefoot into the transition corral rather than attempt to run on the awkward cycling cleats.

===Hydration systems===
[[Image:Aero bottle cage and bottle.JPG|thumb|Aerodynamically shaped bottle with matching carbon fiber cage]]
As with everything else, triathletes often strive to make their water bottles as aerodynamic as possible, and often to reduce the need to reach for a water bottle - which may interrupt pedaling and slow the racer down. Triathletes have tried placing water bottles in unusual locations, such as in a bracket behind the saddle, on the theory that the bottles are shielded from the wind by the body. However, a recent wind-tunnel study by ''Triathlete Magazine'' discovered that this approach is actually counterproductive because it interrupts the [[laminar flow]] of air down the athlete's curved back. A 2003, wind tunnel study by Dan Empfield found that the best configuration was a single water bottle on the bike's downtube (it smoothed airflow to the seat tube and rear wheel). This caused less drag than having no waterbottle at all. The most drag was 2 water bottles; one on the down tube and one on the seat tube.

A number of products have been created to satisfy triathlete's demands for aerodynamic hydration systems. Examples include the Aerodrink system by Profile Design, an aero bottle that hangs from the handlebars with a straw so the athlete can drink without using his hands; and the Neverreach system, a teardrop-shaped reservoir mounted behind the seat with a tube running up to the handlebars. In addition, certain high-end triathlon bicycles have a hydration system integrated into the frame's tubing itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specialized.com/us/en/bikes/road/shiv/s-worksshivdi2 Specialized Bicycles S-Works Shiv DI2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603053710/http://www.specialized.com/us/en/bikes/road/shiv/s-worksshivdi2 |date=2012-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On long-distance triathlons, the participants will get filled bottles by the organiser during the race as replacement for the used ones. If using special bottles, the received bottle should be emptied into own bottle, and immediately thrown. Bottles hanging from the handlebars are generally prepared for this. To throw bottles outside [[aid station]]s is not allowed. In Ironman own aid suppliers are not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ironmanmelbourne.com/files/2012/02/v_IRONMAN_MELBOURNE_AIG.pdf ATHLETE INFORMATION GUIDE See page 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wheels===
A vast array of low-weight and/or aerodynamic [[Bicycle wheel|wheels]] exist for racing bicycles. Some (such as wheels with an aerodynamic ring, flat spokes, and fewer spokes than the traditional 32) are legal for use in most cycling events, while others such as carbon-fiber tri-spokes (wheels with only three large, rigid spokes) generally are only legal in triathlons and time-trials. Typically wheels that are lighter are preferred and, although this is an obvious consideration, it is not the only one. Higher profile wheels (larger rim) are conducive to laminar flow of air past them more so than traditional thin rimmed wheels.

Solid [[Bicycle wheel#Disc wheels|disc wheels]] are used as well, though in outdoor settings these are generally not used on the front wheel because they are difficult to handle in crosswinds. Disc wheels provide a significant aerodynamic advantage when mounted on the rear wheel improving laminar flow over the rear half of the bike. Recent developments in technology have given rise to disc wheels with a dimpled surface like a golf ball, also in the name of aerodynamics. Disc wheels are not permitted at the Ironman World Championships in Kona Hawaii, as large crosswinds are not uncommon and present an unsafe situation to athletes.

Some triathlon bikes use 650c wheels (a nominal diameter of 65 centimeters) rather than the conventional 700c wheels used on nearly all road bikes. The smaller wheels weigh less, have a smaller cross-sectional area (reducing wind resistance), and reduce the overall wind resistance of the bicycle by bringing the frame and cyclist closer to the ground. A potential drawback is that the smaller diameter means a higher curvature at the [[Bicycle tire|tire's]] [[contact patch]], which increases [[rolling resistance]]. Which effect is more prominent depends on the cyclist and the windiness and steepness of the course.

===Other components===
Many triathletes can be quite fixated with improving the aerodynamics and lowering the weight of their bicycles. As a result, the triathlon industry has developed a whole host of components which improve myriad characteristics of the bicycle. Examples include [[Crankset#Chainring|chainrings]] which have no holes or gaps (increasing aerodynamics a minuscule amount at the cost of a few grams of weight), brake and shifter [[Bowden cable|cables]] which run inside the bicycle frame, and components of all sorts made from carbon fiber composite rather than steel or aluminum, in order to save weight.

==Triathlon-specific running equipment==

===Elastic shoelaces===
Triathletes often lace their [[running shoe]]s with elastic [[shoelaces]]. This allows them to pre-set the tension of the laces but then to pull on the shoes without stopping to tie the laces. This saves a few seconds of time during the bike-to-run transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.runtheplanet.com/trainingracing/triathlon/transitiontips.asp| title = Tips for Faster Triathlon Transitions| author = Lynda Wallenfels| publisher = Run the Planet| accessdate = 2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most popular brands of such laces that are designed specifically for triathlon are [[Lock Laces]], Speedlaces, and Yankz.&lt;ref&gt;http://triathlonwetsuitstore.com/stretch-laces-review-speedlaces-yankz-and-lock-lace/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holes in sole of shoe===
Shoes with holes in the bottom allow water to drain out so that they do not become saturated and heavy, which can happen in long races like Iron-Man and Half-Iron-Man and can become very painful and annoying. Triathlon running stages are generally held later on the day compared to running races, creating a hotter temperature. Certain triathlon specific brand shoes already have holes in them for drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://activegearreview.com/gear-reviews/running/road-running-shoes/mens-road-running-shoes-running-gear-reviews/scott-t2-pro| title = Scott T2 Pro Review| date = Jan 17, 2010| publisher = Active Gear Review| accessdate = 2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socks===
Socks are avoided, especially on shorter races, to give faster transitions, as they are not legal in swimming. If they are used they should be fast to put on. Not using socks can cause [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasion]] which might be painful. Triathletes should practice running the intended distance in the racing shoes without socks. There are triathlon specialty shoes with seamless insides, prepared for long distances without socks. On the Ironman distance some athletes use long [[compression socks]] in the expectation that an enhanced endurance will compensate for the extra time spent to put them on.
