It deals with the professional responsibilities of mathematicians whose work influences decisions with major consequences, such as in law, finance, the military, and environmental science.\n\nMathematicians in industrial, scientific, military and intelligence roles crucially influence decisions with large consequences. For example, complex calculations were needed for the success of the Manhattan Project, while the overextended use of the Gaussian copula formula to price derivatives before the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 has been called \"the formula that killed Wall Street\", and the theory of global warming depends on the reliability of mathematical models of climate. For the same reason as in medical ethics and engineering ethics, the high impact of the consequences of decisions imposes serious ethical obligations on practitioners to consider the rights and wrongs of their advice and decisions.\n\nThese illustrate the major consequences of numerical mistakes and hence the need for ethical care.\n\nMathematicians in professional roles in finance and similar work have a particular responsibility to ensure they use the best methods and data to reach the right answer, as the prestige of mathematics is high and others rely on mathematical results which they cannot fully understand. Other ethical issues are shared with information economy professionals in general, such as duty of care, confidentiality of information, whistleblowing, and avoiding conflict of interest.\n\nMuch of mathematics as used in applications involves the drawing of conclusions from quantitative data. It is recognised that there are many difficulties in reaching and communicating such conclusions accurately, honestly and with due regard to the uncertainties that remain. It is easy for a statistician to mislead clients whose understanding of data and inference is less developed, so statisticians have professional responsibilities to act fairly.\n\nThe American Mathematical Society publishes a code of ethical guidelines for mathematical researchers. The responsibilities of researchers include being knowledgeable in the field, avoiding plagiarism and giving credit, to publish without unreasonable delay, and to correct errors. The European Mathematical Society Ethics Committee also publishes a code of practice relating to the publication, editing and refereeing of research.\n\nIt has been argued that as pure mathematical research is relatively harmless, it raises few urgent ethical issues. However, that raises the question of whether and why pure mathematics is ethically worth doing, given that it consumes the lives of many highly intelligent people who could be making more immediately useful contributions.\n\nCourses in the ethics of mathematics remain rare. The University of New South Wales taught a compulsory course on Professional Issues and Ethics in Mathematics in its mathematics degrees from 1998 to 2012.\n\n\n"}

Certain special classes of manifolds also have additional algebraic structure; they may behave like groups, for instance. In that case, they are called Lie Groups. Alternatively, they may be described by polynomial equations, in which case they are called algebraic varieties, and if they additionally carry a group structure, they are called algebraic groups.\nThe term \"manifold\" comes from German \"Mannigfaltigkeit,\" by Riemann.\n\nIn English, \"manifold\" refers to spaces with a differentiable or topological structure, \nwhile \"variety\" refers to spaces with an algebraic structure, as in algebraic varieties.\n\nIn Romance languages, manifold is translated as \"variety\" – such spaces with a differentiable structure are literally translated as \"analytic varieties\", while spaces with an algebraic structure are called \"algebraic varieties\". Thus for example, the french word \"\" means topological manifold. In the same vein, the Japanese word \" (tayōtai) also encompasses both manifold and variety. (\" (tayō) means various.)\nAncestral to the modern concept of a manifold were several important results of 18th and 19th century mathematics. The oldest of these was Non-Euclidean geometry, which considers spaces where Euclid's parallel postulate fails. Saccheri first studied this geometry in 1733. Lobachevsky, Bolyai, and Riemann developed the subject further 100 years later. Their research uncovered two types of spaces whose geometric structures differ from that of classical Euclidean space; these are called hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry. In the modern theory of manifolds, these notions correspond to manifolds with constant, negative and positive curvature, respectively.\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss may have been the first to consider abstract spaces as mathematical objects in their own right. His theorema egregium gives a method for computing the curvature of a surface without considering the ambient space in which the surface lies. In modern terms, the theorem proved that the curvature of the surface is an intrinsic property. Manifold theory has come to focus exclusively on these intrinsic properties (or invariants), while largely ignoring the extrinsic properties of the ambient space.\n\nAnother, more topological example of an intrinsic property of a manifold is the Euler characteristic. For a non-intersecting graph in the Euclidean plane, with \"V\" vertices (or corners), \"E\" edges and \"F\" faces (counting the exterior) Euler showed that \"V\"-\"E\"+\"F\"= 2. Thus 2 is called the Euler characteristic of the plane. By contrast, in 1813 Antoine-Jean Lhuilier showed that the Euler characteristic of the torus is 0, since the complete graph on seven points can be embedded into the torus. The Euler characteristic of other surfaces is a useful topological invariant, which has been extended to higher dimensions using Betti numbers. In the mid nineteenth century, the Gauss–Bonnet theorem linked the Euler characteristic to the Gaussian curvature.\n\nLagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics, when considered geometrically, are naturally manifold theories. All these use the notion of several characteristic axes or dimensions (known as generalized coordinates in the latter two cases), but these dimensions do not lie along the physical dimensions of width, height, and breadth.\n\nIn the early 19th century the theory of elliptic functions succeeded in giving a basis for the theory of elliptic integrals, and this left open an obvious avenue of research. The standard forms for elliptic integrals involved the square roots of cubic and quartic polynomials. When those were replaced by polynomials of higher degree, say quintics, what would happen? \n\nIn the work of Niels Abel and Carl Jacobi, the answer was formulated: the resulting integral would involve functions of two complex variables, having four independent \"periods\" (i.e. period vectors). This gave the first glimpse of an abelian variety of dimension 2 (an abelian surface): what would now be called the \"Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2\".\n\nBernhard Riemann was the first to do extensive work generalizing the idea of a surface to higher dimensions. The name \"manifold\" comes from Riemann's original German term, \"Mannigfaltigkeit\", which William Kingdon Clifford translated as \"manifoldness\". In his Göttingen inaugural lecture, Riemann described the set of all possible values of a variable with certain constraints as a \"Mannigfaltigkeit\", because the variable can have \"many\" values. He distinguishes between \"stetige Mannigfaltigkeit\" and \"diskrete\" \"Mannigfaltigkeit\" (\"continuous manifoldness\" and \"discontinuous manifoldness\"), depending on whether the value changes continuously or not. As continuous examples, Riemann refers to not only colors and the locations of objects in space, but also the possible shapes of a spatial figure. Using induction, Riemann constructs an \"n-fach ausgedehnte Mannigfaltigkeit\" (\"n times extended manifoldness\" or \"n-dimensional manifoldness\") as a continuous stack of (n−1) dimensional manifoldnesses. Riemann's intuitive notion of a \"Mannigfaltigkeit\" evolved into what is today formalized as a manifold. Riemannian manifolds and Riemann surfaces are named after Bernhard Riemann.\n\nIn 1857, Riemann introduced the concept of Riemann surfaces as part of a study of the process of analytic continuation; Riemann surfaces are now recognized as one-dimensional complex manifolds. He also furthered the study of abelian and other multi-variable complex functions.\n\nJohann Benedict Listing, inventor of the word \"topology\", wrote an 1847 paper \"Vorstudien zur Topologie\" in which he defined a \"complex\". He first defined the Möbius strip in 1861 (rediscovered four years later by Möbius), as an example of a non-orientable surface.\n\nAfter Abel, Jacobi, and Riemann, some of the most important contributors to the theory of abelian functions were Weierstrass, Frobenius, Poincaré and Picard. The subject was very popular at the time, already having a large literature. By the end of the 19th century, mathematicians had begun to use geometric methods in the study of abelian functions.\n\nHenri Poincaré's 1895 paper Analysis Situs studied three-and-higher-dimensional manifolds(which he called \"varieties\"), giving rigorous definitions of homology, homotopy, and Betti numbers and raised a question, today known as the Poincaré conjecture, based his new concept of the fundamental group. In 2003, Grigori Perelman proved the conjecture using Richard S. Hamilton's Ricci flow, this is after nearly a century of effort by many mathematicians.\n\nHermann Weyl gave an intrinsic definition for differentiable manifolds in 1912. During the 1930s Hassler Whitney and others clarified the foundational aspects of the subject, and thus intuitions dating back to the latter half of the 19th century became precise, and developed through differential geometry and Lie group theory.\n\nThe Whitney embedding theorem showed that manifolds intrinsically defined by charts could always be embedded in Euclidean space, as in the extrinsic definition, showing that the two concepts of manifold were equivalent. Due to this unification, it is said to be the first complete exposition of the modern concept of manifold.\n\nEventually, in the 1920s, Lefschetz laid the basis for the study of abelian functions in terms of complex tori. He also appears to have been the first to use the name \"abelian variety\"; in Romance languages, \"variety\" was used to translate Riemann's term \"Mannigfaltigkeit\". It was Weil in the 1940s who gave this subject its modern foundations in the language of algebraic geometry.\n\n"}

Milne states that the text was due to conversations (circa 1924) with his then-colleague and erstwhile teacher Sydney Chapman who viewed vectors not merely as a pretty toy but as a powerful weapon of applied mathematics. Milne states that he did not at first believe Chapman, holding on to the idea that \"vectors were like a pocket-rule, which needs to be unfolded before it can be applied and used.\" In time, however, Milne convinces himself that Chapman was right.\n\n\"Vectorial Mechanics\" has 18 chapters grouped into 3 parts.

Part II is on \"systems of line vectors\" including chapters on line co-ordinates, systems of line vectors, statics of rigid bodies, the displacement of a rigid body, and the work of a system of line vectors. Part III is on \"dynamics\" including kinematics, particle dynamics, types of particle motion, dynamics of systems of particles, rigid bodies in motion, dynamics of rigid bodies, motion of a rigid body about its center of mass, gyrostatic problems, and impulsive motion.\n\nThere were significant reviews given near the time of original publication.\n\nG.J.Whitrow:\n\nDaniel C. Lewis: \n\nThe reviewer has long felt that the role of vector analysis in mechanics has been much overemphasized. It is true that the fundamental equations of motion in their various forms, especially in the case of rigid bodies, can be derived with greatest economy of thought by use of vectors (assuming that the requisite technique has already been developed); but once the equations have been set up, the usual procedure is to drop vector methods in their solution. If this position can be successfully refuted, this has been done in the present work, the most novel feature of which is to solve the vector differential equations by vector methods without ever writing down the corresponding scalar differential equations obtained by taking components. The author has certainly been successful in showing that this can be done in fairly simple, though nontrivial, cases. To give an example of a definitely nontrivial problem solved in this way, one might mention the nonholonomic problem afforded by the motion of a sphere rolling on a rough inclined plane or on a rough spherical surface. The author's methods are interesting and aesthetically satisfying and therefore deserve the widest publication even if they partake of the nature of a tour de force.\n"}
