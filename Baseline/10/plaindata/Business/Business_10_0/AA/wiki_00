Products produced this way often include ceramics, furniture, amplifiers, yachts, boats, leather goods or watches and jewellery among others. In industrial countries, boutique manufacturing is being selected generally for high class goods in upper price levels and only for single products or small batches.\n\nThe key advantages of boutique manufacturing in comparison to traditional factory manufacturing with batch fabrication, large or mass production are as follows:\n\nConsequently, boutique manufacturing closes the gap between piece production and small batch/low volume production. The workflow organization of a boutique manufacturing entity can be a mixture of both – elements of jobbing or batch production, however involving higher standardization than the first one. Often boutique manufacturing workshop and factories are organized with single workplaces or production cells carrying out a number of subsequent production steps until completion of certain components or even the whole product. Flexibility and variety of products being able to produce in the entity therefore are much higher than with the more standardized method batch production. \n\nHowever, with this method, manufacturing of larger quantities of unified products is not possible at reasonable costs. Serial fabrication or large production of goods then would be suitable alternative production methods involving higher grades of automation and standardization.\n\n"}

Teams deliver presentations for judges and, while competitions vary in composition, a standard format and purpose exists.\n\nThe case competition concept originated in the United States and originally included participants from domestic universities. The notion of expanding to include international competitors emerged later, with the concept eventually taking hold across North America and Western Europe. Today, a wide range of international competitions are hosted in various countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. International case competitions have also begun expanding beyond the undergraduate level, as competitions like the Wharton China Business Society International Case Competition offer high school divisions .\n\nThe Middle East & North Africa Regional Case Initiative (MENARCCI) at the American University of Beirut (AUB). MENARCCI's goal is to serve as a depository of all necessary knowledge about the case method, sources of cases and publishing outlets, and the links to all cases on the Region available on-line. In the Middle East, cases competitions are conducted by the American University of Beirut and the American University in Cairo.\n\nFormats vary according to a number of dimensions. The following dimensions are often used to classify and compare competitions: Host: corporate versus educational institution; Participant selection: \"by invitation\" versus \"by application\"; and, Level: undergraduate, graduate. Formats may vary along practical dimensions, including: Case specificity (whether the case has been written especially for the competition or not); Number of teams; Organization (student-run, professional etc.); Rules, e.g.:Time (common formats are 3-4 or 24 hours), Materials, Degree of access to expert advice (either from within the competition or externally, and electronically or face to face).\n\nSome competitions add complexity to create a more interesting challenge. For example, Ohio State University (OSU)'s Center For International Business Education And Research (CIBER), in its annual Case Challenge, created teams from the overall pool of participants, regardless of school, dissolving the usual school-based team format. For the Ohio State scenario, once the students are assigned to teams, a full day of team-building exercises is run for competitors.\n\nCompetitions can be internal to a business school, or they can involve teams from multiple schools. Sometimes the competition includes several rounds, with the final round typically judged by outside company executives (sometimes the panel consists of executives from the actual company in the case). For example, the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business' 2010 round of its Global Business Case Competition featured a customized case on the Boeing Company and Boeing executives acted as judges.\n\nParticipants exercise skills and knowledge on a \"real world\" case for an actual organization, with the support of representatives who can provide professional advice. Other competitions select an issue based on its degree of importance, and employ the competition as a means to both highlight the issue and create potential solutions through the efforts of the competitors. Participants can also be assessed as potential candidates for analysis-based jobs within the targeted companies.\n\nTeams in case competitions are tasked with assessing the situation facing the organization, analyzing available information, crafting a solution, and defending their recommendations. In general, teams adhere to a time limit and specific rules. Each team is judged independently, and the judges' decision is final, although a confidential summary evaluation is generally provided.\n"}

Similar to seed accelerators they support early-stage startup companies through mentorship and often capital and office space. In contrast to regular programs, though, corporate accelerators derive their objectives from the sponsoring organization. These objectives can include the wish to stay close to emerging trends or to establish a funnel for corporate venture capital investments.\n\nAccording to Corporate Accelerator DB there are 70+ such programs in existence as of December 2016. Notable companies include Microsoft, Citrix, and Telefónica who were among the first companies to offer such programs in the early 2010s. More recently, corporate accelerators have faced criticism as they might be less effective as regular seed accelerators. For example, the startup could be too focused on solving the problems of the sponsoring firm rather than finding external customers.\n\nCorporate accelerators differ from Business incubators, which usually have a continuous intake, due to their fixed-term, cohort-based organization (similar to seed accelerators) and are distinct to corporate venture capital which is a direct, targeted investment.\n\n"}

In its simplest terms, the two criteria to judge feasibility are cost required and value to be attained.\n\nA well-designed feasibility study should provide a historical background of the business or project, a description of the product or service, accounting statements, details of the operations and management, marketing research and policies, financial data, legal requirements and tax obligations. Generally, feasibility studies precede technical development and project implementation.\n\nA feasibility study evaluates the project's potential for success; therefore, perceived objectivity is an important factor in the credibility of the study for potential investors and lending institutions. It must therefore be conducted with an objective, unbiased approach to provide information upon which decisions can be based.\n\nA project feasibility study is a comprehensive report that examines in detail the five frames of analysis of a given project. It also takes into consideration\nits four Ps, its risks and POVs, and its constraints (calendar, costs, and norms of quality). The goal is to determine whether the project should go ahead, be redesigned, or else abandoned altogether.. \n\nThe five frames of analysis are: The frame of definition; the frame of contextual risks; the frame of potentiality; the parametric frame; the frame of dominant and contingency strategies.\n\nThe four Ps are traditionally defined as Plan, Processes, People, and Power. The risks are considered to be external to the project (e.g., weather conditions) and are divided in eight categories: (Plan) financial and organizational (e.g., government structure for a private project); (Processes) environmental and technological; (People) marketing and sociocultural; and (Power) legal and political. POVs are Points of Vulnerability: they differ from risks in the sense that they are internal to the project and can be controlled or else eliminated.\n\nThe constraints are the standard constraints of calendar, costs and norms of quality that can each be objectively determined and measured along the entire project lifecycle. Depending on projects, portions of the study may suffice to produce a feasibility study; smaller projects, for example, may not require an exhaustive environmental assessment.\n\nThe acronym TELOS refers to the five areas of feasibility - Technical, Economic, Legal, Operational and Scheduling.\n\nThis assessment is based on an outline design of system requirements, to determine whether the company has the technical expertise to handle completion of the project. When writing a feasibility report, the following should be taken to consideration:\n\nAt this level, the concern is whether the proposal is both \"technically\" and \"legally\" feasible (assuming moderate cost).\n\nThe technical feasibility assessment is focused on gaining an understanding of the present technical resources of the organization and their applicability to the expected needs of the proposed system.\nIt is an evaluation of the hardware and software and how it meets the need of the proposed system\n\nThe selection among a number of methods to produce the same commodity should be undertaken first. Factors that make one method being preferred to other method in agricultural projects are the following:\n\nAfter we determine the appropriate method of production of a commodity, it is necessary to look for the optimal technique to produce this commodity. \nOnce the method of production and its technique are determined, technical people have to determine the projects' requirements during the investment and operating periods. These include:\n\nThe most important factors that determine the selection of project location are the following:\n\nIt Determines whether the proposed system conflicts with legal requirements, e.g., a data processing system must comply with the local data protection regulations and if the proposed venture is acceptable in accordance to the laws of the land.\n\nOperational feasibility is the measure of how well a proposed system solves the problems, and takes advantage of the opportunities identified during scope definition and how it satisfies the requirements identified in the requirements analysis phase of system development.\n\nThe operational feasibility assessment focuses on the degree to which the proposed development project fits in with the existing business environment and objectives with regard to development schedule, delivery date, corporate culture and existing business processes.\n\nTo ensure success, desired operational outcomes must be imparted during design and development. These include such design-dependent parameters as reliability, maintainability, supportability, usability, producibility, disposability, sustainability, affordability and others. These parameters are required to be considered at the early stages of design if desired operational behaviours are to be realised. A system design and development requires appropriate and timely application of engineering and management efforts to meet the previously mentioned parameters. A system may serve its intended purpose most effectively when its technical and operating characteristics are engineered into the design. Therefore, operational feasibility is a critical aspect of systems engineering that needs to be an integral part of the early design phases.\n\nA time feasibility study will take into account the period in which the project is going to take upto its completion. A project will fail if it takes too long to be completed before it is useful. Typically this means estimating how long the system will take to develop, and if it can be completed in a given time period using some methods like payback period. Time feasibility is a measure of how reasonable the project timetable is. Given our technical expertise, are the project deadlines reasonable? Some projects are initiated with specific deadlines. It is necessary to determine whether the deadlines are mandatory or desirable.\n\nDescribe how much time is available to build the new system, when it can be built, whether it interferes with normal business operations, type and amount of resources required, dependencies,\nand developmental procedures with company revenue prospectus.\n\nIn case of a new project, financial viability can be judged on the following parameters:\n\n\nThe financial viability of a project should provide the following information:\nIn 1983 the first generation of the Computer Model for Feasibility Analysis and Reporting (COMFAR), a computation tool for financial analysis of investments, was released. Since then, this United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) software has been developed to also support the economic appraisal of projects.\nThe COMFAR III Expert is intended as an aid in the analysis of investment projects. The main module of the program accepts financial and economic data, produces financial and economic statements and graphical displays and calculates measures of performance. Supplementary modules assist in the analytical process. Cost-benefit and value-added methods of economic analysis developed by UNIDO are included in the program and the methods of major international development institutions are accommodated. The program is applicable for the analysis of investment in new projects and expansion or rehabilitation of existing enterprises as, e.g., in the case of reprivatisation projects. For joint ventures, the financial perspective of each partner or class of shareholder can be developed. Analysis can be performed under a variety of assumptions concerning inflation, currency revaluation and price escalations.\n\nThis is one of the most important sections of the feasibility study as it examines the marketability of the product or services and convinces readers that there is a potential market for the product or services. If a significant market for the product or services cannot be established, then there is no project.\n\nTypically, market studies will assess the potential sales of the product, absorption and market capture rates and the project's timing.\n\nThe feasibility study outputs the \"feasibility study report\", a report detailing the evaluation criteria, the study findings, and the recommendations.\n\n\n\n"}

Most often, business entities are formed to sell a product or a service. There are many types of business entities defined in the legal systems of various countries. These include corporations, cooperatives, partnerships, sole traders, limited liability companies and other specifically permitted and labelled types of entities. The specific rules vary by country and by state or province. Some of these types are listed below, by country. For guidance, approximate equivalents in the company law of English-speaking countries are given in most cases, for example:\n\nHowever, the regulations governing particular types of entities, even those described as roughly equivalent, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. When creating or restructuring a business, the legal responsibilities will depend on the type of business entity chosen.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutch, French or German names may be used.\n\n\n\n\nThere are three main types of business entity in Brunei, namely sole proprietorship, partnership and company.\n\nA private company contains the term \"Sendirian Berhad\" or \"Sdn. Bhd.\" as part of its name where as for a public company \"Berhad\" or \"Bhd.\" is used.\n\n\n\nIn Canada entities can be incorporated under either federal or provincial (or territorial) law. Unlimited liability corporations can be formed in Alberta \"AULC\" and Nova Scotia \"NSULC\".\n\nThe word or expression \"Limited\", \"Limitée\", \"Incorporated\", \"Incorporée\", \"Corporation\" or \"Société par actions de régime fédéral\" or the corresponding abbreviation \"Ltd.\", \"Ltée\", \"Inc.\", \"Corp.\" or \"S.A.R.F.\" forms part of the name of every entity incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act (R.S., 1985, c. C-44). ≈ Ltd. or Plc (UK)\n\nAs an exception, entities registered prior to 1985 may continue to be designated \"Société commerciale canadienne\" or by the abbreviation \"S.C.C.\"\n\nUnder the Canada Cooperatives Act (1998, c. 1), a co-operative must have the word \"cooperative\", \"co-operative\", \"coop\", \"co-op\", \"coopérative\", \"united\" or \"pool\", or another grammatical form of any of those words, as part of its name.\n\nUnlike in many other Western countries, Canadian businesses generally only have one form of incorporation available. The aforementioned AULC and NSULC are generally not used as operating business structures, but are instead used to create favorable tax positions for either Americans investing in Canada or vice versa.\n\nRather, Canadian businesses are generally formed under one of the following structures:\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of legal person business entities:\n\n\nTypes of natural person business entities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn SE or SCE may be created by registration in any of the EU/EEA Member States, and is subject to the European Company Statute. It may relocate its registered office to any other EU/EEA Member State with minimal formalities.\n\n\nThe abbreviations are usually in Finnish, but Swedish names may also be used either as is or in combination with Finnish, e.g. \"Oy Yritys Ab\".\n\nIn the corporations of real estate law, the ownership or membership may be vested either in the real property or in a legal or natural person, depending on the corporation type. In many cases, the membership or ownership of such corporation is obligatory for a person or property that fulfils the legal requirements for membership or wishes to engage in certain activities.\n\nIn addition to native types, European Union types are implemented:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Hungary, business entities are mainly regulated by the Companies Act of 2006, the Companies Registration Act of 2006 and the new Civil Code of 2013. All companies are required to indicate their type in their name.\n\n\n\n\nSituation in Ireland is similar to United Kingdom below, though without the class \"Community Interest Company\". There were two forms of Company Limited by Guarantee, but only the form \"without a share capital\" is now used. Irish names may also be used, such as \"cpt\" (cuideachta phoibli theoranta) for plc, and \"Teo\" (Teoranta) for Ltd.\n\n\n\nBusiness corporations are referred to as \"kaisha\" (会社) and are formed under the Companies Act of 2005.

This form is a little bit specific and was created for companies that are domiciled registered in other countries and have its part in Montenegro.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies are registered on the Companies Register and with a regional Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\nThe Commercial Code establishes the following types of companies:\n\n\n\n\nThere are three main forms of business:\n\n(a) Sole Proprietorship\n(b) Partnership\n(c) Company\n\n\nIn a sole proprietorship, an individual on his/her own account carries out the business or profession. No formal procedure or formality is required for setting up a sole proprietary concern.\n\n\nA partnership is a business relationship entered into by a formal agreement between two or more persons or corporations carrying on a business in common. The capital for a partnership is provided by the partners who are liable for the total debts of the firms and who share the profits and losses of the business concern according to the terms of the partnership agreement.\n\nPartnerships (other than banking companies) are generally limited in size to twenty partners. The interest of a partner is transferable only with the prior consent of the other partner(s). However, a partner's right to a share of the partnership income may be received in trust for another person.\n\nFor taxation purposes, partnerships are classified into:\n\n(i) Registered Firms\n(ii) Unregistered Firms\n\nThe income of the registered firm is subject to Super Tax before distribution to the partners. Also the individual income of the partners is subject to income tax at the usual rates.\n\nFor unregistered firms, income tax is levied on the firm's income and the partners are not liable to pay tax on the shares of profit received from the unregistered firm(s).\n\n\nA company is a legal entity formed under the Companies Ordinance, 1984. It can have share capital or can be formed without share capital.\n\nA company having share capital may be formed as:\n\n(i) A company limited by shares.\n(ii) A company limited by guarantee.\n(iii) An unlimited company.\n\n\nThe liability of its members is limited to the extent of their shares in the paid-up capital of the company. These companies may further be classified as public limited and private limited companies.\n\n\n(i) Restricts the right to transfer its shares;\n(ii) Limits the number of its members to fifty; and;\n(iii) Prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures of the company.\n\nA private limited company is required to use the words \"(Private) Limited\" as the last words of its name.\n\n\nMeans a company having the liability of its members limited by memorandum to such amounts as the members may respectively undertake to contribute to the capital of the company in the event of its winding up. A company limited by guarantee is usually formed on a 'non profit basis'. Companies limited by guarantee use the words (Guarantee) Limited\" as the last words of their n\nUnlimited Company\n\nMeans a company having unlimited liability of its members\n\nhttps://www.secp.gov.pk\n\n\n\nOlder forms (now rarely used)\n\n\n\n\"Societăți comerciale\", abbreviated SC (Companies):\n\nlimited liability company \"societate cu raspundere limitata\" (SRL);\njoint stock company \"societate pe actiuni\" (SA);\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Limited Company, Sole Proprietorship and Partnership are the predominant types of business found in Singapore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Code of Obligations (fifth book of Civil Code) (Act No: 6098)\n\nAccording to the Commercial Code (Act No: 6102)\n\nŞahıs şirketleri ≈ Partnerships (Unlike the partnerships in Anglo-American law, they also have legal personality like companies)\n\nSermaye şirketleri ≈ Companies\n\nAccording to the Capital Markets Act (Act No: 6362)\n\nAccording to the Cooperatives Act (Act No: 1136)\n\nOther entitites:\n\n\n\nCompany formation is regulated by the Ukrainian Civil Code and Commercial Code, Law of Commercial companies, Law of stock companies, law and order.\n\n\nIn the United States, the individual states incorporate most businesses. Very few special types are incorporated by the federal government.\n\nFor federal tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service has separate entity classification rules. Under the tax rules, an entity may be classified as a corporation, a partnership, a Cooperative or a disregarded entity. A corporation may be taxed as either a C corporation or elect to be treated as a Subchapter S corporation. A disregarded entity has one owner (or a married couple as owner) that is not recognized for tax purposes as an entity separate from its owner. Types of disregarded entities include single-member LLCs; qualified sub-chapter S subsidiaries and qualified real estate investment trust subsidiaries. A disregarded entity's transparent tax status does not affect its status under state law. For example, for federal tax purposes, a sole-member LLC (SMLLC) is disregarded, so that all its assets and liabilities are treated as owned by its single member. But under state law, an SMLLC can contract in its own name and its owner is generally not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the entity. To be recognized as a Cooperative for tax purposes Cooperatives must follow certain rules under Sub Chapter T of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nThe key word for a bank is \"national\". A bank chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) must have the word \"national\" in its name. A bank chartered by a state cannot have \"national\" in its name.\n\nFor a savings bank (formerly called a savings and loan association) or credit union, the key word is \"federal\", and the same rules apply; a federally chartered savings bank or credit union must have the word \"federal\" in its name, while a state chartered savings bank or credit union cannot have \"federal\" in its name.\n\n\nMany federal governmental units are specially formed public corporations, while some private organizations have received a charter from Congress.\n\nThe following are the main business designations and types:\n\n\n\n\nRequired designations for corporations, by U.S. state, territory or commonwealth:\n\n\n\n"}
