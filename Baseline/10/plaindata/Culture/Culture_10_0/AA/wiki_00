This practice is neither new nor outdated and can be associated with religious beliefs, medication or as part of a regular diet. This act can expose the consumer to toxic substances and parasites found in the ingested earth.\n\nCalabash chalk is identified by different names such as: calabar stone (English), \"la craie\" or \"argile\" (French), \"mabele\" (Lingala in Congo), \"nzu\" (Igbo of Nigeria), \"ndom\" (Efik/Ibibio Nigeria) \"eko\" (Bini/Edo Nigeria). In addition it is also known as \"ebumba\", \"poto\" and \"ulo\". In Ghana it is known as \"shilè\".\n\nCalabash chalk is found predominantly in Nigeria and other West African communities. Although this geophagic material is native to Africa, as a result of migration of West African's to other nations, it can also be found in ethnic stores in the UK, Canada and the US. Calabash chalk is also eaten amongst women of African descent in the US state of Georgia.\n\nCalabash chalk is a naturally occurring material composed of fossilized sea shells. However it can also be prepared artificially by combining clay, sand, wood ash and even salt. By molding and heating this mixture, the calabash chalk is obtained. It is available as a powder, a molded shape or a block.\n\nThere are different views concerning the components of calabash chalk, the consensus being that the major component is aluminum silicate hydroxide. This comes from the kaolin clay group, making Al2Si2O5(OH)4 a possible formula for calabash chalk. Aside from aluminum silicate hydroxide, calabash chalk is also known to have very high concentrations of lead. The European Union recommends (Commission Regulation, 2001) the amount of lead in food should not exceed 1 mg/kg, however the amount of lead contained in calabash chalk has been reported (Codex Committee of Food Additives and Contaminants, 2003) to be between 10–50 mg/kg.\nIn addition, other reports of its composition include: aluminum, persistent organic pollutants, silicon, alpha lindane, endrin, endosulfan 11, arsenic, and chromium.\n\nThe practice of eating calabash chalk is observed by both sexes and different age groups of people of African descent, for the purpose of pleasure. However, it is prevalent among women, predominantly during pregnancy, who claim it prevents vomiting, over-salivation and nausea. Calabash chalk is also used to make facial masks and soaps.\n\nWhen geophagical materials are consumed and come in contact with digestive fluids, they have the potential of releasing clinical or sub-clinical toxic effects on an individual.\nThere are several reports regarding the health risks of consuming calabash chalk including; the alteration of the normal concentration of hemoglobin, red blood cell counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Another possible side effect of eating this geophagia is the alteration of growth rate and de-mineralization in the femur bone. Other reports suggest that calabash chalk also causes numerous gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, ulcers and gastritis. This stems from histomorphological changes that calabash chalk causes to the stomach and oesophagus.\n"}
{"id": "5899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5899", "title": "Continuity (fiction)", "text": "Continuity (fiction)\n\nIn fiction, continuity is consistency of the characteristics of people, plot, objects, and places seen by the reader or viewer over some period of time. It is relevant to several media.\n\nContinuity is particularly a concern in the production of film and television due to the difficulty of rectifying an error in continuity after shooting has wrapped up. It also applies to other art forms, including novels, comics, and video games, though usually on a smaller scale. It also applies to fiction used by persons, corporations, and governments in the public eye.\n\nMost productions have a script supervisor on hand whose job is to pay attention to and attempt to maintain continuity across the chaotic and typically non-linear production shoot. This takes the form of a large amount of paperwork, photographs, and attention to and memory of large quantities of detail, some of which is sometimes assembled into the story bible for the production. It usually regards factors both within the scene and often even technical details including meticulous records of camera positioning and equipment settings. The use of a Polaroid camera was standard but has since been replaced by digital cameras. All of this is done so that, ideally, all related shots can match, despite perhaps parts being shot thousands of miles and several months apart. It is an inconspicuous job because if done perfectly, no one will ever notice.\nIn comic books, continuity has also come to mean a set of contiguous events, sometimes said to be \"set in the same universe.\"\n\nMost continuity errors are subtle and minor, such as changes in the level of drink in a character's glass or the length of a cigarette, and can be permitted with relative indifference even to the final cut. Others can be more noticeable, such as sudden drastic changes in appearance of a character. Such errors in continuity can ruin the illusion of realism and affect suspension of disbelief.\n\nIn cinema, special attention must be paid to continuity because films are rarely shot in the order in which they are presented. The shooting schedule is often dictated by location permit issues. For example, a character may return to Times Square in New York City several times throughout a movie, but as it is extraordinarily expensive to close off Times Square, those scenes will likely be filmed all at once to reduce permit costs. Weather, the ambience of natural light, cast and crew availability, or any number of other circumstances can also influence a shooting schedule.\n\nFilm production companies use various techniques to prevent continuity errors. First would be to film all the shots for a particular scene together, and all shots of consecutive scenes together (if the scenes take place together, with no break between them in the film's timeline). This allows actors to remain in costume, in character, and in the same location (and with the same weather, if shooting on location).\n\nThe second major technique is for costume designers, production designers, prop masters, and make-up artists to take instant photographs of actors and sets at the beginning and end of each day's shooting (once made possible by Polaroid cameras, now done with digital cameras and cell phones as well). This allows the various workers to check each day's clothing, set, props, and make-up against a previous day's.\n\nThe third is to avoid shooting on location entirely, but instead film everything on a studio set. This allows weather and lighting to be controlled (as the shooting is indoors), and for all clothing and sets to be stored in one place to be hauled out the next day from a secure location.\n\nEditing errors can occur when a character in a scene references a scene or incident that has not occurred yet, or of which they should not yet be aware.\n\nAn example of an editing error can be seen in the film \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963), where a scene of people climbing a slope at the start is seen from below and then replayed from above.\n\nVisual errors are instant \"discontinuities\" occurring in visual media such as film and television. Items of clothing change colors, shadows get longer or shorter, items within a scene change place or disappear, etc.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of a \"visual error\" appears in Charlie Chaplin's 1914 movie \"The Property Man\". Here, in a supposedly smooth step from one room to another, the Tramp loses his hat in one room, but it is instantly back on his head as he enters the next room. Rather \"loose\" plots and a lack of continuity editing made most early films rife with such errors.\n\nAnother example occurs in the 1998 film \"Waking Ned\", when two of the film's characters, Jackie and Michael, are walking through a storm towards Ned's house. The umbrella they are under is black during their conversation as they walk towards the house (filmed from slightly above and to the front), yet after cutting to a lower shot (filmed from behind Jackie), Michael walks onscreen from the right holding an umbrella that is not black but beige, with a brown band at the rim.\n\nYet another glaring example of poor continuity occurs in the Disney film \"Pete’s Dragon\" (filmed in 1976). During the song \"Brazzle Dazzle Day\" when Lampie (Mickey Rooney), Pete (Sean Marshall), and Nora (Helen Reddy) climb the stairs to the top of the lighthouse, Pete's shirt beneath his overalls is orange. But after descending to the bottom again and coming out of the lighthouse door, his shirt is now grey.\n\nThough visual continuity errors are logically confined to visual media, parallel mistakes can occur in text. In \"The Miller's Tale\" in Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\", a door is ripped off its hinges only to be slowly closed again in the next scene.\n\nA plot error, or a plot hole as it's commonly known, reflects a failure in the consistency of the created fictional world. A character might state he was an only child, yet later mention a sibling. In the TV show \"Cheers\", Frasier Crane's wife Lilith mentions Frasier's parents are both dead. When the character was spun off into \"Frasier\", his father became a central character with, in a case of retroactive continuity, the explanation that Frasier was embarrassed about his father's lowbrow attitudes and thus claimed his death. This is a frequent occurrence in sitcoms, where networks may agree to continue a show, but only if a certain character is emphasized, leading other minor characters to written out of the show with no further mention of the character's existence, while the emphasized character (usually a breakout character, as in the case of Frasier Crane) develops a more complete back story that ignores previous, more simplified back stories.\n\nA Homeric nod (sometimes heard as 'Even Homer nods') is a continuity error. It has its origins in Homeric epic.\n\nThe proverbial phrase for it was coined by the Roman poet Horace in his \"Ars poetica\":\n\n\"... et idem\" \"indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus\"\n\n... and yet I also become annoyed whenever the great Homer nods off.\n\nThere are numerous continuity errors in Homer that resemble \"nods\", as for example:\n\n\nIn modern Homeric scholarship many of Homer's \"nods\" are explicable as the consequences of the poem being retold and improvised by generations of oral poets. So in the second case cited above, it is likely that two different versions are being conflated: one version with an embassy of three people, another with just two people.\n\nAlexander Pope was inclined to give Homeric nods the benefit of the doubt:\n\nThose oft are Stratagems which Errors seem,Nor is it Homer Nods, but We that Dream. - \"Essay on Criticism\" \n\nIn his online column, \"Best of The Web Today\", James Taranto of \"The Wall Street Journal\" often used the phrase \"Homer Nods\" as the title of a retraction or correction.\n\nThe practice of accelerating the age of a television character (usually a child or teenager) in conflict with the timeline of a series and/or the real-world progression of time is popularly known as Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome, or SORAS. Children unseen on screen for a time might reappear portrayed by an actor several years older than the original. Usually coinciding with a recast, this rapid aging is typically done to open up the character to a wider range of storylines, and to attract younger viewers. A recent example of this occurring is in the BBC's \"Merlin\" series, in which Mordred is initially played by a young child in Season 4, yet suddenly grows up into his late teens in time for the start of Season 5, with the rest of the characters aging by only three years.\n\nThe reverse can also happen. On \"Lost (TV Series)\", the character of 10-year-old Walt Lloyd was played by 12-year-old Malcolm David Kelley. The first few seasons took place over the course of just a few months, but by that point Lloyd looked much older than 10. In his remaining few appearances, special effects were used to make him look younger, or the scene took place years later.\n\nSometimes a work of fiction may deliberately employ continuity errors, usually for comedy. For example, the Marx Brothers' classic film \"Duck Soup\", at the climax of the film, the camera shows a shot of Groucho Marx speaking a line, followed by a shot of something else happening, followed by another shot of Groucho. Each time, Groucho's hat changes, usually to something more outrageous than before (a Napoleonic hat, a Prussian hat, etc.).\n\nWhen continuity mistakes have been made, explanations are often proposed by either writers or fans to smooth over discrepancies. Fans sometimes make up explanations for such errors that may or may not be integrated into canon; this has come to be colloquially known as \"fanwanking\" (a term originally coined by the author Craig Hinton to describe excessive use of continuity). Often when fans do not agree with one of the events in a story (such as the death of a favorite character), they will choose to ignore the event in question so that their enjoyment of the franchise is not diminished. When the holder of the intellectual property discards all existing continuity and starts from scratch it is known as rebooting. Fans call a less extreme literary technique that erases one episode the reset button. See also fanon.\n\nDiscrepancies in past continuity are sometimes made deliberately; this is known as retconning. Retcons are also sometimes used to either correct or cover up a perceived error. These changes may be made either by the same writer who made it, or more commonly by an author that has taken over the creative lead of a corporate owned show or publication. Not to be confused with the continuance of a reality (continuality).\n\nTelevision programs like \"24\", in which actors have to appear as if it is the same day for 24 consecutive episodes, have raised public recognition of continuity. However, traditional films have frequently had much of the same sort of the issues to deal with; film shoots may last several months and as scenes are frequently shot out of story sequence, footage shot weeks apart may be edited together as part of the same day's action in the completed film. In some ways, \"24\" presents a simpler situation, as costumes and hairstyles generally should \"not\" change very frequently; in many feature films a range of different hairstyles and costumes must be created, changed, and then recreated exactly, as various scenes are shot.\n\n"}

{"id": "795780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=795780", "title": "Ethos", "text": "Ethos\n\nEthos ( or ) is a Greek word meaning \"character\" that is used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation, or ideology. The Greeks also used this word to refer to the power of music to influence emotions, behaviours, and even morals. Early Greek stories of Orpheus exhibit this idea in a compelling way. The word's use in rhetoric is closely based on the Greek terminology used by Aristotle in his concept of the three artistic proofs or modes of persuasion.\n\n\"Ethos\" (, ; \"plurals:\" \"ethe\", ; \"ethea\", ) is a Greek word originally meaning \"accustomed place\" (as in \"the habitats of horses\", \"Iliad\" 6.511, 15.268), \"custom, habit\", equivalent to Latin \"mores\".\n\n\"Ethos\" forms the root of \"ethikos\" (), meaning \"moral, showing moral character\". As an adjective in the neuter plural form \"ta ethika\" (), used for the study of morals, it is the origin of the modern English word \"ethics\".\n\nIn modern usage, ethos denotes the disposition, character, or fundamental values particular to a specific person, people, corporation, culture, or movement. For example, the poet and critic T. S. Eliot wrote in 1940 that \"the general ethos of the people they have to govern determines the behaviour of politicians\". Similarly the historian Orlando Figes wrote in 1996 that in Soviet Russia of the 1920s \"the ethos of the Communist party dominated every aspect of public life\".\nEthos may change in response to new ideas or forces. For example, according to the Jewish historian Afrie Krampf, ideas of economic modernization which were imported into Palestine in the 1930s brought about \"the abandonment of the agrarian ethos and the reception of...the ethos of rapid development\".\n\nIn rhetoric, ethos is one of the three artistic proofs (\"pistis\", πίστις) or modes of persuasion (other principles being \"logos\" and \"pathos\") discussed by Aristotle in 'Rhetoric' as a component of argument. Speakers must establish ethos from the start. This can involve \"moral competence\" only; Aristotle however broadens the concept to include expertise and knowledge. Ethos is limited, in his view, by what the speaker says. Others however contend that a speaker's ethos extends to and is shaped by the overall moral character and history of the speaker—that is, what people think of his or her character before the speech has even begun (cf Isocrates).\n\nAccording to Aristotle, there are three categories of ethos:\n\n\nIn a sense, ethos does not belong to the speaker but to the audience. Thus, it is the audience that determines whether a speaker is a high- or a low-ethos speaker. Violations of ethos include:\n\n\nCompletely dismissing an argument based on any of the above violations of ethos is an informal fallacy (Appeal to motive). The argument may indeed be suspect; but is not, in itself, invalid.\n\nFor Aristotle, a speaker's ethos was a rhetorical strategy employed by an orator whose purpose was to \"inspire trust in his audience\" (\"Rhetorica\" 1380). \"Ethos\" was therefore achieved through the orator's \"good sense, good moral character, and goodwill\", and central to Aristotelian virtue ethics was the notion that this \"good moral character\" was increased in virtuous degree by habit (\"Rhetorica\" 1380). Aristotle links virtue, habituation, and \"ethos\" most succinctly in Book II of \"Nichomachean Ethics\": \"Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching [...] while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit, whence also its name \"ethike\" is one that is formed by a slight variation from the word \"ethos\" (habit)\" (952). Discussing women and rhetoric, scholar Karlyn Kohrs Campbell notes that entering the public sphere was considered an act of moral transgression for females of the nineteenth century: \"Women who formed moral reform and abolitionist societies, and who made speeches, held conventions, and published newspapers, entered the public sphere and thereby lost their claims to purity and piety\" (13). Crafting an ethos within such restrictive moral codes, therefore, meant adhering to membership of what Nancy Fraser and Michael Warner have theorized as counterpublics. While Warner contends that members of counterpublics are afforded little opportunity to join the dominant public and therefore exert true agency, Nancy Fraser has problematized Habermas's conception of the public sphere as a dominant \"social totality\" by theorizing \"subaltern counterpublics\", which function as alternative publics that represent \"parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses, which in turn permit them to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs\" (67).\n\nThough feminist rhetorical theorists have begun to offer more nuanced ways to conceive of ethos, they remain cognizant of how these classical associations have shaped and still do shape women's use of the rhetorical tool. Johanna Schmertz draws on Aristotelian ethos to reinterpret the term alongside feminist theories of subjectivity, writing that, \"Instead of following a tradition that, it seems to me, reads ethos somewhat in the manner of an Aristotelian quality proper to the speaker's identity, a quality capable of being deployed as needed to fit a rhetorical situation, I will ask how ethos may be dislodged from identity and read in such a way as to multiply the positions from which women may speak\" (83). Rhetorical scholar and professor Kate Ronald's claim that \"ethos is the appeal residing in the tension between the speaker's private and public self\", (39) also presents a more postmodern view of ethos that links credibility and identity. Similarly, Nedra Reynolds and Susan Jarratt echo this view of ethos as a fluid and dynamic set of identifications, arguing that \"these split selves are guises, but they are not distortions or lies in the philosopher's sense. Rather they are 'deceptions' in the sophistic sense: recognitions of the ways one is positioned multiply differently\" (56).\n\nRhetorical scholar Michael Halloran has argued that the classical understanding of ethos \"emphasizes the conventional rather than the idiosyncratic, the public rather than the private\" (60). Commenting further on the classical etymology and understanding of \"ethos\", Halloran illuminates the interdependence between \"ethos\" and cultural context by arguing that \"To have ethos is to manifest the virtues most valued by the culture to and for which one speaks\" (60). While scholars do not all agree on the dominant sphere in which ethos may be crafted, some agree that ethos is formed through the negotiation between private experience and the public, rhetorical act of self-expression. Karen Burke LeFevre's argument in \"Invention as Social Act\" situates this negotiation between the private and the public, writing that ethos \"appears in that socially created space, in the 'between', the point of intersection between speaker or writer and listener or reader\" (45-46).\n\nAccording to Nedra Reynolds, \"ethos, like postmodern subjectivity, shifts and changes over time, across texts, and around competing spaces\" (336). However, Reynolds additionally discusses how one might clarify the meaning of ethos within rhetoric as expressing inherently communal roots. This stands in direct opposition to what she describes as the claim \"that ethos can be faked or 'manipulated'\" because individuals would be formed by the values of their culture and not the other way around (336). Rhetorical scholar John Oddo also suggests that ethos is negotiated across a community, and not simply a manifestation of the self (47). In the era of mass-mediated communication, Oddo contends, one's ethos is often created by journalists and dispersed over multiple news texts. With this in mind, Oddo coins the term intertextual ethos, the notion that a public figure's \"ethos is constituted within and across a range of mass media voices\" (48).\n\nIn \"Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos\", scholar Coretta Pittman notes that race has been generally absent from theories of ethos construction, and that this concept is troubling for black women. Pittman writes, \"Unfortunately, in the history of race relations in America, black Americans' ethos ranks low among other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. More often than not, their moral characters have been associated with a criminalized and sexualized ethos in visual and print culture\" (43).\n\nThe ways in which characters were constructed is important when considering ethos, or character, in Greek tragedy. Augustus Taber Murray explains that the depiction of a character was limited by the circumstances under which Greek tragedies were presented. These include the single unchanging scene, necessary use of the chorus, small number of characters limiting interaction, large outdoor theatres, and the use of masks, which all influenced characters to be more formal and simple. Murray also declares that the inherent characteristics of Greek tragedies are important in the makeup of the characters. One of these is the fact that tragedy characters were nearly always mythical characters. This limited the character, as well as the plot, to the already well-known myth from which the material of the play was taken. The other characteristic is the relatively short length of most Greek plays. This limited the scope of the play and characterization, so that the characters were defined by one overriding motivation toward a certain objective from the beginning of the play.\n\nHowever, Murray clarifies that strict constancy is not always the rule in Greek tragedy characters. To support this, he points out the example of Antigone who, even though she strongly defies Creon in the beginning of the play, begins to doubt her cause and plead for mercy as she is led to her execution.\n\nSeveral other aspects of the character element in ancient Greek tragedy are worth noting. One of these, which C. Garton discusses, is the fact that either because of contradictory action or incomplete description, the character cannot be viewed as an individual, or the reader is left confused about the character. One method of reconciling this would be to consider these characters to be flat, or type-caste, instead of round. This would mean that most of the information about the character centers around one main quality or viewpoint. Comparable to the flat character option, the reader could also view the character as a symbol. Examples of this might be the Eumenides as vengeance, or Clytemnestra as symbolizing ancestral curse. Yet another means of looking at character, according to Tycho von Wilamowitz and Howald, is the idea that characterisation is not important. This idea is maintained by the theory that the play is meant to affect the viewer or reader scene by scene, with attention being only focused on the section at hand. This point of view also holds that the different figures in a play are only characterised by the situation surrounding them, and only enough so that their actions can be understood.\n\nGaret makes three more observations about character in Greek tragedy. The first is an abundant variety of types of characters in Greek tragedy. His second observation is that the reader or viewer's need for characters to display a unified identity that is similar to human nature is usually fulfilled. Thirdly, characters in tragedies include incongruities and idiosyncrasies.\n\nAnother aspect stated by Garet is that tragedy plays are composed of language, character, and action, and the interactions of these three components; these are fused together throughout the play. He explains that action normally determines the major means of characterisation. Another principle he states is the importance of these three components' effect on each other; the important repercussion of this being character's impact on action.\n\nAugustus Taber Murray also examines the importance and degree of interaction between plot and character. He does this by discussing Aristotle's statements about plot and character in his Poetics: that plot can exist without character, but character cannot exist without plot, and so character is secondary to plot. Murray maintains that Aristotle did not mean that complicated plot should hold the highest place in a tragedy play. This is because the plot was, more often than not, simple and therefore not a major point of tragic interest. Murray conjectures that people today do not accept Aristotle's statement about character and plot because to modern people, the most memorable things about tragedy plays are often the characters. However, Murray does concede that Aristotle is correct in that \"[t]here can be no portrayal of character [...] without at least a skeleton outline of plot\".\n\nEthos, or character, also appears in the visual art of famous or mythological ancient Greek events in murals, on pottery, and sculpture, referred to generally as pictorial narrative. Aristotle even praised the ancient Greek painter Polygnotos because his paintings included characterization. The way in which the subject and his actions are portrayed in visual art can convey the subject's ethical character and through this the work's overall theme, just as effectively as poetry or drama can. This characterisation portrayed men as they ought to be, which is the same as Aristotle's idea of what ethos or character should be in tragedy. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 178) Professor Mark D. Stansbury-O'Donnell states that pictorial narratives often had ethos as its focus, and was therefore concerned with showing the character's moral choices. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 175) David Castriota, agreeing with Stansbury-O'Donnell's statement, says that the main way Aristotle considered poetry and visual arts to be on equal levels was in character representation and its effect on action. However, Castriota also maintains about Aristotle's opinion that \"his interest has to do with the influence that such ethical representation may exert upon the public\". Castriota also explains that according to Aristotle, \"[t]he activity of these artists is to be judged worthy and useful above all because exposure of their work is beneficial to the polis\". Accordingly, this was the reason for the representation of character, or ethos, in public paintings and sculptures. In order to portray the character's choice, the pictorial narrative often shows an earlier scene than when the action was committed. Stansbury-O'Donnell gives an example of this in the form of a picture by the ancient Greek artist Exekia which shows the Greek hero Ajax planting his sword in the ground in preparation to commit suicide, instead of the actual suicide scene. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 177.) Additionally, Castriota explains that ancient Greek art expresses the idea that character was the major factor influencing the outcome of the Greeks' conflicts against their enemies. Because of this, \"ethos was the essential variable in the equation or analogy between myth and actuality\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "674787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=674787", "title": "In medias res", "text": "In medias res\n\nA narrative work beginning in medias res (, lit. \"into the middle of things\") opens in the midst of the plot (cf. \"ab ovo\", \"ab initio\"). Often, exposition is bypassed and filled in gradually, either through dialogue, flashbacks or description of past events. For example, \"Hamlet\" begins after the death of Hamlet's father. Characters make reference to King Hamlet's death without the plot's first establishment of said fact. Since the play focuses on Hamlet and the revenge itself more so than the motivation, Shakespeare utilizes \"in medias res\" to bypass superfluous exposition.\n\nWorks that employ \"in medias res\" often, though not always, will subsequently use flashback and nonlinear narrative for exposition of earlier events in order to fill in the backstory. For example, in Homer's \"Odyssey\", we first learn about Odysseus's journey when he is held captive on Calypso's island. We then find out, in Books IX through XII, that the greater part of Odysseus's journey precedes that moment in the narrative. On the other hand, Homer's \"Iliad\" has relatively few flashbacks, although it opens in the thick of the Trojan War.\n\nThe Roman lyric poet and satirist Horace (65–8 BC) first used the terms ab ōvō (\"from the egg\") and in mediās rēs (\"into the middle of things\") in his \"Ars poetica\" (\"Poetic Arts\", c. 13 BC), wherein lines 147–149 describe the ideal epic poet:\nThe \"egg\" reference is to the mythological origin of the Trojan War in the birth of Helen and Clytemnestra from the double egg laid by Leda following her seduction by Zeus in the guise of a swan.\n\nProbably originated in oral tradition, the narrative technique of beginning a story \"in medias res\" is a stylistic convention of epic poetry, the exemplars in Western literature being the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" (both 7th century BC), by Homer. Likewise, the technique features in the Indian \"Mahābhārata\" (c. 8th century BC – c. 4th century AD). \n\nThe classical-era poet Virgil (Publius Vergilius Maro, 70–19 BC) continued this literary narrative technique in the \"Aeneid\", which is part of the Greek literary tradition of imitating Homer. Later works featuring \"in medias res\" include the stories \"Sinbad the Sailor\" and \"The Three Apples\" from the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" (c. 9th century), the German \"Nibelungenlied\" (12th century), the Spanish \"Cantar de Mio Cid\" (c. 14th century), the Italian \"Divine Comedy\" (1320) by Dante Alighieri, the Portuguese \"The Lusiads\" (1572) by Luís Vaz de Camões, \"Jerusalem Delivered\" (1581) by Torquato Tasso, \"Paradise Lost\" (1667) by John Milton, and generally in Modernist literature.\n\nModern novelists known to extensively employ \"in medias res\" in conjunction with flashbacks include William Faulkner and Toni Morrison.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe’s The Tell-Tale Heart is written in medias res.\n\nIt is typical for film noir to begin \"in medias res\"; for example, a private detective will enter the plot already in progress. \"Crossfire\" (1947) opens with the murder of Joseph Samuels. As the police investigate the crime, the story behind the murder is told via flashbacks. \"Dead Reckoning\" (1947) opens with Humphrey Bogart as Rip Murdock on the run and attempting to hide in a Catholic church. Inside, the backstory is told in flashback as Murdock explains his situation to a priest.\n\nThe technique has been used across genres, including dramas such as \"Through a Glass Darkly\" (1961), \"8½\" (1963), \"Raging Bull\" (1980), and \"City of God\" (2002); crime thrillers such as \"No Way Out\" (1987), \"Grievous Bodily Harm\" (1988), \"The Usual Suspects\" (1995), and \"Kill Bill Volume 2\" (2004); horror films such as \"Firestarter\" (1984); action films such as many in the James Bond franchise; and comedies such as \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964).\n\nMany war films, such as \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998), also begin \"in medias res\", with the protagonists already actively in combat and no prior domestic scenes leading up to the film's events.\n\nOccasionally, adaptations of source material may employ \"in medias res\" while the original version did not. For example, the film adaptation of the stage musical \"Camelot\" employed \"in medias res\" while the original Broadway version did not (although revivals of the musical have). Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film adaptation of \"Lolita\" begins \"in medias res\" although the novel does not. Herman Wouk's stage adaptation of his own novel \"The Caine Mutiny\" begins \"in medias res\" as it opens with the court-martial that occupies the final section of the novel, telling the earlier part of the story through flashbacks in court-room testimony.\n\n"}

Language minoritization stems from the desire of large nations to establish a common language for commerce and government, or to establish homogeneity for ideological reasons. Minoritized languages are typically restricted to a smaller range of domains than dominant languages, and frequently one-way bilingualism develops when speakers of minoritized languages learn the dominant language, but not vice versa. Speakers of minoritized languages face various consequences, including reduced educational achievement and language shift in favor of the dominant language.\n\nA minoritized language differs from a minority language, which means a language used by a small number of speakers, or alternately to a language with lesser numerical or political power in a given context. There are cases in which a language is minoritized while being spoken by a majority of the population, such as some indigenous languages during the colonization of Africa, when colonial languages were favored. Spanish is minoritized in the United States but the dominant language in Latin America, where indigenous languages are minoritized. The term \"minoritized\" is sometimes used in preference to \"minority\" because it draws attention to the power differential between languages. \n\nNancy Dorian, Kathryn A. Davis, and Prem Phyak have argued that there is a \"Western language ideology\" which applies social Darwinism to linguistics. This ideology allegedly idealizes monolingualism, denies the benefits of multilingualism, and disdains non-standard language varieties. Because such non-standard varieties are labeled deficient, a hierarchy of languages is created. Some authors have drawn a connection between anti-immigration sentiment, especially anti-German sentiment, and English-only education in the US.\n\nIn Europe, the process of minoritization, for example of the Celtic languages in Britain and minority languages in France, was connected to the emergence of nationalist movements calling for the establishment of monolingual, monocultural nation-states in the nineteenth century. The process of minoritization then led to language shift towards English and French.\n\nThe defining characteristic of minoritization is the existence of a power imbalance between it and the dominant language. One sign that a language is minoritized is if its speakers develop one-way bilingualism—they learn the dominant language, but speakers of the dominant language do not learn the minoritized language. Another frequent symptom of minoritization is the restriction of the language to a limited range of domains. A language excluded from use in government and formal education might only be used at home and social situations. Because of the above, speakers of the minoritized language became a subset of speakers of the dominant language; for instance, all speakers of Scottish Gaelic are also speakers of English, but most English speakers in Scotland do not speak Gaelic. In contrast, speakers of a dominant language can carry out all functions of daily life using their native language. \n\nSpeakers of the dominant language typically use the greater prestige of the dominant language to prevent speakers of the minoritized language from changing the situation to one more favorable to the minoritized language. They use \"amnesia\" and \"normalization\" to confuse the reality with what should be, and therefore legitimize the situation in which some languages are minoritized. For example, many \"liberal\" criticisms of language planning for minoritized language communities assert that intervention in favor of minoritized languages is equivalent to the policies that caused the language to become minoritized in the first place, such as linguistic legislation, elitism, exclusion of minoritized languages from formal education, and even forced population transfer.\n\nIn \"Engaged Language Policy and Practices\", the authors cite three studies that have shown that students' academic achievement suffers if policies are implemented that minoritize their native language. Nancy Dorian has argued that the \"Western language ideology\" favoring monolingualism has fostered an \"ideology of contempt\" for minoritized languages. The process of minoritization can lead to language shift in favor of the dominant language.\n\n\nThe word \"minoritized\" is also used for racial groups, LGBT people, and other groups facing marginalization or institutionalized disadvantage in a certain setting.\n\n"}
{"id": "18816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18816", "title": "Mural", "text": "Mural\n\nA mural is any piece of artwork painted or applied directly on a wall, ceiling or other permanent surface. A distinguishing characteristic of mural painting is that the architectural elements of the given space are harmoniously incorporated into the picture.\n\nSome wall paintings are painted on large canvases, which are then attached to the wall (e.g., with marouflage). Whether these works can be accurately called \"murals\" is a subject of some controversy in the art world, but the technique has been in common use since the late 19th century.\n\nMurals of sorts date to Upper Paleolithic times such as the paintings in the Chauvet Cave in Ardèche department of southern France (around 30,000 BC). Many ancient murals have been found within ancient Egyptian tombs (around 3150 BC), the Minoan palaces (Middle period III of the Neopalatial period, 1700–1600 BC) and in Pompeii (around 100 BC – AD 79).\n\nDuring the Middle Ages murals were usually executed on dry plaster (secco). The huge collection of Kerala mural painting dating from the 14th century are examples of fresco secco. In Italy, circa 1300, the technique of painting of frescos on wet plaster was reintroduced and led to a significant increase in the quality of mural painting.\n\nIn modern times, the term became more well-known with the Mexican muralism art movement (Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros and José Orozco). There are many different styles and techniques. The best-known is probably \"fresco\", which uses water-soluble paints with a damp lime wash, a rapid use of the resulting mixture over a large surface, and often in parts (but with a sense of the whole). The colors lighten as they dry. The \"marouflage\" method has also been used for millennia.\n\nMurals today are painted in a variety of ways, using oil or water-based media. The styles can vary from abstract to \"trompe-l'œil\" (a French term for \"fool\" or \"trick the eye\"). Initiated by the works of mural artists like Graham Rust or Rainer Maria Latzke in the 1980s, trompe-l'oeil painting has experienced a renaissance in private and public buildings in Europe.\nToday, the beauty of a wall mural has become much more widely available with a technique whereby a painting or photographic image is transferred to poster paper or canvas which is then pasted to a wall surface \"(see wallpaper, Frescography)\" to give the effect of either a hand-painted mural or realistic scene.\n\nIn the history of mural several methods have been used:\n\n\"A fresco\" painting, from the Italian word \"affresco\" which derives from the adjective \"fresco\" (\"fresh\"), describes a method in which the paint is applied on plaster on walls or ceilings. The \"buon fresco\" technique consists of painting in pigment mixed with water on a thin layer of wet, fresh, lime mortar or plaster. The pigment is then absorbed by the wet plaster; after a number of hours, the plaster dries and reacts with the air: it is this chemical reaction which fixes the pigment particles in the plaster. After this the painting stays for a long time up to centuries in fresh and brilliant colors.\n\n\"Fresco-secco\" painting is done on dry plaster (\"secco\" is \"dry\" in Italian). The pigments thus require a binding medium, such as egg (tempera), glue or oil to attach the pigment to the wall.\n\n\"Mezzo-fresco\" is painted on nearly-dry plaster, and was defined by the sixteenth-century author Ignazio Pozzo as \"firm enough not to take a thumb-print\" so that the pigment only penetrates slightly into the plaster. By the end of the sixteenth century this had largely displaced the \"buon fresco\" method, and was used by painters such as Gianbattista Tiepolo or Michelangelo. This technique had, in reduced form, the advantages of \"a secco\" work.\n\nIn Greco-Roman times, mostly encaustic colors applied in a cold state were used.\n\nTempera painting is one of the oldest known methods in mural painting. In tempera, the pigments are bound in an albuminous medium such as egg yolk or egg white diluted in water.\n\nIn 16th-century Europe, oil painting on canvas arose as an easier method for mural painting. The advantage was that the artwork could be completed in the artist's studio and later transported to its destination and there attached to the wall or ceiling. Oil paint may be a less satisfactory medium for murals because of its lack of brilliance in colour. Also the pigments are yellowed by the binder or are more easily affected by atmospheric conditions. The canvas itself is more subject to rapid deterioration than a plaster ground.\nDifferent muralists tend to become experts in their preferred medium and application, whether that be oil paints, emulsion or acrylic paints applied by brush, roller or airbrush/aerosols. Clients will often ask for a particular style and the artist may adjust to the appropriate technique.\n\nA consultation usually leads to a detailed design and layout of the proposed mural with a price quote that the client approves before the muralist starts on the work. The area to be painted can be gridded to match the design allowing the image to be scaled accurately step by step. In some cases the design is projected straight onto the wall and traced with pencil before painting begins. Some muralists will paint directly without any prior sketching, preferring the spontaneous technique.\n\nOnce completed the mural can be given coats of varnish or protective acrylic glaze to protect the work from UV rays and surface damage.\n\nIn modern, quick form of muralling, young enthusiasts also use POP clay mixed with glue or bond to give desired models on a canvas board. The canvas is later set aside to let the clay dry. Once dried, the canvas and the shape can be painted with your choice of colors and later coated with varnish.\n\nAs an alternative to a hand-painted or airbrushed mural, digitally printed murals can also be applied to surfaces. Already existing murals can be photographed and then be reproduced in near-to-original quality.\n\nThe disadvantages of pre-fabricated murals and decals are that they are often mass-produced and lack the allure and exclusivity of an original artwork. They are often not fitted to the individual wall sizes of the client and their personal ideas or wishes can not be added to the mural as it progresses. The Frescography technique, a digital manufacturing method (CAM) invented by Rainer Maria Latzke addresses some of the personalisation and size restrictions.\n\nDigital techniques are commonly used in advertisements. A \"wallscape\" is a large advertisement on or attached to the outside wall of a building. Wallscapes can be painted directly on the wall as a mural, or printed on vinyl and securely attached to the wall in the manner of a billboard. Although not strictly classed as murals, large scale printed media are often referred to as such. Advertising murals were traditionally painted onto buildings and shops by sign-writers, later as large scale poster billboards.\n\nMurals are important in that they bring art into the public sphere. Due to the size, cost, and work involved in creating a mural, muralists must often be commissioned by a sponsor. Often it is the local government or a business, but many murals have been paid for with grants of patronage. For artists, their work gets a wide audience who otherwise might not set foot in an art gallery. A city benefits by the beauty of a work of art.\n\nMurals can be a relatively effective tool of social emancipation or achieving a political goal. Murals have sometimes been created against the law, or have been commissioned by local bars and coffeeshops. Often, the visual effects are an enticement to attract public attention to social issues.\nState-sponsored public art expressions, particularly murals, are often used by totalitarian regimes as a tool of propaganda. However, despite the propagandist character of that works, some of them still have an artistic value.\n\nMurals can have a dramatic impact whether consciously or subconsciously on the attitudes of passers by, when they are added to areas where people live and work. It can also be argued that the presence of large, public murals can add aesthetic improvement to the daily lives of residents or that of employees at a corporate venue.\n\nOther world-famous murals can be found in Mexico, New York City, Philadelphia, Belfast, Derry, Los Angeles, Nicaragua, Cuba and in India. They have functioned as an important means of communication for members of socially, ethnically and racially divided communities in times of conflict. They also proved to be an effective tool in establishing a dialogue and hence solving the cleavage in the long run.\nThe Indian state Kerala has exclusive murals. These Kerala mural painting are on walls of Hindu temples. They can be dated from 9th century AD.\n\nThe San Bartolo murals of the Maya civilization in Guatemala, are the oldest example of this art in Mesoamerica and are dated at 300 BC.\n\nMany rural towns have begun using murals to create tourist attractions in order to boost economic income. Colquitt, Georgia, is one such town. Colquitt was chosen to host the 2010 Global Mural Conference. The town has more than twelve murals completed, and will host the Conference along with Dothan, Alabama, and Blakely, Georgia. In the summer of 2010, Colquitt will begin work on their Icon Mural.\n\nThe Mexican mural movement in the 1930s brought a new prominence to murals as a social and political tool. Diego Rivera, José Orozco and David Siqueiros were the most famous artists of the movement. Between 1932 and 1940, Rivera also painted murals in San Francisco, Detroit, and New York City. In 1933, he completed a famous series of twenty-seven fresco panels entitled \"Detroit Industry\" on the walls of an inner court at the Detroit Institute of Arts. During the McCarthyism of the 1950s, a was placed in the courtyard defending the artistic merit of the murals while attacking his politics as \"detestable.\"\n\nIn 1948, the Colombian government hosted the IX Pan-American Conference to establish the Marshall plan for the Americas. The director of the OEA and the Colombian government commissioned master Santiago Martinez Delgado, to paint a mural in the Colombian congress building to commemorate the event. Martinez decided to make it about the Cúcuta Congress, and painted Bolívar in front of Santander, making liberals upset; so, due to the murder of Jorge Elieser Gaitan the mobs of el bogotazo tried to burn the capitol, but the Colombian Army stopped them. Years later, in the 1980s, with liberals in charge of the Congress, they passed a resolution to turn the whole chamber in the Elliptic Room 90 degrees to put the main mural on the side and commissioned Alejandro Obregon to paint a non-partisan mural in the surrealist style.\n\nNorthern Ireland contains some of the most famous political murals in the world. Almost 2,000 murals have been documented in Northern Ireland since the 1970s. In recent times, many murals are non-sectarian, concerning political and social issues such as racism and environmentalism, and many are completely apolitical, depicting children at play and scenes from everyday life. (See Northern Irish murals.)\n\nA not political, but social related mural covers a wall in an old building, once a prison, at the top of a cliff in Bardiyah, in Libya. It was painted and signed by the artist in April 1942, weeks before his death on the first day of the First Battle of El Alamein. Known as the Bardia Mural, it was created by English artist, private John Frederick Brill.\nIn 1961 East Germany began to erect a wall between East and West Berlin, which became famous as the Berlin Wall. While on the East Berlin side painting was not allowed, artists painted on the Western side of the Wall from the 80s until the fall of the Wall in 1989.\n\nMany unknown and known artists such as Thierry Noir and Keith Haring painted on the Wall, the \"World's longest canvas\". The sometimes detailed artwork were often painted over within hours or days. On the Western side the Wall was not protected, so everybody could paint on the Wall. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the Eastern side of the Wall became also a popular \"canvas\" for many mural and graffiti artists.\nOrgosolo, in Sardinia, is a most important center of murals politics.\n\nIt is also common for mural graffiti be used as a memoir. In the book \"Somebody Told Me,\" Rick Bragg writes about a series of communities, mainly located in New York, that have walls dedicated to the people who died. These memorials, both written word and mural style, provide the deceased to be present in the communities in which they lived. Bragg states that the \"murals have woven themselves in the fabric of the neighborhoods, and the city.\" These memorials remind people of the deaths caused by inner city violence.\n\nMany people like to express their individuality by commissioning an artist to paint a mural in their home. This is not an activity exclusively for owners of large houses. A mural artist is only limited by the fee and therefore the time spent on the painting; dictating the level of detail; a simple mural can be added to the smallest of walls.\n\nPrivate commissions can be for dining rooms, bathrooms, living rooms or, as is often the case- children's bedrooms. A child's room can be transformed into the 'fantasy world' of a forest or racing track, encouraging imaginative play and an awareness of art.\n\nThe current trend for feature walls has increased commissions for muralists in the UK. A large hand-painted mural can be designed on a specific theme, incorporate personal images and elements and may be altered during the course of painting it. The personal interaction between client and muralist is often a unique experience for an individual not usually involved in the arts.\n\nIn the 1980s, illusionary wall painting experienced a renaissance in private homes. The reason for this revival in interior design could, in some cases be attributed to the reduction in living space for the individual. Faux architectural features as well as natural scenery and views can have the effect of 'opening out' the walls. Densely built up areas of housing may also contribute to people's feelings of being cut off from nature in its free form. A mural commission of this sort may be an attempt by some people to re-establish a balance with nature.\n\nCommissions of murals in schools, hospitals and retirement homes can achieve a pleasing and welcoming atmosphere in these caring institutions. Murals in other public buildings, such as public houses are also common.\n\nRecently, graffiti and street art have played a key role in contemporary wall painting. Such graffiti/street artists as Keith Haring, Shepard Fairey, Above, Mint&Serf, Futura 2000, Os Gemeos, and Faile among others have successfully transcended their street art aesthetic beyond the walls of urban landscape and onto walls of private and corporate clients. As graffiti/street art became more mainstream in the late 1990s, youth oriented brands such as Nike and Red Bull, with Wieden Kennedy, have turned to graffiti/street artists to decorate walls of their respective offices. This trend continued through 2000's with graffiti/street art gaining more recognition from art institutions worldwide.\n\nMany home owners choose to display the traditional art and culture of their society or events from their history in their homes. Ethnic murals have become an important form of interior decoration. Warli painting murals are becoming a preferred mode of wall decor in India. Warli painting is an ancient Indian art form in which the tribal people used to depict different phases of their life on the walls of their mud houses.\n\nTile murals are murals made out of stone, ceramic, porcelain, glass and or metal tiles that are installed within, or added onto the surface of an existing wall. They are also inlaid into floors. Mural tiles are painted, glazed, sublimation printed (as described below) or more traditionally cut or broken into pieces. Unlike the traditional painted murals described above, tile murals are always made with the use of tiles.\n\nMosaic murals are made by combining small 1/4\" to 2\" size pieces of colorful stone, ceramic, or glass tiles which are then laid out to create a picture. Modern day technology has allowed commercial mosaic mural makers to use computer programs to separate photographs into colors that are automatically cut and glued onto sheets of mesh creating precise murals fast and in large quantities.\n\nThe azulejo (, ) refers to a typical form of Portuguese or Spanish painted, tin-glazed, ceramic tilework. They have become a typical aspect of Portuguese culture, manifesting without interruption during five centuries, the consecutive trends in art.\n\nAzulejos can be found inside and outside churches, palaces, ordinary houses and even railway stations or subway stations.\n\nThey were not only used as an ornamental art form, but also had a specific functional capacity like temperature control in homes. Many azulejos chronicle major historical and cultural aspects of Portuguese history.\n\nCustom-printed tile murals can be produced using digital images for kitchen splashbacks, wall displays, and flooring. Digital photos and artwork can be resized and printed to accommodate the desired size for the area to be decorated. Custom tile printing uses a variety of techniques including dye sublimation and ceramic-type laser toners. The latter technique can yield fade-resistant custom tiles which are suitable for long term exterior exposure.\n\n\n\n"}

Indigenous peoples of Oceania and Circumpolar peoples, and perhaps other populations of Asiatic origin are similarly affected and perhaps genetically predisposed. It is characterized by obesity, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and shortened life span.\n\nNew World Syndrome is linked to a change from a traditional diet and exercise to a Western diet and a sedentary lifestyle. Along with the lack of money. Traditional occupations of indigenous people—such as fishing, farming, and hunting—tended to involve constant activity, whereas modern office jobs do not. The introduction of modern transportation such as automobiles also decreased physical exertion. Meanwhile, Western foods which are rich in fat, salt, sugar, and refined starches are also imported into countries. The amount of carbohydrates in diets increases.\n\n\nRelated:\n\n"}

Different countries have different classifications and census options for race and ethnicity/nationality which are not comparable with data from other countries. In addition, many of the race and ethnicity concepts that appear on national censuses worldwide have their origins in Europe or in the views of Europeans, rather than in the views of the locals of these countries.\nPeople in Abkhazia (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census. In addition to the Soviet Union enumerating people by ethnicity for its entire existence, the partially recognized state of Abkhazia also enumerated people by ethnicity in its post-Soviet censuses of 2003 and 2011.\n\nPrior to 2010, Afghanistan had not held a census since 1979 due to the wars and conflicts that have occurred there over those three decades (since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979).\n\nAlbania enumerated people by ethnicity in 1955, 1989, and 2011. The 2011 Albanian census also enumerated people by language used and by their religious beliefs.\n\nThe Portuguese asked about race in colonial censuses when they controlled Angola, and they provided three options: White, Mestizo, or African/Black. Africans had to then pick either \"Assimilado\" (assimilated) or \"Indigenato\" (indigenous). Angola has not used any racial categories since its independence in 1975. Tribe and language for Africans were recorded only in 1950 and 1960.\n\nArgentina enumerated its population by their country of birth from 1869 to the present day.\n\nPeople in Armenia (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census.

In addition to the Soviet Union enumerating people by ethnicity for its entire existence, Belarus also enumerated people by ethnicity in its post-Soviet censuses of 1999 and 2009.\n\nBack when Belize was British Honduras, it enumerated people by ethnicity in 1946. Since gaining independence, Belize has enumerated people by ethnicity from 1980 all the way up to its most recent census in 2010. \n\nThe people in Benin were enumerated by ethnicity in 1979 and 1992.\n\nThe people of Bermuda were enumerated by ethnicity since at least 1950 all the way up to the present day.\n\nBolivia enumerated people by ethnicity in 1950, 2001, and 2012. The 2012 census included 40 ethnic group options. However, it did not include Mestizo as an option, which critics of current Bolivian President Evo Morales say was because he wants more Bolivians to identify as one of the indigenous groups in order to lend more legitimacy to his indigenous-friendly policies.\n\nThe population of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been enumerated by ethnicity since at least 1885, including the recent censuses in 1991 and 2013.\n\nBotswana enumerated people by race in all censuses between 1904 and 1946, and again in the 1964 census (though not in 1956), but in no censuses after 1964.

The Brazilian census classifies people by race as either white, black, pardo (brown), yellow (Asian), or indigenous.\n\nSince 1945, Brunei enumerated people by ethnicity in all censuses since 1947.\n\nBulgaria enumerated people by mother tongue in 1880 and 1887 and used this info to determine their ethnicities. Bulgaria directly enumerated people by ethnicity from 1900 all the way up to its most recent census in 2011, with the exception of the 1985 census.\n\nThe people in Burma (also known as Myanmar) were enumerated by ethnicity in 1931, and 1953. A new census which plans to enumerate the people of Burma by ethnicity and race is planned to be held in 2014. The 1931 Burmese census generated a lot of anger from non-Burmese ethnic groups who were marked as Burmese on the census. There is hope that the scheduled 2014 Burma Census will help empower the various ethnic groups in Burma.\n\nCanada counted people by ethnic origin in 1765 and again from at least 1871 to 2006, with the exception of 1891. The options for ethnicity in the 2006 Canadian census were various kinds of European Canadian, Aboriginal Canadian, and various non-white or non-European groups known officially as \"visible minorities\". The 2011 Canadian census did not ask about race and ethnicity, but the new voluntary National Household Survey (NHS) for that year did ask about race and ethnicity (as well as many other questions that were previously asked on the Canadian census). Prior to the 1981 Canadian census, respondents could only mark one ethnicity/ethnic ancestry, but the 1981 census and all future ones allowed multiple ethnicity responses. Canada also enumerated its population by place of birth from 1871 to the present day.\n\nCape Verde enumerated its population by ethnicity in 1950.\n\nThe Central African Republic enumerated its population by ethnicity in 1959/1960.\n\nChad enumerated people by ethnicity in 1993.\n\nChile enumerated people by ethnicity in 1992.\n\nThe People's Republic of China counted people by ethnicity since at least 1952 but does not count people by mother tongue.\n\nThe people in the Democratic Republic of Congo were enumerated by ethnicity from 1955–1958.\n\nThe people in the Republic of Congo were enumerated by ethnicity in 1960, 1974, and 1984.\n\nCosta Rica enumerated people by ethnicity in 1950.\n\nThe people of Croatia have been enumerated by ethnicity/nationality from at least 1953, including the censuses of 2001 and 2011.\n\nThe people of Cyprus were enumerated by ethnicity in 1960.\n\nCzechoslovakia (of which the territory of the Czech Republic was a part) enumerated people by ethnicity in 1921 and 1930, and the Czech Republic did the same thing from 1991 to the present day.\n\nThe people in Dominica were enumerated by ethnicity in 1960 and 1981.\n\nThe people in the Dominican Republic were enumerated by ethnicity in 1950.\n\nEast Timor enumerated its population by ethnicity in 1950.\n\nThe population of Equatorial Guinea was enumerated by ethnicity in 1950.\n\nPeople in Estonia were enumerated by ethnicity/nationality from 1922 to the present day. People in Estonia were also enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census. During this time period Estonia was under the control of the Russian Empire, then independent, then (excluding World War II) under the control of the Soviet Union, and then independent again since 1991. There were 192 different ethnicity/nationality options in the 2011 Estonian census.\n\nEthiopia enumerated people by ethnicity in 1994.\n\nThe population of Fiji was enumerated by ethnicity from 1881 all the way up to Fiji's most recent census in 2007.\n\nFinland has enumerated its population by language of most frequent use from at least 1990 to the present day.\n\nFrance has not counted individuals by race or ethnicity since at least 1978, when a law was passed that prevented individuals from being enumerated by these categories without their consent or a state committee waiver. The reasons for this are that many French people consider asking people about race and ethnicity to be a contradiction of their principle of equality and equal treatment for all French people. Also, there is a desire to avoid repeating what Vichy France did in regards to its Jewish population and to prevent the National Front from getting more popularity. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his administration supported and proposed counting French people by race and ethnicity. Due to criticism, however, this proposal was never implemented, and as of 2013 former French President Francois Hollande opposes enumerating people by race and ethnicity.\n\nThe population of Gabon was enumerated by ethnicity in 1960–1961 and 1993.\n\nPeople in Georgia (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census.

Allochtoon was a term used for a person living in the Netherlands from whom at least one parent was born outside the Netherlands. An allochtoon born outside the Netherlands (from at least one parent also born outside the Netherlands) was labelled first generation allochtoon, an allochtoon born in the Netherlands was labelled a second generation allochtoon. This definition implied that from third generation onwards people (grandparents from abroad, but parents born in the Netherlands) were considered autochtoon.\n\nNew Zealand enumerated people by ethnicity from 1858 to the present day.

Sovereign Poland enumerated people by ethnicity/nationality in 1921. It enumerated people by mother tongue in 1931, and used this data to determine ethnicity/nationality. After World War II, the Communist Polish government did not enumerate people by nationality/ethnicity. The post-Communist 2002 Polish census did enumerate people by nationality/ethnicity and language used at home.\n\nPuerto Rico enumerated people by race in its census since at least 1877 with the exception of the period from 1960 to 1990.\n\nRomania enumerated people by ethnicity in 1859–1860, 1887, 1899, and in every census since 1930, with the exception of the 1948 census, which enumerated people only by mother tongue. The World Jewish Congress also carried out a census of Romania's Jewish population in 1947.\n\nThe Russian Empire began counting people by native tongue with its first modern census in 1897. In 1920, the Soviet Union replaced this question with a question about ethnicity. The Soviet government organized lists of ethnicities and wanted to shape these various ethnic groups in the mold of Communism. In the words of Soviet politician Anastas Mikoyan, the Soviet Union was \"creating and organising new nations\" The government of the U.S.S.R. was eager to get ethnic data for many ethnic groups in order to create republics and autonomous regions for many of these ethnic groups and nationalities, and later on (under Joseph Stalin) in order to deport some of them. The Bolsheviks also wanted to get more support from ethnic minority groups within the Soviet Union, many of whom were previously oppressed under Tsarist rule. The Soviet Union continued to ask about ethnicity for the rest of its existence, and Russia also asked about ethnicity in its two post-Soviet censuses of 2002 and 2010. Unlike in 1989, the 2002 census did not require respondents to prove their ethnicity/nationality when they responded to this question. The number of ethnicity/nationality options available on Soviet censuses was enormous—the Soviet Union offered 194 different choices for ethnicity/nationality in its 1926 census. There were 97 options in 1939, 126 options in 1959, 122 options in 1970, 123 options in 1979, and 128 options for the Soviet Union in 1989. There were 192 ethnicity/nationality options for Russia in 2002.\n\nRwanda enumerated people by ethnicity from 1933/34 until 1991.

The Italian Somaliland census of 1935 reported that the remaining 6.2% of the area's population consisted of \"Negroid groups\", including the Bantu ethnic minorities inhabiting the southern riverine region. These census designations were at the time pre-assigned rather than based on self-reporting. Following independence in 1960, no official census was taken until 1975. This first post-independence national census only collected information on district of birth. However, the general government literature maintained that the country's ethnic Somali majority was of Hamitic stock, or alternately of Arab heritage. Similarly, Article 3 of the Provision Constitution adopted in 2012 indicates that Somalia is an Arab nation. In 2014, the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation also announced that it would release a new national population census before 2016.\n\nSouth Africa has enumerated people by race in all of its censuses since 1904. Five population group options are provided in response to the question \"How would \"(name)\" describe him/herself in terms of population group?\": \"Black African\", \"Coloured\", \"Indian or Asian\", \"White\" and \"Other\".

In addition to the Soviet Union enumerating people by ethnicity for its entire existence, the de facto independent country of Transnistria also enumerated people by ethnicity in its only post-Soviet census in 2004. Romania also enumerated people in Transnistria by ethnicity in its 1941 census.\n\nTunisia enumerated people by ethnicity in 1956.\n\nBetween 1881 and 1893 the Ottoman Empire implemented its first census, which enumerated the people in the empire by ethnicity. Some other censuses and studies were conducted in the Ottoman Empire for enumerating the population by ethnicity after the first Ottoman census.\n\nPeople in Turkmenistan (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census. In addition to the Soviet Union enumerating people by ethnicity for its entire existence, Turkmenistan also enumerated people by ethnicity in its only post-Soviet census in 1995.\n\nThe people of Uganda were enumerated by ethnicity from 1948 all the way up to Uganda's most recent census in 2012, with the exception of 1980 and possibly 1969.\n\nPeople in Ukraine (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census. In addition to the Soviet Union enumerating people by ethnicity for its entire existence, Ukraine also enumerated people by ethnicity in its only post-Soviet census in 2001.\n\nThe United Kingdom began counting people by ethnicity in 1991. There eventually became more of an interest in enumerating ethnic minorities after large-scale racial minority immigration to the United Kingdom began in the post-World War II era. The United Kingdom previously planned to enumerate people by ethnicity in 1981, but changed its mind after the large non-response rate to this question in the 1979 Test Census. In 1979, many ethnic minorities refused to answer this question due to the fear of deportation. In the 2011 census, the ethnic group options for England and Wales were White, Mixed, Asian British, Black British, Chinese or other ethnic group, and Not stated, with ethnic origin sub-group choices for most of these. The census in the United Kingdom also included a question on country of citizenship between 1851 and 1961.\n\nBefore the U.S. acquired independence from Great Britain, many of the Thirteen Colonies conducted censuses of their own where they enumerated their populations by race. The United States as a whole enumerated people by race in every census since its first census in 1790. Part of the reason why the United States began counting people by race much sooner than many other countries was due to the Three Fifths Compromise, which determined the amount of representation that Southern states had based on how many slaves they had (slaves were counted as three-fifths of a person for representation purposes, and a new census every ten years was needed to enumerate the current slave population). Initially, the United States Census only counted Americans as either white or black, with blacks classified as either free or slaves until 1860 (slavery in the United States was abolished in 1865). Over time, the United States has also added some other racial categories as well. Asian and Native American categories were added in 1860. However, the first census to enumerate all Native Americans occurred in 1890. Before that point Native Americans living on reservations were not counted, and thus most Native Americans in the U.S. were not counted in census data before 1890. Between 1850 and 1870, and in 1890, 1910, and 1920, the U.S. Census Bureau also enumerated Mulattoes and sometimes other partially black groups (Quadroons and Octoroons) separately.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau counted Mexicans as a separate race in 1930 and tried to retroactively determine the number of Mexicans in the U.S. in 1910 and 1920 as well.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt promoted a \"good neighbor\" policy that sought better relations with Mexico. In 1935, a federal judge ruled that three Mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white, as required by federal law. Mexico protested, and Roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white. The State Department, the Census Bureau, the Labor Department, and other government agencies therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of Mexican descent as white. This policy encouraged the League of United Latin American Citizens in its quest to minimize discrimination by asserting their whiteness.\n\nHispanics were counted as whites in 1940, but for the first time ever, the U.S. made an attempt to measure the size of the Hispanic population that year. The U.S. resumed enumerating its Hispanic/Latino population in 1970, with Hispanics being enumerated in every U.S. census since then. The U.S. Census Bureau also began offering Hispanics several sub-group options from which they could identify themselves, such as Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, et cetera (these Hispanic sub-group options have changed over time). The Other race category was added in 1950, and the Multiracial (\"two or more races\") category was added in 2000. Due to the adding of the Multiracial category, U.S. Census data since 2000 is not directly comparable with that of previous censuses. While people nowadays are enumerated by race based on self-identification, until 1950 their race on the census was mainly determined by their census enumerator. During this time multiracial people who were White and of another race were usually marked down as belonging to the other race due to the One drop rule.\n\nIt is worth noting that some of the definitions of race in the United States changed over time. For instance, Indian Americans were previously marked as Hindu in 1920–1940, Other race in 1950–1960, and White in 1970 before being marked as Asian (Indian) since 1980. The U.S. census counted certain Asian ethnic groups separately since 1870, initially counting only Chinese and Japanese, but having other categories as well since 1910. It only began counting all people by ethnic ancestry since the 1980 census, though. The United States enumerated most or all foreign-born Americans by mother between 1910 and 1970, with the exception of 1950. It counted the foreign-born aged five or more by the language that they spoke at home since 1980. Before 1970, Alaska and Hawaii had different choices for race on their censuses in contrast to the continental United States.\n\nThe 2020 United States Census might allow Middle Easterners and North Africans to write in their ethnicity/race instead of merely marking them as White. Right now, and in the past, Arabs have been marked in the U.S. Census as White. This began in the early twentieth century when Arabs coming to the United States successfully petitioned to be marked as White in order to avoid entry quotas and have a greater chance of achieving success and avoiding discrimination.\n\nThe United States is one of the countries that uses racial and ethnic census data in order to create minority-majority districts, as is required by the 1965 Voting Rights Act. These districts were created in order to increase minority representation in the United States Congress following the end of legal segregation and racial discrimination in the Southern United States.\n\nSince 1850, the United States enumerated its population by their country of birth of its population. The whole U.S. population was enumerated by country of birth between 1850 and 1930 and again from 1960 to the present day. Meanwhile, only the White population of the United States was enumerated by their country of birth in 1940 and 1950.\n\nPeople in Uzbekistan (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census. The Soviet Union (to which Uzbekistan also belonged) enumerated people by ethnicity for its entire existence. Uzbekistan has not conducted any censuses at all since 1989.\n\nVatican City enumerated people by ethnicity in 1948.\n\nCommunist North Vietnam enumerated people by ethnicity in 1960, when Vietnam was still divided into two countries. After Vietnamese reunification, Vietnam enumerated its population by ethnicity from 1979 up to the most recent census in 2009.\n\nYemen enumerated its population by ethnicity in 1994. The British Colony of Aden (which is within Yemen's current borders) enumerated its population by ethnicity in 1946 and 1955.\n\nPeople in Zambia were not continuously counted by race before independence, and when they were counted by race it were primarily the non-Africans/non-blacks who were counted. People were counted by language only in 1931, while they were counted for ethnicity at various points since 1969. The 1969 census asked about language but not ethnic group, and the 1974 census asked about ethnic group, but not language. The 1980 census asked about ethnic group, mother tongue, and language of most frequent use, while the 1990 census asked about ethnic group and mother tongue. The 2000 census asked about ethnic group, language of most frequent use, and second language.\n\nPeople in Zimbabwe were enumerated by race between 1901 and 2002, but many censuses were done separately for Whites/Europeans and Blacks/Africans before the 1970s. People were enumerated by language only in 1982 (when they were enumerated by \"[their] father's dialect\").\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50406750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50406750", "title": "Suzanne Césaire", "text": "Suzanne Césaire\n\nSuzanne Césaire [née Roussi] (11 August 1915 – 16 May 1966), born in Martinique, and was a writer, teacher, scholar, anti-colonial and feminist activist, and Surrealist.\n\nSuzanne Césaire (née Roussi) was born on 11 August 1915 in Poterie, Martinique, to Flore Roussi (née William), a school teacher, and Benoït Roussi, a sugar factory worker.\n\nShe began her education at her local primary school in Rivière-Salée in Martinique (which still had the status of a French colonial territory at that time), before attending a girls’ boarding school in the capital, Fort-de-France. Having completed her secondary education, she went to study literature in Toulouse, France, and then in Paris at the prestigious École normale supérieure from 1936-1938.\n\nDuring her first year as a student in Paris, Suzanne (then still named Roussi) meet Léopold Sédar Senghor, who introduced her to Aimé Césaire, a fellow student at the École normale supérieure. The following year, on 10 July 1937, the couple married at the town hall of the 14th arrondissement in Paris. During their studies, the Césaires were both part of the editorial team of the militant journal, \"L'Étudiant noir\". In 1938 the couple had their first child. The following year they returned to Martinique where they both took up teaching jobs at the Lycée Schoelcher. They went on to have 6 children together, divorcing in April 1963 after 25 years of marriage.\n\nSuzanne Césaire wrote in French and published seven essays during her career as a writer. All seven of these essays were published between 1941 and 1945 in the Martiniquan cultural journal \"Tropiques\", of which she was a co-founder and editor along with her husband, Aimé Césaire, and René Ménil, both of whom were notable Martiniquan poets. Her writing explored themes such as Caribbean identity, civilisation, and surrealism.\n\nWhile her writing remains largely unknown to Anglophone readers, excerpts of her essays “Leo Frobenius and the Problem of Civilisations”, “A Civilisation’s Discontent”, “1943: Surrealism and Us”, and “The Great Camouflage” can be found translated into English in the anthology \"The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean\" (Verso, 1996) edited by Michael Richardson.\n\nCésaire had a particular affinity with surrealism, which she described as “the tightrope of our hope”. In her essay, “1943: Surrealism and Us”, she called for a Martiniquan surrealism:\n\n“Our surrealism will then deliver it the bread of its depths. Finally those sordid contemporary antinomies of black/white, European/African, civilised/savage will be transcended. The magical power of the mahoulis will be recovered, drawn forth from living sources. Colonial stupidity will be purified in the blue welding flame. Our value as metal, our cutting edge of steel, our amazing communions will be recovered.”\n\nSuzanne Césaire also developed a close relationship with André Breton following his visit to Martinique in 1941. She dedicated an essay to him (“André Breton, poet”, 1941) and received a poem dedicated to her in return (“For madame Suzanne Césaire”, 1941). This encounter with André Breton opened the way for her development of Afro-Surrealism \n\nHer writing is often overshadowed by that of her husband, who is the better known of the two. However, in addition to her important literary essays, her role as editor of \"Tropiques\" can be regarded as an equally significant (if often overlooked) contribution to Caribbean literature. \"Tropiques\" was the most influential francophone Caribbean journal of its time and is widely acknowledged for the foundational role it played in the development of Martiniquan literature. Césaire played both an intellectual and administrative role in the journal’s success. She managed the journal’s relations with the censor — a particularly difficult role given the oppositional stance of \"Tropiques\" towards the war-time Vichy government — as well as taking responsibility for the printing. The intellectual impact she had on the journal is underlined by her essay “The Great Camouflage”, which was the closing article of the final issue. Despite her substantial written and editorial contribution to the journal, the collected works of \"Tropiques\", published by Jean-Michel Place in 1978, credits Aimé Césaire and René Ménil as the journal’s catalysts.\n\n\"Tropiques\" published its last issue in September 1945, at the end of World War Two. With the ending of the journal, Suzanne Césaire stopped writing. The reasons for this are unknown. However, journalist Natalie Levisalles suggests that Suzanne Césaire would have perhaps made different choices if she had not had the responsibilities of mothering 6 children, teaching, and being the wife of an important politician and poet, Aimé Césaire. Indeed, her first daughter, Ina Césaire, remembers her saying regularly: “yours will be the first generation of women who choose”.\n\nHaving stopped writing she pursued her career as a teacher, working in Martinique, France, and Haiti. She was also an active feminist and participated in the Union des Femmes Françaises.\n\nSuzanne Césaire was a pioneer in the search for a distinct Martiniquan literary voice. However, following an early edition of \"Tropiques\", she attacked by some Caribbean writers for aping traditional French styles of poetry, supposedly promoting 'The Happy Antilles' view of the island promoted by French colonialism. However, her essay of 1941, Misère d'une poésie, condemned what she termed \"Littérature de hamac. Littérature de sucre et de vanille. Tourisme littéeraire\" [Literaure of the hammock, of sugar and vanilla. Literary tourism].[1]\nHer encounter with André Breton opened the way for her development of Afro-Surrealism[2], which followed in the footsteps of her use of surrealist concepts to illuminate the colonial dilemma.[3] Her dictum - \"La poésie martinique sera cannibale ou ne sera pas\" [Cannibal poetry or nothing][4] - was an anti-colonial appropriation of a surrealist trope. Suzanne Césaire's repudiation of simple idealised answers - whether assimilationist, Africanist, or creole - to the situation of colonialism in the Caribbean has proved increasingly influential in later postcolonial studies.[6]\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
