{"id": "1695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1695", "title": "Amazons", "text": "Amazons\n\nIn Greek mythology, the Amazons (, ', singular , ') were a tribe of women warriors related to Scythians and Sarmatians. Apollonius Rhodius, at Argonautica, mentions that Amazons were the daughters of Ares and Harmonia (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.\n\nHerodotus and Strabo place them on the banks of the Thermodon, while Diodorus giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas, states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya. These Amazons started from Libya, passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the Caïcus in Aeolis, near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established Mytilene a little way beyond the Caïcus. Aeschylus, in Prometheus Bound, places the original home of the Amazons in the country about Lake Maeotis and they later moved to Themiscyra on the Thermodon. Homer tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near Lycia.\n\nNotable queens of the Amazons are Penthesilea, who participated in the Trojan War, and her sister Hippolyta, whose magical girdle, given to her by her father Ares, was the object of one of the labours of Heracles. Diodorus mentions that the Amazons traveled from Libya under Queen Myrina. Amazon warriors were often depicted in battle with Greek warriors in amazonomachies in classical art.\n\nArchaeological discoveries of burial sites with female warriors on the Eurasian steppes suggest that the Scythian women may have inspired the myth. From the early modern period, their name has become a term for female warriors in general. Amazons were said to have founded the cities and temples of Smyrna, Sinope, Cyme, Gryne, Ephesus, Pitania, Magnesia, Clete, Pygela, Latoreria and Amastris; according to legend, the Amazons also invented the cavalry.\n\nPalaephatus, who was trying to rationalize the Greek myths in his work \"On Unbelievable Tales\" or \"On Incredible Tales\" (), stated that the Amazons most probably were men mistaken for women by their enemies because they wore clothing which reached their feet, tied up their hair in headbands and shaved their beards, and also, since they did not exist during his time, most probably they did nοt exist in the past either.\n\nThe origin of the word is uncertain. It may be derived from an Iranian ethnonym \"*ha-mazan-\" \"warriors\", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in Hesychius of Alexandria's gloss (\"\"\": 'to make war' in Persian\"), where it appears together with the Indo-Iranian root \"*kar-\" \"make\" (from which Sanskrit \"karma\" is also derived).\n\nIt may also be derived from \"\" \"manless, without husbands\" (\"a-\" privative and a derivation of \"*man-\" also found in Slavic \"muzh\") has been proposed, an explanation deemed \"unlikely\" by Hjalmar Frisk. 19th-century scholarship also connected the term to the ethnonym Amazigh. A further explanation proposes Iranian *\"ama-janah\" \"virility-killing\" as source.\n\nAmong Classical Greeks, \"amazon\" was given a folk etymology as originating from ' () and ' (), \"without breast\", connected with an etiological tradition once claimed by Marcus Justinus who alleged that Amazons had their right breast cut off or burnt out. There is no indication of such a practice in ancient works of art, in which the Amazons are always represented with both breasts, although one is frequently covered. Adrienne Mayor suggests the origin of this myth was due to the word's etymology.\n\nGreeks also used some descriptive phrases for them. Herodotus used the \"Androktones\" (, singular , ') (\"killers of men\") and \"Androleteirai\" (, singular , ') (\"destroyers of men, murderesses\"), in the Iliad they are also called \"Antianeirai\" (, singular , \"\") (\"against men\") and Aeschylus, in his work \"Prometheus Bound\", used \"styganor\" () (\"those who loathe all men\").\n\nHerodotus and Strabo placed them on the banks of the Thermodon and Themiscyra. Herodotus also mentions that some Amazons lived at Scythia because after the Greeks defeated the Amazons in battle, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them, then these Amazons landed at Scythian lands. Strabo writes that the original home of the Amazons was in Themiscyra and the plains about Thermodon and the mountains that lie above them, but were later driven out of these places, and during his time they were said to live in the mountains above Caucasian Albania (not to be confused with the modern Albania), but he also states that some others, among them Metrodorus of Scepsis and Hypsicrates, say that after Themiscyra, the Amazons traveled and lived on the borders of the Gargarians, in the northerly foothills of those parts of the Caucasian Mountains which are called Ceraunian. Diodorus giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya. These Amazons started from Libya passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the Caïcus in Aeolis, near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established Mitylene a little way beyond the Caïcus. Aeschylus, in \"Prometheus Bound\", places the original home of the Amazons in the country about Lake Maeotis and they later moved to Themiscyra on the Thermodon. According to Pseudo-Plutarch, the Amazons lived in and about the Tanais () river (modern Don river), formerly called the Amazonian or Amazon () river, because the Amazons bathed themselves therein. The Amazons later moved to Themiscyra (speculated to be modern Terme, though no ruins exist) on the River Thermodon (the Terme river in northern Turkey).\nPlutarch mentions that the campaign(s) of Heracles and Theseus against the Amazons was at Euxine Sea (modern Black Sea). Homer tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near Lycia.\nThe Amazons were supposed to have founded many towns, amongst them Smyrna, Ephesus, Cyme, Myrina, Sinope, Paphos, Mitylene. At Patmos there was a place called Amazonium. Also, on the island of Lemnos, there was another Myrina. The cities of Myrina had this name after the amazon Myrina.\n\nApollonius Rhodius, at Argonautica, mentions that at Thermodon the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians (), in another the Lycastians (), and in another the Chadesians ().\n\nGreeks also used other descriptive phrases for them. Herodotus used the \"Androktones\" (, singular , ') (\"killers/slayers of men\") and \"Androleteirai\" (, singular , ') (\"destroyers of men, murderesses\"), in the Iliad they are also called \"Antianeirai\" (, singular , \"\") (\"equivalent to men\") and Aeschylus used the \"Styganor\" () (\"those who loathe all men\") in his work Prometheus Bound.\n\nHerodotus stated that in the Scythian language they were called \"Oiorpata\", \"oior\" meaning \"man\", and \"pata\" meaning \"to slay\".\n\nIn some versions of the myth, no men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the Gargareans, a neighbouring tribe.\n\nStrabo, giving credits to Metrodorus of Scepsis and Hypsicrates, mentions that at his time the Amazons were believed to live on the borders of the Gargareans. There were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would go there to offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargarean to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own, regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty. He also stated that the Gargareans went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.\nIn addition, he states that the right breasts of all Amazons are seared when they are infants, so that they can easily use their right arm for every needed purpose, and especially that of throwing the javelin and use the bow.\nHerodotus mentions that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.\nApollonius Rhodius, at Argonautica, mentions that Amazons were the daughters of Ares and Harmonia (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war. According to him, the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians (), in another the Lycastians (), and in another the Chadesians (). Also, he mention that on an island, the Queens of the Amazons, Otrere () and Antiope (), built a marble temple of Ares. On this desert island there were ravening birds, which in countless numbers haunt it. The island mentioned is the Aretias. Argonauts passed by Themiscyra on their journey to Colchis. Zeus sent Boreas (the North Wind), and with his help the Argonauts stood out from the shore near Themiscyra where the Themiscyreian Amazons were arming for battle.\n\nThe King Iobates sent Bellerophon against Amazons, hoping that they would kill him, but Bellerophon killed them all.\n\nThe Amazons appear in Greek art of the Archaic period and in connection with several Greek legends. The tomb of Myrine is mentioned in the \"Iliad\"; later interpretation made of her an Amazon: according to Diodorus,\n\nAccording to Diodorus, the Amazons under the rule of Queen Myrina, invaded the lands of the Atlantians. Amazons defeated the army of the Atlantian city of Cerne, treated the captives savagely, killed all the men, led into slavery the children and women, and razed the city. When the terrible fate of the inhabitants of Cerne became known among the other Atlantians, they were struck with terror, surrendered their cities on terms of capitulation and announced that they would do whatever should be commanded them. Queen Myrina bearing herself honourably towards the Atlantians, established friendship with them and founded a city to bear her name in place of the city of Cerne which had been razed; and in it she settled both the captives and any native who so desired. Atlantians presented her with magnificent presents and by public decree voted to her notable honours, and she in return accepted their courtesy and in addition promised that she would show kindness to their nation. Diodorus also mentions that the Amazons of Queen Myrina used the skins of gigantic snakes, from Libya, to protect themselves at battle. Later Queen Myrine led her Amazons to victory against the Gorgons. After the battle against the Gorgons, Myrina accorded a funeral to her fallen comrades on three pyres and raised up three great heaps of earth as tombs, which are called \"Amazon Mounds\" ().\n\nOne of the tasks imposed upon Hercules by Eurystheus was to obtain possession of the girdle of the Amazonian queen Hippolyta. He was accompanied by his friend Theseus, who carried off the princess Antiope, sister of Hippolyta, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of Attica, in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus. In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die; by this marriage with the Amazon Theseus had a son Hippolytus. \nIn another version of this myth, Theseus made this voyage on his own account, after the time of Heracles.\nThe battle between the Athenians and Amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, amazonomachy, in marble bas-reliefs such as from the Parthenon or the sculptures of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus.\nPlutarch, in his work Parallel Lives-The Life of Theseus, mentions that Bion said that the Amazons, were naturally friendly to men, and did not fly from Theseus when he touched upon their coasts.\n\nAmazons attacked the Phrygians, who were assisted by Priam, then a young man. In his later years, however, towards the end of the Trojan War, his old opponents took his side against the Greeks under their queen Penthesilea \"of Thracian birth\", who was slain by Achilles.\n\nThe god Dionysus and his entourage fought the amazons at Ephesus, the Amazons fled to Samos, but Dionysus pursued them and at Samos he killed a great number of them on a spot which was, from that occurrence, called Panaema (), which means blood-soaked field. In another myth Dionysus united with the Amazons to fight against Cronus and the Titans.\n\nThe Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the island of Leuke, at the mouth of the Danube, where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by Thetis. The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. Pompey is said to have found them in the army of Mithridates.\n\nThey are heard of in the time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen Thalestris visiting him and becoming a mother by him (the story is known from the \"Alexander Romance\"). However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded secondary source, Plutarch. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, Onesicritus, was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King Lysimachus of Thrace who was on the original expedition: the king smiled at him and said \"And where was I, then?\"\n\nThe Roman writer Virgil's characterization of the Volscian warrior maiden Camilla in the \"Aeneid\" borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazons.\n\nJordanes' \"Getica\" (), purporting to give the earliest history of the Goths, relates that the Goths' ancestors, descendants of Magog, originally dwelt within Scythia, on the Sea of Azov between the Dnieper and Don Rivers. After a few centuries, following an incident where the Goths' women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe, while the menfolk were off campaigning against Pharaoh Vesosis, the women formed their own army under Marpesia and crossed the Don, invading Asia. Her sister Lampedo remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These Amazons conquered Armenia, Syria, and all of Asia Minor, even reaching Ionia and Aeolia, holding this vast territory for 100 years. Jordanes also mentions that they fought with Hercules, and in the Trojan War, and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the Caucasus Mountains until the time of Alexander. He mentions by name the Queens Menalippe, Hippolyta, and Penthesilea.\n\nIn the Grottaferrata Version of \"Digenes Akritas\", the twelfth century medieval epic of Basil, the Greek-Syrian knight of the Byzantine frontier, the hero battles with and kills the female warrior Maximo.\n\n\nThere are several (conflicting) lists of names of Amazons.\n\nOther names of Amazons from various sources include:\n\n\nAccording to ancient sources (Plutarch, Theseus, Pausanias), Amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient Greek world. Some are found in Megara, Athens, Chaeronea, Chalcis, Thessaly at Skotousa, in Cynoscephalae, and statues of Amazons are all over Greece. Stephanus of Byzantium, quoting Ephorus, mention that the tomb of the amazon Anaea () was at the city of Anaea (), which also has this name after the amazon.\n\nAt both Chalcis and Athens, Plutarch tells us that there was an Amazoneum or shrine of Amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult. At the entrance of Athens there was a monument to the Amazon Antiope. On the day before the Thesea at Athens there were annual sacrifices to the Amazons. In historical times Greek maidens of Ephesus performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by Hippolyta and her Amazons. They had initially set up wooden statues of Artemis, a \"bretas\" (Pausanias, (): \"Description of Greece\", Book I: Attica).\n\nIn works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as – and often associated with – battles of Greeks and centaurs. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called \"pelta\", and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek mind had apparently been the goddess Athena. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly Persian – that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the \"kidaris\". They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.\nThis depiction of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greek mind, the Amazons were linked to the Scythians. Their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the Crimea to Mongolia. Amazons were described by Herodotus as wearing trousers and having tall stiff caps. The double-sided axe was the most emblematic of their weapons. Amazons can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons (Amazonomachy) is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the Temple of Apollo at Bassae, now in the British Museum), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at Athens it was represented on the shield of the statue of Athena Parthenos, on wall-paintings in the Theseum and in the \"Stoa Poikile\". There were also three standard Amazon statue types.\n\nLater in the Renaissance, as Amazon myth evolved, artists started to depict warrior women in a new light. Queen Elizabeth was often thought of as an Amazon-like warrior during her reign and was sometimes depicted as such. Though, as explained in \"Divinia Viagro\" by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright \"has given a detailed account of the bad press Amazons had in the Renaissance (with respect to their unwomanly conduct and Scythian cruelty). She notes that she has not found any Elizabethans comparing the queen directly to an Amazon, and suggests that they might have hesitated to do so because of the association of Amazons with enfranchisement of women, which was considered contemptible.\"\n\nPeter Paul Rubens and Jan Brueghel depicted the Battle of the Amazons around 1598, showing many attributes of Renaissance-styled paintings. Amazons also appear in the Rococo period in another painting titled \"Battle of the Amazons\" by Johann Georg Platzer. As a part of the Romantic period revival, German artist Anselm Feuerbach painted the Amazons as well. His paintings “engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.”\n\nHerodotus reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs, \"frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men\". Moreover, said Herodotus, \"No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle\". In the story related by Herodotus, a group of Amazons was blown across the Maeotian Lake (the Sea of Azov) into Scythia near the cliff region (today's southeastern Crimea). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the Tanais (Don) river, and became the ancestors of the Sauromatians. According to Herodotus, the Sarmatians fought with the Scythians against Darius the Great in the 5th century BC.\n\nHippocrates describes them as: \"They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm.\"\n\nAmazons came to play a role in Roman historiography. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by Semiramis and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders (Strabo 5.504; Nicholas Damascenus). Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. Pliny the Elder records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the Terme River as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herodotus (VI.86) first mentions their capital Themiscyra, which Pliny locates near the Terme. Philostratus places the Amazons in the Taurus Mountains. Ammianus places them east of Tanais, as neighbouring the Alans. Procopius places them in the Caucasus. Diodorus Siculus (\"Bibliotheca historica\" III, chapter 52) mentioned that besides Pontus Amazons existed much older race (at that time entirely disappeared) of Amazons from western Libya, and retells their mythological story which includes Atlantis and Greek mythology.\n\nAlthough Strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. Solinus embraces the account of Pliny. Under Aurelianus, captured Gothic women were identified as Amazons (Claudianus). The account of Justinus was influential, and was used as a source by Orosius who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, Adam of Bremen placing them at the Baltic Sea and Paulus Diaconus in the heart of Germania.\n\nAmazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the Age of Exploration, they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, Francisco de Orellana reached the Amazon River (\"Amazonas\" in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the Nhamundá River, a tributary of the Amazon. Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (\"Amazônia\" in Portuguese, \"Amazonía\" in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both Christopher Columbus and Walter Raleigh. Famous medieval traveller John Mandeville mentions them in his book:\n\nMedieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the battle-axe. This is probably related to the \"sagaris\", an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan). Paulus Hector Mair expresses astonishment that such a \"manly weapon\" should have been invented by a \"tribe of women\", but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, Johannes Aventinus.\n\nAriosto's \"Orlando Furioso\" contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" in \"The Knight's Tale\".\n\nClassicist Peter Walcot wrote, \"Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the Black Sea in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of the civilized world. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience.\"\n\nNevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical Scythia and Sarmatia in line with the account by Herodotus, but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even Minoan Crete.\n\nSpeculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in Greek mythology may have been \"inspired by real warrior women\".\n\nEvidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from kurgans in southern Ukraine and Russia.\nDavid Anthony notes, \"About 20% of Scythian-Sarmatian 'warrior graves' on the lower Don and lower Volga contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons.\"\nUp to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows. Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-hegemony in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.\n\nBefore modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under kurgans in the region of Altai Mountains and Sarmatia,\n\nWhen Minoan archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by Lewis Richard Farnell and John Myres to Robert Ranulph Marett's \"Anthropology and the Classics\" (1908), placed their possible origins in Minoan civilization, drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres, the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in Minoan culture. \n\nFrancisco de Orellana gave the Amazon river its name after reporting pitched battles with tribes of female warriors, whom he likened to the Amazons.\n\nThe city of Samsun in modern-day Turkey features a recently constructed \"Amazon Village\" museum, created to bring attention to the legacy of the Amazons and to generate both academic interest and popular tourism. A festival is also held every year in the Terme district of Samsun Province to celebrate the Amazons.\n\nIn Greece, female equestrians are also called \"Amazons\" ().\n\nAmazons became an important subject of the fine arts around 1900, especially in the work of the Munich painter and sculptor Franz Stuck (1863-1928). \n\nIn Nazi-Germany open air events called \"Nacht der Amazonen\" (Night of the Amazons) were performed at Nymphenburg Palace in Munich between 1936 and 1939. These revues with bare-breasted girls presented an allegedly emancipated female role as part of the „new race“ intended to be realized by racial fanatics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44991852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44991852", "title": "Amedy Coulibaly", "text": "Amedy Coulibaly\n\nAmedy Coulibaly (; 27 February 1982 – 9 January 2015) was a Malian-French man who was the prime suspect in the Montrouge shooting, in which municipal police officer Clarissa Jean-Philippe was shot and killed, and was the hostage-taker and gunman in the Hypercacher Kosher Supermarket siege, in which he killed four hostages before being killed by police.\n\nHe was a close friend of Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, the gunmen in the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting, to which Coulibaly's shootings were connected. He said he synchronized his attacks with the Kouachi brothers. Coulibaly had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\n\nHis wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, is currently being sought by French police as a suspected accomplice of Coulibaly, alleged to have helped him commit his attacks. She arrived in Turkey five days before the attacks. She has been described by newspapers as \"France's most wanted woman\". She was last tracked on 10 January 2015 to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-controlled border town of Tell Abyad in Syria.\n\nCoulibaly was born in Juvisy-sur-Orge, a suburb south-east of Paris, into a Malian Muslim immigrant family. He was the only boy, with nine sisters. He grew up on a housing estate, La Grande Borne, in Grigny, south of Paris.\n\nStarting at the age of 17, he was convicted five times for armed robbery and at least once for drug trafficking. A report by a psychiatric expert prepared for a Parisian court found Coulibaly had an \"immature and psychopathic personality\" and \"poor powers of introspection\".\n\nIn 2004, Coulibaly was sentenced to six years in Fleury-Mérogis Prison for armed bank robbery. There, he met Chérif Kouachi. He is believed to have converted to radical Islam in prison at the same time as Chérif. In prison he also met al-Qaeda recruiter Djamel Beghal, who was in \"isolation\" in the cell above him but whom he was nevertheless able to communicate with. He later said that his discovery of Islam in prison changed him.\n\nAfter release from prison he married Hayat Boumeddiene on 5 July 2009 in an Islamic religious ceremony. Boumeddiene's father stood in for her at the marriage service. On 15 July 2009, while involved in an effort promoting youth employment, Coulibaly, along with about 500 others, met with then-President Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nA source stated that Coulibaly \"was friends of both of\" the Kouachi brothers, and he had first met Cherif in prison. Coulibaly and the Kouachi brothers were known members of the . The name comes from the nearby Parc des Buttes Chaumont, where they often met and performed military-style training exercises with other French-Algerian extremists. Coulibaly is believed to have been radicalised by an Islamic preacher in Paris, and had expressed a desire to fight in either Iraq or Syria.\n\nTen months after his meeting with Sarkozy, in May 2010 police arrested him and searched his apartment. They found ammunition, a crossbow, and letters seeking false official documents. Coulibaly maintained that he was planning to sell the ammunition on the street. In December 2013 he was sentenced to five years in prison for supplying ammunition for a plot to break out from prison radical French-Algerian Islamist Smain Ait Ali Belkacem (who had planned the 1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings), a plot in which the Kouachi brothers were also involved. However, Coulibaly was released early from Villepinte prison outside Paris, in March 2014. He was required to wear an electronic bracelet until May 2014.\n\nIn August 2014, Coulibaly and his wife approached a Jewish school, and inquired if there were Jews inside. The security guard asked them to leave.\n\nA week before the attacks, on 4 January 2015 Coulibaly rented a house in Gentilly, Val-de-Marne, in the southern Paris suburbs. There, after the attacks, police discovered automatic weapons, a grenade launcher, smoke grenades and bombs, handguns, industrial explosives, and flags of the Islamic State.\n\nHe had pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, as he put it, \"as soon as the caliphate was declared,\" which was in the summer of 2014. He stated this, and described how he and the Kouachi brothers had synchronized their attacks and were \"a team, in league together,\" in a video posted on Twitter days after he and the brothers were killed. Text in the video states that Coulibaly had killed a policewoman and \"five Jews.\" The video captions him with the names \"Amedy Coulibaly\" and \"Abou Bassir Abdallah al-Ifriqi\". As the video includes news reports of his attack on the kosher supermarket, it was edited by someone after he was killed.\n\nCoulibaly is said to be responsible for three shootings, and he said he synchronized his attacks with the Kouachi brothers. In the shootings, five people were killed and eleven others were wounded.\n\nThe first shooting was of a jogger who was wounded on the evening of 7 January in Fontenay-aux-Roses. Shell casings found at the scene were later linked to the weapon carried by Coulibaly in his kosher supermarket attack.\n\nThe second shooting occurred in Montrouge on 8 January. Clarissa Jean-Philippe, an unarmed French policewoman, was killed, and a street sweeper was critically injured. DNA found at the scene was a match to Coulibaly.\n\nThe third shooting took place at Porte de Vincennes, east Paris, on 9 January. Coulibaly killed four more people, all Jewish patrons at a Jewish Hypercacher supermarket at Porte de Vincennes, at the outset of an hours-long siege in which he demanded that the Kouachi brothers be freed. At the outset of that attack, he introduced himself to his hostages, saying: \"I am Amedy Coulibaly, Malian and Muslim. I belong to the Islamic State.\" French commandos stormed the store, and killed Coulibaly. He left in his car maps indicating the locations of Jewish schools in Paris. * A Nagant M1895 revolver was also found in the possession of Coulibaly.\n\nAfter Mali refused to accept Coulibaly's body for burial, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Muslim section of a cemetery in Thiais.\n\nHis wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, is currently being sought by French police as a suspected accomplice of Coulibaly, alleged to have helped him commit his attacks. She arrived in Turkey five days before the attacks. She has been described by newspapers as \"France's most wanted woman\". She was last tracked on 10 January 2015 to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-controlled border town of Tell Abyad in Syria.\n\n"}
{"id": "31663216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31663216", "title": "Apostles", "text": "Apostles\n\nIn Christian theology and ecclesiology, the apostles (), particularly the Twelve Apostles (also known as the Twelve Disciples or simply the Twelve), were the primary disciples of Jesus, the central figure in Christianity. During the life and ministry of Jesus in the 1st century AD, the apostles were his closest followers and became the primary teachers of the gospel message of Jesus. The word \"disciple\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"apostle\"; for instance, the Gospel of John makes no distinction between the two terms.\n\nIn modern usage, prominent missionaries are often called apostles, a practice which stems from the Latin equivalent of \"apostle\", i.e. \"\", the source of the English word \"missionary\". For example, Saint Patrick (AD 373–463) was the \"Apostle of Ireland\", Saint Boniface (680–755) was the \"Apostle to the Germans\", Saint José de Anchieta (1534–1597) was the \"Apostle of Brazil\" and Saint Peter of Betancur (1626–1667) was the \"Apostle of Guatemala\".\n\nWhile Christian tradition often refers to the apostles as being twelve in number, different gospel writers give different names for the same individual, and apostles mentioned in one gospel are not mentioned in others. The commissioning of the Twelve Apostles during the ministry of Jesus is recorded in the Synoptic Gospels. After his resurrection, Jesus sent eleven of them (minus Judas Iscariot, who by then had died) by the Great Commission to spread his teachings to all nations. This event is commonly called the Dispersion of the Apostles. There is also an Eastern Christian tradition derived from the Gospel of Luke of there having been as many as 70 apostles during the time of Jesus' ministry. Prominent figures in early Christianity, notably Paul, were often called apostles, even though their ministry or mission came after the life of Jesus.\n\nThe period of early Christianity during the lifetimes of the apostles is called the Apostolic Age. During the 1st century AD, the apostles established churches throughout the territories of the Roman Empire and, according to tradition, through the Middle East, Africa, and India.\n\nThe word \"apostle\" comes from the Greek word (\"apóstolos\"), formed from the prefix (\"apó-\", \"from\") and root (\"stéllō\", \"I send\", \"I depart\") and originally meaning \"messenger, envoy\". It has, however, a stronger sense than the word messenger, and is closer to a \"delegate\". The \"Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament\" argues that its Christian use translated a Jewish position known in Hebrew as the \"sheliach\" (). This ecclesiastical meaning of the word was later translated into Latin as \"\", the source of the English \"missionary\".\n\nIn the New Testament, the majority of the apostles have Hebrew names, although some have Greek names. Many Jews at the time had Latin or Greek names as well as Hebrew names.\n\nLater in the Gospel narratives the twelve apostles are described as having been commissioned to preach the Gospel to \"all the nations\", regardless of whether Jew or Gentile. Paul emphasized the important role of the apostles in the church of God when he said that the household of God is \"built upon the foundation of apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone\".\nAlthough not one of the apostles commissioned during the life of Jesus, Paul, a Jew named Saul of Tarsus, claimed a special commission from the risen Jesus and is considered \"the apostle of the Gentiles\", for his missions to spread the gospel message after his conversion. In his writings, the epistles to Christian churches throughout the Levant, Paul did not restrict the term \"apostle\" to the Twelve, and often refers to his mentor Barnabas as an apostle. The restricted usage appears in the Revelation to John.\n\nBy the 2nd century AD, association with the apostles was esteemed as an evidence of authority. Churches which are believed to have been founded by one of the apostles are known as apostolic sees. Paul's epistles were accepted as scripture, and two of the four canonical gospels were associated with apostles, as were other New Testament works. Various Christian texts, such as the \"Didache\" and the \"Apostolic Constitutions\", were attributed to the apostles. Bishops traced their lines of succession back to individual apostles, who were said to have dispersed from Jerusalem and established churches across great territories. Christian bishops have traditionally claimed authority deriving, by apostolic succession, from the Twelve. Early Church Fathers who came to be associated with apostles, such as Pope Clement I with St. Peter, are referred to as the Apostolic Fathers. The Apostles' Creed, popular in the West, was said to have been composed by the apostles themselves.\n\nThe three Synoptic Gospels record the circumstances in which some of the disciples were recruited, Matthew only describing the recruitment of Simon, Andrew, James, and John. All three Synoptic Gospels state that these four were recruited fairly soon after Jesus returned from being tempted by the devil.\n\nDespite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, they are all described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets to do so. Traditionally the immediacy of their consent was viewed as an example of divine power, although this statement is not made in the text itself. The alternative and much more ordinary solution is that Jesus was simply friends with the individuals beforehand, as implied by the Gospel of John, which states that Peter (Simon) and Andrew were disciples of John the Baptist, and started following Jesus as soon as Jesus had been baptized.\n\nAlbright and Mann extrapolate from Simon's and Andrew's abandonment of their nets that Matthew is emphasizing the importance of renunciation by converting to Christianity, since fishing was profitable, although required large start-up costs, and abandoning everything would have been an important sacrifice. Regardless, Simon and Andrew's abandonment of what were effectively their most important worldly possessions was taken as a model by later Christian ascetics.\nMatthew describes Jesus meeting James and John, also fishermen and brothers, very shortly after recruiting Simon and Andrew. Matthew and Mark identify James and John as sons of Zebedee. Luke adds to Matthew and Mark that James and John worked as a team with Simon and Andrew. Matthew states that at the time of the encounter, James and John were repairing their nets, but readily joined Jesus without hesitation.\n\nThis parallels the accounts of Mark and Luke, but Matthew implies that the men have also abandoned their father (since he is present in the ship they abandon behind them), and Carter feels this should be interpreted to mean that Matthew's view of Jesus is one of a figure rejecting the traditional patriarchal structure of society, where the father had command over his children; most scholars, however, just interpret it to mean that Matthew intended these two to be seen as even more devoted than the other pair.\n\nThe Synoptic Gospels go on to describe that much later, after Jesus had later begun his ministry, he noticed, while teaching, a tax collector in his booth. The tax collector, called Matthew in , Levi in and , is asked by Jesus to become one of his disciples. Matthew/Levi is stated to have accepted and then invited Jesus for a meal with his friends. Tax collectors were seen as villains in Jewish society, and the Pharisees are described as asking Jesus why he is having a meal with such disreputable people. The reply Jesus gives to this is now well known: \"it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners\".\n\nAfter Judas Iscariot betrayed Christ and then in guilt committed suicide before Christ's resurrection (in one Gospel account), the apostles numbered eleven. When Jesus had been taken up from them, in preparation for the coming of the Holy Spirit that he had promised them, Peter advised the brethren:\nSo, between the ascension of Christ and the day of Pentecost, the remaining apostles elected a twelfth apostle by casting lots, a traditional Israelite way to determine the will of God (see ). The lot fell upon Matthias.\n\nPaul the Apostle in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, appears to give the first historical reference to the twelve apostles:\nIn his writings, Paul the Apostle, although not one of the original twelve, described himself as an \"apostle\", one \"born out of due time\" (e.g., , 1 Corinthians 15:8 and other letters). He was called by the resurrected Jesus himself during his Road to Damascus vision and given the name \"Paul\". With Barnabas, he was allotted the role of apostle in the church. He referred to himself as the \"apostle of the Gentiles.\"\n\nAs the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" states, \"It is at once evident that in a Christian sense, everyone who had received a mission from God, or Christ, to man could be called 'Apostle'\"; thus extending the original sense beyond the twelve.\n\nSince Paul claimed to have received the gospel through a revelation of Jesus Christ after the latter's death and resurrection (rather than before like the twelve), he was often obliged to defend his apostolic authority () and proclaim that he had seen and was anointed by Jesus while on the road to Damascus.\n\nJames, Peter and John in Jerusalem accepted his calling to the apostleship from the Lord to the Gentiles (specifically those not circumcised) as of equal authority as Peter's to the Jews (specifically those circumcised) according to Paul. \"James, Peter and John, those reputed to be pillars ... agreed that we [Paul and Barnabas] should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.\"\n\nPaul, despite his divine calling as an apostle, considered himself perhaps inferior to the other apostles because he had originally persecuted Christ's followers. In addition, despite the Little Commission of Matthew 10, the twelve did not limit their mission to solely Jews as Cornelius the Centurion is widely considered the first Gentile convert and he was converted by Peter, and the Great Commission of the Resurrected Jesus is specifically to \"all nations\".\n\nOf the twelve Apostles to hold the title after Matthias' selection, Christian tradition has generally passed down that all but one were martyred, with John surviving into old age. Only the death of James, son of Zebedee is described in the New Testament.\n\nAccording to the 18th-century historian Edward Gibbon, early Christians (second half of the second century and first half of the third century) believed that only Peter, Paul, and James, son of Zebedee, were martyred. The remainder or even all of the claims of martyred apostles do not rely upon historical or biblical evidence.\n\nThe relics of the Apostles are claimed by various Churches, many in Italy.\n\nEach of the four listings of apostles in the New Testament (, , , and ) indicate that all the apostles were men. The canonical gospels and the book of Acts give varying names of the twelve apostles. The list in the Gospel of Luke differs from Matthew and Mark at two points. It lists \"Judas the son of James\" instead of \"Thaddeus\". (For more information, see Jude the Apostle.) Unlike the Synoptic Gospels, the Gospel of John does not offer a formal list of apostles. Although it refers to \"the Twelve\" (), the gospel does not present any elaboration of who these twelve actually were, and the author of the Gospel of John does not mention them all by name. There is also no separation of the terms \"apostles\" and \"disciples\" in John.\n\nIn Luke (10:38–42), Mary, sister of Lazarus, is contrasted with her sister Martha, who was \"cumbered about many things\" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen \"the better part,\" that of listening to the master's discourse. John names her as the \"one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair\" (11:2). In Luke, an unidentified \"sinner\" in the house of a Pharisee anoints Jesus' feet. In Medieval Catholic folklore, Mary, the sister of Lazarus, was seen as the same as Mary Magdalene.\n\nLuke refers to a number of people accompanying Jesus and the twelve. From among them he names three women: \"Mary, called Magdalene, ... and Joanna the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their resources\" (Luke 8:2-3). Mary Magdalene and Joanna are among the women who went to prepare Jesus' body in Luke's account of the resurrection, and who later told the apostles and other disciples about the empty tomb and words of the \"two men in dazzling clothes\". Mary Magdalene is the most well-known of the disciples outside of the Twelve. More is written in the gospels about her than the other female followers. There is also a large body of lore and literature covering her.\n\nOther gospel writers differ as to which women witness the crucifixion and witness to the resurrection. Mark includes Mary, the mother of James and Salome (not to be confused with Salomé the daughter of Herodias) at the crucifixion and Salome at the tomb. John includes Mary the wife of Clopas at the crucifixion.\n\nThe \"seventy disciples\" or \"seventy-two disciples\" (known in the Eastern Christian traditions as the \"Seventy Apostles\") were early emissaries of Jesus mentioned in the Gospel of Luke . According to Luke, the only gospel in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.\n\nIn Western Christianity, they are usually referred to as disciples, whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as Apostles. Using the original Greek words, both titles are descriptive, as an \"apostle\" is one sent on a mission (the Greek uses the verb form: \"apesteilen\") whereas a \"disciple\" is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words \"apostle\" and \"disciple\".\n\nThe Gospel of Matthew is anonymous: the author is not named within the text, and the superscription \"according to Matthew\" was added some time in the 2nd century. The tradition that the author was Matthew the Apostle begins with Papias of Hierapolis (c. AD 100–140), an early bishop and Apostolic Father, who is cited by the Church historian Eusebius (AD 260–340), as follows: \"Matthew collected the oracles [\"logia\": sayings of or about Jesus] in the Hebrew language [\"Hebraïdi dialektōi\"], and each one interpreted [\"hērmēneusen—\"perhaps 'translated'] them as best he could.\"\n\nAlthough the Gospel of John is anonymous, Christian tradition historically has attributed it to John the Apostle, son of Zebedee and one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles. The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving Johannine epistles that commentators treat the four books, along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not necessarily written by the same author.\n\nThe Gospel of Mark was written anonymously. Early Christian tradition, first attested by Papias of Hierapolis, ascribes it to John Mark, a companion and interpreter of the apostle Peter. Hence its author is often called Mark, even though most modern scholars are doubtful of the Markan tradition and instead regard the author as unknown. It was probably written c. AD 66–70, during Nero's persecution of the Christians in Rome or the Jewish revolt, as suggested by internal references to war in Judea and to persecution. The author used a variety of pre-existing sources, such as conflict stories (Mark 2:1–3:6), apocalyptic discourse (4:1–35), and collections of sayings (although not the Gospel of Thomas and probably not the Q source).\n\nAccording to Church tradition, Luke the Evangelist, the companion of Paul, is believed to have authored the Gospel of Luke, though anonymously written and lacking an author's name; but while this view is still occasionally put forward the scholarly consensus emphasises the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters. The most probable date for its composition is around 80–110 AD, and there is evidence that it was still being revised well into the 2nd century.\n\n"}
{"id": "2179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179", "title": "Autobiography", "text": "Autobiography\n\nAn autobiography (from the Greek, αὐτός-\"autos\" self + βίος-\"bios\" life + γράφειν-\"graphein\" to write) is a self-written account of the life of oneself. The word \"autobiography\" was first used deprecatingly by William Taylor in 1797 in the English periodical \"The Monthly Review\", when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it as \"pedantic\". However, its next recorded use was in its present sense, by Robert Southey in 1809. Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century, first-person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity. Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self-reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that \"[autobiography] is a review of a life from a particular moment in time, while the diary, however reflective it may be, moves through a series of moments in time\". Autobiography thus takes stock of the autobiographer's life from the moment of composition. While biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints, autobiography may be based entirely on the writer's memory. The memoir form is closely associated with autobiography but it tends, as Pascal claims, to focus less on the self and more on others during the autobiographer's review of his or her life. \n\n\"See also: List of autobiographies and for examples.\"\n\nAutobiographical works are by nature subjective. The inability—or unwillingness—of the author to accurately recall memories has in certain cases resulted in misleading or incorrect information. Some sociologists and psychologists have noted that autobiography offers the author the ability to recreate history.\n\nSpiritual autobiography is an account of an author's struggle or journey towards God, followed by conversion a religious conversion, often interrupted by moments of regression. The author re-frames his or her life as a demonstration of divine intention through encounters with the Divine. The earliest example of a spiritual autobiography is Augustine's \"Confessions\" though the tradition has expanded to include other religious traditions in works such as Zahid Rohari's \"An Autobiography\" and \"Black Elk Speaks\". The spiritual autobiography works as an endorsement of his or her religion.\n\nA memoir is slightly different in character from an autobiography. While an autobiography typically focuses on the \"life and times\" of the writer, a memoir has a narrower, more intimate focus on his or her own memories, feelings and emotions. Memoirs have often been written by politicians or military leaders as a way to record and publish an account of their public exploits. One early example is that of Julius Caesar's \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\", also known as \"Commentaries on the Gallic Wars\". In the work, Caesar describes the battles that took place during the nine years that he spent fighting local armies in the Gallic Wars. His second memoir, \"Commentarii de Bello Civili\" (or \"Commentaries on the Civil War\") is an account of the events that took place between 49 and 48 BC in the civil war against Gnaeus Pompeius and the Senate. \n\nLeonor López de Córdoba (1362–1420) wrote what is supposed to be the first autobiography in Spanish. The English Civil War (1642–1651) provoked a number of examples of this genre, including works by Sir Edmund Ludlow and Sir John Reresby. French examples from the same period include the memoirs of Cardinal de Retz (1614–1679) and the Duc de Saint-Simon.\n\nThe term \"fictional autobiography\" signifies novels about a fictional character written as though the character were writing their own autobiography, meaning that the character is the first-person narrator and that the novel addresses both internal and external experiences of the character. Daniel Defoe's \"Moll Flanders\" is an early example. Charles Dickens' \"David Copperfield\" is another such classic, and J.D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\" is a well-known modern example of fictional autobiography. Charlotte Brontë's \"Jane Eyre\" is yet another example of fictional autobiography, as noted on the front page of the original version. The term may also apply to works of fiction purporting to be autobiographies of real characters, e.g., Robert Nye's \"Memoirs of Lord Byron\".\n\nIn antiquity such works were typically entitled \"apologia,\" purporting to be self-justification rather than self-documentation. John Henry Newman's Christian confessional work (first published in 1864) is entitled \"Apologia Pro Vita Sua\" in reference to this tradition.\n\nThe Jewish historian Flavius Josephus introduces his autobiography (\"Josephi Vita\", c. 99) with self-praise, which is followed by a justification of his actions as a Jewish rebel commander of Galilee.\n\nThe pagan rhetor Libanius (c. 314–394) framed his life memoir (\"Oration I\" begun in 374) as one of his orations, not of a public kind, but of a literary kind that could not be aloud in privacy.\n\nAugustine (354–430) applied the title \"Confessions\" to his autobiographical work, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau used the same title in the 18th century, initiating the chain of confessional and sometimes racy and highly self-critical, autobiographies of the Romantic era and beyond. Augustine's was arguably the first Western autobiography ever written, and became an influential model for Christian writers throughout the Middle Ages. It tells of the hedonistic lifestyle Augustine lived for a time within his youth, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits; his following and leaving of the anti-sex and anti-marriage Manichaeism in attempts to seek sexual morality; and his subsequent return to Christianity due to his embracement of Skepticism and the New Academy movement (developing the view that sex is good, and that virginity is better, comparing the former to silver and the latter to gold; Augustine's views subsequently strongly influenced Western theology). \"Confessions\" will always rank among the great masterpieces of western literature.\n\nIn the spirit of Augustine's \"Confessions\" is the 12th-century \"Historia Calamitatum\" of Peter Abelard, outstanding as an autobiographical document of its period.\n\nIn the 15th century, Leonor López de Córdoba, a Spanish noblewoman, wrote her \"Memorias\", which may be the first autobiography in Castillian.\n\nZāhir ud-Dīn Mohammad Bābur, who founded the Mughal dynasty of South Asia kept a journal \"Bāburnāma\" (Chagatai/; literally: \"Book of Babur\" or \"Letters of Babur\") which was written between 1493 and 1529.\n\nOne of the first great autobiographies of the Renaissance is that of the sculptor and goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1571), written between 1556 and 1558, and entitled by him simply \"Vita\" (Italian: \"Life\"). He declares at the start: \"No matter what sort he is, everyone who has to his credit what are or really seem great achievements, if he cares for truth and goodness, ought to write the story of his own life in his own hand; but no one should venture on such a splendid undertaking before he is over forty.\" These criteria for autobiography generally persisted until recent times, and most serious autobiographies of the next three hundred years conformed to them.\n\nAnother autobiography of the period is \"De vita propria\", by the Italian mathematician, physician and astrologer Gerolamo Cardano (1574).\n\nIt is often claimed that the earliest known autobiography in English is the early 15th-century \"Book of Margery Kempe\", describing among other things Kempe's pilgrimage to the Holy Land and visit to Rome although it is, at best, only a partial autobiography and arguably more a memoir of religious experiences. The book remained in manuscript and was not published until 1936.\n\nPossibly the first publicly available autobiography written in English was Captan John Smith's autobiography published in 1630 which was regarded by many as not much more than a collection of tall tales told by someone of doubtful veracity. This changed with the publication of Philip Barbour's definitive biography in 1964 which, amongst other things, established independent factual bases for many of Smith's \"tall tales\", many of which could not have been known by Smith at the time of writing unless he was actually present at the events recounted. \n\nOther notable English autobiographies of the 17th century include those of Lord Herbert of Cherbury (1643, published 1764) and John Bunyan (\"Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners\", 1666).\n\nJarena Lee (1783 – 1864), was the first African American woman to have a published biography in the United States.\n\nFollowing the trend of Romanticism, which greatly emphasized the role and the nature of the individual, and in the footsteps of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's \"Confessions\", a more intimate form of autobiography, exploring the subject's emotions, came into fashion. Stendhal's autobiographical writings of the 1830s, \"The Life of Henry Brulard\" and \"Memoirs of an Egotist\", are both avowedly influenced by Rousseau. An English example is William Hazlitt's \"Liber Amoris\" (1823), a painful examination of the writer's love-life.\n\nWith the rise of education, cheap newspapers and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop, and the beneficiaries of this were not slow to cash in on this by producing autobiographies. It became the expectation—rather than the exception—that those in the public eye should write about themselves—not only writers such as Charles Dickens (who also incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and Anthony Trollope, but also politicians (e.g. Henry Brooks Adams), philosophers (e.g. John Stuart Mill), churchmen such as Cardinal Newman, and entertainers such as P. T. Barnum. Increasingly, in accordance with romantic taste, these accounts also began to deal, amongst other topics, with aspects of childhood and upbringing—far removed from the principles of \"Cellinian\" autobiography.\nFrom the 17th century onwards, \"scandalous memoirs\" by supposed libertines, serving a public taste for titillation, have been frequently published. Typically pseudonymous, they were (and are) largely works of fiction written by ghostwriters. So-called \"autobiographies\" of modern professional athletes and media celebrities—and to a lesser extent about politicians, generally written by a ghostwriter, are routinely published. Some celebrities, such as Naomi Campbell, admit to not having read their \"autobiographies\".. Some sensationalist autobiographies such as James Frey's \"A Million Little Pieces\" have been publicly exposed as having embellished or fictionalized significant details of the authors' lives.\n\nAutobiography has become an increasingly popular and widely accessible form. \"A Fortunate Life\" by Albert Facey (1979) has become an Australian literary classic. With the critical and commercial success in the United States of such memoirs as \"Angela’s Ashes\" and \"The Color of Water\", more and more people have been encouraged to try their hand at this genre.\n\nA genre where the \"claim for truth\" overlaps with fictional elements though the work still purports to be autobiographical is autofiction.\n\nFurthermore, in the latter years new impulses at the Autobiographical genre arrived from the italian poet and critic Menotti Lerro. In contrast to what Philippe Lejeune asserts Lerro claims that if the truth can only be grasped in a synchronic manner (also according to postmodernist philosophers point of view) and through fragments, why not entrust this narrative to the verse? Why not consider the role of “autobiography in verse” equally dignified as a form of self-narration? For the critic this, perhaps, is the necessary leap: through poetry it is possible to get the most dramatic and highest form of autobiographical narrative.\n\n"}
{"id": "174943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174943", "title": "Biographical evaluation", "text": "Biographical evaluation\n\nBiographical evaluation (), literally meaning\" 'Knowledge of Men' \"but more commonly understood as the \"Science of Narration\", refers to a discipline of Islamic religious studies within hadith terminology in which the narrators of hadith are evaluated. Its goal is to distinguish authentic and reliable hadiths from unreliable hadiths in establishing the credibility of the narrators, using both historic and religious knowledge. \"`Ilm ar-rijal\" is synonymous with what is commonly referred to as \"al-jarḥ wa al-taʻdīl\" (discrediting and accrediting) – the criticism and declared acceptance of hadith narrators.\n\nIn his \"Introduction to the Science of Hadith\", Ibn al-Salah, a renowned hadith specialist, explained the importance of the study of hadith narrators. Introducing the chapter entitled, 'Recognizing the trustworthy, reliable narrators and those who are weak and unreliable,' Ibn al-Salah said, \"This is from the most distinguished and noble types (of hadith study) as it results in recognizing the authenticity of a hadith or its weakness.\" He then explained that any criticism directed at a narrator was permissible due to the \"maintenance of the Shariah, purging it of any mistakes or misinformation\".\n\nStressing the importance of biographical evaluation, Ali ibn al-Madini, an early authority on the subject, said, \"Knowing the narrators is half of knowledge.\"\n\nThe Qur'anic verses are numerous that praise the Companions and criticize the hypocrites, both as a group and specific individuals from amongst them–as well as criticism of specific individuals other than the hypocrites. The most well-known of these is a verse of the Quran stating, \"O you who believe, if a wrongdoer should approach you conveying information, then verify that so as not to fall into ignorance thus regretting what you have done.\" While this verse was revealed regarding a particular individual, it is a general principle. Following this example, were the Prophet and then His Companions.\n\nWhile many Companions narrated hadith, according to Ahmad ibn Hanbal there were six who were the most prolific narrators of them, who lived long lives enabling them narrate to a large extent. They were: Abu Huraira, Abdullah ibn Umar, Aisha, Jabir ibn Abdullah, Ibn Abbas and Anas ibn Malik with Abu Huraira being the most prolific of them. According to Ibn al-Salah the most prolific narrators from the Companions was Abu Huraira followed by Ibn Abbas.\n\nIn spite of the Companions' efforts in narrating their hadith, there was no need for them to evaluate each other's narrating capabilities or trustworthiness. This is because, as Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi said, that Allah and his Prophet declared the Companions to be upright and trustworthy, and, therefore, there is no need to investigate their reliability, however, one must investigate the condition of those after them. However, there are many established narrations originating from the Companions praising some of the Followers with some criticism of specific individuals from them.\n\nAs for the Followers, the generation following the Companions, their praise of narrators was plentiful, while disparagement from them was seldom. Those narrators who were criticized from the Followers were not criticized for fabricating hadith, but, instead, due to heresy, such as the Kharijites, or due to weak memory or due to their condition as narrators being unknown.\n\nEvaluating the narrators of hadith began in the generation following that of the Companions based upon the statement of Muhammad Ibn Sirin, \"They did not previously inquire about the \"isnad\". However, after the turmoil occurred they would say, 'Name for us your narrators.' So the people of the Sunnah would have their hadith accepted and the people of innovation would not.\" The \"turmoil\" referred to is the conflicting ideologies of the Kharijites and extreme Shias that had emerged at the time of the third \"khalifas\" Uthman ibn Affan's assassination and the social unrest of the Kharijites in opposition to the succeeding rulers, Ali and Muawiyah. The death of Uthman was in the year 35 after the migration.\n\nIn the following generation, that after the Followers, and afterward, the weak, unacceptable narrators increased in number, necessitating that a group of scholars clarify the condition of the narrators and distinguishing any narrations that were not authentic.\n\nAccording to Ibn al-Salah, quoting an early religious authority, the first to specialize in the study of hadith narrators was Shuʿba Ibn al-Ḥajjāj, followed by Yahya ibn Sa'id al-Qattan and then Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Yahya ibn Ma'in. Al-Bulqini added some names to the aforementioned: Ali ibn al-Madini and 'Amr ibn 'Ali al-Fallas, and then mentioned Malik ibn Anas and Hisham ibn Urwah as having preceded them in evaluating narrators.\n\nA hadith is subject to criticism on the basis of two matters. The first relates to the continuity of the hadith's chain of narration; if there is discontinuity between two or more narrators, that hadith is criticized on this basis as discussed in depth in the hadith terminology article. The second relates to criticism of a narrator, or more, in the chain of narration of a particular hadith.\n\nHadith narrators are evaluated in light of two qualities in determining the overall grading of a hadith. These qualities are derived from the definition of a hadith that is \"sahih\" constituting two of its five conditions. The first, uprightness (\"al-ʻadālah\"), is defined as the ability an individual possesses to adhere to moralistic decorum (\"al-taqwā\") and maintaining proper social graces (\"al-murūʼah\"). The second, precision (\"al-ḍabṭ\"), is of two types, the first is pertaining to memorization and the second to writing. Precision in memorization (\"ḍabṭ al-ṣadr\") refers to the ability to retain the specified information, recalling and conveying it at will. Precision in writing (\"ḍabṭ al-kitāb\") is the preservation of the written information from the time it was heard until its transmission.\n\nThe grounds upon which a narrator is subject to criticism are numerous some relating to moral uprightness and others to precision. Ibn Ḥajr identified and enumerated ten qualities in which a narrator could be criticized. Five relate to trustworthiness and the other five to precision; however, he presented these ten qualities in order according to severity:\n\nHadith scholars of the past employed various methods by which to evaluate the narrating abilities of a narrator. From these means are the following:\n\nAs a result of the evaluation of narrators, each scholar would then conclude by describing the standing of each narrator. A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator, with some variation in usage of terms between the individual evaluators. These are divided into two categories, those terms that constitute praise (\"taʻdīl\") and those that constitute criticism (\"jarḥ\"). al-Suyūṭī gathered the various terms and arranged them in order of strength. He quoted four levels of strength for praise from Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah, adding that al-Dhahabi and Abd al-Rahim ibn al-Husain al-'Iraqi added an additional level and Ibn Ḥajr one above that. Thus according to al-Suyūṭī, there are six levels of praise. Similarly, al-Suyūṭī described six levels of terms used to criticize a narrator; he arranged them beginning with the least severe and concluding with the most severe criticism.<ref name=\"Tadrib 1/573-80\">\"Tadrib al-Rawi\", by al-Suyūṭī, vol. 1, pp. 573-8, \"Dar al-'Asimah\", Riyadh, first edition, 2003.</ref>\n\n\n\nCollections of narrator biographies are sometimes general and sometimes specific to particular categories of narrators. Among the most common of these categories are:\n\n\nBooks particular to the Companions:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character's real name is used. They differ from films \"based on a true story\" or \"historical drama films\" in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person's life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives.\n\nBecause the figures portrayed are actual people, whose actions and characteristics are known to the public (or at least historically documented), biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses. Ben Kingsley, Johnny Depp, Jim Carrey, and Jamie Foxx all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics: Ben Kingsley as Mahatma Gandhi in \"Gandhi\" (1982), Depp as Ed Wood in \"Ed Wood\" (1994), Carrey as Andy Kaufman in \"Man on the Moon\" (1999), and Foxx as Ray Charles in \"Ray\" (2004).\n\nIn rare cases, sometimes called auto biopics, the subject of the film plays himself or herself: Jackie Robinson in \"The Jackie Robinson Story\"; Muhammad Ali in \"The Greatest\"; Audie Murphy in \"To Hell and Back\"; Patty Duke in \"Call Me Anna\"; Bob Mathias in \"The Bob Mathias Story\", Arlo Guthrie in \"Alice's Restaurant\"; Fantasia Barrino in \"\"; and Howard Stern in \"Private Parts\".\n\nBiopic scholars include George F. Custen of the College of Staten Island and Dennis P. Bingham of Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis. Custen, in \"Bio/Pics: How Hollywood Constructed Public History\" (1992), regards the genre as having died with the Hollywood studio era, and in particular, Darryl F. Zanuck. On the other hand, Bingham's 2010 study \"Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre\" shows how it perpetuates as a codified genre using many of the same tropes used in the studio era that has followed a similar trajectory as that shown by Rick Altman in his study, \"Film/Genre\". Bingham also addresses the male biopic and the female biopic as distinct genres from each other, the former generally dealing with great accomplishments, the latter generally dealing with female victimization. Ellen Cheshire's \"Bio-Pics: a life in pictures\" (2014) examines UK/US films from the 1990s and 2000s. Each chapter reviews key films linked by profession and concludes with further viewing list. Christopher Robé has also written on the gender norms that underlie the biopic in his article, \"Taking Hollywood Back\" in the 2009 issue of \"Cinema Journal\". \n\nCasting can be controversial for biographical films. Casting is often a balance between similarity in looks and ability to portray the characteristics of the person. Anthony Hopkins felt that he should not have played Richard Nixon in \"Nixon\" because of a lack of resemblance between the two. The casting of John Wayne as Genghis Khan in \"The Conqueror\" was objected to because of the American Wayne being cast as the Mongol warlord. Egyptian critics criticized the casting of Louis Gossett, Jr., an African American actor, as Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in the 1982 TV miniseries \"Sadat\". Also, some objected to the casting of Jennifer Lopez in \"Selena\" because she is a New York City native of Puerto Rican descent while Selena was Mexican-American.\n\n"}

She may be identical with Cleopatra V.\n\nThere were at least two, perhaps three Ptolemaic women called \"Cleopatra Tryphaena\":\n\nTryphaena was a sister of Ptolemy IX Lathyros, Ptolemy X Alexander I, Cleopatra IV and Cleopatra Selene. If this \"Tryphaena\" also bore the name \"Cleopatra\", has not been attested. This Tryphaena may have been born in early 140 or 141 BC. She married Antiochus VIII Grypus, king of Syria, in 124 BC, and bore him five sons: Seleucus VI Epiphanes, the twin Antiochus XI Epiphanes and Philip I Philadelphus, Demetrius III Eucaerus, and Antiochus XII Dionysus. The couple also had a daughter called Laodice. Tryphaena was killed in Antioch (Greek: Αντιόχεια), capital of Syria, by Antiochus IX Cyzicenus, as a revenge for his own wife's (Cleopatra IV) death by the orders of her sister Tryphaena (in 111 BC).\n\nCleopatra V Tryphaena was a Queen of Egypt until her mysterious disappearance from the records in 69 BC. If, as some scholars believe, her disappearance is attributable to her death, then it must be assumed that she had a daughter also called \"Cleopatra Tryphaena\".\n\nShe is called \"Cleopatra VI Tryphaena\" by some modern historians and she would have been an older sister of the famous Cleopatra VII. If so, her birth year would correctly be c. 75 BC. The only instance she is mentioned in historical sources is by Porphyry. He says that when Ptolemy XII fled to Rome to avoid an uprising in Alexandria against him (in 58 BC), Berenice IV took control of Ptolemaic Egypt and ruled alongside her sister, Cleopatra Tryphaena. Strabo, however, states that Ptolemy had three daughters, of whom only the eldest (Berenice) was legitimate. This suggests that the Cleopatra Tryphaena referred to by Porphyry may have been Ptolemy's wife, not his daughter. Some, though not all, experts now identify Cleopatra VI with Cleopatra V of Egypt, Ptolemy's wife.\n"}

Charles was the first sole monarch of Spain, inheriting the kingdoms first united by his maternal grandparents, Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon (the Catholic Monarchs). From his father, Philip I of Castile, he inherited the Burgundian Netherlands, which came from his paternal grandmother, Mary of Burgundy. Finally, on the death of his paternal grandfather, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, he inherited the Habsburg lands in Austria. His coat of arms, representing much of the land he inherited, is blazoned as follows:\n\nThe first and fourth quarters represents holdings derived from the Spanish crowns: that is, the quartered arms of Castile and Leon themselves quartered with the quartered arms of Aragon and Sicily. After 1520 the Aragon/Sicily quartering also incorporated the arms of Jerusalem, Naples, and Navarre.\n\nThe second and third quarters represents holdings derived from Charles's Austrian and Burgundian inheritance: these quarters shows further quartering of Austria, Duchy of Burgundy, County of Burgundy, and the Duchy of Brabant, with the escutcheon in the middle showing Flanders on the left and Tyrol on the right.\n\nThe Granada pomegranate is represented at the bottom between the two.\n\nIn 1477, the territory of the Duchy of Burgundy had been conquered and annexed by France. In the same year, Mary \"the Rich\", the last Burgundian duke's only child, had married Charles' grandfather Maximilian, giving the Habsburgs control of the remainder of the Burgundian Inheritance: although the territory of the Duchy of Burgundy itself remained in the hands of France, the Habsburgs remained in control of the title of Duke of Burgundy and the other parts of the Burgundian inheritance, notably the Low Countries and the Free County of Burgundy in the Holy Roman Empire. They often used the term Burgundy to refer to it until the late 18th century, when the Austrian Netherlands were lost to the French Republic. Although Charles V had inherited the grand mastership of numerous orders, the only order which he habitually wore and awarded was that of the Burgundian Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\n"}
{"id": "2010320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2010320", "title": "Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI", "text": "Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI\n\nThe personal papal coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI was designed by Archbishop Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo (who was later created a Cardinal) soon after the papal election in 2005.\n\nThe shape of the shield varies from artist to artist. In the official rendering of the coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI the shape chosen is that of a chalice.\n\nThe blazon (the written description, in terminology peculiar to heraldry, of the contents of the coat of arms) given on the Vatican website is as follows:\nThis means, in non-technical English:\n\nNote 1. A mantle outside the shield does not normally contain \"charges\" (an heraldic term for objects). Within the shield, as here, it is a religious symbol, and indicates ideals inspired in monastic spirituality. It is also a reference to the Order of Saint Benedict.\n\nNote 2. The black bands tying the red pack is one of several existing contraventions of the heraldic rule of tincture, which in general does not allow the placing of colour on colour or metal (gold or silver) on another metal.\n\nThe charges of the arms — the Moor's head, Corbinian's bear, and scallop — appeared on Ratzinger's previous coat of arms, used when he was Archbishop of Munich and Freising. However, they relate not only to his origins, but also to his trust in God, as well his calling to spread this faith to others.\n\nThe symbolism of the scallop shell is multiple. Saint Augustine is said to have been walking along the seashore, meditating on the unfathomable mystery of the Holy Trinity. A boy was using a shell to pour sea water into a little hole. When Augustine asked him what he was doing, he replied, \"I am emptying the sea into this hole.\" Thus did Augustine understand that man would never penetrate to the depths of the mystery of God. While a doctoral candidate in 1953, Fr. Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on \"The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church\", and the shell therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this great Doctor of the Church.\n\nThe scallop shell is also an allusion to the Sacrament of Holy Baptism. In the Roman Catholic Church, a sea shell is often used to pour water over the head of the child being baptized. Thus, a sea shell is used to evoke the imagery of this rite which is fundamental to the Christian life.\n\nThe shell also stands for pilgrimage. When topped with a scallop shell a pilgrim's staff, or \"Jacob's staff\", is the sign of a pilgrim. In Church art it is a symbol of the apostle Saint James the Great, and his sanctuary at Santiago de Compostela in Spain, perhaps the principal place of pilgrimage during the Middle Ages. This symbol also alludes to \"the pilgrim people of God\", a title for the Church which Joseph Ratzinger championed at the Second Vatican Council as \"peritus\" (theological adviser) to Cardinals Josef Frings of Cologne and Julius Döpfner of Munich-Freising (his episcopal predecessor). When he became Archbishop he took the shell in his coat of arms. It is also found in the insignia of the Schottenkloster in Regensburg, where the major seminary of that diocese is located, a place where Benedict taught as a professor of theology.\n\nFinally, the pilgrimage symbolism of the shell may also refer both to the reconfigured role of the pope as not only ruler, but also pilgrim among the peoples and nations of the world. Pope Paul VI—who created Joseph Ratzinger as a cardinal in 1977—was often called the \"Pilgrim Pope\" for his ground-breaking travels to the Holy Land, India, the United States, Colombia, the Philippines, and elsewhere. This precedent was greatly elaborated upon by Pope John Paul II with his historic trips, numbering over a hundred. As a result, Benedict may be paying homage to these men and the new role for the papacy.\n\nThe Moor's head is a heraldic charge associated with Wörth, Upper Bavaria, Germany. The origin of the Moor's head in Freising is not entirely known. Typically facing to the heraldic right, the viewer's left (\"dexter\" in heraldic terms) and depicted in natural brown colour \"caput Aethiopum\" (literally \"Ethiopian head\") with red lips, crown and collar. This is the ancient emblem of the Diocese of Freising, founded in the 8th century, which became a Metropolitan Archdiocese with the name of München und Freising in 1818, subsequent to the Concordat between Pius VII and King Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria (5 June 1817).\n\nThe Moor's head is fairly common in European heraldry. It still appears today in the arms of Sardinia and Corsica, as well as in the blazons of various noble families. Italian heraldry, however, usually depicts the Moor wearing a white band around his head instead of a crown, indicating a slave who has been freed; whereas in German heraldry the Moor is shown wearing a crown. The Moor's head is common in the Bavarian tradition and is known as the \"caput Ethiopicum\" or the \"Moor of Freising\".\n\nA legend states that while traveling to Rome, Saint Corbinian's pack horse was killed by a bear. He commanded the bear to carry the load. Once he arrived, he released it from his service, and it returned to Bavaria. The implication is that \"Christianity tamed and domesticated the ferocity of paganism and thus laid the foundations for a great civilization in the Duchy of Bavaria.\" At the same time, Corbinian's bear, as God's beast of burden, symbolizes the weight of office that Benedict carried.\n\nTraditionally, a pope's coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered papal tiara with lappets and the crossed keys of Saint Peter with a cord. No other objects nor a motto was added. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind on heaven and earth (). Pope Benedict's arms maintain the keys, but replace the tiara with a mitre and add a pallium. However, the tiara and keys remain the symbol of the papacy, and appear on the coat of arms of the Holy See and (reversed) on the flag of Vatican City.\n\nIn Pope Benedict's arms, the tiara is replaced with a silver mitre with three gold stripes. These stripes recall the three crowns of the tiara, which came to represent the three powers of the Bishop of Rome: Orders, Jurisdiction and Magisterium. The stripes preserve that meaning and are joined at the centre to show their unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for “sovereign” (王).\n\nThe pallium with red crosses is also a new addition. It represents a bishop's role of being pastor of the flock entrusted to him by Christ. The form of the pallium included in the coat of arms recalls that used by metropolitan archbishops (but with black crosses) rather than the much larger pallium worn by Pope Benedict at his inauguration.\n\nSome have voiced objection to Pope Benedict's use of the mitre and pallium in his coat of arms, and the absence of the traditional papal tiara.\n\nTheir arguments include:\nRegardless of the validity of such arguments, the Pope, as supreme legislator and interpreter of Church law, had full authority to decide the form of his armorial bearings.\n\nSome claimed that Benedict's arms could still properly be rendered with the tiara and keys and without the pallium. This was done in the Vatican gardens behind St. Peter's Basilica, viewable from atop the dome. Shortly after the death of John Paul II, the contents of his shield were removed from the flowerbed, but the tiara was left in place. After the election of Benedict XVI, the gardeners put the design of the new Pope's arms within the shield, but rather than digging up the flowers depicting the tiara and replacing them with a mitre design, they left the tiara in place and omitted the pallium.\n\nIn a 2013 interview, Cardinal Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo, designer of the coat of arms, said that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms now that he was no longer the pontiff. “The problem now is whether the Pope Emeritus can keep that same coat of arms or not,”. “And as a person who has always dedicated himself to this, I say ‘no,’”. He drew up a new coat of arms, which he believed could be used now by the former pontiff. He moved the big keys of Saint Peter from the back of the coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller. “But this is only a proposal, it isn’t official,” Montezemolo qualified.\n\n"}

The Welsh Triads name her one of the three most beautiful maids of the Isle of Britain. Born in Penllyn in Powys, Wales, Creirwy (also known as \"Llywy\") has a dark, hideous brother named Morfran and a foster brother, Gwion Bach (who would become the bard Taliesin). She does not appear in the stories about Afagddu and Taliesin.\n\nCeltic researcher Edward Davies deemed Creirwy \"the Proserpine of the British Druids\"—also comparing her mother Ceridwen to Ceres of Roman myth. Mythographer Jacob Bryant theorized that Creirwy and Ceridwen were essentially \"the same mystical personage.\"\n\nHer name possibly means \"sacred symbol of the egg\" (i.e., \"mundane egg\", \"adder stone\") from the Welsh elements \"creir\" \"a token, jewel, sacred object, relic, talisman, treasure, richly decorated article, object of admiration or love, darling, safeguard, strength, hand-bell, church-bell\" and \"wy\" \"egg\". For the ancient Druids, the mundane egg allegedly symbolized chaos, the beginning of all things, and upon it oaths were administered.\n\nThis was also the name of a 6th-century Breton saint from Wales, daughter of Saint Gwen the Triple-Breasted and sister of the great regional saint Winwaloe. According to hagiographies of Winwaloe, Saint Creirwy (; ) as a young girl had one or both eyes gouged out by a wild goose, but Winwaloe retrieved the eyeball(s) from the gander's belly and returned it/them to his little sister's orbit(s), and Creirwy's eyesight was miraculously restored. Thus, she is allegedly a patron saint of the blind. The story is memorialized in a 16th-century statue in Keravézan, Saint-Frégant; known as \"la fontaine de Saint Guénolé\", it depicts Winwaloe (Guénolé) holding the goose and the eyeball, with little Creirwy at his feet.\n\nHowever, the legend is dismissed by Baring-Gould and Fisher, who say it originated with an expression that \"Creirwe\" used; supposedly she would often say she \"owed her eye to Winwaloe\", but in reference to a much more ordinary childhood event, in which her brother stepped in and protected her when a wild goose flew at Creirwy and almost pecked out her eye.\n\n"}

All other occurrences of the name refer to the daughter. The more familiar form \"Domentzia\" (Δομεντζία) is given by Theophanes the Confessor. Anastasius Bibliothecarius, who translated the work of Theophanes to Latin, renders the name \"Domnentzia\". The later historian Joannes Zonaras gives the name as \"Domnentia\" (Δομνεντία), while Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos gives her name as \"Dysmenziane\", indicating that both women used the same name.\n\nPhocas and his family were likely of Thraco-Roman origin. The husband of the elder Domentzia is unknown.She had three known sons: Phocas, Comentiolus and Domentziolus. The latter seems to have been \"magister officiorum\" by 610. A grandson, also named Domentziolus, was granted the title of \"curopalates\" on the ascension of Phocas to the throne in 602.\n\nThe younger Domentzia was a daughter of Phocas and Leontia. In 607, she married the general Priscus, who served as \"comes excubitorum\", commander of the Excubitors bodyguard. As she was the only known child of the Emperor, the marriage effectively made Priscus an heir apparent to the throne. Her husband fell into disfavour however when the citizenry of Constantinople began erecting statues in their honour.\n\nHer marriage took place in the palace of Marina, named after its original owner, a daughter of Arcadius and Aelia Eudoxia. A chariot racing event was arranged to be held in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, in honor of the newlyweds. The leaders of the Blues (\"Vénetoi\") and the Greens (\"Prásinoi\") racing factions (\"demoi\") decided to honor the occasion by erecting statues of the royal family. Thus they placed images of Phocas, Leontia, Domentzia, and Priscus in the Hippodrome. The images of the reigning imperial couple belonged there by tradition, but the latter two implied that Priscus was the heir or co-emperor of Phocas. Phocas was enraged at the implication and ordered the depictions of his daughter and son-in-law to be destroyed.\n\nPhocas further treated the matter as an attempted coup d'état, demanding further investigation of the matter, arresting the demarchs responsible with accusations of treason. While their lives may have been spared due to popular demand, Phocas likely viewed Priscus himself as the culprit, and seems to have started viewing his son-in-law as a potential rival. By alienating Priscus however, Phocas undermined his own hold on the throne. By 608, John of Antioch reports Priscus initiating contact with Heraclius the Elder, the Exarch of Africa, and instigating the revolt that would eventually remove Phocas from power.\n\n"}

{"id": "27975085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27975085", "title": "Eight Tigers", "text": "Eight Tigers\n\nThe Eight Tigers (), sometimes referred to as the Gang of Eight (八党/八黨), were a powerful group of eunuchs (宦官) that controlled the Chinese imperial court during the reign of the Ming Dynasty Zhengde Emperor (r. 1505-1521 CE).\n\nLed by Liu Jin, the remaining members of the coterie were Ma Yongcheng (馬永成), Gao Feng (高鳳), Luo Xiang (羅祥), Wei Bin (魏彬), Qiu Ju (丘聚), Gu Dayong (谷大用) and Zhang Yong (張永).\n\nEunuchs are castrated men who have often been used as servants in imperial and noble households, due to the belief that they would not be distracted by or a danger to women. Eunuchs were often utilized in the imperial household as harem guards and attendants. The harems were considered necessary in order to help produce a male heir, and the eunuchs were trusted protectors.\n\nBefore the Ming Dynasty, eunuchs had long been a powerful political force in China. In the Tang Dynasty, from 821 until the dynasty's end, eunuchs were \"the real power holders\". They controlled the Imperial Guard and the Palace Secretariat, chose seven out of eight emperors, and possibly killed two emperors.\n\nThe first Ming emperor, Hongwu (1328-1398), was worried about the power of eunuchs. He erected a tablet that said, \"Eunuchs must have nothing to do with administration\", and he worked to disempower them. He warned, \"Anyone using eunuchs as his eyes and ears will be blind and deaf\". Despite these measures, many of emperors who followed Hongwu were more willing to leave ruling to the eunuchs, and the Ming Dynasty became the peak of eunuch influence. By the end of the 15th century, there were 10,000 eunuchs working in the palace.\n\nIn addition to close access to the emperor and his wives and concubines, they were often trusted with imperial sons. Oftentimes this trust extended to eunuchs being given command as palace guards, military commanders, or imperial inspectors. They controlled the court's luxury workshops and managed the tributes from the provinces and foreign countries, and they were often made the heads of official missions abroad. This power gave the eunuchs many chances to become rich through graft. They also eventually controlled the secret police, which meant they could control the nation through blackmail and corruption.\n\nEmperor Zhengde ascended to the imperial throne in 1505, aged 14, after the death of his father.\n\nFrom the early days of his rule it was clear that the young emperor distrusted government officials and was partial to eunuchs who took an active role in raising him. The emperor's inner circle consisted of 8 eunuchs who served him when he was still heir apparent and became his personal staff shortly after Zhengde began his reign. Shortly after the emperor's ascension to the throne, the Eight Tigers swiftly took control of important positions not only in the imperial court but in the secret service and the army. In addition to this, they appointed their relatives to influential ranks and roles in the dynasty.\n\nOne of the eunuchs, Liu Jin, who would emerge as the leader of the group, was put in charge of palace music in early 1506, putting him in position of control over the emperor's entertainment. He excelled in this role, coming up with ideas for pastimes that proved to be much to the emperor's liking.\n\nSeveral groups within the imperial elites were alarmed with Liu Jin's promotion and the group's apparent influence over the young ruler, and so they began plotting against the Eight Tigers.\n\nThree grand secretaries, inherited from the emperor's father and supported by the ministers, demanded the group's execution, while senior eunuchs insisted on banishment as a punishment that the Emperor would be more likely to consider. A joint plan was finally agreed upon and set in motion with a direct petition to the emperor, asking for Liu Jin's execution and banishment of the other members of the group from the imperial court.\n\nLiu Jin was notified of the plot by one of his agents and led seven other eunuchs to ask for mercy before Emperor Zhengde on October 27, 1506.\n\nThe emperor heeded their plea, and on the following day it was announced that he would decide upon their fate at his leisure. All but one grand secretaries resigned immediately upon hearing the news and a number of senior officials followed suit.\n\nThe plot was averted and most checks on the eunuchs' power eliminated with it.\n\nLiu Jin proceeded to retaliate against those who spoke out against him, leading to a string of dismissals, incidents of torture and imprisonments of a number of high government figures.\n\nIn February 1507, twenty-one officials who had protested the dismissal of the senior grand secretaries were beaten and reduced to the status of commoners.\n\nBy the end of 1507 very few in the palace were willing to challenge the reign of terror of Liu Jin, who was known to many at the time as \"Emperor Liu\", and his fellow eunuchs.\n\nLiu Jin was from the area of Xingping, Shaanxi. He was born on February 28, 1451 into the Tan family. His original name was Tan Jin. He considered himself very eloquent, so he decided to become a eunuch, as he considered that his best path to success. After becoming a eunuch, he was adopted by another eunuch named Liu, and changed his name to Liu Jin.\n\nHe began working in the imperial palace in the 1480s, where he began to consolidate the group that later became the Eight Tigers. In 1492, he was removed from his post at the Chenghua emperor's tomb to serve the new heir apparent, the future Zhengde emperor. Liu became a favorite of his, and he became the head of the bureau of bells and drums after Zhengde's rise to the throne in 1505. From there, Liu Jin gradually gained more power and influence, and became known as the leader of the Eight Tigers.\n\nMost Ming and modern historians regard Liu Jin's rise to power as tyrannic and describe him as \"rapacious, cruel, and wily\". He became the Head of the Directorate of Ceremonies, in which role he was notorious for altering rescripts in transit to and from the emperor. This meant he essentially controlled what the emperor knew and what the emperor approved. Later, he became the chief of the imperial staff, and became known for taking bribes from senior officials. For example, he required the thirteen provincial administration officials to pay him 20,000 taels of silver when they visited the capital, three times a year. He also was very influential in the military. At the height of his power, all military actions had to be approved by him, giving him more power than the generals.\n\nAfter the re-establishment of the Western Depot under Gu Dayong, Liu Jin convinced the emperor to create the \"Neixinchang\", or Inner Branch Depot, which would supervise direct dangers to the throne and the emperor's safety. This Depot was made supervisor to the other two, the East and West Depots, thus consolidating Liu Jin's power. The depot persecuted many of the opponents to Liu Jin and his policies. It is estimated that more than one thousand people were killed by the Inner Branch Depot.\n\nFrom the money he gained through corruption, he went on to flaunt his glory and wealth by building a palace in his hometown.\n\nDuring the fall of his reign, officials were sent to detain him and confiscate his belongings. During the house search, the officials found a total of 12,057,800 taels of gold and 259,583,600 taels of silver, as well as gems, false seals, and fans with concealed knives, ostensibly for use in his plot against the emperor. He was ordered to be executed by the punishment of death by a thousand cuts. He was cut 3,357 times over a period of three days.\n\nZhang Yong, a native of Xincheng, Baoding, is fairly absent in historical records until his time in the Eight Tigers. During Emperor Zhengde's reign, he took control of many important posts and developed a tight bond between him and the Emperor. By doing this, he began to disregard the government's policies and plans. For instance, despite heavy opposition from the Ministry of Revenue, he successfully acquired some privatised land. He controlled the Eastern Depot, one of the secret police and intelligence operations that reported to the emperor. He also was given control of the Shen-Chi garrison, which had been established to practice with firearms. In 1510, Zhang Yong was appointed Supreme Commander of the military and sent to put down the Prince of Anhua's rebellion.\n\nDuring Liu Jin's reign, Zhang Yong was his right-hand in the battlefield and at home. He did not get along with Liu Jin, but could not be removed from power due to his military prowess. He conspired with Yang Yiqing to remove Liu Jin from power, and became the most powerful member of the remaining Eight Tiger's after Liu Jin's death.\n\nIn October 1511, he asked the emperor to allow him to select 6,000 troops from the Capital Garrison reserves to be specially trained as assault forces for times of crisis. The emperor approved the request due to his need to fight the rebel forces of Liu the Sixth.\n\nIn July 1514, Zhang Yong was put in charge of an operation to defend against Mongol invasion.\n\nHowever, after Emperor Zhengde's death, his status fell to that of a regular eunuch, and he was ordered to retire by the new emperor, Jiajing. However, by 1529 he had begun to regain some power, and was made the Grand Secretary of Integrated Divisions. He died shortly after this appointment.\n\nAfter the fall of Liu Jin, Gao Feng was made one of the new heads of the Directorate of Ceremonies, along with Wei Bin. Besides this, information on Gao Feng is limited.\n\nMa Yongcheng was from the Bazhou or Wenan area. He grew rich off of the bandit situation, accepting bribes from them so they could gain favor with the emperor. Ma Yongcheng took control of the Eastern Depot, which operated as a spy and secret police agency during the Ming dynasty.\n\nGu Dayong is known for his place at the head of the Western Depot, a secret-police style intelligence agency. Emperor Zhengde reopened it in 1506 after 25 years of dormancy, with Gu Dayong as its leader, due to his desire to have a more comprehensive intelligence agency. The Western Depot was closed down after Liu Jin's arrest, although Emperor Zhengde still considered Gu Dayong quite favorably.\n\nIn August 1511, Gu Dayong was appointed overall superintendent of military affairs, and he led a group of troops south of the capital to fight the rebel forces of the Liu brothers. As a reward for defeating the rebellion, his younger and older brothers became earls.\n\nMembers of his family assumed important positions and roles inside the dynasty. For instance, Gu Dayong's father was given the right to command the Embroidered Uniform Guard alongside Zhang Young's father.\n\nHe also worked in charitable construction projects in Peking. In 1508, he donated a large bell to the Daoist Baiyunguan (White Cloud Temple), which had built a new hall. In 1510 and 1512, he restored the Southern Park's Lingtongmiao, the Yanfasi outside of the city's western gate, and the Huguosi (so that it could house Central Asian monks). He used donations from the emperor and the imperial family to carry out these projects, which seem to have been authorized and requested by the emperor. Gu Dayong also seems to have chosen at least one of his one projects, restoring an old temple in the far Western Hills, turning it into \"a bright and glittering precinct\".\n\nAfter the death of the Zhengde Emperor, he was temporarily honored, before being banished to Nanking, where he died.\n\nHe was in charge of the Eastern Depot, but lost his job after the arrest of Liu Jin. He does not have any of his own records, but is only mentioned sometimes in biographies of the other Eight Tigers. Besides this, information on Qiu Ju is limited.\n\nWei Bin was given command of the \"san qian ying\" (三千營) garrison, which was made of 3,000 barbarians who had surrendered to the throne. Wei Bin is also known for building the Hongshangshi. He used divination to find a suitable burial place in Peking's southern suburbs, and built Hongshangshi there in 1514. The land was officially endowed by the emperor, and the temple became known as Sir Wei's Temple. It was famous for its crab-apple orchards and other unusual trees. After Liu Jin's execution, Wei Bin was made one of the heads of the Directorate of Ceremonial, along with Gao Feng. Wei Bin was made to retire upon the ascension of the Jiajing Emperor.\n\nThere is almost no available information on Luo Xiang, although it is known that he was a member of the Eight Tigers.\n\nAt the beginning of the Zhengde Emperor's reign, Liu Jin and seven other eunuchs who had served him were added to his personal staff. He ignored the advice of his grand secretaries, who told him to limit the roles of his eunuchs in government. Having been raised by eunuchs, he liked them, and, starting in 1506, he gave them important financial and military roles. He enjoyed spending time with them, practicing riding, archery, wrestling, and music. Liu Jin was responsible for palace entertainment, and \"provided dancing, wrestling matches, a menagerie of exotic animals, and of course music\". He also encouraged the Zhengde Emperor to leave the palace in disguise to explore the streets of Peking, which the emperor grew to love. He was thus disinterested in ruling his own government, so he began to leave matters of state solely to his eunuchs.\n\nSince he didn't want to deal with manners of state, he left most of the empire's affairs to the eunuchs. For instance, he needed money to implement various imperial projects, but did not want to use his personal funds, so he listened to and implemented the ideas of the Eight Tigers, which mostly meant raising new taxes.\n\nAlthough Zhengde spent all his money and time on palace entertainments, the Eight Tigers never criticized him and always obeyed his wishes, which caused him to trust them greatly. One example of this is when, in 1516, he decided he wanted to leave the imperial palace and move to Xuanhua for a more entertaining life. Since his grand secretaries and many other officials opposed this, he was prevented from doing so. On September 8, 1517, he attempted the move again, instructing Gu Dayong not to let anyone else follow him past the Juyong pass on the way to Xuanhua. Due to Gu Dayong's dutiful execution of this order, the other government officials could do nothing but wait until the emperor got bored with his new life and returned to Peking in 1518.\n\nZhengde's trust in his eunuchs transcended many attempts to remove the Eight Tigers from power. He gave them dragon robes to wear, which symbolized that they were immune to charges for any crimes they might have committed. The only real challenge to this trust manifested in the arrest of Liu Jin, who had always been his favorite, and was accomplished only with the help of all the other Eight Tigers.\n\nGovernment Control\n\nAfter the failed 1506 petition to remove the Eight Tigers from power, Liu Jin began removing anyone opposed to him from power. In March 1507, he issued an edict that made he and the other Eight Tigers equal in rank and authority to the highest provincial officials, as well as the right to investigate any administrative or judicial matter. All official documents had to be approved by him first before they could be sent to the ministries or grand secretariat. He also broke custom by sentencing officials to punishment by cangue for minor offenses, namely not acknowledging his authority, which had previously never been used on officials, and only for serious crimes. Liu Jin had control of the imperial administration in both the capital and the provinces by the summer of 1507. \n\nThe eunuchs were able to expand their roles within the palace to control the rest of the government structure. Many of these positions became available for the Eight Tigers after the governmental purge after the 1506 petition. For instance, the eunuch Director of Ceremonial usually controlled the Western or Eastern Depots, as well as the Embroidered-Uniform guard, who \"exercised almost unlimited police and governmental authority\", with a greatly feared prison.\n\nThe Depots, which were intelligence and terror organizations, were run by the Eight Tigers. Qiu Ju ran the Eastern Depot, Gu Dayong ran the Western Depot, and Liu Jin ran the Inner Branch Depot. Many suspects, including Imperial Ministers, censors, soldiers, and civilians, were arrested, beaten heavily, and sometimes killed. The Inner Branch Depot's embroidered-uniform guards conducted much of the beating and torture. Those arrested number in the several thousands. The Western and Inner Branch Depots were shut down after Liu Jin's arrest for extortion, although the emperor remained fond of Gu Dayong and contemplated reopening the Western Depot. There was too much backlash, however, and it remained closed. The Eastern Depot, on the other hand, remained operational for the next few years, under different directors, until its disbandment after Emperor Zhengde's death.\n\nWhen he was in power, Liu Jin managed to drastically change government structure in the favor of him and his fellow eunuchs, but he was aiming for much more that was never realized. He wanted to create an empire where eunuchs were the superiors of every official in every branch of government, a scale which would have been unprecedented in Chinese history. Most of his radical reforms to this end are not known, because they were rigorously opposed by the civil officials and so were never implemented.\n\nFinancial\n\nIn 1506, Liu Jin was given the task of raising revenue for the emperor. He claimed that the decline in revenues was due to mismanagement and corruption, and decided to run a general investigation and fine the ineffective officials. Liu Jin implemented many new taxes and worked against corruption and ineffectiveness of government officials. He also became known for accepting large bribes.\n\nFor example, in June 1508, Liu ordered grain inventory inspections. He dispatched secretaries and censors around China to see how much fodder and hay had been purchased, as well as if it had been changed for silver or remained in storage in the warehouses. He also targeted abuses by the local elites, punishing ineffectual officials with jail time or heavy fines paid in grain, which was then shipped to the north and west. In Fukien and Szechwan, Liu Jin added a surtax on silver mines, event though the officials had reported that there was no more silver in them. Since he gave heavy fines to officials who displeased him, many began to pay him bribes to avoid those fines.\n\nLiu Jin also implemented surveys of the military agricultural colonies, which is what eventually led to the Prince of Anhua rebellion in 1510.\n\nEarly Opposition\n\nCensor Jiang Qin objected to Liu Jin driving important officials out of office. Calling Liu Jin \"a minor servant\", he questioned why the emperor should trust Liu Jin so fully when everyone else hated and feared him. He also stated he would give his head if it meant removing Liu Jin from power. For these statements, Jiang Qin was given 30 lashes and imprisoned. Three days later, he again urged Zhengde to execute Liu Jin, but he was beaten again. Finally, after a final flogging, he died.\n\nAfter Liu Jin was appointed the head of the imperial household in June 1506, the grand secretaries were alarmed. They questioned the action but were ignored.\n\nThe first real plan to remove Liu Jin from power came from other, senior eunuchs who felt threatened by his influence. They wanted him either banished to Nanking or executed. On October 27, 1506, Han Wen, the minister of revenue, submitted a petition to the emperor, requesting that he execute the Eight Tigers. The emperor was unwilling to consider this. Minister of personal Hsu Chin warned that the emperor would not change his mind on so drastic a request, but the grand secretaries were resolute, and convinced the senior eunuchs to get the emperor to sign the petition. The court officials agreed to ask the emperor to carry out the sentence on the morning of October 28.\n\nHowever, one of Liu Chin's agents in the court told him about the plan. On the night of October 27, the Eight Tigers begged the emperor for mercy. Liu Jin told the emperor that it was all a conspiracy and that the eunuch Director of Ceremonial was cooperating with the grand secretaries to limit the emperor's power. The emperor believed Liu Jin, and removed the conspirators from their posts, designating Liu Jin as Director of Ceremonial. The rest of the Eight Tigers took over several other important eunuch agency and military positions. The deposed senior eunuchs were banished to Nanking, but were assassinated en route.\n\nOn October 28, 1506, the morning the court had agreed would be the end of the Eight Tigers, the officials realized that something was strange when they were all summoned to the morning audience. A senior official announced that the emperor had decided he would decide what to do about the Eight Tigers by himself. Almost all the grand secretaries then resigned, realizing the battle was lost, and Liu Jin accepted the resignations personally.\n\nLiu Jin went on to consolidate his control and exact revenge over those who had opposed him. He framed Han Wen for fraud, and dismissed him on December 13, 1506. In February 1507, the twenty-one senior officials who had protested the removal of the grand secretaries were beaten and given commoner status. From then on, officials who opposed Liu Jin were beaten, tortured, and dismissed.\n\nOn July 23, 1508, a group of eunuchs submitted an anonymous letter to the emperor about Liu Jin's crimes. Liu Jin thought it must have been written by an official, and began investigating them, arresting all the palace officials. He released them once he discovered a eunuch had written the letter, and then he established a security agency to investigate them. He banished the eunuchs involved to Nanking.\n\nLiu Jin raised the tax rate in Shaanxi, and he had tax delinquents arrested and beaten. This angered the soldiers in the province. The local prince, Prince Anhua, was already angry about the power of the eunuchs. He believed that they gained their positions through persuasiveness, not through any real helpfulness to the empire. Therefore, Prince Anhua decided to take the opportunity to rebel. On May 12, 1510, he held a banquet, then had the soldiers come in and kill the officials, officers, and eunuchs in attendance. He then announced he was raising an army to defeat Liu Jin. However, the rebellion only lasted 19 days before he was betrayed by one of his own cavalry commanders. Zhang Yong and Yang Yiqing, who had been dispatched to defeat the rebellion, arrived to escort the prince back to the capital for his execution.\n\nLiu Jin was not on good terms with Zhang Yong, who could not be removed from his post like Liu Jin's other enemies due to his military prowess. Liu Jin considered himself the dictator of the rest of the Eight Tigers, and often delegated the work he did not want to do to them. This attitude caused the rest of the Eight Tigers to resent him as well. This rift led to the eventual toppling of Liu Jin.\n\nBy 1510 the relations between Liu Jin and Zhang Yong have significantly deteriorated. As an inspector of the army Zhang Yong was sent to Shaanxi to oversee the suppression of the Prince of Anhua rebellion by the imperial forces. His companion during the travels was Yang Yiqing, the supreme commander of the army, who was once forced out of office by Liu Jin in 1507 and held a grudge against him. Yang Yiquing managed to convince the eunuch that Liu Jin was planning an operation that would put Zhang Yong's life in danger. He claimed that Liu Jin was planning to assassinate the emperor and put his own grand-nephew on the throne, and that the plan would begin on September 17, 1510.\n\nOn September 13, the emperor held a banquet with the Eight Tigers, and Liu Jin left first. Zhang Yong told the emperor about Liu Jiu's plan, and he and the rest of the Eight Tigers convinced him to send guards to arrest Liu Jin and confiscate his property. The emperor decided he was guilty when he saw Liu Jin's hordes of wealth.\n\nAt his trial, Liu Jin at first tried his normal tactics of controlling those who defied him. He appealed to the people who he claimed he had helped over the years, saying they owed him. When an imperial consort asked why he had so much armor hidden away if not to attack the emperor, he stopped speaking. The emperor was convinced, and Liu Jin was sentenced to death by a thousand cuts. The execution began on September 27 and lasted for 3 days. His property was taken and used to prop up the emperor's finances.\n\nThe execution of Liu Jin, which took place in 1510, greatly diminished the ability of the group to influence emperor's decisions. The system built by Liu Jin that bestowed significant authority upon the eunuchs was swiftly dismantled by the government officials after his death. However, the Zhengde emperor continued to entrust the remaining members of the Eight Tigers with authority. He still needed financial security, so he gave the eunuchs the power to take whatever supplies and labor they needed from civil officials, in order to make their jobs easier. He appointed Wei Bin and Gao Feng as the new Directors of Ceremonial, and had the rest continue to run the garrisons and surveillance agencies.\n\nAfter the death of the Zhengde emperor, many of the Eight Tigers were banished.\n\nConfucian scholars viewed the eunuchs as usurpers, as they rose to power independent of the examination system.\n\nAdditionally, the imperial censors, who sometimes criticized powerful eunuchs directly to the emperor, viewed the defeat of Liu Jin as a victory for the strength of China's empire. In 1624, censor Yang Lien implored the emperor to impeach eunuch Wei Zhongxian in a letter which said that eunuchs must be kept from interfering in anything outside palace life. He mentioned Liu Jin: \"Even such arrogant and lawless eunuchs as Wang Zhen and Liu Jin were promptly executed. Thus the dynasty lasted until today\".\n\nIn the histories, written by the Confucian scholars, eunuchs, including the Eight Tigers and especially Liu Jin, are portrayed negatively. Liu Jin is blamed for the outbreak of rebellions at the end of Emperor Zhengde's reign. In the earliest complete narrative of the 1510 rebellion, \"Rebellion Quelled at Jianghuai\", written in 1513, Wang Ao argued that Liu Jin was responsible for the rebellion, writing, \"In the early Zhengde reign, the traitorous eunuch unlawfully seized the power of the sovereign. By [his] cruel punishments and tyranny, [he] poisoned all within the seas. All within the seas was confused and in upheaval. [When] the traitorous eunuch was executed, the masses of bandits/rebels arose\". In Jianghai jianqu ji, Zhu Yunming asserted that Liu Jin's abuses pushed the empire to rebellion.\n\nOne Ming historian who portrays Liu Jin in a more positive light is Liao Xinyi in \"A Brief Study of Liu Jin's 'Change of Established Regulations\", in which he argues that the grain inventory inspections were motivated more by the need to supplement the grain of the northern and western borders than by a desire by Liu Jin to extract bribes or revenge.\n\nIn the \"Veritable Records of Wuzong\", Liu Jin is again described in a very negative way. There seems to be disagreement on his relation to the rebellions, for while it is agreed that he sometimes worked tirelessly to stop banditry, it is also sometimes claimed that he was personally linked to the bandits and supported them in their rebellions. It is true that rebellions rose along with Liu Jin's fall, but the relationship between those events is unclear.\n\nNishimura Gensho, the leading Japanese scholar of the 1510 rebellion, attributes the rebellion to the weakness of Emperor Zhengde as his court was overrun by scheming eunuchs. He claims that the extensive intelligence network run by the eunuchs caused the empire to fall into a period of panic, and that the imperial estates uprooted peasants from their land and livelihoods, lending more support to the rebellion.\n\nThe dragon cloaks worn by the emperor's chosen Eight Tigers came to symbolize great power, which was desirable to young men trying to make a career. The Eight Tigers convinced many young boys and men to become castrated, as they believed that was the path towards a successful life.\n\nOverall, the Eight Tigers add credence to the many stories told in the classical Chinese histories and in modern scholarship about how much power eunuchs had in imperial China. In a book of classical Chinese tales, the Eight Tigers and their infamy are mentioned several times. A few examples: Liu Jin, as head of the Inner Branch Depot, was powerful enough to demand that officials kneel before him and to order flogging punishments, sometimes until death. The Inner Branch Depot is infamous for arresting people numbering in the several thousands. It also mentions the Eastern Depot, calling it an \"imperial terror establishment\" and \"Gestapo-like organization\".\n\nLiu Jin is featured in several plays and novels.\n\nHang Kai, who was instrumental in Lin Jiu's removal from power, wrote many plays featuring Liu Jin, as they were both from Xinping.\n\nHowever, the most famous play with Liu Jin, Famensi (Famen Temple) became popular during the Qing Dynasty, its earliest known record in 1845. This classic Peking Opera included the lines, \"My last name is Liu, my first name is Jin… At age seven, I was castrated and entered the imperial palace two years later… I helped Emperor Zhengde ascend the throne\". In the play, Liu Jin is a painted-face role (xiahualian), whose face is painted red to indicate Liu Jin's \"rough characteristics and compelling power\".\n\nFamen Temple tells the story of a famous murder case. The murderers got away, and an innocent man was falsely accused, by Liu Jin ordered the court to be reviewed, which led to the punishment of the perpetrators. Throughout the play, he is decisive, but his decisions are backed up or checked by the Empress Dowager. The play thus portrays Liu Jin in a relatively positive light. Famen Temple is a famous classic opera, and was a favorite of Empress Dowager Cixi. It has a famous video recording from 1950 and a few famous audio recordings.\n\nAt least two novels written in the Qing dynasty feature Liu Jin in a treacherous plot. In \"Bajian qixia wuyi pingmen qianhou zhuan\" and \"Sanmenjie\", Liu Jin lures the emperor from the capital's safety to Suzhou, promising him beautiful women and scenery. Using his connections with three bandit chiefs, who have an army of ten-thousand men based in Qingzhou, Shandong, Liu Jin has the imperial entourage attacked. The emperor is saved by the bravery of a set of fraternal twins.\n\n"}

Facebook furthermore prohibits users from accurately representing names which according to the site have \"too many words\", and prohibits initializing first names, preventing users who do so in real life from formatting their own names as they see fit.\n\nThe social networking website Facebook has maintained the real-name system policy for user profiles. According to Facebook, the real-name policy stems from the position \"that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe.\" Likewise per this policy, a \"real name\" is defined by \"your real name as it would be listed on your credit card, driver's license or student ID.\" In August 2012, Facebook estimated that more than 83 million Facebook accounts are fake accounts. As a result of this revelation, the share price of Facebook dropped below $20. Facebook has asserted that \"authentic identity is important to the Facebook experience, and our goal is that every account on Facebook should represent a real person.\"\n\nNative Americans have been repeatedly targeted due to Facebook's policy. \n\nA number of Native Americans have objected to Facebook's inquiries into their names, and to Facebook's request that they provide proof of identification or other documentation in order to use the service. Native American activists claimed to be planning to file a class action lawsuit against Facebook regarding the 'real name' policy.\n\nIn 2008, a woman in Japan named Hiroko Yoda had her Facebook account suspended over her surname, which is common in Japan, being confused with a Star Wars character of the same name.\n\nThe Dublin branch of the Irish language rights group, Misneach, started a Change.org online petition to demand the right to use Irish names on Facebook and protested outside Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin on October 7, 2015.\n\nIn 2015, one Gaelic-speaking retired policeman won the right to use his Gaelic name on Facebook, even though it was not his legal name. Some Scottish Gaelic surnames, such as NicIllAnndrais, contain more than two capital letters and are still disallowed by Facebook.\n\nIn the Spanish-influenced indigenous Chamoru culture of the Marianas, the standard naming convention has historically been for a person to use their mother's maiden name as their middle name. (Chamoru culture, having been colonized by Spain, went through a period where indigenous names and naming conventions were forcibly eradicated and replaced by what the conquering Spanish deemed acceptable.) Furthermore, using one's full name rather than simply the first and last is commonplace, if only for disambiguation purposes due to a relatively small pool of surnames. Therefore, middle names such as De Leon Guerrero and De La Cruz are frequently encountered. However, attempting to register such names as one's middle name results in a message telling users that \"Names can't have too many words.\" Therefore, many Chamoru users are forced to either run all of the words together as if they were one single word, or to initialize each word to a common acronym such as DLG or DLC.\n\nIn cases where the acronym is employed, Facebook automatically changes to lower-case all letters except the first. (Use of periods, e.g. D.L.G., will result in a message telling users that \"Profile names can't have too many periods.\") Therefore, someone commonly known in real life by a name such as Mary De Leon Guerrero Mafnas would have to resort to using what on Facebook would end up being \"Mary Dlg Mafnas\". The message is not accompanied by an option to challenge/appeal the restriction or to send Facebook documentation that the format is how one normally formats their name in real life.\n\nIn January 2015, a 23-year-old Australian bank employee claiming to be named Phuc Dat Bich posted a photo of his passport identification page to Facebook, protesting that the company had unfairly shut down his account for being \"false and misleading\". \"Is it because I'm Asian? Is it?\" he asked. The BBC reported that in Vietnamese the name is pronounced similarly to \"Phoo Da Bi\" (IPA: ). After his reinstatement, Bich posted a thank you note to supportive Facebook fans, stating he was \"glad and honoured to be able to make people happy by simply making them laugh at something that appears outrageous and ridiculous\". Subsequently \"Phuc Dat\" published a further message admitting it was a hoax.\n\nTamils do not have surnames: They have their father or mother or both father and mother's first name as initials. This standard naming practice has not been acknowledged by Facebook.\n\nFacebook's real-name policy does not reflect adopted names or pseudonyms used by the transgender community, and has led to suspending users with real names that might be thought to be fake. A user via the anonymous Android and iOS app Secret began reporting \"fake names\" which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the stage names of drag queens.\n\nTransgender people have also been affected by the policy, including one former Facebook employee who initiated development on Facebook's custom gender options, who was suspended on the day the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional. According to gender non-conforming activist D. Dragonetti, Facebook even disregarded their government identification when supplied.\n\nOn October 1, 2014, Chris Cox, Chief Product Officer at Facebook, offered an apology to the LGBT community and drag kings and queens: In the two weeks since the real-name policy issues surfaced, we've had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it. We've also come to understand how painful this has been. We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook, and we're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were.\n\nSecular, atheist, agnostic, humanist, or users who comment or blog expressing views critical of particular religions, sects or religion in general, as well as religious people who express the opposing views critical of atheism or agnosticism very often have a legitimate need to use an alias. Some of these users could suffer rejection, retaliation or violence if their views – contrary to those of their family, friends or community – are known. In some cases, secular bloggers are exposed to imprisonment by an intolerant government, violent attacks in the street or even being killed by religious fanatics. Examples are the incarceration of activist and blogger Raif Badawi in Saudi Arabia and a string of attacks and murders of secular activists in Bangladesh or Pakistan.\n\nInternational non-profit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation stated they were \"alarmed to hear that Facebook's 'real name' policy is disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ community.\"\n\nOnline magazine \"Queerty\" called Facebook's policy \"a frankly creepy overreach of authority\", adding \"There are a million reasons why someone would choose to self-identify with a name other than the one that's printed on their birth certificate. And really, it's absolutely none of your business in the first place.\"\n\nIn an interview for MAGE Magazine, Second Life entrepreneur Jennifer Ceara Firehawk stated: \"If we are not using our page to abuse or grief others they just need to leave us be. We are not hurting anyone… FB does not realize some SL people earn lindens to turn into RL (real life) money and that is how they make a living. Once you force a person to change the SL name they will lose money due to not being able to find them on FB or SL as they may use FB for their buisness [sic] or advertise. So they end up losing buisness [sic] and money.\"\n\nSeattle drag performer Olivia LaGarce started a Change.org online petition titled \"Allow performers to use their stage names on their Facebook accounts!\"\n\nOn December 15, 2015, Facebook announced in a press release that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay/lesbian community and abuse victims. The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their \"special circumstance\" or \"unique situation\" with a request to use pseudonyms, subject to verification of their true identities. At that time, this was already being tested in the U.S. Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook. The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified, forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation.\n\nThis measure was criticised by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who pointed out that it forces the most vulnerable users to reveal intimate details of their personal lives. Furthermore, as of January 2018, there is no evidence in Facebook's policies that this measure was ever implemented.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19339921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19339921", "title": "Forgotten Ten", "text": "Forgotten Ten\n\nThe Forgotten Ten () is the term applied to ten members of the Irish Republican Army who were executed in Mountjoy Prison, Dublin by British forces following courts martial from 1920–21 during the Irish War of Independence.\n\nBased upon military law at the time, they were buried within the prison precincts, their graves unmarked in the unconsecrated ground. The names of the Forgotten Ten are Kevin Barry, Patrick Moran, Frank Flood, Thomas Whelan, Thomas Traynor, Patrick Doyle, Edmond Foley, Thomas Bryan, Bernard Ryan, and Patrick Maher.\n\nThe executioner was John Ellis, one of the United Kingdom's hangmen at that time.\n\nFollowing the Irish War of Independence, Mountjoy Prison was transferred to the control of the Irish Free State, which became the State of Ireland in 1937. In the 1920s, the families of the dead men requested their remains be returned to them for proper burial. This effort was joined in the later 1920s by the National Graves Association. Through the efforts of the Association, the graves of the men were identified in 1934, and in 1996 a Celtic cross was erected in Glasnevin Cemetery to commemorate them.\n\nThe campaign to rebury the men dragged on for 80 years from their deaths. Following an intense period of negotiations, the Irish government relented. Plans to exhume the bodies of the 10 men were announced on 1 November 2000, the 80th anniversary of the execution of Kevin Barry. On 14 October 2001, the Forgotten Ten were afforded full state honours, with a private service at Mountjoy Prison for the families of the dead, a requiem mass at St Mary's Pro-Cathedral and burial in Glasnevin Cemetery.\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", some criticised the event as glorifying militant Irish republicanism. It coincided with the Fianna Fáil party conference.\n\nThe progress of the cortège through the centre of Dublin was witnessed by crowds estimated as being in the tens of thousands who broke into spontaneous applause as the coffins passed. On O'Connell Street, a lone piper played a lament as the cortege paused outside the General Post Office, the focal point of the 1916 Easter Rising. In his homily during the requiem mass, Cardinal Cahal Daly, a long-time critic of the IRA campaign in Northern Ireland, insisted that there was a clear distinction between the conflict of 1916–22 and the paramilitary-led violence of the previous 30 years:\n\nIn his graveside oration the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern echoed these sentiments and also paid tribute to the Ten:\n\nThe state funeral, broadcast live on national television and radio, was only the 13th since independence. Patrick Maher would not be reburied with his comrades. In accordance with his wishes, and those of his family, he was reinterred in Ballylanders, County Limerick.\n\nA feature length Irish language documentary on the re-interments, \"An Deichniúr Dearmadta\" (\"The Forgotten Ten\") aired on TG4 on 28 March 2002.\n\nAn episode of the BBC series \"Who Do you Think You Are?\" with Boy George describes the life of Thomas Bryan, who was his great uncle.\n\n\n"}

The jack is raised on Polish Navy ships when the president is officially on board, as well as on land, if the president is present. The design of the jack is based directly on the pre-war Banner of the Republic of Poland which used to be part of presidential insignia.\n\nThe jack of the President is defined in the Ordinance of the Minister of National Defense on the Use of Insignia of the Armed Forces of January 26, 1996 with subsequent amendments. The ordinance defines the jack of the President as \"a piece of red cloth with the image of the state eagle (i.e. the White Eagle from the national coat of arms) in the middle, bordered with a \"wężyk generalski\"\", an ornate wavy line used in the Polish military as a symbol of general's rank. The hoist to fly ratio is 5:6. The proportion of the eagle's height to the fly is 3:5.\n\nThe presidential jack is used in military ceremonies attended by the commander-in-chief. Celebrations of the Constitution Day, May 3; Polish Armed Forces Day, August 15; and Independence Day, November 11 (see Public holidays in Poland) are typical occasions. For example, during the grand military parade on August 15, 2007 in Warsaw, President Lech Kaczyński rode in a convertible jeep preceded by a mounted cavalry officer carrying the presidential jack,\nwhile a smaller jack was attached to the president's jeep as a car flag. The jack also draped the coffins of President Kaczyński (see Death and state funeral of Lech Kaczyński and Maria Kaczyńska) and former President-in-exile Ryszard Kaczorowski after both died in the Smolensk air crash of 2010.\n\nA state banner was used in Poland as insignia of the head of state (king, president, etc.) as early as the 11th century CE. Although its design changed with time, it was always a heraldic banner, i.e. one based directly on the national coat of arms: a crowned White Eagle in a red field. In 1919, the Sejm (lower house of parliament) established the Banner of the Republic of Poland, reserved for use by the head of state – the State Leader (\"Naczelnik Państwa\") and, later, President of the Republic. In 1927, it was modified to reflect the adoption of a new official rendering of the national coat of arms. At this point the banner was virtually identical to the current design for the presidential jack.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Banner of the Republic was still used by presidents-in-exile while a variant with a crownless eagle was used by Communist authorities at home. Officially abandoned in 1955, the banner continued to be used in practice by the prime minister and, during the 1960s, by the Council of State, a collective head of state of the time.\n\nThe modern Jack of the President of the Republic of Poland was established by the Minister of National Defense on January 29, 1996 with the sole purpose of flying it on Polish Navy ships while the commander-in-chief is on board. On December 14, 2005, the use of the presidential jack was extended to all branches of Polish Armed Forces. It was first flown on land during a Constitution Day ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw on May 3, 2005.\n\n\n"}

Several of his co-stars and stuntmen hired by the film studios began working together regularly. This engendered a familiarity of one another's skills and abilities and it made sense for them to become a working team. Some of the members had received training at the Peking Opera schools, similar to Chan.\n\nBy 1983, and the release of the film \"Project A\", the stunt team had become an official organisation of 6 members. The organisation meant that the stuntmen not only received insurance coverage, but also a monthly salary and higher pay.\nBy the time of \"Police Story 2\" in 1988, the team had expanded to around 20 members.\nThis incarnation of the team was disbanded in 1990 and thereafter, individual members were contracted and used on a film-by-film basis rather than all members remaining on the payroll. This allowed for some new faces, and the return of former members.\n\nThe formation of Chan's team influenced others in the business to follow suit, particularly his former co-stars and \"brothers\" Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao (their stunt teams known as \"Hung Ga Ban\" and \"Yuen Ga Ban\" respectively). Other actors who formed their own stunt teams include Lau Kar-leung, Philip Ko, Stanley Tong and Bruce Law.\nChan's stunt team worked in collaboration with Sammo Hung's team on films including Thunderbolt and Around the World in 80 Days.\nA small number of films that Chan produced but did not appear in, or was not involved in at all, have utilised his stunt team.

They are best known for their \"Roadfood\" books, website, and magazine columns, in which they find road food restaurants serving classic American regional specialties and review them. Starting their hunt for regional American food in the early 1970s they were the first food writers to regard this food as being as worthy to report on as the haute cuisine of other nations. \n\nSince the Sterns began documenting regional American food in the 1970s many other writers and television personalities have used their pioneering work as inspiration. In addition to their early work with regional American food the Sterns' book \"Square Meals\" (Knopf 1985) put \"comfort foods\" like mac and cheese, meatloaf, and mashed potatoes on the culinary map. \"Square Meals\" did an audacious reverse spin on the tricked up and precious nouvelle cuisine that was beloved by food critics at that time. \n\nJane Grossman grew up in New York City, where she attended the Walden School and received a BFA in graphic design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Michael Stern grew up in Winnetka, Illinois, and graduated from the University of Michigan in 1968. They met as graduate students in art at Yale University and their first date, at Pepe's Pizza in New Haven, had a food focus. The couple married in 1970. The following year, Jane earned an MFA in painting from Yale and Michael changed schools and earned an MFA from Columbia University in film. Neither found work in their fields of study.\n\nAfter a short stint of producing documentaries for WNBC, a teaching job at Hunter College and another at Wesleyan University they began work on the book that eventually became the first \"Roadfood\". The book was conceived as a book on \"truck-stop dining,\" funded with an advance from a publisher. The Sterns set out in their car to travel through the United States and eat up to 12 meals daily at diners and local cafes. The resulting first edition of \"Roadfood\" was published in 1977; the most recent edition was released in 2017.\n\nIn addition to their food writing, the Sterns have written books on American popular culture, including \"The New York Times\" bestselling \"Elvis World\" (1987) and \"The Encyclopaedia of Bad Taste\" (1990). In all, they have written over 30 books. They were staff writers for \"Gourmet\" magazine for 18 years, have written for \"The New Yorker\", \"The Atlantic Monthly\", and are now contributing editors at \"Saveur\". \n\nThey are regular guests on American Public Media's public radio program, \"The Splendid Table\". They have won numerous awards, including James Beard awards, and were inducted into Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America in 1992. The Sterns founded Roadfood.com; the site was sold to Fexy Media in 2016. After the sale, the Sterns remained in charge of editorial content of their website.\n\nIn 2003, Jane Stern published \"Ambulance Girl: How I Saved Myself by Becoming an EMT\", a memoir in which she described suffering from severe clinical depression when she was in her early 50s and overcame her depression by training and working as an emergency medical technician in Connecticut. In 2005 the book was made into a television movie, \"Ambulance Girl\", for which actress Kathy Bates was nominated for an Emmy Award. The Sterns wrote a joint memoir, \"Two for the Road: Our Love Affair With American Food\", in 2006. \n\nThe couple divorced in 2008; they still write as a team. She now lives in Ridgefield, Connecticut; he and his present wife, Linda, reside in Aiken, South Carolina. \n\nIn 2011 the former couple published \"The Lexicon of Real American Food\", and Jane Stern published a book on her little known but long-standing career as a tarot card reader. \n\n\n"}

It is a creature having half tiger and half human features, depicted to be transformed from a learned ancient Manipuri physician. He was experimenting his magical skills and powers, and came up with this idea of turning himself into a powerful man with strength of a tiger. He became this creature with the head, limbs and strength of a tiger but failed to remember how to revert to his normal human form, owing to low memory or thinking capacity of a tiger.\n\nThis is a story of a kind, dedicated and skilled ancient Manipuri physician, who used to ride on a horse and visit places to heal the suffering ailments. As his knowledge and skill kept on increasing day by day, he kept on wanting to learn more and more. At a time, he was able to do whatever he wanted. He kept on conducting experiments until he decided to turn himself into a tiger one day, for he wanted the power of a tiger.\n\nHe taught his wife how to help him turn into a tiger and how to return to his human form. But, as soon as he became the tiger-like creature/ keibu keioiba, he developed the tiger-instinct of roaring and frightening people. So, his wife ran away from him before he could be subjected to return to his human form. Instead, he even tried to kill his wife and ran away in the wild far from home.\nWhen he got hungry, he would come to human villages to steal poultry or fish or livestock, as he never learned how to hunt like a real tiger in the wild. He became the feared and the hated. He began to target humans for food.\n\nHe came to a village and took a young girl called Thabaton, who was home alone, left by her seven brothers for work. He was avenged by the brothers and the girl was saved.\nThe story depicts the never-ending desire of man for getting more which ultimately ruins himself. It teaches a lesson to us about the evil effects of this human nature. We can witness many examples of this today- e.g., global warming because of the never-ending industrial race, world devastation by never ending arms race in world wars, etc.\n\nAlmost every Manipuri grow up listening to this folktale from their elders. It is a common story told to kids over many generations.\n\nA 2-D Manipuri animated film, titled as \"keibu keioiba\", has been made, directed by Bhumenjoy konsam, released in 2009, based on the original folktale. The movie has increased awareness of the story to the selfie-generation kids of present Manipur as well as to other communities.\n\n"}

{"id": "30867957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30867957", "title": "Metabiography", "text": "Metabiography\n\nMetabiography is the literary study of the relation of biographies to the temporal, geographical, institutional, intellectual or ideological locations of their writers (the biographers). It is a hermeneutics of biography that sees the biographical subject (the “biographee”) as a collective construct of different memory cultures, proposing an essential instability of historical lives. In the words of Steven Shapin, metabiography stresses “that shifting biographical traditions make one person have many lives,” none of these necessarily more real than any other, because all are “configured and reconfigured according to the sensibilities and needs of the changing cultural settings.” In this sense, metabiography expresses a belief in the observer-dependence of historical knowledge.\n\nAs part of the preparations for their own writings, biographers have traditionally examined previous biographical studies. For these authors, dealing with predecessors has served such purposes as establishing the factual inadequacy of earlier efforts, staking one’s own claim against prior “myths” and “mistakes,” or has been intended simply as laying the groundwork for a new and more “definitive” study. Metabiography, however, goes beyond writing about the strengths or weaknesses of preceding biographical studies in interpreting a life. It is less concerned with the authenticity of biographical representations than with their relational nature. \nIt has been argued that in the history of science, metabiography has a long tradition of over fifty years, stretching from Henry Guerlac’s study of “Lavoisier and his biographers” to A. Rupert Hall’s edition of eighteenth-century Newton biographies and beyond. However, to these scholars, the study of former biographers had a propaedeutic function vis-à-vis the biographical works of their own time. They did not follow a relational approach and thus do not meet the crucial criterion for metabiographical studies.\n\nIn the field of biographies of artists and writers, the metabiographical approach was followed e.g. by David Dennis for Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827), and Lucasta Miller who used it to good effect in the case Emily Brontë (1818–48). \nGordon S. Wood’s study on the Americanization of Benjamin Franklin, however, is not metabiography, although the Franklin literature would provide ideal material for such a study.\n\nExamples of scientific metabiography are Jan Sapp’s “The nine lives of Gregor Mendel,” Patricia Fara’s \"Newton: the Making of Genius\" and Nicolaas Rupke’s \"Alexander von Humboldt: a Metabiography\". James Moore and Ralph Colp have applied the metabiographical approach to Charles Darwin. A metabiographical slant is also discernible in the \"Reader’s Guide to the History of Science\" (2000).\n"}

{"id": "2163726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163726", "title": "Oriflamme", "text": "Oriflamme\n\nThe Oriflamme (from Latin \"aurea flamma\", \"golden flame\") was the battle standard of the King of France in the Middle Ages. It was originally the sacred banner of the Abbey of St. Denis, a monastery near Paris. When the oriflamme was raised in battle by the French royalty during the Middle Ages, most notably during the Hundred Years War, no prisoners were to be taken until it was lowered. Through this tactic they hoped to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy, especially the nobles, who could usually expect to be taken alive for ransom during such military encounters.\n\nIn French, the term \"oriflamme\" has come to mean any banner with pointed ends; by association with the form of the original.\n\nThe Oriflamme was mentioned in the eleventh-century ballad the \"Chanson de Roland\" (vv. 3093-5) as a royal banner, first called \"Romaine\" and then \"Montjoie\". According to legend, Charlemagne carried it to the Holy Land in response to a prophecy regarding a knight possessing a golden lance, from which flames would burn and drive out the Saracens. This suggests that the \"lance\" was originally the important object, with the banner simply a decoration, but this changed over time.\n\nThe Oriflamme was first used by Louis VI in 1124 and was last flown in battle at Agincourt in 1415, though a version of it remained in the Abbey of St. Denis until the 18th century.\n\nLouis VI replaced the earlier banner of Saint Martin with the oriflamme of the Abbey of St. Denis, which floated about the tomb of St. Denis and was said to have been given to the abbey by king Dagobert.\nUntil the 12th century the standard-bearer was the Comte de Vexin, who, as vowed to St. Denis, was the temporal defender of the abbey. Louis VI, having acquired Vexin, became standard-bearer; as soon as war began, Louis VI received Communion at St. Denis and took the standard from the tomb of the saint to carry it to the combat.\n\nIt is recorded as having been carried at the following battles/campaigns:\n\nThe Oriflamme was lost at least five times during its medieval history; Mons-en-Pévèle, Crécy Poitiers and Agincourt, and also during the campaigns of the Seventh Crusade under King Louis IX.\n\nThe banner was red or orange-red silk and flown from a gilded lance. According to legend, its colour stems from it being dipped in the blood of the recently beheaded St. Denis.\n\nThe surviving descriptions of the Oriflamme are in Guillaume le Breton (thirteenth century), in the \"Chronicle of Flanders\" (fourteenth century), in the \"Registra Delphinalia\" (1456) and in the inventory of the treasury of St. Denis (1536). They show that the primitive Oriflamme was succeeded in the course of the centuries by newer Oriflammes which bore little resemblance to one another except for their colour.\n\nWhen the Oriflamme was displayed on the battlefield it indicated that no quarter\nwas to be given, its red colour being symbolic of cruelty and ferocity.\n\nAlthough the azure ground (from the blue cope of St. Martin of Tours) strewn with gold fleur-de-lis remained the symbol of royalty until the 15th century, the Oriflamme became the royal battle standard of the King of France, and it was carried at the head of the king's forces when they met another army in battle. In the fifteenth century, the fleur-de-lis on the white flag of Joan of Arc became the new royal standard replacing both the symbol of royalty and the Oriflamme on the battle field.\n\nThe bearer of the standard, the \"porte-oriflamme\", became an office (like that of Marshal or Constable) and a great honour, as it was an important and very dangerous job to take charge of such a visible symbol in battle. If things went badly, the bearer was expected to die rather than relinquish his charge.\n\nFroissart vividly describes \"porte-oriflamme\" Geoffroi de Charny's fall at the side of his king at the Battle of Poitiers in this passage: “There Sir Geoffroi de Charny fought gallantly near the king (note: and his fourteen-year-old son). The whole press and cry of battle were upon him because he was carrying the king’s sovereign banner [the Oriflamme]. He also had before him his own banner, gules, three escutcheons argent. So many English and Gascons came around him from all sides that they cracked open the king’s battle formation and smashed it; there were so many English and Gascons that at least five of these men at arms attacked one [French] gentleman. Sir Geoffroi de Charny was killed with the banner of France in his hand, as other French banners fell to earth.”\n\n\nThe 19th-century poet Robert Southey refers to the Oriflamme and its reputation in his poem \"Joan of Arc\"\n"}
{"id": "51027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51027", "title": "Patronymic", "text": "Patronymic\n\nA patronymic, or patronym, is a component of a personal name based on the given name of one's father, grandfather (i.e., an avonymic), or an earlier male ancestor. A component of a name based on the name of one's mother or a female ancestor is a matronymic. Each is a means of conveying lineage.\n\nPatronymics are still in use, including mandatory use, in many countries worldwide, although their use has largely been replaced by or transformed into patronymic surnames. Examples of such transformations include common English surnames such as Johnson (son of John).\n\nThe usual noun and adjective in English is \"patronymic\", but as a noun this exists in free variation alongside \"patronym\". (The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" records the corresponding \"metronymic\" and \"metronym\", alongside \"matronymic\" but not, however, \"matronym\".) The first part of the word \"patronym\" comes from Greek πατήρ \"patēr\" \"father\" ( πατρός \"patros\" whence the combining form πατρο- \"patro\"-); the second part comes from Greek ὄνυμα \"onyma\", a variant form of ὄνομα \"onoma\" \"name\". In the form \"patronymic\", this stands with the addition of the suffix -ικός (\"-ikos\"), which was originally used to form adjectives with the sense ‘pertaining to’ (thus 'pertaining to the father's name'). These forms are attested in Hellenistic Greek as πατρώνυμος (\"patrōnymos\") and πατρωνυμικός (\"patrōnymikos\"). The form \"patronym\", first attested in English in 1834, was borrowed into English from French \"patronyme\", which had previously borrowed the word directly from Greek. \"Patronymic\", first attested in English in 1612, has a more complex history. Both Greek words had entered Latin, and, from Latin, French. The English form \"patronymic\" was borrowed through the mutual influence of French and Latin on English.\n\nIn many areas around the world, patronyms predate the use of family names. Family names in many Celtic, English, Iberian, Scandinavian, Armenian and Slavic surnames originate from patronyms, e.g. Wilson (son of William), FitzGerald (son of Gerald), Powell (from \"ap Hywel\"), Fernández (son of Fernando), Rodríguez (son of Rodrigo), Anderson or Andersen (son of Anders, Scandinavian form of Andrew), Carlson or Carlsen (son of Carl), Ilyin (of Ilya), Petrov (of Peter), Grigorovich (son of Grigory, Russian form of Gregory), Stefanović (son of Stefan, little Stefan), MacAllister (from \"mac Alistair\", meaning son of Alistair, anglicized Scottish form of Alexander) and O'Conor (from \"Ó Conchobhair\", meaning grandson/descendant of Conchobhar). Other cultures which formerly used patronyms have switched to the more widespread style of passing the father's last name to the children (and wife) as their own.\nIn Iceland, family names are unusual; Icelandic law favours the use of patronyms (and more recently, matronyms) over family names.\n\nTraditionally Muslim and non-Arabic speaking African people, such as Hausa and Fulani people usually (with some exceptions) follow the Arab naming pattern. The word or phrase meaning \"son of\" is, however, omitted. So Mohamed son of Ibrahim son of Ahmed is \"Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed\", and Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed's son Ali is \"Ali Mohamed Ibrahim\".\n\nEthiopians and Eritreans have no concept of family name and surname. If one is to refer to a person with a single name he/she will always use the person's given name. Ethiopian and Eritreans use a naming pattern very similar to the Arab naming pattern, but with one exception: no suffix or prefix. The full name is written as: First name (given name) followed by the father's name, and last by the grandfather's name. For example, Sara Yohannes Petros is Sara (given name) Yohannes (father's name) Petros (grandfather's name). The grandfather's name is usually only used in official documents. The father's name is not considered a middle name. Instead, it is considered a last name. The same is true for females; they do not take their husband's last name. They go independently by their given name, followed by their father's name, and then their grandfather's name, even after marriage.\n\nSome Kenyan communities used patronyms. As of 2010 the practice has largely dropped off with the use of just the father's last name as a surname.\nKalenjin use 'arap' meaning 'son of'; \nKikuyu used 'wa' meaning 'of'. Because of polygamy, matronyms were also used and 'wa' used to identify which wife the child was born of; \nMaasai use 'ole' meaning 'son of'; \nMeru use 'mto' abbreviated M' thus son of Mkindia would be M'Mkindia, pronounced Mto Mkindia.\n\nPatronymic naming is very common in parts of Mozambique. Although the practice is not universal, patronymic naming has been documented in the Zambezia province.\n\nNow not as prominent as before, Many people of southern Nigeria took their father's given name (father's first name) as their surname. It could also be the father's prominent nickname, which takes the place of a first name. An example would be a man named Kolade Fabiyi, who had a son named Dele. The son's name would now be Dele Kolade, not Dele Fabiyi. This is used to distinguish between extended family who would have the same last name, like cousin. This custom has dropped to the modern English one due to increase in British style education.\n\nSomalis use their paternal grandfather's given name as their legal surname for documentation purpose. They also use the term \"ina\" or \"iña\" meaning \"the son of\" or \"the daughter of,\" which is similar to other African- and the Arab-naming patterns. For example, the name \"Ahmed Mohamed Ali Farah\" means \"Ahmed son of Mohamed son of Ali son of Farah.\" When stating one's lineage, one will say \"Ahmed ina Mohamed\" (Ahmed, the son of Mohamed). To identify themselves and the sub=clan they belong to, Somalis memorize their long lineage back a common ancestor. Women never adopt their husbands' patronym but keep theirs for life.\n\nAmong the Zulu patronymics were used in the pre-colonial era. The prefix \"ka\" was attached to the father's name, for example Shaka kaSenzangakhona means Shaka son of Senzangakhona. The practice disappeared from everyday use with the introduction of the modern European style surname system but still remains part of traditional cultural practices, particularly in the case of chieftains and royalty where reciting lineages forms a part of many ceremonial occasions.\n\nYi people's sons' given names are based on the last one or two syllables of father's name. Hani people also have patronymic customs.\n\nAtayal people's names are followed by the name of their father, both son and daughter are patronymic. \nAmis people's son names are also followed by the father's name, while a daughter's name is followed by her mother's name.\n\nPatronymy is common in parts of India. For example, if a father is named Khurram Suleman (a Muslim masculine name), he might name his son Taha Khurram, who in turn might name his son Ismail Taha. As a result, unlike surnames, patronymics will not pass down through many generations.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu and some parts of Kerala and South Karnataka, patronymy is predominant. This is a significant departure from the rest of the country where caste names are mostly employed as surnames. This came into common use during the 1950s and 1960s when the Dravidian movement campaigned against the use one's caste as part of the name.\n\nHowever, rather than using the father's full name, only the first letter — popularly known as the initial — is prefixed to the given name. For example, if a person's given name is \"Saravanan\" and his father's \"Krishnan\", then the full name is \"K. Saravanan\" and is seldom expanded, even in official records. Only where it is forced by stipulation — such as when applying for an Indian passport which does not usually allow initials — is the initial expanded and the name rendered as \"Krishnan Saravanan\". Some families follow the tradition of retaining the name of the hometown, the grandfather's name, or both as initials. The celebrated Indian English novelist R. K. Narayan's name at birth was Rasipuram Krishnaswami Ayyar Narayanaswami, which was shortened at the behest of his writer friend, Graham Greene. Rasipuram, the first name, is a toponym and Krishnaswami Ayyar, the second name, is a patronym.\n\nIn Tamilnadu the use of initials and/or surname is up to the prerogative of the person with no strict rules. The late chief minister Karunanidhi preferred to be referred as M. Karunanidhi where the initial M stood for Muthuvel - his father's given name. M.Karunanidhi's son prefers to be referred as M.K.Stalin incorporating both his fathers and grandfather's names. However M.K.Stalin's son prefers to be referred as Udhayanidhi Stalin. Where Udhayanidhi is his given name and Stalin his father's given name as his surname rather than as an initial.\n\nLikewise, cricketer Ashwin son of Ravichandran prefers to be referred to as R.Ashwin or Ravichandran Ashwin. This is because commentators in sports often call players by their last names only and it would be embarrassing to call him by his fathers name, therefore he puts his own given name in the last.\n\nAnother upcoming trend is to expand the initials to reflect how it would sound in the native language. For example Karuppiah prefers to be called Pala. Karuppiah instead of P. Karuppiah and his son Palaniappan prefers Karu. Palaniappan. Cinema director Ranjith prefers Pa. Ranjith instead of P. Ranjith as Pa sounds closer to the name in Tamil rather than P which sounds like Pe unlike the first syllable Pa.\n\nCelebrated scientist M. Annadurai would expand his name as Mayilsami Annadurai, however he has to be referred to as Annadurai as referring to him as Mayilsami would be referring to him with his father's given name which could be embarrassing for him.\n\nWhile the usage of caste names as surnames/last names is discouraged(but not banned) in Tamil Nadu, such usage by out of state people is greeted with indifference. So Lakshmi Menon, Shilpa Shetty, Pranab Mukherjee, Somnath Chaterjee etc. are referred by their preferred names which include their caste names. Likewise old tamil names with caste in them are also fully used while referring to them such as Pasumpoan Muthuramalinga Thevar, U.Ve. Swaminatha Iyer etc.\n\nIn Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat, a very common convention among the Hindu communities is to have the patronymic as the middle name. Examples:\n\n\nThis system works for both boys and girls, except that after marriage, a woman takes her husband's given name as her middle name – her new middle name is no longer a patronymic.\n\nIndians, particularly Tamils in Singapore, often continue the patronymic tradition; this entails having a single given name, followed by son / daughter of, followed by their father's name.\n\nMalaysian Indians may also follow this custom with \"son\" or \"daughter\" of being replaced by \"anak lelaki\" or \"anak perempuan\", respectively.\n\nIndians of the Muslim Isma'ili sect also have patronymic middle names which use the father's first name and the grandfather's first name plus a family name. Someone called \"Ramazan Rahim Ali Manji\" might call his son \"Karim Ramazan Rahim Manji\" and his granddaughter might be called \"Zahra Karim Ramazan Manji\".\n\nIn Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, ethnic Malays generally follow the Arabic patronymic naming system of \"given name\" + bin/binti + \"father's name\".\n\nIn Brunei, the ruling family of the monarch uses \"given name\" + \"ibni\" + \"father's name\" instead of using bin/binti.\n\nIn Indonesia, there are a number of ethnic groups with different naming systems. The Batak of North Sumatra (Sumatra Utara) give every child the family's name. Sometimes the family's name is prefixed by Huta-, Batu-, etc., but most use Si-, such as Sitanggang, Sihombing, Sibutar-butar, Sinaga, or Sitohang. The family's name is given from the father's family. For example, if the father's name is Boggi Sinaga who married to Moetia Siregar then all children will be given family's name of Sinaga.\n\nIn Sunda a similar cultural rule is used to that of the Batak. The family's name for Sunda is -Wijaya, but this isn't true for all Sundanese families.\n\nIn Arabic, the word \"\" ( or : \"bin\", \"ben\" and sometimes \"ibni\" and \"ibnu\" to show the grammatical case of the noun) is the equivalent of the \"-son\" suffix discussed above. (The prefix ben- is used similarly in Hebrew.) In addition, \"\" () means \"daughter of\". Thus, for example, \"Ali ibn `Amr\" means \"Ali son of `Amr\". In Classical Arabic, the word \"ibn\" is written as \"bn\" between two names, since the case ending of the first name then supplies a vowel. Consequently, ibn is often written as \"b.\", as bint is often written as \"bt.,\" in name formulas rendered from Arabic into Roman characters. Thus Hisham ibn al-Kalbi is alternatively written as Hisham b. al-Kalbi. However, the pronunciation \"bin\" is dialectal and has nothing to do with either the spelling or pronunciation in Classical Arabic. The word \"Abu\" (\"Aba\" or \"Abi\" in different grammatical cases) means \"father of\", so \"Abu `Ali\" is another name for \"`Amr\".\n\nIn medieval times, an illegitimate child of unknown parentage would sometimes be termed \"ibn Abihi\", \"son of his father\" (notably Ziyad ibn Abihi.) In the Qur'an, Jesus (Isa in Arabic) is consistently termed \"`Isa ibn Maryam\" - a matronymic (in the Qur'an, Jesus has no father; see Islamic view of Jesus). An Arabic patronymic can be extended as far back as family tree records will allow: thus, for example, Ibn Khaldun gives his own full name as \"`Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Jabir ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn `Abd ar-Rahman ibn Khaldun\".\n\nPatronymics are still standard in parts of the Arab world, notably Saudi Arabia and Iraq. (In the case of Iraq, with the omitted ibn or bint.) However, most of the Arab world has switched to a family name system. As in English, the new family names are sometimes based on what was formerly a patronymic. Another form widely used in the Arab world is the usage of both the patronymic and a family name, often using both the father's and paternal grandfathers given name in sequence after the own given name, and then the family name. In Iraq for example, full names are formed by combining the given name of an individual with the given name of their father (sometimes the father is skipped and the paternal grandfather's given name is used instead, sometimes both father and paternal grandfather are used), along with the town, village, or clan name. For instance, Hayder Muhammed al-Tikriti is the son of Muhammed named Hayder, and he is from the town of Tikrit. In Saudi Arabia naming conventions are similar to Iraq's but family names are used much more often.\n\nIn Aramaic, the prefix bar- means \"son\" and is used as a prefix meaning \"son of\". In the Bible, Peter is called Bar-Jonah in and Nathanael is possibly called Bartholomew because he is the son of Tolmai (or son of Ptolemy, with \"P\" being reduced). The titles can also be figurative, for example in Acts 4:36-37 a man named Joseph is called Barnabas meaning \"son of consolation\".\n\nThe Assyrians for centuries have used the patronymic bet or bit literally meaning \"house\" in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic; however, in the context of the name it means \"from the house of [the father's name].\"\n\nJews have historically used Hebrew patronymic names after the Bar Kokhba revolt, before which the most common language was Aramaic. In the Jewish patronymic system the first name is followed by either ben- or bat- (\"son of\" and \"daughter of\", respectively), and then the father's name, mother's name, or both. In Aramaic, the first name was followed by bar- or bat- (\"son of\" and \"daughter of\", respectively).\n\nPermanent family surnames exist today, first by Sephardic Jews in 10th or 11th century Iberia and by Ashkenazi Jews in the late 18th century, when Austria passed the first law requiring Jews adopt surnames. Similar laws were passed in Prussia, Galicia, France, regions of Germany, and other countries.\n\nWhile Jews now have permanent surnames for everyday life, the patronymic form is still used in religious life. It is used in synagogue and in documents in Jewish law such as the ketubah (marriage contract). Many Sephardic Jews used the Arabic \"ibn\" instead of \"bat\" or \"ben\" when it was the norm. The Spanish family Ibn Ezra is one example.\n\nThere is a strong cultural pressure for immigrants to modern Israel to Hebraize their names. \nThis practice is especially common among Ashkenazic immigrants, because most of their names were taken during the period from the end of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th century. For example, Golda Meir was born \"Golda Mabovitch\", took the name \"Golda Meyerson\" after her marriage to American Morris Meyerson, and, upon making Aliyah and at the urging of Moshe Sharett, Hebraized her last name to Meir.\n\nIn Persian, patronymics پَتوَند are formed by names ending with the suffix \"Pur\" \"پور\" for men and \"Dokht\" \"دُخت\" for women. For example: Shahpoor (son of king) and Sinapoor (Ebne sina). Depending on country, some suffixes are more common than others. For example, in Iran, the suffix \"pur\" is common while in Afghanistan, the suffix \"Zadah\" \"زاده\" or \"Zad\" \"زاد\" is common.\n\nIn Western Europe patronyms were formerly widespread but later became confined to Scandinavia and Iceland.\n\nIn England, names ending with the suffix \"son\" were often originally patronymic. In addition, the archaic French (more specifically, Norman) prefix \"fitz\" (cognate with the modern French \"fils\", meaning \"son\"), appears in England's aristocratic family lines dating from the Norman Conquest, and also among the Anglo-Irish. Thus there are names such as Fitzgerald and Fitzhugh. Of particular interest is the name \"Fitzroy\", meaning \"son of [the] king\", which was used by illegitimate royal children who were acknowledged as such by their fathers.\n\nThe use of \"Mac\" in some form was prevalent in Scottish Gaelic, Irish and Manx, in all of which it denotes \"son\". \"Mc\" is also a frequent anglicisation in both Scotland and Ireland. In Ireland, the forms \"Mag\" and \"M'\" are encountered. The prefix \"Mac\" is used to form a patronym, such as \"Mac Coinnich\" – or the anglicized 'Mackenzie' – son of Coinneach/Kenneth. The female equivalent of \"Mac\" is \"Nic\", condensed from \"nighean mhic\" (in Scottish Gaelic) or \"iníon mhic\" (in Irish), both meaning daughter. For example, the Scottish Gaelic surname, \"Nic Dhòmhnaill\" meaning 'daughter of a son of Dòmhnall' (in English, Donald), as in \"Mairi Nic Dhòmhnaill\", or Mary MacDonald.\n\nAt the north end of the Irish Sea, in Ulster, the Isle of Man and Galloway (indeed as far north as Argyll), \"Mac\" was frequently truncated in speech to /k/, leading to such anglicisations as \"Qualtrough\" (Son of Walter) & \"Quayle\" (son of Paul, cf. MacPhail) – usually beginning with \"C\", \"K\" or \"Q\". In Ireland, this truncation resulted in surnames such as \"Guinness\" (son of Aonghus, cf. MacAonghusa) beginning usually in \"C\" or \"G\" for patronymics prefixed with Mac, and in \"H\" (e.g. \"Hurley\" (descendant of Jarlath, cf. Ua h-Iarfhlatha/O'Hurley)) for surnames prefixed with \"O\". Colloquial Scottish Gaelic also has other patronymics of a slightly different form for individuals, still in use (for more information please see: Scottish Gaelic personal naming system).\n\nBefore the 1536 Act of Union, the Welsh did not generally employ surnames, but instead used epithets (e.g. Selyf Sarffgadau, \"Selyf the Battle-Serpent\"), patronyms (e.g. Rhodri ap Merfyn, \"Rhodri son of Merfyn\"), and (much less often) matronyms (e.g. Rhodri ap Nest, \"Rhodri son of Nest\") to identify people. Welsh, as a P-Celtic language, originally used \"map\" or \"mab\" instead of the Q-Celtic \"mac\" employed in Ireland and Scotland. These were later simplified to the modern Welsh \"ap\" and \"ab\". A common practice is to use \"ab\" before a father's name beginning with a vowel (e.g., Llywelyn ab Iorwerth), but they are also employed arbitrarily in many sources.\n\nDaughters were indicated by \"ferch\" or \"verch\" (mutated from \"merch\", \"girl, daughter\"). \"Angharad verch Owain\" would be \"Angharad, daughter of Owain\".\n\nAfter the Acts of Union, this led to many Welsh surnames being variants of their father or ancestor's personal name: \"ap\" or \"ab Ieuan\" often became \"Evans\"; \"ap Rhys\", \"Price\"; \"ap\" or \"ab Owain\", \"Bowen\"; \"ap Hywel\", \"Powell\" or \"Howell\". In addition to these Anglicised baptismal and official names, patronyms continued to be commonly employed in Welsh until the Industrial Revolution, particularly in the north and west of Wales. Patronyms were sometimes employed within the English names as well by using the father's personal name as the sons' middle name.\n\nSimilar rules might apply in Cornwall were it not for its earlier inclusion into England; and therefore patronyms (e.g.[m]ap Ros>Rouse, [m]ap Richard>Pritchard, Davies, Evans) are less common than toponyms (e.g. Tresillian, Trevithick, Nanskeval/Nankeville) and occupational surnames (e.g. An Gof, [An] Gove, \"(Blacksmith)\"; Helyer (Cornish dialect - possibly a slater or huntsman (helgher)).\n\nIn Dutch, patronymics were often used in place of family names or as middle names. Patronymics were composed of the father's name plus an ending \"-zoon\" for sons, \"-dochter\" for daughters. For instance, Abel Janszoon Tasman is \"Abel son of Jan Tasman\", and Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer: \"Kenau, daughter of Simon Hasselaer\". In written form, these endings were often abbreviated as \"-sz.\" and \"-dr.\" respectively e.g. Jeroen Cornelisz. \"Jeroen son of Cornelis\", or Dirck Jacobsz. The endings \"-s\", \"-se\" and \"-sen\" were also commonly used for sons and often for daughters too. In the northern provinces, \"-s\", as genitive case, was almost universally used for both sons and daughters. The suffix -\"x\" as in \"Tacx\" also denoted the son or daughter of Tac, and is now integrated as a complete name.\n\nPatronymics were common in the Dutch United Provinces until the French invasion in 1795 and subsequent annexation in 1810. As the Netherlands were now a province of France, a registry of births, deaths and marriages was established in 1811, whereupon emperor Napoleon forced the Dutch to register and adopt a distinct surname.\n\nIn France, the terms \"patronyme\" and \"nom patronymique\" had long been used interchangeably to designate the family name, meaning that it is inherited from the father.\n\nThe tradition of patronymic lineage is still used among some Canadian descendants of French colonists: in the oral tradition of many Acadians, for example, \"Marc à Pierre à Gérard\" (lit. \"Marc of Pierre of Gérard\"), means \"Marc, son of Pierre, grandson of Gérard\".\n\nIn the past, both in Spanish and Portuguese, the endings \"-ez\" and \"-es\" tended to be conflated since pronunciation was quite similar in the two languages. Today, Portuguese has been fully standardized to \"-es\"; Spanish is also standardized to \"-ez\", but it is very common to see archaic endings in \"-es\". For instance, Pires/Peres and Pérez are the modern forms of \"Peterson\" in Portuguese and Spanish.\n\nIn Portugal, there are some surnames which had a patronymic genesis, while still common they no longer indicate patronymic usage. For instance, \"Álvares\" was the son of \"Álvaro\" and \"Gonçalves\" was the son of \"Gonçalo\" (it was the case of Nuno Álvares Pereira, son of Álvaro Gonçalves Pereira, son of Gonçalo Pereira). Other cases include \"Rodrigues\" (\"son of Rodrigo\"), \"Nunes\" (\"son of Nuno\") and \"Fernandes\" (\"son of Fernando\").\nIn the same way the surname Soares means son of Soeiro (in Latin Suarius). It comes from Latin Suaricius (son of Suarius); the Latin genitive suffix \"-icius/a\" was used to indicate a patronymic. Later it became Suáriz, Suárez and eventually Soares. Another theory attributes the Iberian -ez style patronymics to Germanic (Visigothic) rather than Latin influence.\n\nSpanish patronyms follow a similar pattern to the Portuguese (e.g., López: of Lope; Hernández: of Hernán; Álvarez: of Álvaro). Common endings include -ez, -az, -is, and -oz. However, not all names with similar endings are necessarily patronymic. For example, Chávez is not the son of \"Chavo\", but comes from Galician or Portuguese \"Chaves\", meaning \"keys\", and its \"s\" stands for the plural form, as in key/keys in English.\n\nA list of some Iberian patronymics:\n\nIn Norse custom patronyms and matronyms were formed by using the ending -son (later -søn and -sen in Danish, Norwegian and German) to the genitive form of the father's name to indicate \"son of\", and -dóttir (Icelandic and Faroese -dóttir, Swedish and Norwegian -dotter, Danish and Norwegian -datter) for \"daughter of\". This name was generally used as a last name although a third name, a so-called byname based on location or personal characteristic, was often added to differentiate people and could eventually develop into a kind of family name. Some Early Modern examples of the latter practice, where the patronymic was placed after the given name and was followed by the surname, are Norwegian Peder Claussøn Friis, the son of Nicolas Thorolfsen Friis (Claus in Claussøn being short for Nicolas) and Danish Thomas Hansen Kingo, the son of Hans Thomsen Kingo.\n\nEventually, most Nordic countries replaced or complemented this system with the prevailing \"international\" standard of inherited family names. In Norway, for example, the parliament passed a family name act in 1923, citing the rising population and the need to avoid the confusion of new last names in every generation. The law does allow a person to retain a patronymic as a middle name in addition to the surname, as was common in Early Modern times; this is not a common practice, but does occur, a modern example being Audhild Gregoriusdotter Rotevatn. The Danish government outlawed the practice in 1856 and eased the regulations in 1904 to deal with the limited number of patronymics. In Sweden the practice of children keeping their father's and wives keeping their husband's patronymic as a surname occurred in the 1700s but was first prevalent in the late 1800s, still present yet uncommon in the 1900s and finally abolished in 1966. In 1982 the right to use patronyms (and matronyms) was partially restored, and from 1 July 2017 parents in Sweden are free to give their children patronyms/matronyms at birth instead of inherited family names.\n\nMatronyms were used exceptionally if the child was born out of wedlock or if the mother was much more high-born or well known than the father, a historical example being Sweyn Estridsson.\n\nIn Iceland, patronymics or matronymics are still used as last names and this is in fact compulsory by law, with a handful of exceptions. The father's name (occasionally with a minor alteration for genitive) plus the word \"son\" for sons, \"dóttir\" for daughters. For example, Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir (to be read in English as \"Jóhanna, daughter of Sigurð[ur]\").\n\nIn Finland, the use of patronymics was a result of relatively recent Swedish influence and remained uncommon outside official documents. Only in the 19th century did the use of patronymics gain any sort of popularity among the Finnish-speaking lower classes. Family names became obligatory in Finland by law in 1920.\n\nHistorically, patronymics were composed in Swedish fashion: the father's name and the suffix -n for genitive plus the word \"poika\" for sons, \"tytär\" for daughters. For example, Tuomas Abrahaminpoika (to be read in English as \"Tuomas, Abraham's son\") and Martta Heikintytär (to be read in English as \"Martta, Heikki's daughter\").\n\nIn Bulgarian, the patronymics are \"-ov\"/\"-ev\" and \"-ova\"/\"-eva\" for men and women, respectively. These are identical to the endings of \"family\" names in Bulgarian and some other Slavic family names (such as names in Russian and Czech). In Bulgarian official documents, the patronymic is inserted before the surname - e.g. \"Ivan Marinov Yordanov\" would be the son of \"Marin Yordanov\".\n\nThe use of patronymics was introduced in Armenia by Russians during the times of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Previously to that the use of patronymics was very limited. Patronymics are usually formed by addition of \"i\" (\"of\", pronounced as ee) to the father's name, e.g. if father's name is \"Armen\", the corresponding patronymic would be \"Armeni\" (of Armen). Russified version of the same patronymic would be \"Armenovich\" for males and \"Armenovna\" for females. After Armenia re-gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 a massive decline in the use of Russified patronymics occurred; nowadays few Armenians use patronymics outside of official contexts.\n\nMany Armenian surnames were once patronymics first used by distant ancestors or clan founders. These are characterized by the suffix \"-ian\" in Western Armenian, often transliterated as \"-yan\" in Eastern Armenian. These are appended to the given name, i.e. Kardashian, Asdvadzadourian, Hagopian, Khachadourian, Mardirosian, Bedrosian, Sarkissian, etc. Note that the suffix \"-ian\" was also appended to trades, as in Adakhtsakordzian (issued from the carpenter), Chalian (issued from the candlemaker, using the Turkish word \"chal\", meaning candle).\n\nOf particular note are the surnames of the children of married priests, or kahanas. Though not as common nowadays, it was customary for a long time for these children (particularly the sons) to change their last names to the name-in-religion of their father. For example, the son of Ter (Reverend) Bartev would change his last name to Ter Bartevian.\n\nIn Azeri, patronymics are formed through \"-oğlu\" (sometimes transliterated as \"ogly\") for males and \"qızı\" (often transliterated as \"gizi\" or \"kizi\") for females. Prior to the late 19th–early 20th century, patronymics were used as an essential part of a person's full name, i.e. \"Sardar Ilyas oğlu\" (\"Sardar, son of Ilyas\") and \"Mina Nabi qızı\" (\"Mina, daughter of Nabi\"), since surnames were mostly non-existent before Sovietization (with the exception of the upper and some middle-class families). After surnames were commonly adopted in Azerbaijan in the 1920s, patronymics still remained parts of full names, i.e. \"Sardar Ilyas oğlu Aliyev\" (\"Sardar Aliyev, son of Ilyas\"). Nowadays in Azerbaijan, patronymics sometimes replace surnames in unofficial use. Normally in such case, they are spelled as one word (i.e. \"Eldar Mammadoğlu\", \"Sabina Yusifqızı\"). Many Azeri surnames are also derived from Persian-style patronymics ending in \"-zadeh\" (\"Kazimzadeh\", \"Mehdizadeh\", etc.). They are found among both Caucasian and Iranian Azeris. However unlike the former, Azeris in Iran do not generally use patronymics in \"oglu\" / \"qizi\". Azeri patronymics are not to be confused with Turkish surnames in \"-oğlu\" and Greek surnames in -ογλού (\"-oglou\"), which do not have specific female versions and do not reflect names of fathers.\n\nIn Georgian, patronymics, when used, come with the addition of \"s\" to the end of the father's name, followed by \"dze\" for a man and \"asuli\" for a woman. For example, Joseph Stalin's actual name was Ioseb Besarionis Dze Jugashvili. \"s\" in Georgian is a possessive, and \"dze\" and \"asuli\" mean male and female descendant. After collapse of the USSR, patronymics in Georgia are disused as part of Russian tradition.\nGeorgian last names derive mostly from patronymics, nicknames and places of origin. Two common elements in Georgian last names, \"dze\" and \"shvili\" mean son of, and child, respectively.\n\nMost Greek surnames are patronymics by origin, albeit in various forms depending on ancestral locality. Diminutive suffixes which denote \"\"son of\", or more generally \"descendant of\"\", are produced as follows: starting with the given name Δημήτριος, \"Dēmétrios\", for example, the patronymic surnames Dēmētr\"ópoulos\" (Peloponnese), Dēmētr\"ákos\" (Laconia), Dēmētr\"éas\" (Messenian Mani), Dēmētr\"átos\" (Cephalonia), Dēmētr\"ákēs\" (Crete), Dēmētr\"iádēs\"/Dēmētr\"-ídēs\" (Pontus, Asia Minor), Dēmētr\"éllēs\" (Lesbos), Dēmétr\"oglou\" (Asia Minor) (identical to Turkish patronym \"-oğlu\"), or simply \"Dēmētríou\" (esp. common in Cyprus, the first name in the Genitive) are formed. The same principle can apply to surnames deriving from professions, for example from παπάς, \"papás\", priest, one derives the surnames \"Papadópoulos, Papadákos, Papadéas, Papadátos, Papadákēs, Papadéllēs, Papazoglou\" etc., all of which signify a \"priest's son\". The same principle(s) may apply in combination, e.g. \"Papanikoláou, Papanikolópoulos\", \"the son of the priest Nikolaos\". A daughter's family name is the same as the son's, but \"always\" declined in the Genitive, e.g. \"Dēmētropoúlou, Papanikoláou\" etc.\n\nIn addition to these surnames, \"actual\" patronymics are used in official documents as \"middle names\" preceding the surname. For example, the children of a \"Giánnēs Papadópoulos\" are, say, \"María Ioánnou Papadopoúlou\" and \"Andréas Ioánnou Papadópoulos\" (\"Ioánnou\" is the genitive case form of \"Ioánnēs\", which is the formal form of the father's name, \"Giánnēs\"). Traditionally, a married woman would adopt her husband's family name. Now, however, women in Greece can keep their own surname if they so choose.\n\nIn Hungarian, patronyms were traditionally formed with the ending \"-fi\" (sometimes spelled as \"-fy\" or \"-ffy\"). This system is no longer in common use, though traces of it can still be found in some frequent present-day surnames such as \"Pálfi\" (son of Paul), \"Győrfi\", \"Bánfi\" or in the name of the famous poet Sándor Petőfi (who chose this Hungarian form instead of his Slavic birth name \"Petrovics\"). In the Old Hungarian period (10th−16th century, see History of Hungarian), when surnames were not in common use, the full genitive was represented as in \"Péter fia András\" (\"Peter's son Andrew\"); these forms are in frequent use in charters and legal documents dated back to that time.\n\nIn Romanian, the endings \"-escu\" and \"-eanu\" were used, as in \"Petrescu\", 'son of Petre (Peter)'; many modern Romanian family names were formed from such patronymics. Less commonly, matronymics formed with the genitive form (using the prefix \"a-\") were used, as in \"Amariei\", '(son/daughter) of Maria'.\n\nIn East Slavic languages, the endings \"-ovich\", \"-evich\" and \"-ich\" are used to form patronymics for men. It would be cognate to the Latin genitive -ici, used for marking family line, and also as equivalent to: 'little' -Vladic= 'the little Vlad'-. For women, the ending is \"-yevna\", \"-ovna\" or \"-ichna\". For example, in Russian, a man named Ivan with a father named Nikolay would be known as Ivan Nikolayevich or \"Ivan, son of Nikolay\" (\"Nikolayevich\" being a patronymic). Likewise, a woman named Lyudmila with a father named Nikolay would be known as Lyudmila Nikolayevna or \"Lyudmila, daughter of Nikolay\" (\"Nikolayevna\" being a patronymic). For masculine names ending in a vowel, such as Ilya or Foma, when they are used as a base for patronymic, the corresponding endings are \"-ich\" (for men) and \"-inichna\" (for women). Examples in titles of classical Russian literature include\" The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin\", \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\" and \"The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich\".\n\nIn Russia, the patronymic is an official part of the name, used in all official documents, and when addressing somebody both formally and among friends. Individuals are addressed by their given name followed by patronymic (e.g., \"Mikhail Nikolayevich\") in many situations including on formal occasions, by colleagues at work, by acquaintances, or when addressed by someone younger in age. It is becoming more common for younger individuals (under 50) to drop the patronymic at work. In informal situations, if a person is called by a diminutive (such as Misha for Mikhail or Nastya for Anastasia), the patronymic is not used.\n\nIn colloquial, informal speech, it is also possible to contract the ending of a patronymic: thus Nikolayevich becomes Nikolaich, and Stepan Ivanovich becomes Stepan Ivanych or simply Ivanych as the given name may be omitted altogether. In this case the contraction, if possible, is obligatory: Ivan Sergeyevich Sidorov may be called \"Sergeich\" or, more rarely, \"Sergeyevich\". In contrast to male names, if a woman is called by her patronymic name without a given name, the patronymic is usually not contracted: \"Ivanovna\" but \"Mar' Ivanna\"; \"Sergeyevna\"/\"Sergevna\" is one exception, where both forms are fine. Typically, a patronymic name alone is a familiar form of addressing an older female.\n\nVuk Karadžić reported in the 19th century that Serbs sometimes used their old family names, and sometimes patronymics. Vuk Karadžić himself used patronymic Stefanović (son of Steven), and sometimes Karadzić, old family name. However, nowadays, the patronymic names in Serbia are mostly used on legal documents, and have the form of the father's name that says the child is 'of so and so'... example: Marija Dragoljuba Pavlovic, where Dragoljub is the father's name and 'Dragoljuba' literally means 'of Dragoljub'.\n\nIn Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, the patronymic names do not change form between masculine and feminine. Example: Marija Dragoljuba Pavlović (Dragoljub is the father's name; Dragoljuba is the form that says she is his daughter, or literally 'of Dragoljub').\n\nIn Turkish, the suffixes used to indicate paternal ancestry are \"-oğlu\" and \"-zade\", which indicate the ancestry as coming from a certain man. Like many other patronymics in other languages, with the formalization of naming conventions by laws in the late modern contemporary age many turned into surnames. After the 'Surname revolution' in 1934, many people chose professions or habitat as surnames with or without the suffix \"-oğlu\", such as \"Elbeyioğlu\", \"Bakkaloğlu\" or \"Giritlioğlu\" and with \"-zade\" such as \"Beyzade\", \"Mehmedzade\", \"Yusufzade\".\n\nIn Ukrainian, the female patronymic always ends with \"-івна\" \"(-ivna)\" or \"-ївна\" \"(-yivna)\". The male patronymic always ends with -\"ович\" \"(-ovych)\" or \"-йович\" \"(-yovych)\". Exception: \"Illia (Ілля)\" -> \"Illich (Ілліч)\" (e.g. Illia Illich Mechnikov), \"Sava (Сава)\" -> \"Savych (Савич)\", \"Iakiv (Яків)\" -> \"Iakovych (Якович)\"\n\n\n"}

In 651 BCE he had his priestly offices confirmed by Psamtik I, above all that of prophet of Amun of Teudjoi. After he had resigned from his powerful office of administrator of Upper Egypt, the priests of Teudjoi decided in 621 to wrest his priestly offices, which were well paid, from him and killed two of his grandsons. Pediese received police protection. He restored the fortunes of the temple at Teudjoi. Pediese's rights were inscribed on a stela. He signed over his prophet's portion to his son Wedjasematawi I.\n\nIn 591, Petiese II, son of Wedjasematawi I, accompanied Psamtik II on a campaign to Syria.

{"id": "179091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179091", "title": "Rat Pack", "text": "Rat Pack\n\nThe Rat Pack is a term used by the media to refer to an informal group of entertainers centered on the Las Vegas casino scene. Having its origins in a group of friends that met at the Los Angeles home of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, by the 1960s, it was the name used by the press and the general public to refer to a later variation of the group that called itself \"the Summit\" or \"the Clan\", featuring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop among others; they appeared together on stage and in films in the early 1960s, including the movies \"Ocean's 11\", \"Sergeants 3\", and \"Robin and the 7 Hoods\" (in the last film, Bing Crosby replaced Lawford). Sinatra, Martin, and Davis were regarded as the group's lead members.\n\nThe name \"The Rat Pack\" was first used to refer to a group of friends in New York. Several explanations have been offered for the famous name over the years. According to one version, the group's original \"Den Mother\", Lauren Bacall, after seeing her husband, Humphrey Bogart, and his friends return from a night in Las Vegas, said words to the effect of \"You look like a goddamn rat pack.\" \"Rat Pack\" may also be a shortened version of \"Holmby Hills Rat Pack\", a reference to the home of Bogart and Bacall which served as a regular hangout.\n\nVisiting members included Errol Flynn, Ava Gardner, Nat King Cole, Robert Mitchum, Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Leigh, Tony Curtis, Mickey Rooney, Lena Horne, Jerry Lewis and Cesar Romero.\n\nAccording to Stephen Bogart, the original members of the Holmby Hills Rat Pack were: Frank Sinatra (pack master), Judy Garland (first vice-president), Nicole Bassing (den mother), Sid Luft (cage master), Bogart (rat in charge of public relations), Swifty Lazar (recording secretary and treasurer), Nathaniel Benchley (historian), David Niven, Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, George Cukor, Cary Grant, Rex Harrison, and Jimmy Van Heusen. In his autobiography \"The Moon's a Balloon\", David Niven confirms that the Rat Pack originally included him but neither Sammy Davis, Jr. nor Dean Martin.\n\nThe 1960s version of the group included Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop. Marilyn Monroe, Angie Dickinson, Juliet Prowse, Buddy Greco, and Shirley MacLaine were often referred to as the \"Rat Pack Mascots\". \n\nThe post-Bogart version of the group (Bogart died in 1957) was reportedly never called that name by any of its members – they called it \"the Summit\" or \"the Clan\". \"The Rat Pack\" was a term used by journalists and outsiders, although it remains the lasting name for the group.\n\nOften, when one of the members was scheduled to give a performance, the rest of the Pack would show up for an impromptu show, causing much excitement among audiences, resulting in return visits. They sold out almost all of their appearances, and people would come pouring into Las Vegas, sometimes sleeping in cars and hotel lobbies when they could not find rooms, just to be part of the Rat Pack entertainment experience. The Rat Pack's appearances were of unprecedented value because the city would always become flooded with high rollers, wealthy gamblers who would routinely leave substantial fortunes in the casinos' coffers. The marquees of the hotels at which they were performing as individuals would read, for example, \"DEAN MARTIN - MAYBE FRANK - MAYBE SAMMY\" as seen on a Sands Hotel sign.\n\nPeter Lawford was a brother-in-law of President John F. Kennedy (dubbed \"Brother-in-Lawford\" by Sinatra), and Kennedy spent time with Sinatra and the others when he visited Las Vegas, during which members sometimes referred to the group as \"the Jack Pack\". Rat Pack members played a role in campaigning for Kennedy and the Democrats, appearing at the July 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Lawford had asked Sinatra if he would have Kennedy as a guest at his Palm Springs house in March 1962, and Sinatra went to great lengths (including the construction of a helipad) to accommodate the President. When Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy advised his brother to sever his ties to Sinatra because of the entertainer's association with Mafia figures such as Sam Giancana, the stay was cancelled. Kennedy instead chose to stay at rival Bing Crosby's estate, which further infuriated Sinatra. Lawford was blamed for this, and Sinatra \"never again had a good word for [him]\" from that point onwards. Lawford's role in the upcoming \"4 for Texas\" was written out, and his part in \"Robin and the 7 Hoods\" was given to Bing Crosby.\n\nOn June 20, 1965, Sinatra, Martin, and Davis, with Johnny Carson as the emcee (substituting for Bishop, who was out with a bad back), performed their only televised concert together during the heyday of the Pack at the Kiel Opera House in St. Louis, a closed-circuit broadcast done as a fundraiser for Dismas House (the first halfway house for ex-convicts) and fed live to movie theatres across the country. Thirty years later Paul Brownstein tracked down a print of the \"lost\" show in a St. Louis closet after someone noticed mysterious cameras onstage during a CBS documentary on Sinatra which filmed part of the show. It has since been broadcast on Nick at Nite (in 1998) as part of The Museum of Television & Radio Showcase series and released on DVD as part of the \"Ultimate Rat Pack Collection: Live & Swingin\".\n\nIn 1981, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr., appeared together in the film \"Cannonball Run\", and were joined by Sinatra in the sequel \"Cannonball Run II\". This would be the last time that the three would appear in a movie together (Shirley MacLaine also appears in the latter film).\n\nIn December 1987, at Chasen's restaurant in Los Angeles, Sinatra, Davis, and Martin announced a 29-date tour, called \"Together Again\". At the press conference to announce the tour, Martin joked about calling the tour off, and Sinatra rebuked a reporter for using the term \"Rat Pack\", referring to it as \"that stupid phrase\".\n\nDean Martin's son, Dean Paul Martin, died in a plane crash in March 1987 on the San Gorgonio Mountain in California, the same mountain where Sinatra's mother, Dolly, was killed in a plane crash ten years earlier. Martin had since become increasingly dependent on alcohol and prescription drugs. Davis had hip replacement surgery two years previously, and was estranged from Sinatra because of Davis' use of cocaine. Davis was also experiencing severe financial difficulties, and was promised by Sinatra's people that he could earn between six and eight million dollars from the tour.\n\nMartin had not made a film or recorded since 1984, and Sinatra felt that the tour would be good for Martin, telling Davis, \"I think it would be great for Dean. Get him out. For that alone it would be worth doing\". Sinatra and Davis still performed regularly, yet had not recorded for several years. Both Sinatra and Martin had made their last film appearances together in 1984's \"Cannonball Run II\", a film which also starred Davis. This marked the trio's first feature film appearance since 1964's \"Robin and the 7 Hoods\". Martin expressed reservations about the tour, wondering whether they could draw as many people as they had in the past. After private rehearsals, at one of which Sinatra and Davis had complained about the lack of black musicians in the orchestra, the tour began at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena on March 13, 1988, to a sold-out crowd of 14,500. \n\nDavis opened the show, followed by Martin and then Sinatra; after an interval, the three performed a medley of songs. During the show, Martin threw a lit cigarette at the audience.\n\nMartin withdrew from the tour after just five shows, with the official reason stated as being a flare-up of a kidney problem. Sinatra and Davis continued the tour under the title \"The Ultimate Event\" with Liza Minnelli replacing Martin as the third member of the trio.\n\nDavis's associate stated that Sinatra's people were skimming the top of the revenues from the concerts, as well as stuffing envelopes full of cash into suitcases after the performances. In August 1989, after Davis experienced throat pain, he was diagnosed with throat cancer which caused his death in May 1990. Davis was buried with a gold watch that Sinatra had given him at the conclusion of \"The Ultimate Event Tour\".\n\nA 1988 performance of \"The Ultimate Event\" in Detroit was recorded and shown on Showtime the following year as a tribute to the recently deceased Davis. A review in \"The New York Times\" praised Davis's performance, describing him as \"pure, ebullient, unapologetic show business.\"\n\nConcerning the group's reputation for womanizing and heavy drinking, Joey Bishop stated in a 1998 interview: \"I never saw Frank, Dean, Sammy or Peter drunk during performances. That was only a gag! And do you believe these guys had to chase broads? They had to chase 'em away!\"\n\n\nArchival footage of Lawford and Sinatra were used in the 1974 compilation film \"That's Entertainment!\".\n\nShirley MacLaine appeared in the 1958 film \"Some Came Running\" along with Sinatra and Martin. She had a major role (and Sinatra a cameo) in the 1956 Oscar-winning film \"Around the World in 80 Days\". MacLaine played a Hindu princess who is rescued by, and falls in love with, original Rat Pack associate David Niven, and Sinatra had a non-speaking, non-singing role as a piano player in a saloon, whose identity is concealed from the viewer until he turns his face toward the camera during a scene featuring Marlene Dietrich and George Raft. MacLaine appeared alongside Sinatra in the 1960 film \"Can-Can\". She also had an appearance in the 1960 film \"Ocean's 11\" as a drunken woman. The 1984 film \"Cannonball Run II\", with MacLaine, marked the final time members of the Rat Pack shared theatrical screen-time together.\n\nA biopic, \"The Rat Pack\", made by HBO in 1998, starred Ray Liotta as Sinatra, Joe Mantegna as Martin and Don Cheadle as Davis, dramatizing their private lives and, in particular, their roles in the 1960 presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy.\n\n\"Christmas with the Rat Pack\", a collection of holiday tunes sung by Sinatra, Martin and Davis, was released in 2001. \"\" went on sale in 2003. A concert featuring the three men, \"Live from the Sands\" in Las Vegas, also is available on CD.\n\n\"\" tribute show originated on stage in London in 2000 and has been running continuously since then throughout Europe and North America.\n\n\n\n"}

Muhammad and Imams' words and deeds are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin (known as \"ismah\", or infallibility) and must be chosen by divine decree, or \"nass\", through the Prophet.\n\nIt is believed in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, divine wisdom, is the source of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called \"Hikmah\" and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees. Although the Imam is not the recipient of a divine revelation, he has a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as al-Jafr and al-Jamia. Imamate, or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.\n\nAccording to Twelvers, there is at all times an Imam of the era who is the divinely appointed authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. Ali was the first of the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed by male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of Husayn ibn Ali, who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali. The twelfth and final Imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in the Major Occultation until he returns to bring justice to the world. It is believed by Twelver Shia and Alevi Muslims that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the Hadith of the Twelve Successors. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in occultation.\n\nThe Twelve Imams also have a leading role within some Sufi orders and are seen as the spiritual heads of Islam, because most of the Silsila \"(spiritual chain)\" of Sufi orders lead back to one of the Twelve Imams.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51289352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51289352", "title": "Widowhood effect", "text": "Widowhood effect\n\nThe widowhood effect is the increase in the probability of a person dying a relatively short time after their long-time spouse has died. The pattern indicates a sharp increase in risk of death for the widower, particularly but not exclusively, in the three months closest thereafter the death of the spouse. This process of losing a spouse and dying shortly after has also been called \"dying of a broken heart\". Becoming a widow is often a very detrimental and life changing time in a spouse's life, that forces them to go through changes that they may not have anticipated to make for a significant amount of time. Responses of grief and bereavement due to the loss of a spouse increases vulnerability to psychological and physical illnesses (Ramadas & Kuttichira, 2013).\n\nPsychologically, losing a long-term spouse can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt. Physical illness may also occur as the body becomes more vulnerable to emotional and environmental stressors. There are many factors that may be affected when one becomes a widow. A widow (or widower if referring to a male who lost a spouse) tends to have a decline in health regulation. Higher prevalence in mortality rates are noted among bereaved spouses during the first six months of bereavement compared to the last six months of bereavement. The most crucial are said to be the first three months during grief processing. Grieving spouses are more vulnerable during these few months not only health wise but socially and physically. During this early period of bereavement spouses tend to have less interest in their health as well as physical appearance caring less about continuing with medications or adapting healthy behaviors such as eating healthy or exercising. Also, they are likelier to practice risky behaviors and commit suicide. Men on the other hand, are more likely to look for social support such as friends, family, or support groups regarding the matter.\n\nThis effect appears to be far more prevalent in older married couples than in younger married couples. As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows. Through the many studies that have been conducted over the years, it has been found that the widowhood effect affects the mortality rates of people with varying levels of severity depending on their genders and religions.It is far more frequent in more seasoned, long-term, elder couples than in recently married couples. Since the topic has only been recently studied within this last decade, and due to the prevalence of older couples being affected, most widows in similar studies are typically over the age of 50 (Jegtvig, 2013).\n\nAlthough there have not been many studies, the phenomenon is one of the best documented examples of the effect of social relations on health. Through the numerous studies that have been directed throughout the years, it has been found that the widowhood impact influences the death rates of individuals with changing levels of stringencies relying upon their sexual orientations and religions. There are many theories as to what causes this to occur. There are many factors and theories about the widowhood effect, but in general, a study on a large population sample has suggested rates of death nearly double during the first three months after loss of a spouse, and quickly taper thereafter. (Moon, et al., 2013)\n\nBoth men and women respond differently to the death of their spouse. In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women. Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.\n\nThe majority of peer-reviewed articles suggest that it is indeed women that are more frequently at risk of succumbing to the widowhood effect. A collaborative study by Gary R. Lee et al. (2001) surveyed 1686 married and widowed people age 65 or older using data from 1988 National Survey of Families and Households. The study took into account the psychological well-being of each person on a Center for Epidemiologic Studies— Depression scale (CES-D), and found that women were further depressed by the loss of their spouse than men were. Women were also more likely to die soon after the death of their spouse compared to men. The researchers hypothesized that this was because older married women had a higher baseline happiness than their spouses, so they had more happiness to lose. Women in this study were also less likely to be avid church goers, despised chores, and were not as adept at helping their adult children. The lack of social behavior and general activity may contribute to the widowhood effect's influence on female mortality.\n\nExperimenters involved in the study regarding: \"The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes\", took a deeper look into the overall health differences between recent widowers and those who are currently involved in a marriage (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Mental health alterations include those of depression and socially extracting yourself were the most common for women who have become widowed in the past year or so (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Although some of these women were shown to extract them selves from social settings, the study also supported an alternate hypothesis that women experiencing the effects of widowhood are less likely to engage coping mechanisms such as support groups, fellow widowers, and overall strong support systems such as close friends and family (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003).\n\nIn a study done by Stahl and Shultz, they found that the death of a woman’s spouse affected her physical activity (2014). Women’s physical activity increases immediately following the death of a spouse, and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms (Stahl & Shultz, 2014). In the year following the death of a spouse, women are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die (Stahl & Shultz, 2014). Women in the youngest age group of this study (55– 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the death of their spouse (Brenn & Ytterstad, 2016). Elwert and Christakis found that within the first month of bereavement after widowhood morality is largest and doesn’t decline sharply until the sixth month of widowhood for females, compared to only the third month for males (2006).\n\nNicholas A. Christakis of Harvard and Felix Elwert of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 9 years’ worth of data gathered from almost 373,189 elderly married couples in the U.S. Their findings showed an 18 percent increase in “all-cause mortality” for women whose husbands died first; for men, the risk is 16 percent (Elwert 2008). Although the percentage of females was higher than males, it is not a significant difference to state that women are more affected than men. It is hard to say whether males or females suffer from the widowhood effect more, however it is clear that it is higher in couples that are older.\n\nThe death of a spouse can have a major impact on a person’s mental health. Each individual may respond to their spouse’s death differently. After the death of a spouse many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues (Avis, Brambilla, Vass, & Mckinlay, 1991). The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Women become more depressed in widowhood compared to men because women may not have as strong of a support group. Married women also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the death of their spouse could drastically alter this happiness. Men may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while women tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the death of a spouse but the rates of depression in women tends to be higher than in men (Lee, DeMaris, & Sullivan, 2001).\n\nRecently, there has been a phenomenon discussed and researched dubbed the takotsubo condition, also referred to as the broken heart syndrome (Brenn & Ytterstad, 2016). Takotsubo has been discussed in contexts surrounding great physical and emotional stress, such as circumstance in which someone has been widowed, and emotional stress has long been associated with myocardial infarction. In their research, Brenn and Ytterstad saw an increase in death of women 55–64 years old due to heart disease in the first week of widowhood than married women 55–64 years old (2016). Although takotsubo is not considered to be the direct cause of death at this time, it is an observed phenomenon (Brenn & Ytterstad, 2016.)\n\nElderly widows experience changes in their social lives prior to and following the deaths of their spouses. A study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood spent more time with family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to a network of family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the death of their husband or wife. Elderly widows were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends. It has been noted that widows who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss of a spouse affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic (Bennett, 2012). With all of these aspects of a widowed individuals being affected maintaining a sense of normality is important to help avoid depression like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals.\n\nA study conducted by Rosato, O’Reilly and Wright (2015) revealed that there is a significant difference in urban-rural variation in the social environment as well as in health outcomes. There is evidence that social support from family and friends have better health outcomes on mortality rates. Investigations showed that the race of the partner influences widowhood effect; whites in endogamous marriages had greater mortality risks that were not obvious among blacks, which the authors concluded was due to a high level of family support for elderly among black families versuswhite families. Moreover, the study also found differences in urban and rural areas around the world. They found that elderly married couples in the US suffered significant mortality risks compared to those in Ireland where older people living in more rural areas receive more social support from their families, and they live with their children, while in the US elderly people live in care homes. As a result, mortality rates are greater in urban areas and less in rural areas.\n\nIn a study done by Elwert and Christakis, they found that there was no widowhood effect found in endogamously married black men or women (2016). Deducing this finding, they proposed that this might be because blacks are able to extend their marital survival advantage into widowhood. This is likely because blacks are prone to have kin nearer to help take care of them, they may be more self-sufficient than their white counterparts, and there is greater religious participation in blacks that may help them with spiritual comfort (Elwert & Christakis, 2016). Whites were found to have “a large and enduring widowhood effect” because there is no reparation to make up for the survival advantages that marriage gave them, even if they have been widowed for years (Elwert & Christakis, 2008).\n\nThe widowhood effect appears to have a higher impact in rural and intermediate areas compared to urban areas. One factor may be that there are greater distances to primary care services in rural areas, and this increases mortality due to discouraged health checkups (Wright, 2015). It is known that the size of family and social network coincides with physical functioning; the bigger the social group one belongs to the better they can physically function. Residential areas near green areas are associated with an increase in physical activity and lowered mortality (Wright, 2015). Researchers measured peak flow to show the increases or decreases in physical functioning, and the results suggest that married subjects have a higher peak flow compared to those divorced or widowed (Clouston, 2014).\n\nIt was suggested that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., & Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased mortality rate of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The results provided evidence that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood.\n\nIn April 2016, the American Heart Association published an article regarding phenomenon referred to as \"broken heart syndrome\". This particular syndrome seems to occur when a person experiences an overwhelming amount of stress in their life in a short period of time. The cases mentioned involved both positive events like winning the lottery as well as negative events like experiencing the death of a spouse. Though broken heart syndrome has been misdiagnosed as a heart attack, the differences between the two phenomena are clear. Heart attacks are the result of a blockage of arteries, but broken heart syndrome is the result of a hormone induced enlargement of a portion of the heart. The enlarged region of the heart is less effective in regards to pumping blood, and the normal sized regions of the heart are forced to work harder as a result.\n Widowhood effect is important to be aware of because of the affects that it can have on the body; mentally, physically, emotionally. Although there is no correct coping mechanism when losing a partner, it is important to find preventative ways to fight this from occurring because of the depressive symptoms and state of mental health that are a result from a partner passing away. Being aware of widowhood effect and acknowledging the feelings, such as grieving over that individual can be a way of coping with their current situation. Individuals that result to safe methods with grieving such as counseling or finding different hobbies can decrease their chances of experiencing widowhood effect. \nThere is no universally accepted “proper” method or way to grieve or adjust to life after loss; it varies among individuals, influenced by their cultural and social practices, personality, and the circumstances surrounding the death. Even though grief processing varies, there are ways to reduce the effects of widowhood. Since a spouse is often one’s primary source of social interactions, maintaining and establishing social bonds is a crucial aspect in determining the outcome of a widowed individual’s bereavement (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Social participation may be utilized “as an active coping strategy” as discovered in a study by Rebecca Utz and colleagues (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Additionally, the loss of a spouse means the loss of a partner; the loss of a supportive presence with whom responsibility was shared amongst one another. Studies have shown that for couples who followed traditional gender roles, adjustment to life after their loss was often more difficult than for couples who did not (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Undertaking the responsibilities previously considered the ‘job’ of one’s deceased partner is often hard to handle on top of processing the loss; therefore, the utilization of organizations built to support and help widowed individuals may also prove to be helpful in reducing grief. The Widowed Persons Service (WPS) and their parent organization, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), are two organizations which provide aid specifically to widowed individuals (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Effective and safe methods of grief processing are important for all individuals dealing with loss; however, the utilization of organizations may prove to be beneficial for those who need a little more help.\n\nDeSpelder, L.

The mother, Joan Flower, died on the way to her trial, and the two daughters, Margaret and Philippa, were supposed to be hanged in Lincoln. It is said that Phillipa drugged the guards and managed to escape and make her way to Kent where she died after having three children.\n\nJoan, Margaret and Philippa Flowers were \"known to be herbal healers\" and came from a local family that \"had fallen on hard times\". They accepted employment as servants with the 6th Earl and Countess of Rutland, at Belvoir Castle near Grantham, Lincolnshire, when additional staff were needed for an upcoming visit by King James I. But the sisters, and their mother, were unpopular with the other staff, and there were suggestions of theft, and misdemeanors. All three were dismissed and only Joan was given a payment of severance amounting to \"40 shillings, a bolster (pillow), and a mattress of wool\".\n\nAfter the sisters were dismissed, the Earl and Countess fell ill, suffering from \"vomiting and convulsions\". Their son and heir, Henry, Baron de Ros, died, and was buried on 26 September 1613. Their younger children, Francis, and daughter Katherine, suffered similarly and Francis died 7 March 1620. The deaths of the two boys left the Earl without a male heir and Earldom passed to his brother after his own death in 1632.\n\nThree years after Henry's death, on 16 July 1616, nine women were hanged as witches in Leicestershire for having bewitched a young boy and, in charges similar to those in the Flowers' case, were said to have kept cats as familiars. But it was to be five years after the Flowers were dismissed from Belvoir Castle, and following the death of their second son, Francis, that the Rutlands had the Flowers arrested, before Christmas of 1618. After initial examinations, in February 1619, by the Earl of Rutland, Hon. Robert Bertie, Lord Willoughby de Eresby, Sir George Manners, Sir William Pelham, Sir Henry Hastings, clergyman Samuel Fleming and others, the women were to be taken to Lincoln gaol.\n\nWhen arrested Joan Flower professed her innocence. She was not known to be a Church-goer, but at Ancaster, en route to the prison at Lincoln, she asked for bread as a substitute for the Eucharist. She claimed that something so blessed could not be consumed by a witch but she was to choke and die, after the first bite.\n\nAt Lincoln, Margaret was to accuse her mother of witchcraft, while Phillipa admitted to witchcraft on behalf of herself, Margaret and Joan. The sisters said they had entered into communion with familiar spirits that had assisted them with their schemes. The mother's familiar was a cat named \"Rutterkin\". The women admitted that they stole the glove of Lord Ros and gave it to their mother, who had dipped it in boiling water, stroked it along Rutterkin's back, and pricked it. Combined with some incantations this supposedly caused Lord Ros to become ill and die. An attempt to harm Lady Katherine, the Earl's daughter, had failed when it was found that \"Rutterkin\" had no power over her. The women had also taken some feathers from the quilt of Rutland's bed and a pair of gloves. By boiling these in water mixed with blood they cast spells to prevent the Earl and Countess from having any more children. Both women admitted to experiencing visions of devils and that their familiar spirits visited them and sucked at their bodies.\n\nDuring the examination, they revealed the names of other women who had aided them: Anne Baker of Bottesford; Joan Willimot of Goadby; and Ellen Greene of Stathern.\n\nAll three women were taken for examination and revealed that they too had visions and consorted with familiar spirits. Willimott said her familiar was called \"Pretty\" and had been blown into her mouth by her former master in the form of a fairy, later reappearing in the form of a woman who asked her to give up her soul. Willimott testified more as a cunning woman than a witch, and insisted \"Pretty\" only helped her to inquire about the health of people she had attempted to heal:\n\nGreene claimed that she had accompanied Willimot into a wood where she said Willimot had conjured up two spirits in the form of a kitten and a \"moldewarp\" (mole) which had climbed on her shoulders and sucked at her ears. Greene sent these familiars to kill a man and woman with whom she had argued and both died within a fortnight. Baker also confessed to possessing a familiar in the form of a white dog, but most of her testimony concerned the visions she had witnessed.\n\nMargaret and Philippa Flowers were tried before Henry Hobart, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and Edward Bromley, a Baron of the Exchequer, and found guilty. and Margaret was hung at Lincoln castle on 11 March 1619.\n\nLater that year a ballad, \"Damnable Practises of Three Lincolnshire Witches Joane Flower and Her Two Daughters\", printed by 'G. Eld for John Barnes' appeared.\n\nThe Earl and Countess remained so convinced that their son had been killed by the effects of witchcraft that they had it inscribed on their monument at Bottesford church. It reads, in part:\n\nIn 1953, Hilda Lewis published a historical romance, \"The Witch and the Priest\", which consists of a series of conversations between Samuel Fleming, the clergyman who oversaw the Flowers' examinations, and the ghost of Joan Flower.\n\nIn 2013, historian Tracey Borman suggested that the Flowers women may have been framed by a favourite of King James I, the Lincolnshire born George Villiers, who was created Duke of Buckingham in 1623. Watson's theory is that Villiers had plans to marry the Rutland's daughter Katherine and, with her two brothers dead, inherit the title. Watson argues 'he had them poisoned – then framed Joan Flower and her two daughters as witches to create a smokescreen to cover up his own guilt'. After the execution of the Flowers sisters, Villiers went on to marry the Rutland's sole heir Katherine on 16 May 1620.\n\n"}

It was one of many witch trials in the early modern period, but scholar Barbara Rosen claims it \"attracted probably more notice than any other in the sixteenth century\".\n\nThe trials of the witches occurred during the sixteenth century at Warboys in Huntingdonshire. The first allegations were made in November 1589 by Jane Throckmorton, the 10-year-old daughter of Robert Throckmorton the Squire of Warboys when she started suffering from fits (see Initial Allegations below). She accused the 76-year-old Alice Samuel of being the cause; this was echoed by Jane’s four sisters and some household servants who began exhibiting similar symptoms. When Alice Samuel was brought forward to the children, they became more ill and had the urge to scratch her.\n\nRobert Throckmorton was a close friend of Sir Henry Cromwell, one of the wealthiest commoners in England and the grandfather of Oliver Cromwell. In March 1590, Lady Cromwell came to Warboys to visit. At the Throckmorton house, she interviewed Alice Samuel and what came after the interview served to confirm the suspicions the Throckmortons had. Lady Cromwell was tormented by Alice Samuel in her dreams, and after some time she became ill and died (buried 1592). This was enough proof to put Alice Samuel through a trial that would find her and the rest of her family guilty.\n\nThe first allegations declaring Alice as a practitioner of witchcraft were made in November 1589. Following this, there were a total of twelve maid-servants of the Throckmorton household (in addition to the five daughters) who experienced fits and the torment of Alice Samuell’s witchcraft. Jane’s fits were described as such: \"Sometimes she would neese [sneeze] very loud and thick for the space of half an hour together; and evidently as one in a great trance and sound lay quietly as long, soon after would begin to swell and heave up her belly so as none was able to bend her or keep her down, sometime thee would shake one leg and no other part of her, as if the palsie had been in it, sometimes the other, presently she would shake one of her arms and then the other, and soon after her head, as if she had been infected with the running palsie\".\n\nJane's mother and grandmother were by the child’s side while other neighbors came to see her. When Alice Samuel came in, the child proclaimed: \"Grandmother look where the old witch sitteth (pointing to Samuell) did you ever see one more like a witch than she is: Take off her black thrumbed [shaggy or fringed] cap, for I cannot abide to look on her\". Jane's mother thought nothing of this at first, thinking her child was sleep deprived and sick. However, because Jane continued to get worse, her parents sent her urine to Doctor Barrow of Cambridge, who sent medicine to Jane three separate times thinking it would heal her. It did not. After the third time, the Doctor inquired whether there were any signs of sorcery or witchcraft involved that the parents could see. Jane’s urine was then sent to a family acquaintance, Master Butler, for examination and he sent back the same remedies that Doctor Barrow had sent. Exactly a month later, on the same day almost to the hour, two more of Master Throckmorton’s daughters fell sick to the same illness that was afflicting Jane.\n\nThese daughters, two to three years older than Jane, cried out: \"Take her away, look where she standeth here before us in a black thrumbed cap it is she that hath bewitched us and she will kill us if you do not take her away\".\n\nThe parents were then worried, but could not understand why any such harm would come to them, for they had only moved into the town the \"Michaelmas before\" (September 29, 1588). Their youngest daughter, nine years old, fell sick less than a month later. Soon after this, the oldest daughter, fifteen years old, fell sick. She was sickest out of the five. Both cried out against Alice Samuell. Their eldest sister, having been the strongest, strived with the spirit, and was grievously tortured not being able to overcome it. This caused her to \"(neefe), screech and groan very fearfully, sometimes it would heave up her belly and bounce up her body with such violence that she was not kept upon her bed\". When sitting in a chair, her fits often caused her to break that chair.\n\nThe daughters could not see, hear or feel while in these fits. They accused Mother Samuell, asking for her to be taken away. These fits would sometimes last for half a day and happened up to six or seven times a day. They believed that God freed them of this sorcery and afterwards, the sisters remembered nothing of what they had been saying.\n\nIn March 1590, Lady Cromwell and Alice had a discussion regarding the accusations made against Alice. During this conversation, Lady Cromwell reportedly grabbed a pair of scissors and cut a lock of hair off Alice, and gave it to Mrs. Throckmorton to burn (a folk remedy believed to weaken a witch's power). That night, Lady Cromwell had nightmares, became ill and later died in 1592.\n\nFollowing the death of Lady Cromwell, a local parson convinced Alice to admit to witchcraft, which she retracted the very next day. However, she confessed again when she was brought before the Bishop of Lincoln, and taken to Huntingdon where she was imprisoned with her daughter and husband. The family was tried in April 1593 for the murder by witchcraft of Lady Cromwell. Alice’s words to Lady Cromwell (\"Madam, why do you use me thus? I never did you any harm as yet\") were used against her at the trial, and all three were found guilty and eventually hanged.\n\nThe jailer and his wife examined the corpses.\nHistorian Jim Kermode argues that the discovery of a witches' mark (also known as a \"devil's mark\") was important legal proof at this period in England. \"[I]t gradually became accepted that the mark, with women, most commonly took the form of a teat-like growth in the pudenda\".\n\nThis tale of the jailer's postmortem examination has been widely quoted in modern scholarship, for example with reference to the animal/human divide, the \"sado-erotic fascination of the witches' teat\", and particularly in feminist interpretations of the Early Modern witch trials. It is also cited by writers such as Lynn Picknett.\n\nThe scholar George Kittredge (1860–1941) called the Warboys trial \"the most momentous witch-trial that had ever occurred in England\", partially because it had \"demonstrably produced a deep and lasting impression on the class that made laws\". He makes a case that the Warboys trial influenced the passage of the Witchcraft Act of 1604.\n\nFollowing the hangings, Robert Throckmorton left Warboys hastily, his wife allegedly dying shortly before his departure.\n\n\n"}

The trio knew each other during their childhood years, growing up in Shorewood, Wisconsin and attending Shorewood High School which is sometimes referenced in their work. While attending the University of Wisconsin–Madison, the trio founded a small theater known as The Kentucky Fried Theater in 1971 which led to their sketch comedy film \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\".\n\nThis was followed in 1980 by the trio's breakout hit \"Airplane!\", which remains a revered comedic milestone. Subsequent collaborations include the TV series \"Police Squad!\", its subsequent \"Naked Gun\" trilogy and the films \"Top Secret!\" and \"Ruthless People\". All of their projects relied heavily on parodies, visual gags and breaking of the fourth wall, and established a strong cult following. The notable stylistic exception is \"Ruthless People\", a more traditional farce that was directed by the trio but unlike their other productions, not written by them.\n\nProminent ZAZ actors and actresses include Leslie Nielsen, Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg and Charlie Sheen. The trio's status as a three-person team of co-directors is highly unusual, although some of their later projects were directed by David Zucker working solo and with Jerry Zucker and Abrahams credited only as producers and/or writers. Each member of the group also had individual solo careers:\n\n\nBelow is a filmography chart on which films the trio have directed together and solo:\n\n"}
