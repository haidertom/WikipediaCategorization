Separated from a larger convoy, they were ambushed in the Iraqi-held town of Nasiriyah on March 23, 2003. Out of thirty-three soldiers, eleven were killed and seven captured in the fire fight. Several weapons jammed in the firefight. The following soldiers were captured by Iraqi forces:\n\nWhen they surrendered, they feared the worst. Miller held out little hope for mercy. \"I thought they were going to kill me,\" he said. \"That was the first thing I asked when they captured me: 'Are \nyou going to kill me?' They said no. . . . I still didn't believe them.\"\n\nSoon after their capture, Jessica Lynch was taken to an Iraqi hospital due to her serious injuries. The other five POWs did not know about Lynch surviving until after they were released. After their capture, the five remaining members of the ambushed 507th would become famous as bloody and beaten. They were then interviewed by Iraq TV, and the footage was shown worldwide by Al Jazeera. In the interview, Private First Class Patrick Miller was asked why he came to Iraq; his reply was \"I come to fix broke stuff.\" Asked if he came to shoot Iraqis, he answered, \"No, I come to shoot only if I am shot at. They don't bother me, I don't bother them.\"\nOn March 24, they were joined by Chief Warrant Officers David Williams, 31, and Ronald Young Jr., 26, whose Apache chopper, from the 1-227 Helicopter Attack Battalion, had been shot down in central Iraq during the attack on Karbala.\n\nThe prisoners were taken to Baghdad, where they were isolated in separate cells of a drab prison with concrete walls and a tin roof. As American troops got closer, the soldiers were shuffled from building to building. The Iraqi captors worked feverishly to stay one step ahead of the advancing units.\n\nAs it became clear that the war was over for the Iraqis, some of their captors approached a Marine unit from the 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, Delta Co., 3rd Platoon which was a part of Task Force Tripoli that had been pushing up toward Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown. A Marine battalion was sent to check on the intelligence and found the seven POWs with a confused Iraqi guard unit, whose officers had fled.\n\nOn April 13, 2003, 21 days after the 507th members were captured, the 3rd Light Armored Recon Marines burst in on the Iraqi guards who gave up without a fight. Ordering everyone on the floor, a Marine gave an order to \"stand up if you're American!\" Given dirty prison clothes and fed little food, the prisoners lost a lot of weight and with their garb, and beards they looked like Iraqis. \"At first,\" Spc. Shoshana Johnson remembers that, \"they didn't realize I was American. They said, 'Get down, get down,' and one of them said, 'No, she's American.' \"\n\nWithin hours, the seven were on their way to Kuwait International Airport inside a Marine Corps KC-130 transport plane, the first stop before the United States. Amid sobs, cheers and laughter, they told their stories to two reporters accompanying them on the flight. \"I broke down. I was like, 'Oh my God, I'm home,'\" Johnson said.\n\nDuring the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Iraqi Saddam Fedayeen irregular forces were involved in executing several Coalition prisoners of war.\n\nSergeant Donald Walters was initially reported to have been killed in the March 23 ambush of the 507th Maintenance Company. However, witnesses later reported that they had seen Walters being guarded by several Fedayeen in front of a building. Forensics work later found Walters' blood in front of the building and blood spatter suggesting he died from two gunshot wounds to the back at close range. This led the Army to conclude that Walters had been executed after being captured.\n\nJessica Lynch was reportedly raped and sodomized by Iraqi forces, based on scars, though she has no recollection of it happening.\n\nAlso on March 23, a British Army engineering unit made a wrong turn near the town of Az Zubayr, which was still held by Iraqi forces. The unit was ambushed and Sapper Luke Allsopp and Staff Sergeant Simon Cullingworth became separated from the rest. Both were captured and executed by Iraqi forces. In 2006, a video of Allsopp lying on the ground surrounded by Iraqi irregular forces was discovered.\n\nMarine Sergeant Fernando Padilla-Ramirez was reported missing from his supply unit after an ambush north of Nasiriyah on March 28. His body was later dragged through the streets of Ash Shatrah and hung in the town square. His body was later taken down and buried by sympathetic locals. His body was discovered by American forces on April 10.\n\nIn addition, the showing of captured soldiers on television, as was done with some of the captured soldiers of the 507th Maintenance Company, was a violation of the Geneva Conventions.\n\n\n"}

The first, Bernard Garnier became antipope in 1424 and died c. 1429. The second, Jean Carrier, became antipope c. 1430 and apparently left office, whether by death or resignation, by 1437.\n\nNeither of these claimants was supported by more than a very small faction within the Church. They claimed to be the successors to Benedict XIII, one of the parties to the great Papal Schism. In 1417, the Council of Constance resolved the Schism, proclaiming Martin V the new Pope and demanding that Benedict XIII renounce his claim. Benedict XIII, however, remained at a castle in Peñíscola (kingdom of Valencia) and continued to maintain supporters. He died in 1423, but, the day before his death, he created four cardinals loyal to him, in order to ensure the Avignon line. Three of these cardinals met and elected Antipope Clement VIII. However, one of Benedict XIII's cardinals, Jean Carrier, disputed the validity of this election. Carrier, acting as the College of Cardinals by himself, elected Bernard Garnier, who took the name Pope Benedict XIV, instead. Carrier was the archdeacon of Rodez, near Toulouse, and Garnier had been the sacristan of Rodez.\n\nGarnier conducted his office secretly and was known as the \"hidden pope\": a letter from the Count of Armagnac to Joan of Arc indicates that only Carrier knew Benedict XIV's location. Garnier's reign as Benedict XIV ended at his death in 1429 or 1430, although he named four of his own cardinals, one of whom was named Jean Farald.\n\nFollowing Garnier's death, Jean Carrier elected himself as the new pope, and also styled himself Pope Benedict XIV. Carrier, however, had been captured and imprisoned by Antipope Clement VIII. Carrier finished his days in captivity in the castle of Foix.\n\nSome imagine that cardinals loyal to him elected a series of increasingly marginal antipopes in 1437 and 1470. For instance, this is the scenario in the 1995 novel \"l'Anneau du pêcheur\" by the French writer Jean Raspail.\n\n"}
{"id": "31961763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31961763", "title": "Biography in literature", "text": "Biography in literature\n\nWhen studying literature, biography and its relationship to literature is often a subject of literary criticism, and is treated in several different forms. Two scholarly approaches use biography or biographical approaches to the past as a tool for interpreting literature: literary biography and biographical criticism. Additionally, two genres of fiction rely heavily on the incorporation of biographical elements into their content, biographical fiction and autobiographical fiction.\n\nA literary biography is the biographical exploration of the lives of writers and artists. Biographies about artists and writers are sometimes some of the most complicated forms of biography. Not only does the author of the biography have to write about the subject of the biography but also must incorporate discussion of the individual's literary works into the biography itself. Literary biographers must balance the weight of commentary on the individual works against the biographical content to create a coherent narrative. This balance is affected by the degree of biographical elements in an author's literary works. The close relationship between writers and their work relies on ideas that connect human psychology and literature and can be examined through psychoanalytic theory.\n\nLiterary biography tends to have a plethora of autobiographical sources. Elizabeth Longford, a biographer of Wilfrid Blunt, noted, \"Writers are articulate and tend to leave eloquent source material which the biographer will be eager to use.\" However, some authors and artists go out of their way to discourage the writing of their biographies, as was the case with Kafka, Eliot, Orwell and Auden. Auden said, \"Biographies of writers whether written by others or themselves are always superfluous and usually in bad taste... His private life is, or should be, of no concern to anybody except himself, his family and his friends.\"\n\nWell-received literary biographies include Richard Ellmann's \"James Joyce\" and George Painter's \"Marcel Proust\".\n\nBiographical criticism is the deliberate use of biographical information to shed light on the difference created by experience between an author and his audience, and so provide insight into how to understand that particular work.\n\nBiographical fiction is a type of historical fiction that takes a historical individual and recreates elements of his or her life, while telling a fictional narrative, usually in the genres of film or the novel. The relationship between the biographical and the fictional may vary within different pieces of biographical fiction. It frequently includes selective information and self-censoring of the past. The characters are often real people or based on real people, but the need for \"truthful\" representation is less strict than in biography. \n\nThe various philosophies behind biographical fiction lead to different types of content. Some asserts itself as a factual narrative about the historical individual, like Gore Vidal's \"Lincoln\". Other biographical fiction creates two parallel strands of narrative, one in the contemporary world and one focusing on the biographical history, such as Malcolm Bradbury's \"To the Hermitage\" and Michael Cunningham's \"The Hours\". No matter what style of biographical fiction is used, the novelist usually starts the writing process with historical research.\n\nBiographical fiction has its roots in late 19th and early 20th-century novels based loosely on the lives of famous people, but without direct reference to them, such as George Meredith's \"Diana of the Crossways\" (1885) and Somerset Maugham's \"The Moon and Sixpence\" (1919). During the early part of the 20th century this became a distinct genre, with novels that were explicitly about individuals' lives.\n\nAutobiographical fiction, or autofiction, is fiction that incorporates the author's own experience into the narrative. It allows authors to both rely and reflect on their own experience. However, the reading of the autobiographical fiction need not always be associated with the author. Such books may be treated as distinct fictional works.\n\n"}
{"id": "352614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=352614", "title": "Blondel de Nesle", "text": "Blondel de Nesle\n\nBlondel de Nesle – either Jean I of Nesle (c. 1155 – 1202) or his son Jean II of Nesle (died 1241) – was a French trouvère.\n\nThe name 'Blondel de Nesle' is attached to twenty-four or twenty-five courtly songs. He was identified in 1942, by Holger Dyggve, as Jean II of Nesle (near Amiens), who was nicknamed 'Blondel' for his long blond hair. He married at the time of his father's death in 1202, and that same year, went on the Fourth Crusade; he later fought in the Albigensian Crusade. However, in 1994, Yvan Lepage suggested that the poet may have been Jean I, father of Jean II, who was Lord of Nesle from 1180 to 1202; this Jean took part in the Third Crusade, which may explain the subsequent legend linking him with King Richard I of England.\n\nIf the works are correctly identified and dated, he was a significant influence on his European contemporaries, who made much use of his melodies. (The melody of \"L'amours dont sui espris\" is used in \"Carmina Burana\", for the song \"Procurans Odium\"). His works are fairly conventional, and several have been recorded in modern times.\n\nBy 1260, Blondel's name had become attached to a legend in the highly fictionalised \"Récits d'un Ménestrel de Reims\"; this claimed that, after King Richard of England was arrested and held for ransom in 1192, he was found by the minstrel Blondel, whom he saw from his window, and to whom he sang a verse of a song they both knew. Later versions of the story related that Blondel went from castle to castle, singing a particular song that only he and Richard knew, and that the imprisoned Richard replied with the second verse – thus identifying where he was imprisoned. Then, Blondel either aided the king's escape or reported his position back to his friends. Blondel finally found Richard at Dürnstein; in fact, there was no mystery about Richard's location which was widely publicized by his ransomers.\n\n'Blondel' is a common surname on the Channel Island of Guernsey. It is recorded that King Richard granted a fief on the island to a vassal named Blondel, but it remains uncertain as to whether this has any connection with the legend, or whether the legend has any connection with the known trouvère.\n\nThe legend of Blondel did not achieve great popularity in the Middle Ages, but was taken up in the late eighteenth century. It was the basis of André Ernest Modeste Grétry's opera \"Richard Coeur-de-lion\" (1784). In 1822, Eleanor Anne Porden used the legend in her epic poem \"Cœur De Lion\": in her version, Blondel is really Richard's wife, Berengaria of Navarre, in disguise.\n\nA poem by Johann Gabriel Seidl titled Blondel's Lied was set to music by Robert Schumann.\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century, the legend became a key component in the mythology surrounding Richard. Some later twentieth century novelists, placed a homosexual interpretation on his supposed relationship with the king. Norah Lofts in \"The Lute Player\" (1951) has Richard make a (rather gentlemanly ) approach to Blondel, which is refused, Blondel's heart and devotion being entirely given to Richard's neglected wife Berengaria. \n\nIn the 1962–63 ITV British television series \"Richard the Lionheart\", Blondel was a semi-regular character, played by Iain Gregory.\n\nThe English acoustic band of the early 1970s, Amazing Blondel, was named after Blondel.\n\nThe legend inspired \"Blondel\", a 1983 musical by Stephen Oliver and Tim Rice. The play, a comedic rock opera, is set during the period of the Third Crusade. Blondel is portrayed as a frustrated artist, seeking fame as a composer and performer, even as he searches for his imprisoned monarch. Rice collaborated with director Patrick Wilde to revive the show at the Pleasance Theatre in London in 2006.\n\n\n\n"}

Although gay sex was partially decriminalised by the Sexual Offences Act 1967, they were all convicted under section 13 of the 1956 Act because more than two men had sex together, which was still illegal. One of the participants (Craig Turner) was also six months under the statutory age of consent for gay sex which was 18 at the time. \n\nUnder the provisions of the 1967 Act, the age of consent for gay sex was different from that of the heterosexual age of consent of 16, and had only been reduced from 21 to 18 by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Equivalent heterosexual behaviour was not a crime.\n\nThe offences only came to light after police seized videos of the men having sex, which they had filmed for their own personal use. All the men were either lovers, ex-boyfriends, or friends of friends.\n\nDuring sentencing on 20 February 1998 Gary Abdie, David Godfrey, Mark Love and Jonathan Moore (all of whom were in their early 20s), and Craig Turner (17 at the time of the offences but 18 when he appeared in court) were given probation and community service orders. The Judge gave Norman Williams a two-year suspended prison sentence and Terry Connell received a nine-month suspended sentence and was ordered to pay £500 towards the cost of the prosecution. Moore (20), Williams (33) and Connell (55) were also required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for the age of consent offences committed with Turner. Estimates of the overall cost of the prosecution were in the region of £500,000.\n\nDespite their convictions, none of them received custodial sentences possibly as a result of a high-profile campaign led by gay human rights group OutRage!. Over 400 letters were presented to the court in support of the men including those from MPs, Bishops and human rights groups. The letters urged the judge not to impose a custodial sentence, with one group, Amnesty International, pledging to declare the men prisoners of conscience should they be imprisoned.\n\nIn 2000, six of the men appealed to the European Court of Human Rights arguing that the prosecutions against them had violated their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights by interfering with 'the right to respect for a private family life' enshrined in article 8 of the Convention. They were subsequently awarded compensation. As Williams was not part of the litigation, he was not deemed eligible by the Home Office for the compensation.\n\nLegislation subsequently introduced by the Labour Government has broadly equalised the treatment of homosexual and heterosexual behaviours in criminal law. The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 equalised the age of consent for gay sex with that of the heterosexual age of consent which is now 16 for both. The Sexual Offences Act 2003, though subject to some controversy, introduced an overhaul in the way sexual offences are dealt with by the police and courts, replacing provisions that date as far back to the 1956 legislation. The offences of gross indecency and buggery have been repealed and sexual activity between more than two men is no longer a crime in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.\n\nFlaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a narrative. For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the action hero who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a romantic comedy who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension. Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is Achilles' famous heel.\n\nIn general, flaws can be categorized as \"minor\", \"major\", or \"tragic\".\n\nA minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.\n\nExamples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.\n\nProtagonists and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a sympathetic character) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.\n\nMany insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the stock character or archetype that they adhere to.\n\nA major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.\n\nExamples of this type of flaw could include blindness, amnesia or greed.\n\nUnlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.\n\n\nThis is a specific sort of flaw, also known as \"Hamartia\", which is possessed by Aristotelian tragic heros. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.\n\nExamples of this could include hubris, misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.\n\nThis fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8444504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8444504", "title": "Character sketch", "text": "Character sketch\n\nThe word character sketch means a rough-and-ready rendering or thumbnail portrayal of an individual, capturing, in brief, that person's physical characteristics, psychological attributes, and the like. The brief descriptions often capitalize on the more unusual or humorous aspects of the person’s character. Character sketches are usually identified by irony, humor, exaggeration, and satire. The term originates in portraiture, where the character sketch is a common academic exercise. The artist performing a character sketch attempts to capture an expression or gesture that goes beyond coincident actions and gets to the essence of the individual.\n\nThe first English writer to delve into the form was Joseph Hall in his book Characters of Virtues and Vices which was published in 1608. However, the character sketch didn’t become popular amongst the literate public until the late seventeenth century. The public appreciated sketches for their humor and readable style. As Pat Rogers notes, Henry Fielding, in book I, chapter 14 of \"Joseph Andrews\", invokes William Hogarth to create a character sketch of Mrs. Tow-wouse: \"Indeed, if Mrs. Tow-wouse had given no Utterance to the Sweetness of her Temper, Nature had taken such Pains in her Countenance, that Hogarth himself never gave more Expression to a Picture.\" Thomas Overbury, John Earle, Richard Steele, and Joseph Addison also wrote notable character sketches. Addison and Steele’s sketches appeared in a periodical that was issued twice a week under the name “The Spectator Papers.” They created several personas such as Roger de Coverly, Mr. Spectator, and Captain Sentry who represented different classes in English society. From the point of view of these personas, Addison and Steele wrote sketches that addressed important events in the social and political atmospheres. In America, Walt Whitman published a series of remarkable character sketches in 1856. Whitman’s sketches involved mostly physical descriptions, however, like Addison and Steele, his sketches were written with a purpose. Rather than make social or political commentary, Whitman used the opportunity to provide sketches that publicly praised his friends and ridiculed his enemies.\n\nIn later literature, a character sketch became a short story or narrative presented without significant action or plot, as the purpose of the writing is solely to present a character at his or her typical. Character sketches of this sort are also frequently found in journalism and regionalist humor (e.g., sketches of \"Big John\" or \"the country rube\" or \"the wise Squire\"). Each of these attempts to delineate a model of a type (a category of person) rather than a realistic person.\n\nToday, the character sketch appears mostly in the writings of satiric novelists such as Thomas Pynchon. The character sketch has also been adapted to appear on television in both dramatic and comedic forms such as TV serial,movies etc.\n\n"}
{"id": "58554195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58554195", "title": "Chitti (character)", "text": "Chitti (character)\n\nChitti is a fictional character and the primary protagonist and antagonist of the films Enthiran and 2.0. The character was portrayed by Rajinikanth in \"Enthiran\", a non-canon cameo in \"Ra.One\", and in \"2.0\". Chitti was created and written by S. Shankar.\n\nThe visual appearance of Chitti was based on the G.I. Joe action figures. For Chitti's 2.0 version look, its hair was spiked and brown coloured lenses were used for its eyes, whereas for its \"good robot\" look, green coloured lenses were used. The wig used for Chitti's 2.0 look had a silver streak in the middle, made out of Yak hair, while its leather jacket was designed by Vogt. To make Vaseegaran look mature, the team made Rajinikanth sport an Oakley beard. Suits made of copper were used for Chitti's costumes.\n\nChitti is described by Vaseegaran as an advanced \"andro-humanoid\" robot. Over his metallic body, he sports synthetic inorganic skin molded after Vaseegaran himself. He is designed with a speed capacity of 1 Terahertz (Hz) and a memory capacity of 1 Zettabyte.\n\nInitially, Chitti has been programmed with almost all the existing world knowledge managed to put in computable terms in his CPU, thus he is knowledgeable and proficient in all forms of academia, martial arts, communication, creative outlets, athletic skills, and scientific ingenuity. \nUnderneath his synthetic skin, he is fire, water, and acid-resistant. \n\nIn his original form, he is partially resistant to severe damage such as gunshots, though he can still be damaged or destroyed by properly aimed and adequately forceful attacks such as being chopped with an axe in the joints. Severe electrocution can also overload short-circuit him. As long as his CPU head is still functioning, Chitti is able to repair or fix back his minor parts such as eyes. However, for large damage such as limbs being chopped off, he can only put them back in place and function at a much slower speed.\n\nChitti's eyes are able to not only see and scan his surroundings to extremely acute detail, including X-ray vision, but they can also serve as high-definition projectors. His eyes also allow him to pick up additional skills within seconds. He can also perform virtual phone calls, with displaying his caller or receiver through his eyes as a hologram. However, on downside, the eyes get bleached when exposed to flash light.\n\nChitti is able to adhere to metal objects through his selective magnetism. This allows him to both render his foes weaponless, as well as fly for a certain distance to any nearby metallic structure. He is physically able to exert superhuman speed, agility and strength; he is at least able to lift with ease a convertible car, and even pull two trucks towards himself while they are in motion. In the second half of \"Enthiran\" as well as in \"2.0\", he designs and equips himself with a \"handgun\", which is basically a retractable firearm within his right hand.\n\nChitti's only known weaknesses are flashing lights, which temporarily distort his sight, and his susceptibility to battery drainage. However, in the case of the latter, he just needs to absorb a bare minimum amount of electric power to recharge himself in a matter of seconds.\n\nIn the first film, \"Enthiran\", Chitti (played by Rajnikanth) is an android robot created by Dr. Vaseegaran, (also played by Rajinikanth). Dr. Vaseegaran, who is specialised in robotics, created Chitti after a decade of intensive research. Chitti was first created without emotions however in order for the robot to understand human behaviour, Vaseegaran taught the robot about them. But then the robot fell in love with the scientist's fiancée, Sana (played by Aishwarya Rai) and thus it caused conflict between them. Angered by the robot, Vaseegaran literally chopped the robot into pieces. He was found by Dr. Bohra (played by Danny Denzongpa) and upgrade into 2.0 because of a red chip. He converts it into a ruthless killer and turned into an evil destructive killing machine and killed Bohra. He then went after Vaseegaran and Sana and crashed their wedding. He showed numerous other powerful abilities including shape shifting as well as duplicating. He caused so much damage and destruction to the city. However, Vaseegaran managed to defeat and stop Chitti. Since he caused so much damage and destruction to the city, he was de-activated and dismantled. His body parts were then displayed in the museum in the year 2030 as the most advanced humanoid robot ever built.\n\nChitti reappeared in the film \"Ra.One\" in a special appearance and communicated with G.One (played by Shah Rukh Khan) with Rajnikanth reprising his role. This appearance is non-canon, meaning both this and Chitti's film franchise don't share the same continuity.\n\nIn the 2018 film \"2.0\" with Rajnikanth reprising his role one more time, Chitti is forced to be reassembled by Dr. Vaseegaran and the Indian Army in order to stop the antagonist, Fifth force, which is controlled by Pakshi Rajan, an Ornithologist (played by Akshay Kumar).But Chitti is defeated and destroyed in his original form by the antagonist, which leads his CPU head to being rebooted in another advanced mechanical body, identifying himself as Chitti reloaded version '2.0', and will also fall in love with his female counterpart, the super-android Nila (played by Amy Jackson), also created by Vaseegaran. Alongside Chitti, there is another robot created known as version 3.0 which is a dwarf.\n"}

Some also relate his name to the deity Xipe Totec.\n\nAccording to the legend, he is the son of a forbidden romance between an indigenous Mesoamerican queen called Sihuehuet or Ziguet, now commonly known as La Siguanaba, and \"Lucero de la mañana\" (Lúcifer Morningstar). Cipitio is the child of this affair. When Ziguet's husband found out about this affair he sought the assistance of the very powerful god Teotl. Ziguet and \"Cipitio\" were cursed and condemned by Teotl. Cipitio was going to live forever as a small boy with his feet in backwards position, as a reminder of the twisted and illicit affair of his parents. Stories are told of farmers that come to their fields and find the footsteps of a boy, but eventually get lost following them because, not knowing that Cipitio has his feet backwards, they follow them in the wrong direction.\n\nCipitio is represented as liking to eat ashes, throwing pebbles to beautiful ladies, and likes to eat a variety of banana called \"Guineo Majoncho\". He could also \"Teleport\" anywhere he wants.\n\nA couple of short stories with this character can be found in the book \"Cuentos de Cipotes\" by the Salvadoran writer and poet Salvador Salarrué.\n\nIn a TV show for the Salvadoran Educational Television Station he is portrayed by Rolando Meléndez, who has played the role for several seasons.

In reference to Francis being a Jesuit, the uppermost charge is the emblem of the Society of Jesus. The emblem is composed of a Sun radiant, within which is the IHS christogram (a monogram of the Holy Name of Jesus) in red, with a red cross surmounting the H and three black nails below the H. \n\nBelow the Jesuit emblem is an eight-pointed star, the star being a long-standing symbol of the Virgin Mary, and a spikenard representing Saint Joseph. In Hispanic iconographic tradition Saint Joseph is often depicted with a branch of spikenard in his hand. \n\nThese charges appeared on Bergoglio's previous coat of arms displayed when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires, but as Pope the tincture of the star and the spikenard were elevated from \"Argent\" (silver) to \"Or\" (gold). The first version of the papal coat of arms published by the Vatican showed a five-pointed star from Bergoglio's previous one, but this was later amended to eight points; the representation of the spikenard was also slightly altered so it would resemble leaves rather than what appears to look like grapes.\n\nThe Vatican has not yet published the official blazon of the arms, but an approximation has been made by John Hamilton Gaylor, as follows:\n\nTraditionally, a Pope's coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered papal tiara with lappets and the crossed keys of Saint Peter with a cord. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the Pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind in Heaven as on earth. Pope Francis' arms maintain the keys, but replaced the tiara (as did his predecessor) with a triband mitre. \n\nThe tiara and keys remain the symbol of the papacy and appear on the coat of arms of the Holy See and (reversed) on the flag of Vatican City.\n\nAs with his predecessor's personal arms, Francis replaced the traditional papal triregnum by adopting a silver mitre with three gold bands. These bands allude to the papal tiara's three crowns, which came to represent the three powers of Orders, Jurisdiction, and Magisterium, all joining at the centre depicting unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for “sovereign” (王).\n\nUnusually, Francis also decided to retain his personal motto: \"Miserando atque eligendo\". It is taken from the 21st homily of Saint Bede, which is on the Gospel of Matthew and refers to the vocation of Saint Matthew. He writes:\n\nBede is here discussing Matthew 9:9-13. The salient point is that Jesus chose Matthew as his disciple not in spite but because of his being a sinner. In the Douay Rheims translation: \nThe statement from the Vatican announcing the Pope's coat of arms and motto explained that the phrase had a special meaning for Francis as he felt it recalled his own vocation, when at the age of 17, he went to confession on St Matthew's day in 1953.\n\n\n"}

This includes any mark or text referring to the Swedish State which this can give the commercial mark a sign of official endorsement. This includes municipal coats of arms which are registered.\"\n\nAny representation consisting of three crowns ordered two above one are considered to be the lesser coat of arms, and its usage is therefore restricted by law 1970:498.\n\nThe arms of Sweden were first formally codified by law in 1908. This law also formally codifies the differences between the \"greater\" and \"lesser\" arms. The present law prescribing the two arms dates from 1982.\n\nThe greater coat of arms is blazoned in Swedish law as follows:\n\n\"A shield azure, quartered by a cross Or with outbent arms, and an inescutcheon containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House. In the first and fourth fields three open crowns Or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams argent, a lion crowned with an open crown Or armed gules. The inescutcheon is party per pale the arms for the House of Vasa (Bendwise azure, argent and gules, a \"vasa\" Or); and the House of Bernadotte (Azure, issuant from a wavy base a bridge with three arches and two towers embattled argent, in honor point an eagle regardant with wings inverted resting on thunderbolts Or, and in chief the Big Dipper constellation of the same). The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the Order of the Seraphim. Supported by two lions regardant, crowned and with forked tails Or armed gules, standing on a compartment Or. All surrounded by ermine mantling, crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseladorned strings Or.\"\n\nThe greater arms may also be displayed only with the crowned escutcheon. While the arms have undergone significant changes over the years, such as changing the inescutcheon with the ruling dynasty, they are based on arms created by King Karl Knutsson in 1448.\n\nThe escutcheon used in the greater blazon has in total five elements: 4 quarterings on the main escutcheon (two coats of arms duplicated), and three coat of arms incorporated into an escutcheon of pretense. However, Bernadotte never used any stars in the arms of Pontecorvo (neither as Prince of Pontecorvo, nor as King of Sweden and Norway). The stars were introduced as an element in the royal coat of arms in the 19th century, chosen as a symbol of Sweden's eternal existence, as in the poem by Esaias Tegnér:\n\nThis symbol became especially popular through its allusion to the name that had been borne by so many famous Swedish kings. Ursa Major, or as it is called in Swedish, \"Karlavagnen\" (Charles' Wain), adds a Swedish accent to the Bernadotte dynastic coat of arms much in the same way as do the Vasa arms.\n\nThe arms are supported by two lions with forked tails (\"queue fourchée\"), facing away from the shield and crowned with Royal Crowns. For centuries, the lion has been an important element in Swedish heraldry and especially for the State Coat of Arms. The shield may be surmounted by the Collar of the Order of Seraphim, the foremost order in Sweden, and the highest honour the Swedish state can bestow on an individual.\n\nBesides being the official national coat of arms, the greater coat of arms is also the personal coat of arms of the king, and as such he can decree its use as a personal coat of arms by other members of the Royal House, with the alterations and additions decided by him.\n\nBlazon: \"The greater state arms consist of a head shield azure, quartered by a cross or with outbent arms, and an inescutcheon containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House.\n\nIn the first and fourth fields three coronets or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams argent, a lion crowned with an open crown or with armaments gules. The inescutcheon is party per pale the arms for the House of Vasa and the House of Bernadotte. The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the Order of the Seraphim. Supported by two lions regardant or crowned, with parted tails and armaments gules, standing on a postament. All surrounded by hermine mantling crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseled strings or.\"\n\nThe lesser coat of arms is mainly used by the Government of Sweden and subordinate government authorities. As such it may be joined by insignias symbolising the activity of individual government agencies, following approval by the State Board of Heraldry. It is, for instance, embroidered on all Swedish police uniforms and in various coats of arms of the Swedish Armed Forces.\n\nBlazon: \"Azure, with three coronets Or, ordered two above one.\" Crowned with a royal crown. The shield may also be surrounded by the insignias of the Order of the Seraphim.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "58712831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58712831", "title": "Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales", "text": "Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales\n\nThe coat of arms of the Prince of Wales is the official heraldic insignia of the Prince of Wales, a title traditionally granted to the heir apparent to the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, formerly the Kingdom of Great Britain and before that the Kingdom of England.\n\nThe coat of arms, in its current form, was devised for Charles, Prince of Wales in 1958. It contains the badges and elements taken from all four of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom as well as from the many titles the prince holds as heir apparent.\n\nThe history of the coat of arms is closely linked with that of the Royal coat of arms of England and the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. However, as the noted antiquarian and heraldist Charles Boutell wrote in 1863, \"The Arms of the Prince of Wales have a distinct individuality of their own, with which nothing ought to be directly associated.\"\n\nThe coronets of the Prince and the Peers of the realm were regulated by King Charles II by Royal Warrant, signed on 9 February 1661. Part of the warrant proclaimed: \"Our Will and Pleasure therefore is, That the Son and Heir Apparent of the Crown for the time being, shall use and bear his Coronet composed of Crosses and Flower-de-Lized with one Arch; and in the midst a Ball and Cross, as hath our Royal Diadem\".\n\nIn other words, the heraldic coronet used in the Prince of Wales's coat of arms is similar to the heraldic crown (St. Edward's crown) used in the Royal arms, except that instead of two intersecting arches it has only one. Boutell wrote that: \"It should be noticed, however, that this coronet belongs to the prince as eldest son of the Sovereign and heir-apparent to the Throne, and not as Prince of Wales\". The coronet is also used by the Prince of Wales's consort, in her coat of arms.\n\nThe heir's coronet was confirmed in another Royal Warrant signed on 19 November 1917 by King George V. The warrant proclaimed: \"by the son and heir apparent of the sovereign and his successors a coronet composed of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch and in the midst a ball and cross as in the royal crown.\"\n\nCurrently there are three physical examples of coronets used at one time or other as part of the Honours of the Principality of Wales; the Coronet of Frederick, the Coronet of George and the Coronet of Charles. However these physical manifestations have not affected the graphical representation of the coronet in heraldic art.\n\nBeginning with the reign of King Edward I, a label of three points Azure (or blue) was used by his son, the future King Edward II, to differentiate his arms from those of his father. Without such a label their arms would be identical. Within heraldry this system of differentiating arms is called cadency. The label is placed on the chief (or top) of the shield of arms, with the ends extending across from the dexter to the sinister sides of the shield. It was Prince Edward the Black Prince, heir of King Edward III, who first used a label of three points Argent, also white or silver. This has been the label of the heir apparent ever since, without regard to the system of cadency used by other members of the royal family.\n\nThe Prince of Wales's crest follows closely that of the Sovereign, but always with the appropriate label of difference displayed. This crest depicts a \"Lion Or, passant guardant, wearing a coronet of the Heir, and differenced on the shoulders with a label of three points Argent.\" The lion always stands on a larger coronet of the Heir, which then sits on a golden helmet or the Royal Helm. From the sides flow the gold and ermine mantling of the royal family.\n\nSimilarly to the crest, the prince's supporters follow those of the Sovereign. On either side of the shield of arms and standing on gold scrollwork are the royal supporters: the Lion and the Unicorn. Both beasts have the prince's label charged around their necks, again as an appropriate mark of difference. The lion on the dexter side, an ancient symbol of England, is crowned with the coronet of the Heir. The beast has been a supporter of the English royal arms since the reign of King Henry VIII. The white unicorn of Scotland on the sinister side, was incorporated into the royal arms from the Scottish royal arms after the Union of the crowns in 1603.\n\nPrince Charles was appointed a Knight of the Garter in 1958. Since the founding of the Order in 1348, almost every Prince of Wales has been appointed to the Order. The Order of the Garter is represented in the coat of arms by its namesake the blue buckled garter, which bears in gold letters the motto, \"Honi soit qui mal y pense\", French for \"Shame upon him who thinks evil of it\".\n\nUnder the coat of arms is a scroll bearing the motto \"Ich dien\", German for \"I serve\". The motto of uncertain origin first appeared on the arms of Edward of Woodstock, or the Black Prince. Prince Edward was created Prince of Wales by his father King Edward III on 12 May 1343. Legend holds that the Black Prince took the motto as well as the ostrich feathers from King John the Blind of Bohemia, who was killed fighting alongside the prince and his father at the Battle of Crécy in 1346. The motto is also a near homophone for \"Eich Dyn\", \"Your Man\" in Welsh.\n\nThe Prince of Wales as part of his full achievement of arms has many Heraldic badges, which represents the history and sovereignty of his many titles.\n\nThe Prince of Wales's feathers badge comprises \"A plume of three ostrich feathers Argent enfiled by a royal coronet of alternate crosses and fleur-de-lys Or\" with the motto 'Ich Dien' on a dark blue ribbon. The badge is probably the most recognisable element of the Prince of Wales's coat of arms. It has become synonymous as a personal insignia of the prince and also of the Principality of Wales itself. In a personal capacity the badge is granted as a Royal Warrant of Appointment to companies that regularly supply of goods and services to the Prince. Currently there are 170 companies which are entitled to display this badge with the words 'By Appointment to HRH The Prince of Wales' underneath. The badge can be depicted on all premises, delivery vehicles, stationery and advertisements as well as on the individual products themselves. Other organisations associated with Wales or the prince incorporate the badge into their own insignia including many Welsh regiments of the British Army (such as the Royal Regiment of Wales) and the Welsh Rugby Union.\n\nFeathers used as either a crest or a badge have been an ancient heraldic badge of the House of Plantagenet. However it was not until its incorporation into the heraldic achievements of the Black Prince that the feathers have become an omnipresent feature of the coats of arms of the Prince of Wales.\n\nOn 10 December 1901 a warrant signed by King Edward VII approved the addition of a badge of the Red Dragon to the coat of arms of the Prince of Wales. The proclamation stated that: \"on the sinister side a representation of the Badge of Wales, namely, on a mount vert a Dragon, passant gules, differenced (as in the Crest) with a label of three points argent.\" This was to complement the feathers badge, which was to be depicted on the dexter side of the prince's crest.\n\nThe Red Dragon, or \"Y Ddraig Goch\", has been a symbol associated with Wales since the time of Cadwaladr, King of Gwynedd in the 7th century. It was not until the beginning of the House of Tudor that the Red Dragon became a royal badge of the kings of England. Henry Tudor (later King Henry VII) displayed the Dragon of Cadwaladr on his battle standard. The red dragon became an official royal badge of the sovereign (representing Wales) according to a warrant issued in 1801. The warrant at the same time also confirmed the Tudor rose as a royal badge for England, the thistle for Scotland and the golden harp for Ireland.\n\nThe arms of the Duke of Cornwall are: \"Sable, fifteen bezants, five, four, three, two and one.\" These arms were derived from those of Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, King of the Romans, son and heir of King John, who was also Count of Poitiers (or Poitou), represented by arms made up of peas (poix) or gold coins.\n\nUpon the accession of the prince's mother as Queen Elizabeth II on 6 February 1952, Prince Charles was automatically made the Duke of Cornwall. As such he is able to display the arms of the duchy on his coat of arms. This title has been granted to every heir apparent since 17 March 1337, in accordance with a charter issued by King Edward III for Prince Edward the Black Prince, his eldest son and heir.\n\nThe family of the Prince of Wales is entitled to use certain heraldic features. The consort of the Prince of Wales (titled the Princess of Wales) is granted a unique coat of arms upon marriage, based on the impaling of the prince's arms (on the dexter side) and her father's arms (on the sinister side). The consort is also entitled to use the prince's supporters (with the appropriate label) and the use of the prince's coronet over the arms. The current consort; Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, was granted a coat of arms on 17 July 2005 upon her marriage to Charles, Prince of Wales.\n\nThe children of the heir apparent were given their own distinct coronet, unlike any other grandchildren of the sovereign. This was confirmed in the 1917 Royal Warrant, which proclaimed: \"to all the sons and daughters of the son and heir apparent of us and of our successors a coronet composed of two crosses pattée (or crosses formy) four fleurs-de-lis and two strawberry leaves.\" The wives of the sons of the Prince of Wales use the same coronet as their husbands. Such as arms borne by Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, which was granted to her in 2011.\n\n\n\n"}

According to her website, she was born Danah Michele Mattas. Once she reached college, she chose to take her maternal grandfather's name, Boyd, as her own last name. She decided to spell her name in lowercase so as \"to reflect my mother's original balancing and to satisfy my own political irritation at the importance of capitalization.\"\nAfter her parents' divorce, in 1982, she moved to York, Pennsylvania, with her mother and her brother. Her mother married again during danah's third grade and the family moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. She used online discussions forums to escape from high school. She called Lancaster a \"religious and conservative\" city. Having had online discussions on the topic, she decided to start identifying as queer.\n\nA few years later, her brother taught her how to use IRC and Usenet. Even though she thought computers were \"lame\" at the time, the possibilities for connecting with others intrigued her.

{"id": "33687298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33687298", "title": "East Side Kids", "text": "East Side Kids\n\nThe East Side Kids were characters in a series of films released by Monogram Pictures from 1940 through 1945. Many of them were originally part of The Dead End Kids and The Little Tough Guys, and several of them later became members of The Bowery Boys.\n\nWhen Samuel Goldwyn turned the play \"Dead End\" into the 1937 film version, he recruited the original tough-talking kids from the play (Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan, Gabriel Dell, Billy Halop, and Bernard Punsly) to repeat their roles in the film. This led to the making of six other films starring The Dead End Kids. The most successful of these features were \"Angels with Dirty Faces\" (1938) with James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart, and \"They Made Me a Criminal\" (1939), starring John Garfield. Universal offered a competing series, under the Little Tough Guys brand name, later combining the Little Tough Guys cast members with the Dead End Kids (minus Gorcey) as the Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys series.\n\nIn 1940 producer Sam Katzman, noting the financial success of other tough-kid series, made the film \"East Side Kids\" using two of the 'Little Tough Guys', Hally Chester and Harris Berger. He added former Our Gang player Donald Haines, Frankie Burke, radio actor Sam Edwards, and Eddie Brian to round out the new team. The film served as a kind of \"pilot\" for a possible series of films, which were eventually made possible by this film's success.\n\nKatzman hired former Dead End Kid Bobby Jordan to play the lead in the first film in the series proper, \"Boys of the City\" and he was soon joined in the series by Leo Gorcey. Gorcey's brother David was also added, as well as (Ernie) 'Sunshine' Sammy Morrison as \"Scruno,\" the only African-American in the group and a former child actor from the very first cast of the Our Gang comedy team.\n\nIn the first few films, Dave O'Brien (familiar from low-budget westerns and serials, and as the accident-prone star of the Pete Smith comedies) played Jordan's older brother \"Knuckles Dolan,\" who always seemed to be getting roped into chaperoning the kids from adventure to adventure. O'Brien appeared in different roles as well—continuity between films was often ignored. As with the Little Tough Guys, the membership of the team changed from film to film, until Huntz Hall joined in 1941, when the lineup was somewhat stabilized. In total, 20 actors were members of the team at one time or another.\nAlways the outsider, Gabriel Dell drifted in and out of the series as a gang-member, a reporter, or a small-time hoodlum (as in \"Million Dollar Kid\"). In \"Smart Alecks\" he's an ex-member who left the gang to pursue a life of crime. Stanley Clements also appeared in \"Smart Alecks\" as well as \"'Neath Brooklyn Bridge\" and \"Ghosts on the Loose\". After Gorcey left the subsequent \"Bowery Boys\" series in 1956, Clements was chosen to replace him in the last seven films.\n\nMonogram (which later became Allied Artists) was notorious for its \"Poverty Row\" productions, and the East Side films were no exception. With a minuscule budget of around $33,000 per feature and a tight shooting schedule of only 5–7 days, the series churned out three or four movies a year (an astonishing 21 films in less than six years). There was no time or money for subtlety, story development, or more than one or two takes per scene.\n\nThe stories always centered on the tough, pugnacious \"Muggs McGinnis\" (Gorcey) or the more innocent, clean-cut \"Danny\" (Bobby Jordan). Huntz Hall's \"Glimpy\" began as a minor character who grew in prominence as he was allowed to do more comedy bits over the course of the series. The loose format proved flexible enough to shift back and forth between urban drama (\"That Gang of Mine\"), murder mystery (\"Boys of the City\"), boxing melodrama (\"Bowery Blitzkrieg\"), and horror-comedy (\"Spooks Run Wild\"), with the kids confronting various stock villains: gangsters, smugglers, spies, and crooked gamblers, along the way. The East Side films were problem-teen melodramas until 1943, when director William Beaudine joined the series and emphasized the comedy content. He encouraged the actors to improvise freely, adding to the films' spontaneous charm.\n\nThe contemporaneous events of World War II affected the series as well as the cast. In 1943 Béla Lugosi (who was in \"Spooks Run Wild\") returned as a Nazi saboteur in the incongruously-titled \"Ghosts on the Loose\" which also featured a young Ava Gardner; a German-Japanese spy ring was thwarted in the blatantly patriotic \"Let's Get Tough!\" from 1942 (with Gabriel Dell, of all people, as a Nazi spy). At the end of \"Kid Dynamite\" Muggs, Danny, and Glimpy enlist and show off their uniforms. In \"Follow The Leader\" (1944), Muggs and Glimpy appear in uniform as they are on leave from the Army. Offscreen, between 1942 and 1944, cast members Billy Benedict, Morrison, Jordan, Dell, and David Gorcey left the series after being drafted. A few days after receiving \"his\" induction notice, Leo Gorcey suffered a near-fatal motorcycle accident and spent almost a year in recovery. His injuries led to a 4-F classification, rendering him unfit for military service.\n\nDuring Bobby Jordan's absence, his role in the series was taken by former child actor David Durand. Durand had been the star of Columbia's series of \"Glove Slingers\" campus comedies, and lent the same earnest sincerity to his East Side Kids appearances. (Jordan returned in 1944, in uniform, for a guest appearance in \"Bowery Champs\".)\n\nStarting with \"Clancy Street Boys\" in 1943, Bernard Gorcey (Leo's father) did various bit parts, playing different characters in a total of seven films. In \"Million Dollar Kid\" he and Leo exchanged banter borrowed from an Abbott and Costello routine. He later became a fixture with The Bowery Boys.\n\nGiven the low budgets, simplistic stories, and crude, assembly-line production of the East Side Kids series, its enduring popularity relies on the cast's rambunctious energy, breezy banter (often ad-libbed and containing inside jokes), fast-paced action, and Leo Gorcey's trademark malapropisms (\"This calls for drastic measurements\").\n\nThe East Side Kids series was supplanted by The Bowery Boys in 1946.\n\n\n\nMany of the East Side Kids programs were re-released by Astor Pictures, Favorite Films, and Savoy Pictures Corporation, the latter two companies owned by former Monogram executives\n\n\n"}

The council contacted the States-General and blamed governor Willem Kieft for the declining economic condition of the nascent colony, and the war with the Native Americans. They requested that a new Director-General of New Netherland be appointed and that the people themselves be given more influence in the new government. Director General Kieft was dismissed, and Peter Stuyvesant took his place and Stuyvesant remained in power until the colony was turned over to the British in 1664. Kieft returned to Holland, but the vessel, the \"Princess Amelia\" was lost at sea and his body was never recovered. John Franklin Jameson (1859–1937) writes:\n\nThe commonalty were called together; they were sore distressed.

The controversy stems from a policy that those who have been adversely affected describe as penalizing users who are in fact using their real names which Facebook has nevertheless deemed to be \"fake\", while simultaneously allowing anyone to create fake yet plausible-sounding names, as well as obviously implausible-sounding names comprising word combinations that Facebook's software fails to recognize as unlikely to be real because their alleged nonstandard spelling or confusion with fictional characters. Facebook furthermore prohibits users from accurately representing names which according to the site have \"too many words\", and prohibits initializing first names, preventing users who do so in real life from formatting their own names as they see fit.\n\nThe social networking website Facebook has maintained the real-name system policy for user profiles. According to Facebook, the real-name policy stems from the position \"that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe.\" Likewise per this policy, a \"real name\" is defined by \"your real name as it would be listed on your credit card, driver's license or student ID.\" In August 2012, Facebook estimated that more than 83 million Facebook accounts are fake accounts. As a result of this revelation, the share price of Facebook dropped below $20. Facebook has asserted that \"authentic identity is important to the Facebook experience, and our goal is that every account on Facebook should represent a real person.\"\n\nNative Americans have been repeatedly targeted due to Facebook's policy. \n\nA number of Native Americans have objected to Facebook's inquiries into their names, and to Facebook's request that they provide proof of identification or other documentation in order to use the service. Native American activists claimed to be planning to file a class action lawsuit against Facebook regarding the 'real name' policy.\n\nIn 2008, a woman in Japan named Hiroko Yoda had her Facebook account suspended over her surname, which is common in Japan, being confused with a Star Wars character of the same name.\n\nThe Dublin branch of the Irish language rights group, Misneach, started a Change.org online petition to demand the right to use Irish names on Facebook and protested outside Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin on October 7, 2015.\n\nIn 2015, one Gaelic-speaking retired policeman won the right to use his Gaelic name on Facebook, even though it was not his legal name. Some Scottish Gaelic surnames, such as NicIllAnndrais, contain more than two capital letters and are still disallowed by Facebook.\n\nIn the Spanish-influenced indigenous Chamoru culture of the Marianas, the standard naming convention has historically been for a person to use their mother's maiden name as their middle name. (Chamoru culture, having been colonized by Spain, went through a period where indigenous names and naming conventions were forcibly eradicated and replaced by what the conquering Spanish deemed acceptable.) Furthermore, using one's full name rather than simply the first and last is commonplace, if only for disambiguation purposes due to a relatively small pool of surnames. Therefore, middle names such as De Leon Guerrero and De La Cruz are frequently encountered. However, attempting to register such names as one's middle name results in a message telling users that \"Names can't have too many words.\" Therefore, many Chamoru users are forced to either run all of the words together as if they were one single word, or to initialize each word to a common acronym such as DLG or DLC.\n\nIn cases where the acronym is employed, Facebook automatically changes to lower-case all letters except the first. (Use of periods, e.g. D.L.G., will result in a message telling users that \"Profile names can't have too many periods.\") Therefore, someone commonly known in real life by a name such as Mary De Leon Guerrero Mafnas would have to resort to using what on Facebook would end up being \"Mary Dlg Mafnas\". The message is not accompanied by an option to challenge/appeal the restriction or to send Facebook documentation that the format is how one normally formats their name in real life.\n\nIn January 2015, a 23-year-old Australian bank employee claiming to be named Phuc Dat Bich posted a photo of his passport identification page to Facebook, protesting that the company had unfairly shut down his account for being \"false and misleading\". \"Is it because I'm Asian? Is it?\" he asked. The BBC reported that in Vietnamese the name is pronounced similarly to \"Phoo Da Bi\" (IPA: ). After his reinstatement, Bich posted a thank you note to supportive Facebook fans, stating he was \"glad and honoured to be able to make people happy by simply making them laugh at something that appears outrageous and ridiculous\". Subsequently \"Phuc Dat\" published a further message admitting it was a hoax.\n\nTamils do not have surnames: They have their father or mother or both father and mother's first name as initials. This standard naming practice has not been acknowledged by Facebook.\n\nFacebook's real-name policy does not reflect adopted names or pseudonyms used by the transgender community, and has led to suspending users with real names that might be thought to be fake. A user via the anonymous Android and iOS app Secret began reporting \"fake names\" which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the stage names of drag queens.\n\nTransgender people have also been affected by the policy, including one former Facebook employee who initiated development on Facebook's custom gender options, who was suspended on the day the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional. According to gender non-conforming activist D. Dragonetti, Facebook even disregarded their government identification when supplied.\n\nOn October 1, 2014, Chris Cox, Chief Product Officer at Facebook, offered an apology to the LGBT community and drag kings and queens: In the two weeks since the real-name policy issues surfaced, we've had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it. We've also come to understand how painful this has been. We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook, and we're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were.\n\nSecular, atheist, agnostic, humanist, or users who comment or blog expressing views critical of particular religions, sects or religion in general, as well as religious people who express the opposing views critical of atheism or agnosticism very often have a legitimate need to use an alias. Some of these users could suffer rejection, retaliation or violence if their views – contrary to those of their family, friends or community – are known. In some cases, secular bloggers are exposed to imprisonment by an intolerant government, violent attacks in the street or even being killed by religious fanatics. Examples are the incarceration of activist and blogger Raif Badawi in Saudi Arabia and a string of attacks and murders of secular activists in Bangladesh or Pakistan.\n\nInternational non-profit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation stated they were \"alarmed to hear that Facebook's 'real name' policy is disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ community.\"\n\nOnline magazine \"Queerty\" called Facebook's policy \"a frankly creepy overreach of authority\", adding \"There are a million reasons why someone would choose to self-identify with a name other than the one that's printed on their birth certificate. And really, it's absolutely none of your business in the first place.\"\n\nIn an interview for MAGE Magazine, Second Life entrepreneur Jennifer Ceara Firehawk stated: \"If we are not using our page to abuse or grief others they just need to leave us be. We are not hurting anyone… FB does not realize some SL people earn lindens to turn into RL (real life) money and that is how they make a living. Once you force a person to change the SL name they will lose money due to not being able to find them on FB or SL as they may use FB for their buisness [sic] or advertise. So they end up losing buisness [sic] and money.\"\n\nSeattle drag performer Olivia LaGarce started a Change.org online petition titled \"Allow performers to use their stage names on their Facebook accounts!\"\n\nOn December 15, 2015, Facebook announced in a press release that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay/lesbian community and abuse victims. The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their \"special circumstance\" or \"unique situation\" with a request to use pseudonyms, subject to verification of their true identities. At that time, this was already being tested in the U.S. Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook. The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified, forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation.\n\nThis measure was criticised by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who pointed out that it forces the most vulnerable users to reveal intimate details of their personal lives. Furthermore, as of January 2018, there is no evidence in Facebook's policies that this measure was ever implemented.\n\n\n\n"}

The names of the Forgotten Ten are Kevin Barry, Patrick Moran, Frank Flood, Thomas Whelan, Thomas Traynor, Patrick Doyle, Edmond Foley, Thomas Bryan, Bernard Ryan, and Patrick Maher.\n\nThe executioner was John Ellis, one of the United Kingdom's hangmen at that time.\n\nFollowing the Irish War of Independence, Mountjoy Prison was transferred to the control of the Irish Free State, which became the State of Ireland in 1937. In the 1920s, the families of the dead men requested their remains be returned to them for proper burial. This effort was joined in the later 1920s by the National Graves Association. Through the efforts of the Association, the graves of the men were identified in 1934, and in 1996 a Celtic cross was erected in Glasnevin Cemetery to commemorate them.\n\nThe campaign to rebury the men dragged on for 80 years from their deaths. Following an intense period of negotiations, the Irish government relented. Plans to exhume the bodies of the 10 men were announced on 1 November 2000, the 80th anniversary of the execution of Kevin Barry. On 14 October 2001, the Forgotten Ten were afforded full state honours, with a private service at Mountjoy Prison for the families of the dead, a requiem mass at St Mary's Pro-Cathedral and burial in Glasnevin Cemetery.\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", some criticised the event as glorifying militant Irish republicanism. It coincided with the Fianna Fáil party conference.\n\nThe progress of the cortège through the centre of Dublin was witnessed by crowds estimated as being in the tens of thousands who broke into spontaneous applause as the coffins passed. On O'Connell Street, a lone piper played a lament as the cortege paused outside the General Post Office, the focal point of the 1916 Easter Rising. In his homily during the requiem mass, Cardinal Cahal Daly, a long-time critic of the IRA campaign in Northern Ireland, insisted that there was a clear distinction between the conflict of 1916–22 and the paramilitary-led violence of the previous 30 years:\n\nIn his graveside oration the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern echoed these sentiments and also paid tribute to the Ten:\n\nThe state funeral, broadcast live on national television and radio, was only the 13th since independence. Patrick Maher would not be reburied with his comrades. In accordance with his wishes, and those of his family, he was reinterred in Ballylanders, County Limerick.\n\nA feature length Irish language documentary on the re-interments, \"An Deichniúr Dearmadta\" (\"The Forgotten Ten\") aired on TG4 on 28 March 2002.\n\nAn episode of the BBC series \"Who Do you Think You Are?\" with Boy George describes the life of Thomas Bryan, who was his great uncle.\n\n\n"}

He was born in Groningen, Netherlands, where he also died. His parents were Adriaan Jacobs Boomgaard (1763-1844) and Geesje Geerts Bontekoe (1762-1834). His father was captain on a boat, and civil records say that Geert did the same work.

When Ireland's potato crop failed in 1845, James Irvine and his younger brother William were among those who left for the United States. The family name is Scottish, meaning that James would have been an Ulster Scot, or Scots-Irish. Irvine worked for two years in New York City. In 1848 Irvine went to join the California Gold Rush as a merchant and miner. In 1854, he purchased an interest in a San Francisco commission house on Front Street, operated by a relative, John Lyons. The business was renamed \"Irvine & Co., wholesale produce and grocery merchants\". He began investing his profits in income-producing San Francisco real estate and soon became a wealthy man. Irvine also became a silent partner in the sheep-raising venture Flint, Bixby & Company of brothers Thomas and Benjamin Flint, and their cousin Llewellyn Bixby. The purchase of the Rancho San Joaquin in 1864 and the Rancho Lomas de Santiago in 1866 marked the beginning of their operations in Southern California. In 1867, Irvine married Henrietta Maria (Nettie) Rice, the daughter of prominent Cleveland, Ohio, educator, writer, poet and State Senator Harvey Rice, who was a direct descendant of Edmund Rice. Nettie died in 1874, and Irvine married Margaret Byrne in 1880. He died March 15, 1886, and is buried in San Francisco.\n\nJames Harvey Irvine, Sr. (1867–1947), son of James Irvine I and Henrietta Maria (Nettie) Rice, was born October 16, 1867, in San Francisco. His mother died when he was seven years old, and his father died when he was about eighteen. Between the time of James Irvine I's death in 1886 and James Irvine II's inheritance of the Southern California real estate holdings upon his twenty-fifth birthday in 1892, the properties were supervised by James Irvine I's brother, George Irvine. James II bought out Flint and the other partners, and formed the Irvine Company. He married Frances Anita Plum in 1892, and they had three children, \"Jase\", James Harvey Irvine Jr. (1894–1935), Katharine Helena Irvine (1894–1920) and Myford Plum Irvine (1898–1959). In 1931, James II married Mrs. Kathryn Brown White, who died in 1950. James II lived in San Francisco until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, when he relocated to the Irvine Ranch. He was a member of the Bohemian Club, and kept a residence in San Francisco, at 2421 Pierce Street. He established the James Irvine Foundation in 1937, an entity dedicated to the \"general well-being of the citizens and residents of the state of California.\" James II owned nearly a third of the land in present-day Orange County. The city of Irvine (formerly Myford) is named after him. He died of Bright's disease in 1947.\n\nJames Harvey Irvine, Jr. (1894–1935) was groomed since a young man to take over the Ranch. He married Madeline Agassiz in 1914, but they were divorced in 1928. He married Athalie Richardson (1903–1993) in 1929, and they had one daughter, Athalie Anita \"Joan\" Irvine (1933– ). When James Irvine III died of tuberculosis in 1935, James II set up the James Irvine Foundation, a charitable organization to hold controlling stock in the Irvine Company.

He had a daughter, who married Madduwatta.\n\nAnother Kupanta-Kurunta was born in the 1330s or 1320s BC at Mira in western Anatolia, in one of the princely families. His father joined a coup against king Mašḫuiluwa. The Hittite king Suppiluliuma I married Mašḫuiluwa to his daughter Muwatti and reinstalled him. Kupanta-Kurunta's father apparently died or was exiled soon after. Mašḫuiluwa then asked Suppiluliuma's successor Mursili II if he could adopt Kupanta-Kurunta as a son.\n\nMira remained a Hittite ally against Uhha-Ziti of Arzawa; but two years after Mursili's eclipse (which would mean 1310 BC) Mira rebelled under influence from \"Great-House-Father\" (probably an adventurer from Masa).

A 73-year-old ethnic Indian Singaporean man, Aravindan Balakrishnan, and a 67-year-old Tanzanian woman, his wife, Chanda Pattni, had been investigated for slavery and domestic servitude. The case centred around the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought commune which was led by Balakrishnan. In the early 1980s after a police raid, Balakrishnan decided to move the group's activities underground. Balakrishnan's control over his followers intensified and the commune became a prison to his followers. On 25 October 2013, three women were rescued from the commune. These were: a 69-year-old Malaysian woman (later revealed to be Aishah Wahab), a 57-year-old Irish woman (Josephine Herivel) and a 30-year-old British woman (Katy Morgan-Davies). Katy Morgan-Davies was born into the sect and hadn't experienced the outside world until her release.\n\nAravindan Balakrishnan (known to his followers as \"Comrade Bala\") was born in Kerala, India but migrated to Singapore, Malaya, where his father was a soldier, when he was 10. Balakrishnan was a student at Raffles Institution and later the University of Singapore, where although gaining a reputation as a \"quiet chap\", he became increasingly politically active and believed that he would have been imprisoned in Singapore had he openly admitted to being a communist. In 1977, while living in London, His Singaporean citizenship – which he gained in 1960 – was revoked due to his leadership of the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought, which the Ministry of Home Affairs accused of engaging in \"activities which are prejudicial to the security\" of Singapore, and denounced him as a radical \"closely associated with Eurocommunists\". The authorities claimed that Balakrishnan and others, many of them former Singaporean students he had associated with in London, were plotting to overthrow Singapore's leader, Lee Kuan Yew.\n\nDespite believing the United Kingdom to be a fascist state due to its treatment of the people of Singapore during the Malayan Emergency, Balakrishnan emigrated to the UK in 1963 on a British Council scholarship to study at the London School of Economics, and married his wife Chandra in 1971. Over the years he built up a following by giving lectures and staging various sit-ins and protests. He was a regular attendee at London demonstrations, where he waved banners depicting the Chinese leader Mao Zedong and addressed the crowds.\n\nIn 1974, Balakrishnan and his \"small clique\" were expelled from the Communist Party of England (Marxist–Leninist) on account of \"their pursuance of conspiratorial and splittist activities ... spreading social fascist slanders against the Party and the proletarian movement\" and attempting \"to put themselves above the discipline of the Party\". The CPE(M–L) \"repudiated the metaphysical logic harmfully promoted\" by Balakrishnan in \"opposition to dialectical materialism and the concrete analysis of concrete conditions\". In response, Balakrishnan set up the Workers' Institute and launched his own publication, the \"South London Workers' Bulletin\", which accused the CPE(M–L) of being \"fascists\" and \"agents of imperialism\".\n\nBetween 1974 and 1976, his followers attempted to \"build revolutionary stable base areas in working-class communities\", primarily South London, and worked in ordinary jobs. Balakrishnan discouraged his followers from joining trade unions, describing them as agents of the \"imperialist fascist bourgeoisie\".\n\nEventually, after the more liberal members of his group drifted away, a cult of around 10 female members formed around him. The collective moved to Brixton in 1976, under the title Workers Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. Following Mao's death in 1976, the Institute built the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre at 140 Acre Lane, Brixton, which also functioned as a communist collective of \"thirteen comrades\", with \"13 members living on the premises, half in paid work, six doing full-time revolutionary work, with a strong emphasis on women taking a leading role (apart from leading the Party Committee headed by Bala)\". Members were handed a rota of chores and only allowed to go out in pairs, which Balakrishnan claimed was because the area they lived in was \"notorious for violence\" and \"anything could happen\".\n\nFollowing a police raid on the Memorial Centre in March 1978, which the group claimed involved \"over 200 police\", including officers from the Special Patrol Group, \"under the pretext of searching for drugs\", the Workers' Institute effectively went underground, with the remaining members being convinced to end all contact with others and maintain an intense level of secrecy. Family members were later branded fascist agents and ostracised, and Balakrishnan and his captives moved to a number of properties during this time as a means for him to escape detection from the authorities. Balakrishnan convinced his followers that everything was controlled by him from the sun, the moon, wind and fires; that he could overthrow governments, control natural disasters, and make people live or die. In order to progress his cause, Balakrishnan invented \"JACKIE\" (an acronym for Jehovah, Allah, Christ, Krishna and Immortal Easwaran) – a type of dangerous, mystical machine that monitored all thought and could control minds. \n\nBalakrishnan began sexually abusing two of the women in 1979, often physically beating them and making others watch as he did so. All of the women were beaten and four (not including his wife) were said to have been sexually assaulted or engaged with sexual relations with him. Balakrishnan forced the women to swallow his ejaculate as it was \"the elixir of life\", and claimed the women he sexually abused had been trying to seduce him out of \"jealousy\" for his lover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two older victims are believed to have met Balakrishnan in London through, according to police, a shared political ideology, as he was the leader of the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought. The women were not being physically restrained, but held by \"invisible handcuffs\" after being subjected to brainwashing, emotional abuse and physical abuse by their captors. \nThe three women, who are not related, are said to have been held captive for more than 30 years with the youngest of the three thought to have spent her whole life in servitude. However it has not yet been established if she was born in the house from where she was rescued. The police were tipped off by Freedom Charity who contacted police following a phone call they had received on 18 October, during which a woman stated that she'd been held unwillingly for more than 30 years. Aneeta Prem of Freedom Charity confirmed that the Irish woman made contact with the charity after watching the ITV television documentary \"Forced to Marry\" about forced marriage in the United Kingdom. The women, who are said to be \"highly traumatised\", are now in safe accommodation.\n\nThe two suspects were bailed until April 2014, and were unable to return to the three-bedroom flat they rented from a housing association.\n\nOn 11 December 2014, it emerged that Balakrishnan had been charged with offences relating to cruelty to a person under 16, four counts of rape and 17 counts of indecent assault. Balakrishnan appeared before Westminster magistrates on 17 December 2014. His wife, Chanda Pattni, was released earlier in 2014, as there was considered to be insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. \n\nBalakrishnan's trial started on 11 November 2015. During his trial, he acted as the only defence witness, and told jurors that a challenge to his leadership resulted in the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, and that JACKIE was responsible for the death of a Malaysian prime minister and the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Leader of the Labour Party.\n\nOn 4 December 2015, Balakrishnan was convicted of child cruelty, false imprisonment, four counts of rape, six counts of indecent assault and two counts of assault. On 29 January 2016, Balakrishnan was jailed for 23 years. \n"}

{"id": "58589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58589", "title": "Name change", "text": "Name change\n\nName change generally refers to the legal act by a person of adopting a new name different from their name at birth, marriage or adoption.\n\nThe procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, common law jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while civil law jurisdictions are more restrictive.\n\nA pseudonym is a name that differs from the original or true name and does not require legal sanction. It is generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but can also be done for personal, social or ideological reasons.\n\n\nIn the United States, state laws regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes (changing the name at will), including \"Lindon v. First National Bank\".\n\nUsually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change. Although the states (except Louisiana) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a court order is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a state court), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change. It is necessary to plead that the name change is not for a fraudulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a lien or debt or for defaming someone else.\n\nApplicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited judicial discretion to grant or deny a change of name, usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or immoral purposes.\nIn 2004, a Missouri man succeeded in changing his name to They. The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (\"Application of Dengler\", 1979); the North Dakota Supreme Court had denied the same request several years before (\"Petition of Dengler\", 1976).\n\nIn nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a racial slur, a threat, or an obscenity.\n\nSome examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:\n\nUnder the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more Americanized names. During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a federal court. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of law enforcement. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a federal court naturalizes an applicant.\n\nTo maintain a person's identity, it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.\n\nThe \"open and notorious\" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an assumed name. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, secretary of state, or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under pseudonyms; such a right is protected under case law pursuant to United States Constitution.\n\nA common law name (i.e. one assumed for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name. In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method, unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.\n\nIn California the \"usage method\" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name. Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively. Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.\n\nSpecifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 and Family Code § 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 (a) reads, \"Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name.\" Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code § 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)\n\nMany universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a \"preferred name\" instead of one's legal name. This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and student ID cards. It provides a \"transitional\"\nname change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.\n\nA legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the Social Security Administration, Bureau of Consular Affairs (for passports), the Federal Communications Commission, the Selective Service System and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.\n\nAlthough state requirements differ, it is generally recommended to first register a new name with the Social Security office as some state motor-vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes; Arizona is one of these states.\n\nMost states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time. For example, South Carolina, and Wyoming require a name change be registered with their office within ten days. Illinois, Texas and Vermont require it be registered within 30 days, while North Carolina allows up to 60 days. New York requires visiting a local motor vehicle office to change the name on all records and documents, but without a definite deadline to do so. The fees for registering a new name vary from state to state. The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.\n\nMany states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (\"e.g.\", intellectual property rights) of others.\n\nIn the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.\n\nIn theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their passport, driving licence, tax and National Insurance records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that \"documentary evidence\" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as birth, marriage and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are \"matters of fact\", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.\n\nDocumentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, decree absolute, civil partnership certificate, statutory declaration or deed of change of name. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.\n\nPeople whose births are registered in England and Wales may have their deed poll enrolled at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. See also College of Arms#Change of names.\n\nFrom the mediaeval age to the 19th century, the era of family dynasties, name changes were frequently demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, of members of the gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by marriage settlements, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's dowry her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private Act of Parliament or by obtaining a Royal Licence. A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname \"in addition to\" his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the \"double-barrelled\", even the \"triple-barrelled\" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy \"squirearchy\" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.\n\nWell known examples are:\n\nPeople whose births are registered in Scotland (or who were adopted in Scotland) can change their name in the same way as people from the rest of the United Kingdom. However they can optionally apply to the Registrar General for Scotland to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated.\n\nIndividuals may legally change their name through the state and territory governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled \"Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages\". Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate) and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.\n\nInstitutions such as banks, the Passports Office and transport authorities require proof of identity, so people who change their names need to have proof of the change.\n\nIf a person's birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person's birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued birth certificate if born in Australia and/or \"Change of Name Certificate\". These certificates are recognised secure identity documents and can be verified electronically through the Attorney-general of Australia's Document Verification Service.\nIn Canada a person can informally call themselves whatever they want. In all provinces except Quebec, when someone gets married they can change their last name without legally changing their name by using their Marriage Certificate as verification of the name change. It is almost impossible for married women in Québec to take their husbands' names.\nLike the United States, the requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. Except for Ontario, British Columbia and New Brunswick, Canadians must be 18 to change their names and have lived in the province they are changing it in for at least 3 months to a year, depending on province. (In British Columbia, Canadians must be 19 to change their names, in Ontario and New Brunswick 16.) People younger than the province's age of majority can change their names if they have their guardians' consent, are legally married, or have a common law marriage. To change a name, a Name Change application must be submitted to either the Ministry of Government Services, Court of justice or Registrar of civil status. A document such as a birth certificate must be submitted. A statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious. In Canada, a name cannot cause confusion, be used for misrepresentation or fraud and in most cases the name change is announced in newspapers. There is a fee involved and it ranges from $10 to $185 depending on the territory or province. British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba need fingerprints to be submitted before one changes their name.\n\nIt is a common practice for ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong to adopt a western-style English name in addition to their transliterated Chinese name. As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their legal English name is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.\n\nHowever, the Immigration Department which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll. Only one application of this kind is allowed for each applicant; any application for subsequent change(s) must be made with a deed poll.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, a person earns their name by \"use and repute\". For most purposes it is enough to simply use the desired name and ask others to call you by that name. For some administrative purposes, such as changing a name on a driving licence or legally changing gender, a deed of change of name must be registered with the Four Courts.\n\nFrom September 1995, New Zealanders can change their name by making a statutory declaration and, if approved, the new name is registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriages section of the Department of Internal Affairs (Identity Services). Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by deed poll.\n\nIn general, unlike in common law countries, names cannot be changed at will in civil law jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of personal identification numbers, that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.\n\nIn Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: \"Arrêté royal\", Dutch: \"Koninklijk besluit\") for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:\n\nAccording to the Brazilian Civil Code and the Public Registries Act, the name registered after birth is definitive and immutable. However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: \n\nIn India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.\n\nAlthough it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.\n\n2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order. Administrative Order No. 1 Series of 2001, implemented the law. It authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change the first name or nickname in the civil register without need of a judicial order.\n\nIn case of controversial and substantial changes, Philippines jurisprudence requires full-blown court lawsuit, that must include the local civil registrar in the petition, since RA 9048 and Rule 108 (Cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court do not allow the change of sex in a birth certificate.\n\nThe only landmark case in the Philippines on name and legal sex change is the Jeff Cagandahan case. The Supreme Court of the Philippines Justice Leonardo Quisumbing on September 12, 2008, allowed Cagandahan, 27, who has congenital adrenal hyperplasia, to change his birth certificate name from Jennifer to Jeff, and his legal gender from female to male.\n\nAlthough as in other jurisdictions residents of Quebec may informally use whatever name they want, procedures for formal name change are very strict as Quebec (unlike the rest of Canada) operates under a civil law system. The decision must be authorized by the Director of Civil Status, and requires a valid reason for changing the name, including long-term use of the new name (in the Montreuil case cited below, the Quebec appeals court has considered five years' use to be a sufficient reason), difficulty of use due to spelling or pronunciation, or bearing a name that another person has made infamous.\n\nOnly a judge may authorize a name change for a child for reasons of abandonment, deprivation of parental authority, or change in filiation such as adoption.\n\nThis has occasionally led to controversy. A lawyer named Micheline Montreuil, a non-operative transgender woman, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the director of civil status refused to permit the change on the grounds that a legal male could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed sex reassignment surgery, which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeal ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name. (Montreuil was initially prevented from changing her name despite this ruling on the grounds that she had not established general use, as normally required for a name change; the Quebec appeals court finally authorized the change on November 7, 2002.)\n\nThe Director of Civil Status will amend a Quebec birth certificate if a name change certificate is issued by another province. Some have used that loophole by temporarily moving to one of Canada's other provinces, which follow the more permissive common-law rules, in order to get the legal documents.\n\nSouth Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil Roman Dutch law, mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in South Africa are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.\n\nA person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the Department of Home Affairs. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a \"good and sufficient reason\" for the change.\n\nA married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)\n\nSouth Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.\n\nThe surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.\n\nIn Switzerland, a name change requires the approval of the respective Cantonal government, if there are important reasons (\"wichtige Gründe\" / \"justes motifs\") for the change, according to article 30 of the Swiss Civil Code. When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. According to the case law of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.\n\nIn Taiwan, the government strictly regulates when one's surname, given name or both may or may not be changed, under the Name Act (姓名條例) since 1953 with 10 articles, totally amended into 14 articles in 2001, and the (姓名條例施行細則).\n\nLegally permitted reasons to change one's given name are:\n\nAdherents of various religions change their name upon conversion or confirmation. The name adopted may not have any legal status but will represent their adopted religious beliefs.\n\n\n\nThere is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called Shudhikaran (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become Hindu may be optionally given a new Dharma (religious) name, which is usually based on Sanskrit or Indian name such as names based on Hindu deities.\n\nThe last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Their members included outspoken author and playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa, Saturday Dobee, Nordu Eawo, Daniel Gbooko, Paul Levera, Felix Nuate, Baribor Bera, Barinem Kiobel, and John Kpuine (Tripathi, p.189), who were executed by hanging in 1995 by the military dictatorship of General Sani Abacha and buried in Port Harcourt Cemetery. \n\nThe executions provoked international condemnation and led to the increasing treatment of Nigeria as a pariah state until General Abacha's mysterious death in 1998. Saro-Wiwa had previously been a critic of the Royal Dutch Shell oil corporation, and had been imprisoned for a year prior to the executions in November 1995.\n\nAt least two witnesses who testified that Saro-Wiwa was involved in the murders of the Ogoni elders later recanted, stating that they had been bribed with money and offers of jobs with Shell to give false testimony – in the presence of Shell’s lawyer.\n\nIn 1996, the Center for Constitutional Rights sued Shell for its complicity in human rights abuses against the Ogoni people, such as colluding with the Nigerian government to bring about the arrest and execution of the Ogoni Nine. In June 2009, on the eve of trial, the parties agreed to a settlement providing a total of $15.5 million to compensate the plaintiffs, establish a trust for the benefit of the Ogoni people, and cover some of the legal costs and fees associated with the case.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35307882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35307882", "title": "Patrial name", "text": "Patrial name\n\nA patrial name or geographical surname is a surname or second cognomen given to person deriving from a toponym, the name for a geographical place. It was particularly common in ancient Greece and Rome.\nThe lack of a family surname and use of a geographical cognomen as a surname may the sign of a lower class, such as courtesans when signing a contract. With medieval writers, Christian, Jewish and Muslim, whose works circulated around many countries, geographical cognomens sometimes served to distinguish better than \"son of,\" \"ben\" or \"ibn.\" \n\nRoman Military commanders often took a second cognomen, an agnomen, recalling a victorious campaign: Africanus, Asiaticus, Macedonicus, Numantinus. These may be inherited as in the case of Augustus who inherited the cognomen Thurinus.\n\nExamples in formation of patrial names include:\n\n1. definite article and noun - using a demonym (also called gentile name or gentilic, from Latin \"nomen gentile\" or \"gentilicium\")\n\n2. unclear: indefinite noun / adjectival forms\n3. adjectives - a common Latin method for making a toponymic adjective is to add -[i]ensis\n\n4. genitive \"of\" constructions\n\nIn examples 1 through 3, where the noun or adjective has case declension the partial name will typically decline in accordance with normal noun or adjective rules. For example, in \"Giraldi Cambrensis opera\" - \"the works of [genitive] Gerald of Wales\" - \"Giraldus\" declines to \"Giraldi\" (the genitive form of Gerald) and \"cambrensis\" (nominative adjective) declines to \"cambrensis\" (genitive adjective, but the same as nominative in this example). The declension is normally not followed when citing Latin patrial names in English, \"of Giraldus Cambrensis,\" but may cause confusion when trying to identify the nominative spellings of patrial names from Latin or Greek sources.\n\nModern era examples in Europe are generally limited to nicknames, or deliberate choices of a birthplace as a penname or stagename or change of name by deed poll:\n"}
{"id": "3488351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3488351", "title": "People", "text": "People\n\nA people is a plurality of persons considered as a whole, as is the case with an ethnic group or nation. Collectively, for example, the contemporary Frisians and Danes are two related Germanic peoples, while various Middle Eastern ethnic groups are often linguistically categorized as Semitic peoples.\n\nVarious states govern, or claim to govern, in the name of \"the people\". Both the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire used the Latin term \"Senatus Populusque Romanus\", (the Senate and People of Rome). This term was fixed to Roman legionary standards, and even after the Roman Emperors achieved a state of total personal autarchy, they continued to wield their power in the name of the Senate and People of Rome.\n\nA People's Republic is typically a Marxist or socialist one-party state that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a dictatorship. Populism is another umbrella term for various political tendencies that claim to represent the people, usually with an implication that they serve the \"common people\" instead of the elite.\n\nChapter One, Article One of the Charter of the United Nations states that peoples have the right to self-determination.\n\nIn criminal law, in certain jurisdictions, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of \"the People\". Several U.S. states, including California, Illinois, and New York, use this style. Citations outside the jurisdictions in question usually substitute the name of the state for the words \"the People\" in the case captions. Four states — Massachusetts, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky — refer to themselves as \"the Commonwealth\" in case captions and legal process. Other states, such as Indiana, typically refer to themselves as \"the State\" in case captions and legal process. Outside the United States, criminal trials in Ireland and the Philippines are prosecuted in the name of the people of their respective states.\n\nThe political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the sovereign; thus, in these U.S. states, the \"people\" are judged to be the sovereign, even as in the United Kingdom and other dependencies of the British Crown, criminal prosecutions are typically brought in the name of the Crown. \"The people\" identifies the entire body of the citizens of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes.\n\n"}

The phrase generally refers to a section of the closing credits of films, listing the babies' given names. The custom of publishing lists of production babies began with animated films, and is still chiefly found in that genre, reflecting the influence of family experiences on storytelling in such films.\n\nThe first list of production babies was included by Pixar in the credits of their first full-length movie \"Toy Story\" in 1995.\n\nLee Unkrich, a film director with Pixar, explains that the production team and film crew indelibly associate the birth of each of their children with the film they were working on at the time. The listing in the end credits becomes a way for them to share these essential memories more widely. \"It's like our family lives are permanently woven into the movies.\" Twists added in film credits include a list of \"Chameleon Babies\" at the end of the 2010 animated film \"Tangled\", born to the real-life model for the pet in the film. The 2011 animated film \"Winnie the Pooh\" lists the names under \"Pooh Babies,\" with the credit knitted on a piece of fabric by the character Kanga.\n\nDisney film director Byron Howard cites the listing of production babies as a pointer to the depth of personal relationships established during collaboration on an animated movie.\n\nA star next to a baby's name honors a baby who passed away before production was complete.\n\nIn 2009, Ari Folman dedicated his Golden Globe Award to the eight production babies born during the making of \"Waltz with Bashir\", an animated anti-war documentary, and expressed hope that their lives would have no contact with the realities of conflict depicted in the film.\n\nReviewers have noted that \"production babies\" credits indicate the creativity of film people in giving some unusual names to their children.\n\nAn early, isolated instance in video games occurred with an easter egg message embedded in the ROM for the 1988 game \"Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball\" for Mattel Intellivision. The modern custom spread to video game credits in the 2005 game \"Call of Duty 2\", and the 2009 game \"\", which also listed the other parents. The title of the list was changed to \"Development Babies\" in \"\". A number of other games have since done the same.\n"}

{"id": "52406994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52406994", "title": "She-wolf (Roman mythology)", "text": "She-wolf (Roman mythology)\n\nIn the Roman foundation myth, it was a she-wolf that nursed and sheltered the twins Romulus and Remus after they were abandoned in the wild by order of King Amulius of Alba Longa. She cared for the infants at her den, a cave known as the Lupercal, until they were discovered by a shepherd, Faustulus. Romulus would later become the founder and first king of Rome. The image of the she-wolf suckling the twins has been a symbol of Rome since ancient times and is one of the most recognizable icons of ancient mythology.\n\nThere is evidence that the wolf held a special place in the world of the ancient inhabitants of Italy. One legend claims that the Hirpini people were so-called because, when they set out to found their first colony, they were led to its location by a wolf (from the Sabine word for wolf: \"hirpus\"). The tale of the Lupercal is central to that of the twins, and probably predates theirs. To the Roman god Mars the wolf is a sacred animal. There is an ongoing debate about a connection to the ancient Roman festival of the Lupercalia.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Apollo's mother Leto is reported to have given birth to him as a she-wolf, to evade Hera.\n\nThe 3 \"canonical\" versions of the myth--those of Livy, Plutarch and Dionysius of Halicarnassus--all draw heavily on Quintus Fabius Pictor. He is considered one of Rome's earliest historians and his now lost work describes the she-wolf and her episode with the twins. The twins were abandoned at the order of Amulius. Some tales claim that they were to be left along the riverbank, others that they were to be cast into the water. The servant charged with the task either thought better of it, or could not get close enough to do the deed because of the flooding. Instead, he left them in the standing water that had formed at the foot of Palatine Hill. The twins were found either after their basket had been left at the foot of the fig tree, or came to rest there after floating in the water. In each case, the she-wolf rescued them and gently cared for them in or near the Lupercal. Later, they were discovered by local shepherds.\n\nDionysius reports that rains had raised the water level such that when Amulius' servant arrived at the appointed spot (around a dozen miles from Alba Longa), they left the twins in the floodwaters because they couldn't go any further. The basket they were in floated along until the waters receded and it struck a stone, tossing them out into the mud. The she-wolf arrived and lowered her teats to the crying babes and licked them clean of the mud.\n\nAfter a shepherd happened upon the scene in the course of tending his flock, he ran to tell his companions, and a group gathered to witness the remarkable sight. The twins were clinging to her as she was their true mother. The she-wolf was nonplussed when the men began making a ruckus to scare her off. She withdrew into a cave that was sacred to the Greek colonists who had formerly lived in the area and held an altar to the nature god Pan.\n\nLivy claims that the servants of Amulius dropped the twins in the standing water out of simple laziness. The fig tree just happened to be the first spot they came to and they figured the twins would drown no matter what. The twins cried in their basket until the waters receded and left them back on land. The she-wolf arrived from the hills looking for a drink of water when she heard their cries.\n\nThe servant was too afraid of the torrential waters to fully carry out the king's orders, according to Plutarch. After being left on the bank, the waters rose further and swept the twins away. It gently carried them along and then dropped them at the fig tree.\n\nThe three relay accounts wherein the term \"lupa\" refers not to a she-wolf, but is a slang word for prostitute. Plutarch tells two other stories not involving the she-wolf or abandonment. In one, the twins are fathered by Hercules after he wins a dice game. Their mother is the unwitting \"prize\". In another, the twins are switched at birth by their grandfather for a different pair of infants and secreted out of the city to be raised by shepherds and later, educated in nearby Gabii.\n\nThe \"Bolsena Mirror\" features a depiction of the she-wolf and the twins surrounded by human and animal figures. Differences in interpretation have precluded virtually any consensus regarding many of its features. This includes its age. However, it is consistent with other such mirrors, made as bridal gifts, in 4th century BC Euritria, perhaps circa 330-340. The famous Capitoline Wolf may be of Etruscan or Old Latin origin. But, a discovery during its restoration in 2000 and radiocarbon dating has cast doubt on an ancient origin. A stele from Bologna, dated to between 350-400 BC, depicts an animal, possibly a wolf, nursing a single infant. By 269 BC, the silver didrachm is the earliest depiction of the complete icon, with the characteristic \"turning of the she-wolf's head\" backward and downward at the twins.\n\nThe distinctive imagery of the she-wolf and the twins made it more recognizable than other symbols of the city, such as Roma, the patron deity of the city, or the Roman eagle. That was useful as the Roman world expanded and symbols of Rome became more important in maintaining unity. By the 1st century AD, the she-wolf was common in both Rome and the provinces. She and the twins were featured on the elaborate Ara Pacis, built in honor of Augustus and dedicated to Pax, the goddess of peace.\n\nCoins with their depiction were minted and widely circulated. They were also produced in Roman Colonies as a way to express their own \"Roman-ness\". They have been found on personal items such as swords, buckles, lamps and statuettes as well as monuments, mosaic floors and funerary stones that date from the 1st through the 3rd centuries AD.\n\nThe Franks Casket, an ornately carved, Anglo-Saxon chest from the 8th–9th century, probably crafted in a monastery in Northern France, features the she-wolf and twins, along with a Runic account of the lupercal. Other Anglo-Saxon artifacts and coins from the same period also feature them. The Byzantines continued to use the image, and coins attributed to them have been found in various locations in central Asia at sites located in modern Tadjikistan and Uzbekistan along with an 8th-century Sogdian painted mural with a she-wolf, head turned back and down, suckling two infants.\n\nThe Italian football clubs A.S. Roma and S.S. Robur Siena use the imagery in their respective team logos.\n\nThe Fascist government of Benito Mussolini made use of the she-wolf while in power.\n\nThe Sienese have a traditional tale that the city was founded by Senius and Aschius, another pair of twins who were also suckled by a she-wolf. They were the sons of Remus and fled Rome after his death at the hands of their uncle Romulus. The legend cannot be attested to prior to the Renaissance. However, depictions of a she-wolf and twins are common in the city and some can be dated earlier.\nThe she-wolf and twins appeared on what may have been the earliest silver coin ever minted in Rome.\nThe Lupercalia was a very ancient festival even during Roman times. Roman historians speculated as to its origins. It may be associated with the god Lupercus, the god of shepherds and protector of flocks. Some historians link it to the she-wolf and the Lupercal.\n\n"}

Many are young, new actresses who go on to receive considerable media attention after appearing in one of Chow's films, and their success is often attributed to the attention brought to them by Chow—Zhang Yuqi, for example, has been referred to as Chow's \"protégée\" after appearing in the 2007 film \"CJ7\". The Chinese word 星 \"xīng\" refers both to Chow's nickname 星爷 (\"Sing Yeh\", \"Grandmaster Sing\") and to 明星, the word for a star or celebrity.\n\nChow has not always chosen newcomer actresses to co-star with him; for example, Vicki Zhao already had a successful music and film career when she appeared as the female lead in \"Shaolin Soccer\", and Gong Li was already famous as an \"Yimou girl\" () for her frequent collaboration with director Zhang Yimou before she starred in two Stephen Chow films in the early 1990s.

{"id": "29298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29298", "title": "Spouse", "text": "Spouse\n\nA spouse is a life partner in a marriage, civil union, or common-law marriage. The term is gender neutral, whereas a male spouse is a husband and a female spouse is a wife. Although a spouse is a form of significant other, the latter term also includes non-marital partners who play a social role similar to that of a spouse, but do not have rights and duties reserved by law to a spouse.\n\nThe legal status of a spouse, and the specific rights and obligations associated with that status, vary significantly among the jurisdictions of the world. These regulations are usually described in family law statutes. However, in many parts of the world, where civil marriage is not that prevalent, there is instead customary marriage, which is usually regulated informally by the community. In many parts of the world, spousal rights and obligations are related to the payment of bride price, dowry or dower. Historically, many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to male marital partners that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to female marital partners. In particular, the control of marital property, inheritance rights, and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage, have typically been given to male marital partners. However, this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century, and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender. Among the last European countries to establish full gender equality in marriage were Switzerland, Greece, Spain, and France in the 1980s. In various marriage laws around the world, however, the husband continues to have authority; for instance the Civil Code of Iran states at Article 1105: \"In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband\".\n\nDepending on jurisdiction, the refusal or inability of a spouse to perform the marital obligations may constitute a ground for divorce, legal separation or annulment. The latter two options are more prevalent in countries where the dominant religion is Roman Catholicism, some of which introduced divorce only recently (i.e. Italy in 1970, Portugal in 1975, Brazil in 1977, Spain in 1981, Argentina in 1987, Paraguay in 1991, Colombia in 1991, Ireland in 1996, Chile in 2004 and Malta in 2011). In recent years, many Western countries have adopted no fault divorce. In some parts of the world, the formal dissolution of a marriage is complicated by the payments and goods which have been exchanged between families (this is common where marriages are arranged). This often makes it difficult to leave a marriage, especially for the woman: in some parts of Africa, once the bride price has been paid, the wife is seen as belonging to the husband and his family; and if she wants to leave, the husband may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the girl's family. The girl's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back.\n\nRegardless of legislation, personal relations between spouses may also be influenced by local culture and religion, which may promote male authority over the wife: for instance the word (ba`al), Hebrew for \"husband\", used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with \"owner\" and \"master\".\n\nThere is often a minimum legal marriageable age. The United Nations Population Fund stated the following:\n\nAlthough in Western countries spouses sometimes choose not to have children, such a choice is not accepted in some parts of the world. In some cultures and religions, the quality of a spouse imposes an obligation to have children. In northern Ghana, for example, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control are at risks of threats and coercion.\n\nThere are many ways in which a spouse is chosen, which vary across the world, and include love marriage, arranged marriage, and forced marriage. The latter is in some jurisdictions a void marriage or a voidable marriage. Forcing someone to marry is also a criminal offense in some countries.\n\n"}

Its name derives from its role as the continuation, covering the years 813–961, of the chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor, which reaches from 285 to 813. The manuscript consists of four distinct works, in style and form very unlike the annalistic approach of Theophanes.\n\nThe first work, of four books consists of a series of biographies of the emperors reigning from 813 to 867 (from Leo the Armenian to Michael III). As they were commissioned by Emperor Constantine VII (r. 913–959), they reflect the point of view of the reigning Macedonian dynasty. The unknown author probably used the same sources as Genesios. The second work is known as the \"Vita Basilii\" (Latin for \"Life of Basil\"), a biography of Basil I the Macedonian (r. 867–886) written by his grandson Constantine VII probably around 950. The work is essentially a panegyric, praising Basil and his reign while vilifying his predecessor, Michael III. The third work is a history of the years 886–948, in form and content very close to the history of Symeon Logothetes, and the final section continues it until 961. It was probably written by Theodore Daphnopates, shortly before 963.\n\n\n"}
