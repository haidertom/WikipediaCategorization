This is somewhat akin to playing air guitar, explaining the name. The creator, \"J-Taro Sugisaku\", says that it was invented in Tokyo in 2006 by a group of bored men without girlfriends. \n\nA report about the phenomenon in the Japanese magazine \"Weekly Playboy\" in 2006 was picked up by the English language web site \"Mainichi Daily News\". A video of the air sex \"world championship\" was uploaded to YouTube in January 2007. This was followed by a segment of the BBC Three documentary show \"Japanorama\" in March 2007, subsequently uploaded to YouTube and flagged as \"inappropriate for some users\".\n\nThese videos led to coverage in the blogosphere. The \"Japanorama\" video was shown in May 2007 at the JACON 2007 convention in Orlando, Florida, and a spontaneous air sex competition ensued, footage of which also found its way to YouTube.\n\nIn late January and early February 2007, a group of American black male teenagers calling themselves \"Peer Pressure\" produced two videos showing air sex set to music, published on YouTube under the user name \"amp6\". Fleshbot called these \"The Best Air Sex Video of All Time\".\n\nSince August 2007, The Alamo Drafthouse has been holding bimonthly Air Sex competitions in the US. In June 2009 The Alamo Drafthouse toured the country on the Air Sex World Championships tour crowning Air Sex Champions in 14 cities. Later that October the first ever world champion was crowned when Shanghai Slammer from Los Angeles out-performed every other city champion. The tour was hosted by comedian Chris Trew. In October 2010 the group will tour once more. Photos are posted on the Alamo Drafthouse Flickr page.\n"}
{"id": "3329308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3329308", "title": "Applied Drama", "text": "Applied Drama\n\nApplied Drama, also known as Applied Theatre, Interactive Theatre or Applied Drama and Theatre (ADT) is an umbrella term for the use of drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context. It is often done in non-theatrical spaces, with participants who do not consider themselves to be artists.\n\nThere are several forms and practices considered to be under the umbrella of Applied Drama. In all these fields approaches and methods of Applied Improvisation are used. \n\nApplied Drama is a term that has been contested, gaining popularity towards the end of the 20th century to describe drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.\n\nJames Thompson states that \"Applied theatre is a participatory theatre created by people who would not usually make theatre. It is, I would hope, a practice by, with and for the excluded and marginalised.\" \n\nJudith Ackyroyd confirms the inclusion of both of these elements in ADT: \"I have identified two features which I believe to be central to our understanding of applied theatre; an intention to generate change (of awareness, attitude, behaviour, etc), and the participation of the audience.\"\n\nApplied drama can be either scripted or unscripted. Some practitioners focus primarily on improvisation, whereas others introduce a range of artistic practices, such as developing scripted plays, devised performances, or indigenous forms of cultural performance, sometimes combined with new forms of digital communication.\n\nPlayback Theatre involves audience or group members telling stories from their lives and viewing them as enacted by actors improvising. It can also be used in conjunction with Narrative Therapy.\n\nDrama in healthcare is drama created in medical contexts, often with the intention of rehabilitation.\n\nThis form of Applied Drama focuses on using theatre to educate, engage, and stimulate healing in medical professionals, patients, and the general public. Theatre and drama in healthcare are tilted towards conscientizing the populace about their health and improving their health and longevity irrespective of status or social stratification. This form of drama is often used to educate people on important health issues such as healthy eating, grief and loss, exercise, and sexual assault prevention. Examples include using actors to role-play health ailments in order to train healthcare professionals, performing plays focused on primary prevention, and facilitating drama workshops for patients.\n\nDrama therapy is the use of Applied Drama techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote mental health.\n\nDrama therapy is rooted in a clinical practice, facilitated by licensed clinicians, that stimulates language, cognitive development and builds resilience.\n\nTheatre for Development uses Applied Drama techniques to facilitate development in less developed countries.\n\nDrama in Education can allow students to develop an understanding of themselves and others. Kathleen Galllagher has argued that 'What is clear is that there is no correct pedagogical model on offer for drama education. [...] In theatre pedagogy, we not only endow experience with meaning, but we are - as players - invited to make manifest our own subjectivities in the world evoked through character and play, a world laden with metaphor and nuance, a world where relationship to other and self-spectatorship are in dynamic and unrelenting interaction.'\n\nTheatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in the mid-1960s. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cite TIE as \"one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice.\" TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.\n\nPractitioner Lynn Hoare defines TIE as a combination of \"theatrical elements with interactive moments in which audience participants (in or out of role) work with actor-teachers towards an educational or social goal, using the tools of theatre in service of this goal.\"\n\nScholar Helen Nicholson notes that this work \"involves professional theatre-makers working with young people in all kinds of educational settings and learning environments, including schools, hospitals, theaters, museums and heritage sites.\"\n\nTIE seeks to educate young people in issues that are relevant to both them and their communities, for example: bullying, dating violence, environmental preservation, and peer conflict resolution. \"TIE companies have always been among the most socially conscious of theatre groups, consistently choosing to examine issues they believe to be of direct relevance to the lives of the children with whom they work.\"\n\n\"Theatre for Dialogue\" (TFD) is a more recent term describing a model that was created specifically for the University of Texas at Austin campus community which pulls methods and theory from a variety of applied theatre practices such as TO and TIE. In her thesis, Spring Snyder explains that \"Theatre For Dialogue performances explore the intersection between theatre and education as a way to investigate, reflect, provoke dialogue and serve as a rehearsal for reality without asking participants to share their own personal experiences. Although some of the Theatre For Dialogue’s roots originate from an adapted form of Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed’s forum structure, it is Theatre in Education (TIE) that more closely aligns with TFD.\"\n\nIn prison theatre, practitioners engage offenders in correctional facilities, jails, prisons, and detention centers in exploring drama work often with the objective of education or rehabilitation.\n\nExamples include Wabash Valley Correctional Facility’s \"Shakespeare in Shackles\" where maximum security prisoners learn about and perform Shakespeare. The University of Texas’ Center for Women and Gender Studies’ Performing Justice Project works with incarcerated female youth to learn about gender and racial justice while devising a play based on the youth’s unique experiences.\n\nThe Theatre of the Oppressed (TO) describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal first developed in the 1960s, initially in Brazil and later in Europe. Boal's techniques aim to use theatre as means of promoting social and political change through allowing the audience to take an active role in the creation of the show. Theatre of the Oppressed can include aspects of Forum Theatre, Invisible Theatre, Legislative Theatre and Image Theatre.\n\nMuseum theatre aims to use theatrical techniques to add emotion and value to the museum experience. It is typically more common in cultural institutions like heritage sites, history museums, and science and industry museums. As with the other forms of applied drama, it can involve a variety of theatrical techniques.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "275510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275510", "title": "Beer pong", "text": "Beer pong\n\nBeer pong, also known as Beirut, is a drinking game in which players throw a ping pong ball across a table with the intent of landing the ball in a cup of beer on the other end. The game typically consists of opposing teams of two or more players per side with 6 or 10 cups set up in a triangle formation on each side. Each team then takes turns attempting to shoot ping pong balls into the opponent's cups. If a ball lands in a cup (known as a 'make'), the contents of that cup are consumed by the other team and the cup is removed from the table. The first team to eliminate all of the opponent's cups is the winner.\n\nBeer pong is played at parties, bars, colleges/universities and other venues such as tailgating at sporting events.\n\nThe game was originally believed to have evolved from the original beer pong played with paddles which is generally regarded to have had its origins within the fraternities of Dartmouth College in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s, where it has since become part of the social culture of the campus. The original version resembled an actual ping pong game with a net and one or more cups of beer on each side of the table. Eventually, a version without paddles was invented and the names \"Beer Pong\" and \"Beirut\" were adopted in some areas of the United States sometime in the 1980s.\n\nBucknell University's student-run newspaper, \"The Bucknellian\", claims Delta Upsilon fraternity members at Bucknell created \"Throw Pong\", a game very similar to beer pong, during the 1970s, and that \"Throw Pong\" was then brought to Lehigh University by fraternity brothers who visited Bucknell and this led to the creation of the version of beer pong that is played today.\n\nIn some places, \"Beer Pong\" refers to the version of the game with paddles, and \"Beirut\" to the version without. However, according to a CollegeHumor survey, \"beer pong\" is the more common term than \"Beirut\" for the paddle-less game.\n\nThe origin of the name \"Beirut\" is disputed. A 2004 op-ed article in the \"Daily Princetonian,\" the student newspaper at Princeton University, suggested that the name was possibly coined at Bucknell or Lehigh University around the time of the Lebanese Civil War. Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, was the scene of much fighting during the war, particularly mortar fire.\n\nBeer pong is usually played with two teams of two to four players each. Each team begins the game by standing at either end of the table behind their rack of cups.\n\nAlthough the game is typically played on either a ping pong table or a folding banquet table, enthusiasts may create a personalized table for use by friends and visitors. In general, this will be a plywood board cut to proper size, sometimes painted with sports, school, or fraternity symbols and given a liquid-proof coating. Some companies sell tables, including portable and inflatable tables. However, the game can be played on any flat surface.\n\nThe most common cups used are disposable plastic cups (such as red Solo cups) with ridge-lines which can be used precisely to measure the amount of beer to be poured into the cup. On each side of the table, teams assemble equilateral triangles with a convergence point focusing on the other team. Games typically use ten cups. Each team usually also has a separate cup of water used to rinse off the ball.\nAn inexpensive pale lager or light beer of 3.2–5% ABV is sometimes preferred because of the large quantities consumed during the course of several games. Sometimes under house rules, there might be cups of other liquors used during the game. For non-drinkers, the game may be played without beer, as is done at Utah State University, where alcohol is not allowed on campus; root beer is used instead. For sanitary reasons, the game may also be played with cups of water that players do not drink from, instead drinking from a separate cup of beer or alcohol.\n\nTraditionally, the game of beer pong has been played by countless variations of rule sets. In recent years, organizations such as The World Series of Beer Pong have put forth \"official\" rules. Typically, players abide by a uniform set of \"house rules\" which are often consistent within one university or region of the country (e.g. \"West Coast rules\") or may vary on a \"house-by-house\" basis. Number of cups, bouncing, re-racking, amount of alcohol, distance shots must be taken from, etc. may all vary. All house rules should be posted or verbally stated and understood by both teams before the game starts.\n\nThe order of play varies - both players on one team can shoot, followed by both players on the other team, or players on opposite teams can alternate back and forth. A cup that is made must immediately have its contents drunk and be removed from play. Some rule sets allow for \"\"re-racking\" (also known as \"reforming\", \"rearranging\", \"consolidation\"\", and other names), which is a rearrangement of a team's remaining cups after some have been removed. The formations, number of cups, when to rearrange and so on, depend on the rule set. For example, a team with three remaining cups may ask the other team to \"re-rack\" the cups into a single triangle formation.\n\nCommon house rules allow players to 'finger' or blow the ball out of the cup if the ball spins around the inner rim. Another common house rule states that if a team makes both shots during their turn, a 'rollback' occurs allowing each player to shoot again. In the World Series of Beer Pong rules, only a single-ball 'rollback' occurs resulting in a three cup maximum that can be made per turn.\n\nBefore shooting, teams may dunk the ping pong balls into cups of water in order to wash off the balls. However, research has shown that the wash cups can still hold bacteria such as \"E. coli\". As a result, players may put water in the cups instead of beer, keeping a separate beer on the side to drink from.\n\nThere are three common ways to shoot in beer pong: the arc, the fastball (or \"laser, snipe, kamikaze\"), and the bounce shot. The most common throwing technique is the arc shot, where one grasps the ping pong ball with the tips of the thumb and forefinger, holds the arm at an angle with the ball upwards, then throws using a gentle elbow motion holding the upper arm parallel with the table.\n\nSome players throw \"fastball\" style which uses more of a hard chopping motion to send the ball in a more direct line toward the intended target cup. A fastball shot may be favorable if house rules dictate that a cup knocked over is removed from the table, in which case a fastball can eliminate multiple cups if thrown hard enough.\n\nA bounce shot is performed by bouncing the ball towards the cups. Depending on house rules, if the other team has the opportunity to swat away a bounced ball, a bounce shot may be worth more than one cup.\n\nIf a team makes their last cup, the other team loses unless they can make all of their remaining cups; this is called a rebuttal or redemption. If the losing team can hit their redemption shots, then the game is forced into overtime where three cups are used instead of the normal ten cups.\n\nAnother 'house rule' can be stated before or during the game in the midst of a shutout. A shutout in beer pong occurs if one team makes all ten of their cups and the opposite team makes none of their cups. If the shutout does occur, the losing team must do whatever the two teams decided on, such as going streaking (naked lap) or drinking a large quantity of beer.\n\nAlso depending on 'house rules', there are other ways to end the game. Cups that were accidentally left in the rack after being made are known as death/kill cups. These cups will immediately end the game if made again.\n\nThe game may have several associated health risks. As with any activity involving alcohol, beer pong may cause players to become drunken or even intoxicated enough to suffer alcohol poisoning. Also, the supposed cleaning effects of the water \"dunk\" cup may be offset by bacteria in the cups.\n\nSome writers have mentioned beer pong as contributing to \"out of control\" college drinking.\n\nSome municipalities and states have attempted to ban beer pong, either from bars or in general, due to the belief that it encourages binge drinking (see Health Effects above). In Oxford, Ohio, where Miami University is located, the city council tried to ban the game from being played outdoors. In Arlington, Virginia and Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, bar owners were told to stop allowing the game to be played in their establishments. In the fall of 2007, Georgetown University officially banned all beer pong paraphernalia such as custom-built tables and the possession of many ping-pong balls.\n\n\"Time\" magazine ran an article on July 31, 2008 called \"The War Against Beer Pong\", noting legal restrictions and bans on the game in college and elsewhere.\n\nIn many states, players have taken to placing water in cups in order to hold organized beer pong tournaments legally in bars. Some examples of this can be found in Michigan, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.\n\nBeer pong tournaments are held in the United States at the local, regional, and national levels.\n\nThe World Series of Beer Pong (WSOBP) is the largest beer pong tournament in the world. WSOBP IV, held in January 2009 at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, had a $50,000 grand prize and over 800 participants from the US and Canada. WSOBP V, held in January 2010, had over 1,000 participants including teams from Ireland, Scotland, Germany and Japan. The World Beer Pong Tour has stops in various cities and cash prizes as well.\n\nA more common organization of beer pong games are leagues which operate on a local or regional level. Ordinarily, a group of pong enthusiasts will create teams (partnerships) and play weekly against each other. Sometimes, the leagues have websites, rankings and statistics, while others have been started by college students with the goal of intramural competition such as at University of California, Santa Barbara with the \"Isla Vista Beer Pong League\", and at New York University.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\", \"Time\" and other media outlets have reported on the increase in businesses selling beer pong paraphernalia, such as tables, mats, cups, or clothes. \"Last Cup: Road to the World Series of Beer Pong\" is a documentary which follows some competitive players as they prepare for the WSOBP II and ultimately compete against one another for the $20,000 grand prize. This documentary, directed by Dan Lindsay, premiered at the CineVegas film festival on June 13, 2008. Rick Reilly wrote an entire column about The World Series of Beer Pong IV for \"ESPN The Magazine\".\n\nThe Associated Press cited the game and other drinking games as a factor in deaths of college students.\n\n\"Time\" magazine recently had an article on the popularity of beer pong and posted a video on their website. In both, players claimed beer pong was a sport, rather than a game—similar to billiards and darts.\n\nThe game has been a recurring segment on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\", with host Fallon playing against female celebrity guests such as Betty White, Serena Williams, Anna Kournikova, Charlize Theron and Jessica Alba.\n\n\"The Colbert Report\" featured a segment on the CDC study hoax.\n\n\"\", a sequel to the 2000 comedy \"Road Trip\", featured the game prominently. Agnes Scott College, where most of the movie was filmed, did not want to be listed in the credits after complaints from students.\n\nOn August 29, 2009, Chronicle Books published \"The Book of Beer Pong\", a 200-page fully illustrated guide to the game.\n\nBud pong was the branded version of beer pong that brewer Anheuser-Busch said involved the drinking of water, not Budweiser or any other beer. In the summer of 2005, the company began marketing \"bud pong\" kits to its distributors. Francine I. Katz, vice president for communications and consumer affairs, was reported in \"The New York Times\" as saying that bud pong was not intended for underage drinkers because promotions were held in bars, not on campuses. And it did not promote binge drinking, she said, because official rules call for water to be used, not beer.\n\n\"The New York Times\" quoted a bartender at a club near Clemson University as saying she had worked at several bud pong events and had \"never seen anyone playing with water. It's always beer. It's just like any other beer pong.\"\n\nSome expressed incredulity at Anheuser-Busch's public statements. Henry Wechsler, director of the College Alcohol Study at the Harvard School of Public Health, said: \"Why would alcohol companies promote games that involve drinking water? It's preposterous,\" while advertising news site Adjab opined that \"someone playing bud pong with water is about as likely as a teenage kid using the rolling paper he bought at the convenience store to smoke tobacco.\"\n\nHowever, the practice of playing with water has become increasingly common on college campuses, due to the cost saving effects. Instead of drinking the beer from a glass each time a player sinks a shot, the player simply takes a shot of liquor or a sip from their own drink each time the opposing team scores. This is usually done when there isn't enough beer to accommodate a large number of games during the party.\n\nIn July 2008, JV Games Inc. released a downloadable video game for the Wii console called \"Frat Party Games: Beer Pong\". After much outrage by parent and university groups, the game was renamed \"\" and all references to alcohol were removed.\n"}
{"id": "534617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=534617", "title": "Care Bears", "text": "Care Bears\n\nThe Care Bears are a fictional group of multi-colored bear characters originally painted in 1981 by artist Elena Kucharik to be used on greeting cards from American Greetings, but later used for toys, in TV programs, and in films. There are 218 Care Bears to date. \n\nThe original development was through American Greetings' \"Those Characters From Cleveland\" research and development division, In 1983, Kenner turned the Care Bears into plush teddy bears. The Care Bears appeared in TV specials called \"The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings\" (1983) and \"The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine\" (1984). They then had a television series from 1985 to 1988, and three feature films: \"The Care Bears Movie\" (1985), \"\" (1986) and \"The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland\" (1987).\n\nEach Care Bear comes in a different color and has a specialized insignia on its belly that represents its personality. The movie \"\" named them \"belly badges\". Adding to the Care Bear family are the \"Care Bear Cousins\", which feature a lion, rabbit, penguin, raccoon, monkey, elephant, pig, dog, cat, and other such animals created in the same style as the teddy bears.\n\nIn 2002, the bears were reintroduced with new toys. Made by Play-Along Toys, the new toys offered features such as illuminated bellies upon touch, aerobic bears, and glow-in-the-dark bears. As part of this comeback, the Bears have appeared in two computer-animated movies: \"\" (2004), \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\" (2005) and \"The Care Bears' Rise Up Of Kingdom\" (2006). In 2007, the franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary; another relaunch took place, as well as the release of \"Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!\".\n\nIn mid-2011, American Greetings announced a revival TV animated series titled \"\". The premiere of the series utilizes \"30 years of caring\". It premiered on The Hub on June 2, 2012. Though Welcome to Care-a-Lot lasted one season, a continuation of the series, \"Care Bears and Cousins\", was commissioned by Netflix and premiered November 6, 2015. The cast of characters and animation style of Welcome to Care-a-Lot remains for Care Bears and Cousins. Toy company Just Play debuted a range of Care Bears toys (plush, figures & blind bag collectibles) based on the Welcome to Care-a-Lot characters and style guide in Spring 2015. Just Play continued their range of product for Care Bears and Cousins in 2016.\n\nThe Care Bears were initially created in 1981 by Those Characters From Cleveland (TCFC), the licensing division of American Greetings. Jack Chojnacki, the co-president of TCFC, introduced the first Care Bear, to six businessmen—three from American Greeting Cards, and three from the toy company Kenner—in February 1981. On the employees' reaction to the toy, Chojnacki recalled in early 1985: \"It had a high aaaaaah factor.\"\n\nMuriel Fahrion, the artist who helped create Strawberry Shortcake's look, was also among the franchise's first concept artists. Working with TCFC Creative VP Ralph Shaffer, Muriel designed the first six bears, creating the best-selling greeting card themes for their belly graphics. Susan Trentel, Muriel's sister and doll designer of Strawberry Shortcake, designed the Care Bears plush. Once out of the concept stage children's book illustrator Elena Kucharik became the primary artist for the Care Bears creating hundreds of full color illustrations for cards, books and a myriad of licensed products. TCFC's creative team of artists and writers worked to create numerous characters in the line, which was a joint development by Those Characters From Cleveland and MAD (Marketing and Design Service of the toy group of General Mills).\n\nAs they had done with Strawberry Shortcake, once titled \"Project I\", American Greeting Cards called the Care Bears development \"Project II\" as they strove to make the character program secret until advertising was ready. At the start of the franchise, Care Bears was already established as its working title.\n\nOn September 24, 1982, the Care Bears franchise was launched in New York City before members of the area's Society of Security Analysts. Attending the event were American Greetings president Morry Weiss, and two employees of Those Characters from Cleveland: Jack Chojnacki and senior vice-president Henry Lowenthal. Eventually, the characters were announced as a toyline for production by Parker Brothers and Kenner the following spring, as well as pre-licensed characters and media stars. At that time, American Greetings touted their debut as \"the biggest character launch in the history of retailing\". On a US$5–6 million advertising budget and a wholesale commitment worth US$122.5 million, American Greetings introduced the characters to the general public in February 1983, with an appearance at New York City's Toy Fair; 26 licensees were involved upon launch. Among them was General Mills, a food company which owned the board game manufacturer Parker Brothers. In early 1983, Parker Brothers released six books featuring the Care Bears as part of its publishing division's first offerings. On television, the original ten Bears starred in their first syndicated special, Atkinson Film-Arts' \"The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings\"; Kenner produced and sponsored it.\n\nIn December 1983, American Greetings and CPG Products lost a lawsuit against Easter Unlimited, importers of a line known as \"Message Bears\". According to New York City judge Leonard B. Sand, those toys lacked the \"heart-shaped 'touché tags'\" used to identify the Care Bears.\n\nIn 1984, AGC introduced a spin-off line, the Care Bear Cousins; another syndicated special, \"The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine\", came out that same year. A miniseries based on the toys was distributed by Lexington Broadcast Services Company. A year later, the Bears and Cousins starred in their first film, \"The Care Bears Movie\", produced by Nelvana Limited and released by The Samuel Goldwyn Company. It became the highest-grossing animated film made outside the Disney market at the time of its release. Later that autumn, DIC Entertainment released an 11-episode television series in syndication.\n\nIn 1986, Nelvana returned to the franchise with a second movie, \"\". Released by Columbia Pictures, the film featured a new villain, Dark Heart, and introduced more of the Care Bears and Care Bears Cousins: Harmony Bear, True Heart Bear, and Noble Heart Horse.\n\nLater that year, a TV series titled \"The Care Bears Family\" (also from Nelvana) premiered on the U.S. ABC network and Canada's Global. Lasting two seasons and consisting of over 70 episodes, this introduced the evil wizard No Heart and his sidekick Beastly. In the second season, No Heart's niece Shreeky was introduced.\n\nThe Care Bears' third film, \"The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland\", debuted in 1987. A TV special, \"Care Bears Nutcracker Suite\", premiered on the Disney Channel in 1988.\n\nOver 40 million Care Bears were sold between 1983 and 1987, and American Greetings printed over 70 million of their cards during the decade. In whole, the sales of their merchandise reached over $2 billion during the 1980s.\n\nIn early 1991, Those Characters from Cleveland and Kenner embarked on a relaunch of the franchise, involving seven bears. One of the Care Bear Cousins, Proud Heart Cat, was released as a bear with white fur that sported the belly symbol of a heart-shaped American flag. The publishing company Random House released two tie-in books: \"The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup\" (1991) by Bobbi Katz, and \"The Care Bears and the Whale Tale\" (1992) by Peggy Kahn.\n\nIn 1999, the rights to the Care Bears franchise were bought by Jay Foreman, the president of Fort Lauderdale-based Play Along Toys, for less than $1 million; he also planned to acquire fellow American Greeting Cards property Strawberry Shortcake. Three years later, Kenton Avery Frederick American Greetings relaunched the Care Bear brand as part of the Bears' 20th anniversary celebration with a series of plush toys and movies. The artwork and design of the bears were changed for relaunch. Also, Champ Bear's colours were changed from tan to true blue, with his belly symbol changed to a winner's cup with a star, and Share Bear's belly symbol was changed from a milkshake with two straws to two lollipops crossed. The change to Share Bear's symbol stems from Play Along Toys' suggestion of the change on the grounds that sharing a milkshake may spread germs. Apart from that, many other minor changes were made to the designs, mostly involving lightening the colors of the bears and minor redesigns to the belly symbols.\n\nIn the midst of this revival, Play Along released brand new toys based on the newly redesigned Bears, sold at stores such as Wal-Mart, Kmart, Toys \"R\" Us, Target, KB Toys, and Mervyns. The new merchandise included the Bears doing aerobics; Tenderheart Bear as a patient (casting the child that is playing with the toy as the doctor); Champ Bear as a fireman; and the Care Bears themselves as Cubs. Over 70 million plush Bears have been sold since the re-launch. In addition, Lionsgate Home Entertainment and subsidiary FHE Pictures, in association with Nelvana, have made two direct-to-DVD computer-animated films, \"Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot\" in 2004 and \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\" in 2005. Various other music CDs featuring the bears and video games were also produced.\n\nNew versions of the various cousins were produced (with Proud Heart being changed back into a cat, in a different color and the same symbol she had in the 1980s franchise). Two of the Cousins, Treat Heart Pig and Noble Heart Horse, were never produced as 13 inch plushes in the 2000s, and the Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 relaunch of the franchise.\n\nIn 2007, American Greetings relaunched Care Bears again, first with a series of dolls, then a new movie, \"\" and immediately before with a new TV series \"\". The animation and artwork is completely different from the originals giving the Care Bears have smaller body structures and redesigned belly symbols, which are now called belly badges. Also, instead of Nelvana, the film and the animated series are produced by SD Entertainment.\n\nAs part of the franchise's 25th anniversary celebrations, the Bears were redesigned by the American Greetings Properties illustration team, as was the logo of the franchise. The line consists of fifteen of the thirty-nine bears (as seen in \"\"). Five of the bears were chosen to be the focus of the franchise: Oopsy Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear and Share Bear. The other bears include Wish Bear, True Heart Bear, Bedtime Bear, Tenderheart Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Harmony Bear, Amigo Bear, Surprise Bear, Superstar Bear, Do Your Best Bear, Best Friend Bear, Play-A-Lot Bear, Heartsong Bear, Good Luck Bear and Hopeful Heart Bear, although the remaining 24 bears are also stated to have a release in the near future according to Play Along Toys.\n\nTheir new theme song is performed by former Letters to Cleo member, Kay Hanley, and the music video premiered on Fox and Nickelodeon. In August 2007, they appeared in the film \"Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!\". This was followed by the television series from SD Entertainment, \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\". The series premiered on CBS' \"KEWLopolis\" block on September 15, 2007.\n\nThe Care Bears franchise was rebooted upon the 2007 relaunch. Prior plot devices like the Cloudmobiles, Caring Meter, the Cloud Keeper, and even Care-a-lot castle were not referred to or mentioned as of the new series. In its place is the gathering tree, which is where the Care Bears now gather to meet or hold festivities. Also, the Care Bears have, up until the point of the first direct-to-DVD release for the new franchise (\"Grizzle-ly Adventures\"), never had humans visit Care-a-lot, and a new villain named Grizzle (who seeks to conquer Care-a-lot and nothing else) was introduced. A February 2007 article in the \"Wall Street Journal\" states that in the new version, \"they live in a village, centered on a big tree; with no castle in sight\".\n\nHowever, the Caring Meter made its return in \"Grizzle-y Adventures\", and the second direct-to-DVD release of the franchise, \"Ups and Downs\", included a passing remark regarding the Forest of Feelings. In addition, Care-a-lot castle reappeared in certain scenes in the new game for the V.Smile Baby Infant Development System, \"Play Day\".\n\nOn July 23, 2008, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears (along with \"Strawberry Shortcake\") would be sold to Cookie Jar Entertainment in an acquisition due to take place on September 30, 2008. By April 2009, it was announced that Cookie Jar Entertainment had problems in financing the acquisition and that a French company called MoonScoop has also expressed interest in the franchise. The deadline for Cookie Jar's acquisition was April 30, and MoonScoop's attempt June 7. In mid-August 2009, MoonScoop sued American Greetings, claiming the latter backed out of the planned US$95 million deal; AGC and Cookie Jar sued each other in the process as well. In late April 2010, the Cleveland company \"won summary judgment on MoonScoop SAS' contract\", as well as \"promissory estoppel claims\" in the case; MoonScoop filed for an appeal the following month. At the end of November 2012, the US District Court in Cleveland ruled in favor of American Greetings over MoonScoop.\n\nIn late 2009, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears will be re-imagined with the launch of a new series, \"Care Power Team\". This re-imagining re-used the \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\" designs, has the bears sport \"enhanced belly badges\", and sees the bears taking on emergencies. Soon after, a trio of new films appeared: \"\", \"\" and \"Care Bears: To the Rescue\". In the same year, it was announced that the master rights to the toys for the Care Bears have changed hands from Play Along Toys to Hasbro, in a deal that also involved Strawberry Shortcake. However, it was only in mid-2013 that the first Care Bear toys from Hasbro appeared. There has been no word on what caused the delay.\n\nIn July 2011, the card company announced that a new television series, the franchise's first in CGI, is in development. Entitled \"\", it premiered on The Hub on June 2, 2012.\n\nIn December 2013, AG Properties and Mindworks Entertainment announced they will collaborate with Sanrio for a co-branding with the character franchise \"Little Twin Stars\". An expanded rollout is expected in March 2014.\n\nIn July 2014, it was announced that Hasbro has lost the rights to making the toys to another toy company called \"Just Play\". It is widely thought that the reason for the change is due to American Greetings being unhappy with how long it took Hasbro to release a toyline from the time it acquired the rights to make the toys.\n\nIn October 2014, When The Hub changed over to Discovery Family, it was revealed that Welcome to Care-A-Lot has been cancelled and that there won't be further work on the show.\n\nIn January 15, 2015, it was revealed that Netflix had commissioned a new series called \"Care Bears and Cousins\" after The Hub cancelled \"Welcome to Care-a-Lot\". The show was originally expected to premiere sometime in 2016, but the release was eventually pushed back to November 2015 and it premiered with six episodes. It was followed by another six episodes.\n\nIn September 2018, a new television series, titled \"Care Bears: Unlock the Magic\", was announced. The series is to premiere on the Boomerang premium streaming service. The series order includes 48 11-minute regular episodes, two 22-minute specials and 20 shorts. The series will introduce a new character named Dibble, who will serve as \"the team\"s newest pet and companion\". \n\nThe franchise consists mainly of the Care Bears themselves, as well as the later additions the Care Bear Cousins. Both of them live in the Kingdom of Caring, which is made up of Care-a-lot (the home of the Care Bears proper) and the Forest of Feelings (home to the Care Bear Cousins). In 1989, Carole Ashkinaze of \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" referred to them as \"the whimsical, late 20th-century descendents of what we used to know as guardian angels: furry, friendly, adorable creatures whose mission is to guide small children and protect them from bogeymen. Running against a Care Bear is like, well, running against the Easter Bunny.\"\n\nAccompanying them are the Star and Heart Buddies, who look out for the Bears and Cousins whenever they are on missions in caring; and the Birds, who are usually seen in the Forest of Feelings with the Care Bear Cousins and watch over them. A less recurring character is The Cloud Keeper, the portly gentleman who maintains Care-a-lot. He only appeared in some of the franchise's early publications and on the DiC-produced TV episodes.\n\nThe ten original Care Bears consisted of Bedtime Bear, Birthday Bear, Cheer Bear, Friend Bear, Funshine Bear, Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Tenderheart Bear, and Wish Bear. Later on, additional bears joined them, as well as the Cousins.\n\nFor the new 2007 TV series, \"\", five of the Care Bears were chosen to be the main characters of the show. As seen on the Care Bears website, they are Share Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear, and the new bear introduced in the movie, Oopsy Bear who would frequently make a mess of things. However, the other Care Bears still make appearances in the series. The unofficial role of leader of the bears, as of the new series, was transferred from Tenderheart Bear to Cheer Bear. The cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 series.\n\nSome elements of the Care Bears franchise pay homage to the legend of King Arthur. For example, the name of the main characters' residence, Care-a-lot, is a play on King Arthur's legendary Camelot castle. The Care Bear Family sits around a heart-shaped table, similar to the Round Table used by Arthur and his knights. In addition, Sir Lancelot's name inspired that of Love-a-lot Bear.\n\nThroughout the movies and series, various villains have tried to stop the Bears and Cousins in the background on their missions. On the first two specials and DiC television series, they battled against Professor Coldheart, his assistant Frostbite, and occasionally Auntie Freeze; in Nelvana's version, they faced Wizard No Heart, his bumbling assistant Beastly and his ill-tempered niece Shreeky, and minor villains such as Dr. Fright and Sour Sam. In the movies, they went up against Nicholas and the Evil Spirit in \"The Care Bears Movie\", Dark Heart in \"\", The Wizard of Wonderland and his assistants Dim & Dumb in \"The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland\", and the Rat King and Evil Vizier in \"Care Bears Nutcracker Suite\". Following the 2002 revival, Sir Funnybone the rat was introduced as a villain in the movie \"Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot\", while \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\" broke from tradition in that it did not have a villain. For the 2007 revival, the new film \"Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!\" introduced new villains, Grizzle and WingNut, who persists into the new TV series, \"\".\n\nThe Care Bears' ultimate weapon is the \"Care Bear Stare\" (a.k.a. \"Belly Magic\"), in which the collected Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective belly symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer which could bring care and joy into the target's heart. The Care Bear Stare has several different looks. One has a beam coming from the belly being made up of several replicated images of the symbol. Another variation forms a rainbow when multiple Bears and/or Cousins are involved. A yellow beam with red hearts is sometimes seen as well. The movies \"Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot\" and \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\" do not feature the Care Bear stare, but it does return in \"Oopsy Does It!\". In the new series, \"Care Bears Adventures in Care-a-lot\", the stare appears as a beam of light in the color of the bear from which it originates, but is initiated by simply rubbing the symbol.\n\nIn the original animated specials and the DiC series, the Care Bear Stare is initiated by the phrase \"Care Bears...prepare to stare!\" while in the Nelvana series and later versions it is initiated by the phrase \"Care Bears Countdown!\"\n\nDuring the movies and the DiC series, the Care Bear Cousins call their weapon the \"Care Bear Cousin Call\". In the DiC series, the call looks identical to the Care Bear Stare and is often performed at the same time without it being referred to as the call. In the first movie, the Cousins, excluding Swift Heart Rabbit, simply made whatever animal noise is common to their species since they did not have any belly symbols; those are later given to them by the Care Bears at the end of the movie. In the second movie, the Call looks like a musical score which radiates from their belly symbols. By the start of the Nelvana series, the Care Bear Cousin Call was no longer used and the Cousins simply performed the Care Bear Stare.\n\nAlthough commonly used on villains, the stare and call have been also been used on humans and the Care Bears themselves. It was occasionally used in the DiC series to cure Care Bears and humans who were placed under the effects of Professor Coldheart's uncaring magic. It also occurred once in \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\", when it was used to temporarily cheer Grumpy up in the episode \"Tell-Tale belly\".\n\nIn addition to the Care Bear Stare, the Care Bears can also use their belly symbols to summon other assistance such as heart-shaped balloons, cloud cars, rainbow bridges and sending out a distress signal.\n\nShown prominently in most of the Care Bears movies and TV episodes made in the 80s, the Caring Meter is typically in the dead center of Care-a-lot inside the Care Bears' main meeting hall. This meter shows how much caring there is both in Care-a-lot and on Earth. In the 1980s movies/cartoons, it is shown as an un-numbered clock-like meter. In \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\", the meter is shown with a raincloud (less caring) side and a rainbow (more caring) side. Ideally, the Caring Meter should be all the way towards the rainbow side. Whenever the Bears see the meter drop towards the raincloud side, they try to prevent it from getting worse by going on \"caring missions\" to try to get more people to care or for the Bears themselves to do caring deeds. If the meter drops near zero, Care-a-lot will suffer disasters, such as thunderstorms, buildings and rainbows crumbling (earlier movies) or the bright colors of Care-a-lot gradually turning into black and white (later movies). If the meter were to reach all the way to zero (there is no caring \"anywhere\"), then Care-a-lot would be gone forever.\n\nInitially, no mention was made of the Caring Meter in \"Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!\" and the first season of \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\". With the release of \"Grizzle-y Adventures\", the franchise's first direct-to-DVD release, the Caring Meter has returned, and the Care Bears have begun to interact with humans once again.\n\nApart from toys, books, greeting cards and animated media, the Care Bears have been prominently featured in merchandising as well, some of which includes gummy bears, party goods, cell phone covers, interior decoration sets, stationery, school supplies, stickers, clothing, accessories and many other goods. During the early 2000s relaunch, the classic Care Bear toys were available at stores such as Carlton Cards, Claire's, and Spencer Gifts.\n\nWhen the franchise was introduced in the 1980s, a mistake was made while manufacturing the stuffed animals causing Bedtime Bear (blue) and Wish Bear (aqua) to swap colors. As soon as the mistake was discovered, the two bears returned into their appropriate colors. Later, a children's story was written explaining why the bears had switched colors.\n\nIn his 1986 essay, \"The Shortcake Strategy\", Tom Englehardt referred to the Care Bears dolls as \"highly specialized\" toys. \"So specialized [are they] that instead of being complex individual personalities, they are no more than carefully labeled fragments of a personality\", he stated. \"Together, they must engage in a series of specialized interventions as complex as those of any real-life medical unit.\"\n\nMany children's books have been based on, and have featured, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. Some early publications include \"Meet the Care Bear Cousins\" (based on the first movie), \"Sweet Dreams for Sally\", \"The Witch Down the Street\", \"The Trouble with Timothy\", and \"A Sister for Sam\". All of these titles were published by toy makers Parker Brothers, who was a licensee of the characters. Over 45 million Care Bears books were sold during the 1980s. As of 2006, Scholastic Press has published books based on the Bears' first two CGI films, as well as the new toys, while Modern Publishing publishes a small number of activity and baby books featuring the bears for the toddler market. Publications International and Penny Candy Press are also known to have published a few sound books featuring the bears in the past.\n\nIn \"Playing by Different Rules\", a 1988 book chronicling the Parker Brothers/General Mills merger, Ellen Wojahn wrote that Parker's Care Bears books (along with those based on sister property Strawberry Shortcake) \"were, in fact, little more than illustrated brochures for Kenner's projects—and who knew [by 1984] how long the likes of these characters would remain popular?\"\n\nBetween November 1985 and January 1989, the Care Bears appeared in a 20-issue comic book series published by Marvel's Star Comics; the books were drawn by DC Comics artist Howard Post. The November 13, 1986 issue featured a crossover with another American Greetings property, the Madballs.\n\nDuring the same period, over in Britain the Care Bears also appeared in a comic book series published by Marvel UK with artwork by Mario Capaldi. The periodic comics were later bundled into hardcover Care Bear Annual books. Some of these UK comic book issues also had stories and art from the US comic series.\n\nAt the height of the '80s Care Bears craze, Kid Stuff Records released several LPs based on the franchise. These included \"Introducing the Care Bears\", \"The Care Bears Care For You\", \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\", \"The Care Bears' Birthday Party\", and \"The Care Bears' Christmas\" (all from 1983), and 1986's \"Friends Make Everything Better\" (released as a promotion with Trianimic). They released the soundtrack albums for the first two movies. The albums based on the toys were best sellers in children's music during their prime.\n\nAll of the albums from 1983 (except for \"Birthday Party\") featured writing, production, and performance credits from Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan (who were the lead singers of The Turtles, also known as Flo & Eddie; former Mothers of Invention from Frank Zappa's 1970–1972 period). The soundtrack album from The Care Bears Movie featured songs by Carole King and John Sebastian, who sang lead for The Lovin' Spoonful.\n\nIn the midst of the 2002 revival, Madacy Kids released brand new Care Bear CDs. In 2004, \"Meet the Care Bears\", \"Care Bears Holiday Hugs\", \"Care Bears Christmas Eve\", and the \"Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot\" soundtrack album came out, as well as \"Care Bears Nighty-Night\" the following year.\n\nThe cover of both \"Care Bears Holiday Hugs\" and \"Care Bears Nighty-Night\" advertises another two CDs, called \"Care Bears Share A Smile\" and \"Care Bears Let's Be Friends\". As of April 2008, Both Share A Smile and Let's Be Friends have been folded into a single album and released as a digital download from www.Amazon.com and www.Walmart.com, however it is at this date not available as a physical CD. This has caused some difficulties to international fans as Amazon.com and Walmart.com will not sell digital downloads to fans who reside outside North America.\n\nApproximately 50 seconds into the music video for the breakout single \"I Need Some Fine Wine and You, You Need to Be Nicer\" from Swedish rock band The Cardigans' sixth studio album \"Super Extra Gravity\", there is a brief appearance of Bedtime Bear. He is shown again for the last time at the 76th second, lying on a bed in close proximity to the featured dog.\n\nA Care Bears game was planned for the Atari 2600 in 1983. It was preliminarily completed and ready for beta testing, but the project was canceled before testing could begin. The beta prototype subsequently disappeared into obscurity and the only known existing prototype to date is an early alpha of the game. No other games featuring the bears were ever made during the period.\n\nIn 2004, the Bears starred in their first official game, \"Care-a-lot Jamboree\" for the PC. A few months later, another game featuring the Care Bears for the PC, \"Let's Have a Ball!\" was released. In the same year they were featured in \"Care Bears: A Lesson in Caring\" for the V.Smile educational game console.\n\nIn 2005, they appeared in \"Catch a Star\" (also for the PC) and \"Care Bears: Care Quest\" (for the Game Boy Advance).\n\nLike the movies, no game for any systems was produced in 2006, and no new game was released in time for the 2007 relaunch. However, in August 2008, a new game, \"Care Bears Play Day\", was released for the V.Smile Baby Infant Development System, finally breaking the two years of silence for the franchise on the gaming front.\n\nthem, \"Care Bears Share-A-Story\", was introduced by Play Along in July 2005. The toy is based upon the same basic idea of a Teddy Ruxpin. The head, mouth and eyes of the Care Bear move around as a cartridge plays fairy tales such as Goldilocks and the Three Care Bears, Jack and the Beanstalk and the Three Little Pigs. A hardback book version of the story comes with it so the parent and child can read along as the story plays. The toy ships with the story \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\", and additional story cartridges and books are to be purchased separately. Also, apparently only Share Bear was ever made as such a toy.\n\nAdditionally, Care Bears Sing-along pals were also introduced. These Care Bears plush toys sing three different songs while their heads rock back and forth and could synchronize wirelessly with other singing Care Bears of the series to sing together in a group (the effective wireless coverage being three feet, although the range might deteriorate due to environmental conditions and remaining battery strength). While initially introduced in a rather large variety of designs, at the moment only the Share Bear, Cheer Bear and Funshine Bear models are still being made, with the physical appearance of the bears redesigned to match the 25th anniversary looks.\n\nAnother Care Bear smart toy is the Care Bears Tenderheart Smart Check-up. The toy comes with an interactive plush Tenderheart bear and various toy medical equipment. The interactive plush has soft-touch points throughout the body and can be fully played with without the toy medical equipment.\n\nLastly, there are a line of Care Bears smart toys that would play hide and seek with the owner. The line, called \"Hide 'N Seek Care Bears\", comes in two designs: Secret Bear and Surprise Bear. Both bear comes with a wireless handpiece. To play the toy, a third party, usually the parent, must partake in the game by hiding the bear. The child then has to find the bear, with the handpiece occasionally providing hints on how close the child is to the bear through audible instructions.\n\nThe Care Bears appeared in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1985. With the redesign of the characters on the heels of their 25th anniversary, the Care Bears returned to the parade for the holiday in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Also in those latter two years, they appeared at the Macy's Flower Show in the flagship New York store.\n\nIn 1984 and 1985, the Care Bears appeared at the San Diego Zoo in California, performing in a stage show at the amphitheater.\n\nTenderheart Bear, Funshine Bear and Cheer Bear appeared in a live-action 1985 TV special produced by ABC station WLS-TV in Chicago called \"Be A Safe Kid\", teaching kids how to be safe from strangers.\n\nIn the Summer and Fall of 1986 and 1987, the ABC television network toured shopping malls across the country with their stage show \"The ABC Family Fun Fair\" promoting their Saturday morning cartoon lineup for those years. With \"The Care Bears Family\" series as part of that block, some of the cast were part of the show...Funshine Bear, Cheer Bear and Braveheart Lion in the 1986 edition and Cheer Bear with Tenderheart Bear in the 1987 tour.\n\nDuring the Summers from 1988 through 1992, the Care Bears were the official characters in residence at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom near Allentown PA. On the park's Center Stage, they performed in \"The Care Bear Song & Dance Revue\" and also did many walkabout meets & greets with guests around the amusement park. Dorney Park also had the animatronic \"Care-A-Lot Castle\" show created by Sally Industries.\n\nTenderheart Bear appeared at the Teddy Bear Rally in Amherst, MA from 1996 to 2005.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, the Care Bears have appeared in the DooDah Parade in Ocean City, NJ.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, the Care Bears starred in their own stage show, called \"Care Bears Live\", organized by VEE Corporation.\n\nThe Care Bears appeared in the 2007 St. Patrick's Day Parade in Chicago, where, as grand marshal, Good Luck Bear ceremoneously dyed the Chicago River green from a motorboat.\n\nThe Care Bears have been appearing in the annual Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver, BC, Canada since 2008.\n\nDuring the Christmas holiday season, the Care Bears have done shows and appearances in Singapore at the Downtown East shopping mall and entertainment district from 2008 through 2010.\n\nDuring the 2010s, Tenderheart Bear has appeared in the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade in New York City.\n\nFunshine Bear and Share Bear appear in America's Children's Holiday Parade taking place in Oakland, CA early during the Christmas season.\n\nFunshine and Share have also been appearing in the Indy 500 Festival Parade in Indianapolis, IN over Memorial Day weekend.\n\nAs part of the Care Bears' 30th Anniversary, Share Bear appeared at the Noodlecat restaurant in San Diego, CA as part of The Hub's presence at Comicon 2012.\n\nAlso in connection with their 30th anniversary, Cheer Bear appeared at The Toonseum in Pittsburgh, PA during a 2012 exhibit about the Care Bears' animated television series, and also at the Pittsburgh Comic Arts Festival sponsored by them.\n\nOn the weekend in the middle of June 2013, Funshine Bear, Cheer Bear, Share Bear and Grumpy Bear appeared onstage for \"A Care Bears Dance Party\" at Sesame Place in Langhorne, PA.\n\nIn July 2013, Funshine Bear and Love-A-Lot Bear appeared at Anthrocon, a convention for the furry fandom in Pittsburgh, PA, which took place in the David L. Lawrence Convention Center.\n\nIn April 2015, Cheer Bear appeared in the Cherry Blossom Parade in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "76749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76749", "title": "Character (arts)", "text": "Character (arts)\n\nA character (sometimes known as a fictional character) is a person or other being in a narrative (such as a novel, play, television series, film, or video game). The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a \"fictional\" versus \"real\" character may be made. Derived from the ancient Greek word χαρακτήρ, the English word dates from the Restoration, although it became widely used after its appearance in \"Tom Jones\" in 1749. From this, the sense of \"a part played by an actor\" developed. Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema, involves \"the illusion of being a human person\". In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes. Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase \"in character\" has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor. Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called characterisation.\n\nA character who stands as a representative of a particular class or group of people is known as a type. Types include both stock characters and those that are more fully individualised. The characters in Henrik Ibsen's \"Hedda Gabler\" (1891) and August Strindberg's \"Miss Julie\" (1888), for example, are representative of specific positions in the social relations of class and gender, such that the conflicts between the characters reveal ideological conflicts.\n\nThe study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work. The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions (proairetic, pragmatic, linguistic, proxemic) that it forms with the other characters. The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often miming shifts in society and its ideas about human individuality, self-determination, and the social order.\n\nIn fiction writing, authors create dynamic characters by many methods. Sometimes characters are conjured up from imagination; in other instances, they are created by amplifying the character trait of a real person into a new fictional creation, or are created from scratch as a matter of expediency.\n\nIn his book \"Aspects of the Novel\", E. M. Forster defined two basic types of characters, their qualities, functions, and importance for the development of the novel: flat characters and round characters. Flat characters are two-dimensional, in that they are relatively uncomplicated. By contrast, round characters are complex figures with many different characteristics, that undergo development, sometimes sufficiently to surprise the reader.\n\nMary Sues are characters mainly appearing in fan fiction. They are virtually devoid of flaws, and are therefore considered flat characters.\n\nDynamic characters are those that change over the course of the story, while static characters remain the same throughout. An example of a popular static character in literature is Sherlock Holmes; an example of a dynamic character in literature is Ebenezer Scrooge.\n\nIn television, a regular, main or ongoing character is a character who appears in all or a majority of episodes, or in a significant chain of episodes of the series. Regular characters may be both core and secondary ones. \n\nA recurring character often and frequently appears from time to time during the series' run. Recurring characters often play major roles in more than one episode, sometimes being the main focus.\n\nA guest character is one which acts only in a few episodes or scenes. Unlike regular characters, the guest ones do not need to be carefully incorporated into the storyline with all its ramifications: they create a piece of drama and then disappear without consequences to the narrative structure, unlike core characters, for which any significant conflict must be traced during a considerable time, which is often seen as an unjustified waste of resources. There may also be a continuing or recurring guest character. Sometimes a guest character may gain popularity and turn into a regular one.\n\nIn the earliest surviving work of dramatic theory, \"Poetics\" (c. 335 BCE), the Classical Greek philosopher Aristotle deduces that character (\"ethos\") is one of six qualitative parts of Athenian tragedy and one of the three objects that it represents (1450a12). He understands character not to denote a fictional person, but the quality of the person acting in the story and reacting to its situations (1450a5). He defines character as \"that which reveals decision, of whatever sort\" (1450b8). It is possible, therefore, to have stories that do not contain \"characters\" in Aristotle's sense of the word, since character necessarily involves making the ethical dispositions of those performing the action clear. If, in speeches, the speaker \"decides or avoids nothing at all\", then those speeches \"do not have character\" (1450b9—11). Aristotle argues for the primacy of plot (\"mythos\") over character (\"ethos\"). He writes:\nBut the most important of these is the structure of the incidents. For (i) tragedy is a representation not of human beings but of action and life. Happiness and unhappiness lie in action, and the end [of life] is a sort of action, not a quality; people are of a certain sort according to their characters, but happy or the opposite according to their actions. So [the actors] do not act in order to represent the characters, but they include the characters for the sake of their actions\" (1450a15-23).\nAristotle suggests that works were distinguished in the first instance according to the nature of the person who created them: \"the grander people represented fine actions, i.e. those of fine persons\" by producing \"hymns and praise-poems\", while \"ordinary people represented those of inferior ones\" by \"composing invectives\" (1448b20—1449a5). On this basis, a distinction between the individuals represented in tragedy and in comedy arose: tragedy, along with epic poetry, is \"a representation of serious people\" (1449b9—10), while comedy is \"a representation of people who are rather inferior\" (1449a32—33).\n\nIn the \"Tractatus coislinianus\" (which may or may not be by Aristotle), Ancient Greek comedy is defined as involving three types of characters: the buffoon (\"bômolochus\"), the ironist (\"eirôn\"), and the imposter or boaster (\"alazôn\"). All three are central to Aristophanes' \"old comedy\".\n\nBy the time the Roman comic playwright Plautus wrote his plays two centuries later, the use of characters to define dramatic genres was well established. His \"Amphitryon\" begins with a prologue in which Mercury claims that since the play contains kings and gods, it cannot be a comedy and must be a tragicomedy.\n\n"}

As a discipline, choreomusicology emerged at the end of the twentieth century as a field of study concerned with the relationship between music and dance. More precisely, choreomusicology grew out of Euro-American performance traditions that considered musical composition and dance choreography as separate specialties. Not all performance genres separate music and dance into separate theoretical categories. The directionality of the relationship between sound and movement is not always fixed. Choreomusicologists hold that studying the variable relationships between sound and movement in diverse performance arts can provide insight into perceptual sensibilities, cultural processes, and interpersonal dynamics. Famous artists whose works exhibit rich choreomusical relationships include: John Cage and Merce Cunningham, Igor Stravinsky and George Balanchine, and Louis Horst and Martha Graham. Interesting choreomusical relationships also exist in West Sumatran Tari Piring, West Javanese Pencak Silat, and Afro-Brazilian Capoeira to name but a few examples.\n\nThe following institutions have developed programs practicing and/or researching choreomusicology: accompagnement choregraphique CNSMDP (Paris), continuing studies at Institut del Teatre (Barcelona), MAD at DNSPA (Copenhagen).

{"id": "25151891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25151891", "title": "Comics studies", "text": "Comics studies\n\nComics studies (also comic(s) art studies, sequential art studies or graphic narrative studies) is an academic field that focuses on comics and sequential art. Although comics and graphic novels have been generally dismissed as less relevant pop culture texts, scholars in fields such as semiotics, composition studies and cultural studies are now re-considering comics and graphic novels as complex texts deserving of serious scholarly study.\n\nNot to be confused with the technical aspects of comics creation, comics studies exists only with the creation of comics theory—which approaches comics critically as an art—and the writing of comics historiography (the study of the history of comics). Comics theory has significant overlap with the philosophy of comics, i.e., the study of the ontology, epistemology and aesthetics of comics, the relationship between comics and other art forms, and the relationship between text and image in comics.\n\nComics studies is also interrelated with comics criticism, the analysis and evaluation of comics and the comics medium.\n\nAlthough there has been the occasional investigation of comics as a valid art form, specifically in Gilbert Seldes' \"The 7 Lively Arts\" (1924), Martin Sheridan's \"Classic Comics and Their Creators\" (1942), and David Kunzle's \"The Early Comic Strip: Narrative Strips and Picture Stories in the European Broadsheet from c. 1450 to 1825\" (1973), contemporary Anglophone comics studies in North America can be said to have burst onto the academic scene with both Will Eisner's \"Comics and Sequential Art\" in 1985 and Scott McCloud's \"Understanding Comics\" in 1993. Continental comics studies can trace its roots back to the work of semioticians such as Roland Barthes (particularly his 1964 essay \"Rhetoric of the Image\", published in English in the anthology \"Image—Music—Text\") and Umberto Eco (particularly his 1964 book \"Apocalittici e integrati\").\n\nMore recently, analysis of comics have begun to be undertaken by cognitive scientists, the most prominent being Neil Cohn, who has used tools from linguistics to detail the theoretical structure of comics' underlying \"visual language\", and has also used psychological experimentation from cognitive neuroscience to test these theories in actual comprehension. This work has suggested similarities between the way that the brain processes language and the way it processes sequential images. Cohn's theories are not universally accepted with other scholars like Thierry Groensteen, Hannah Miodrag, and Barbara Postema offering alternative understandings.\n\nSimilar to the problems of defining literature and film, no consensus has been reached on a definition of the comics medium, and attempted definitions and descriptions have fallen prey to numerous exceptions. Theorists such as Töpffer, R. C. Harvey, Will Eisner, David Carrier, Alain Rey, and Lawrence Grove emphasize the combination of text and images, though there are prominent examples of pantomime comics throughout its history. Other critics, such as Thierry Groensteen and Scott McCloud, have emphasized the primacy of sequences of images. Towards the close of the 20th century, different cultures' discoveries of each other's comics traditions, the rediscovery of forgotten early comics forms, and the rise of new forms made defining comics a more complicated task.\n\nIn the field of composition studies, an interest in comics and graphic novels is growing, partially due to the work of comics theorists but also due to composition studies' growing focus on multimodality and visual rhetoric. Composition studies theorists are looking at comics as sophisticated texts, and sites of complex literacy.\n\nGunther Kress defines multimodality as \"the use of several semiotic modes in the design of a semiotic product or event, together with the particular way in which these mode are combined\" or, more simply as \"any text whose meanings are realized through more than one semiotic code\".\n\nKristie S. Fleckenstein sees the relationship between image and text as \"mutually constitutive, mutually infused\"—a relationship she names \"imageword\". Fleckenstein sees \"imageword\" as offering \"a double vision of writing-reading based on [the] fusion of image and word, a double vision of literacy\".\n\nDale Jacobs sees the reading of comics as a form of \"multimodal literacy or multiliteracy, rather than as a debased form of print literacy\". According to Jacobs, comics can help educators to move \"toward attending to multimodal literacies\" that \"shift our focus from print only to multiple modalities\". He encourages educators to embrace a pedagogy that will give students skills to effectively negotiate these multiple modalities.\n\nComics historiography (the study of the history of comics) studies the historical process through which comics became an autonomous art medium and an integral part of culture. An area of study is premodern sequential art; some scholars such as Scott McCloud consider Egyptian hieroglyphics and paintings and pre-Columbian American picture manuscripts to be the very first form of comics and sequential art. Another area of study is the 20th-century emergence of the subculture of comics readers and comicphilia (the passionate interest in comic books).\n\nComics studies is becoming increasingly more common at academic institutions across the world. Some notable examples include: University of Florida, University of Toronto at Mississauga, and University of California Santa Cruz, among others. West Liberty University is currently the only university offering a four-year undergraduate literature degree in comics studies. In Britain, growing interest in comics has led to the establishment of a center for comics studies, the Scottish Centre for Comics Studies (SCCS) at the University of Dundee in Scotland. Beside formal programs and degrees, it is common to see individual courses dedicated to comics and graphic novels in many educational institutions.\n\nSol M. Davidson's New York University thesis, \"Culture and the Comic Strips\", earned him the first PhD in comics in 1959, while in France, Jean-Christophe Menu was awarded a Doctorate in Art and Art Sciences in 2011 from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne after defending his thesis \"The Comics and its Double: Language and Frontiers of Comics: Practical, Theoretical and Editorial Prospects\".\n\nTeesside University began offering a BA in Comics and Graphic Novels in 2014, as well as an MA in Comics from 2018. They have since appointed a team of renowned comics practitioners including Fionnuala Doran, Julian Lawrence, Con Chrisoulis, Nigel Kitching and Tara McInerney.\n\nThe University of Lancaster started offering a PhD degree in comics studies in 2015. The same year French comics studies scholar Benoît Peeters (a student of Roland Barthes) was appointed as the UK's first ever comics professor at Lancaster University.\n\nSince 2000 many new scholarly journals have appeared dedicated to comics studies. Three of the most important peer refereed journals in English are: \"Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics\", \"Studies in Comics\", and \"European Comic Art\". Other notable journals include: \"ImageTexT\" (a peer reviewed, open access journal that began in the spring of 2004 and is based at the University of Florida), \"Image and Narrative\" (stylized as \"Image [&] Narrative\", a peer-reviewed e-journal on visual narratology), \"SANE: Sequential Art Narrative in Education\" (based at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln), \"Inks: The Journal of the Comics Studies Society\" (published by the Ohio State University Press), \"The Comics Grid: Journal of Comics Scholarship\", and the \"International Journal of Comic Art\".\n\nAlthough presentations dedicated to comics are commonplace at conferences in many fields, entire conferences dedicated to this subject are becoming more common. There have been conferences at SAIC (International Comic Arts Forum), MMU (The International Bande Dessinée Society Conference), UTS (Sequential Art Studies Conference), Georgetown, Ohio State (Festival of Cartoon Art), and Bowling Green (Comics in Popular Culture conference), and there is a yearly conference at University of Florida (Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels). Additionally, there is an annual Michigan State University Comics Forum, which brings together academics and professionals working in the industry. Notable regularly held movable conferences include the Comic Art and Comics Area of the Popular Culture Association of America and the conference of the International Society for Humor Studies.\n\nThe International Comics Arts Forum (ICAF), begun in 1995 at Georgetown University by Guy Spielmann and Tristan Fonlladosa, is an annual academic conference distinguished by its international focus and scholarly rigor The German \"Gesellschaft für Comicforschung\" (ComFor, Society for Comics Studies) has organized yearly academic conferences since 2006. The Comics Arts Conference has met regularly since 1992 in conjunction with San Diego Comic-Con International and WonderCon. Another important conference is the annual International Graphic Novels and Comics Conference held since 2010 organized by British academics. This conference has been held in conjunction with the longer running International Bande Dessinée Society conference. \"Comics Forum\", a UK-based community of international comics scholars, also holds an annual conference at Leeds Central Library; the first was held in 2009.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16078207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16078207", "title": "Documentary practice", "text": "Documentary practice\n\nDocumentary practice is the process of creating documentary projects. It refers to what people do with media devices, content, form, and production strategies in order to address the creative, ethical, and conceptual problems and choices that arise as they make documentary films or other similar presentations based on fact or reality. Colleges and universities offer courses and programs in documentary practice (see External Links).\n\nTraditional definitions put forth by scholars of documentary film address documentary practice in terms of formal codes, categories and conventions. These are used by filmmakers to create \"non-fictional\" representations of the historical world. Subsequent definitions made by others define various approaches to documentary in terms of how they use such rhetorical strategies as voice, structure and style. Such definitions focus on finished documentary projects and how they measure up to contemporary notions of truth and representation.\n\nHowever, recent cultural, technological, stylistic, and social shifts have turned attention in documentary studies to the process of documenting as such. Documentary-makers and scholars alike are showing interest in the present moment and how new media tools can be used by documentary-makers to initiate formation of new communities, conversations, and ways of being together.\n\nSuch interests characterized Conceptual Art works of the 1960s and 1970s. The connective potentialities of art as a practice are currently being explored in the contemporary Relational Aesthetics movement. In these movements, the potentialities and dilemmas of aesthetic practice take precedence over traditional concerns with the finished artwork. Likewise, growing interest in documentary as a practice is opening the definition of documentary beyond considerations of finished documents, to include the act of documenting itself. This expansion of the definition of documentary work became possible when consumer-level video cameras became widely available. Some collectives of video producers used this new technology to address issues such as politics of cultural representation, the critique of daily life, the deconstruction of culture control mechanisms, and the subversion of authority.\n\nWhile practices of documentary-makers continue to be informed by existing documentary traditions, Conventions in documentary, and genres, they are also reshaped by emerging media environments, content, devices and uses for those devices. Emerging media, in turn, are greatly affected by their political, economic, and cultural contexts. Various emerging technologies and the situations in which they are used present documentary-makers with new challenges, opportunities, and dilemmas. This makes documentary practice dynamic and ever-evolving.\n\nMany documentary-makers seek innovative approaches to their field in response to emerging technologies and the practices they make possible. Continuous innovation in documentary practice prevents the \"documentary idea\" from becoming stagnant or locked into any single generic form. This challenges each generation of documentary-makers and viewers to approach documentary-making as a living practice.\n\nNew documentary practices associated with cinéma vérité and Direct Cinema began to appear in the mid-1950s when technological developments made film and then video more portable, accessible and affordable. This allowed more people to engage in the practice of documenting. The 1991 video of Rodney King being subjected to police restraint is an example of the continuing power of this shift. An ordinary citizen was able to capture the police brutality with his camcorder, transforming him from a witness to an amateur documentary filmmaker. Scholars have cited the events following the widespread dissemination of the Rodney King video as one of the earliest examples of \"participatory culture.\"\n\nToday's new media continue to reshape documentary practices in significant ways. Recording technologies embedded within personal portable devices such as video-equipped mobile phones and hand-held digital video and still cameras have made it possible for vast numbers of people to engage in citizen journalism and \"documentary practices.\" Additionally, Web 2.0 platforms such as video and photo-sharing websites and blogs now enable amateur \"documentarians\" to share and collaborate on content in ways never before possible. A practice that Howard Rheingold and Justin Hall have labeled \"p2p Journalism,\" now exists at the blurred boundary where traditional definitions of journalism and documentary meet and influence each other.\n\nPromises of new media technologies have raised expectations of a freer flow of ideas and content. Scholars are studying how participants in documenting practices engage in the social process of acquiring knowledge, sharing stories, and documenting events-in-the-making. Through such practices, social ties among people and groups as they arbitrate what qualifies as knowledge evolve continuously, facilitating the emergence of what Pierre Lévy refers to as \"collective intelligence\".\n\nBy enabling more people to record and share their experiences, emerging media technologies have transformed the way people document reality and how they participate in the very events that they are documenting. Everyday life can become performative as people respond to encounters and events through documentary practices, creating records of daily life which they then share with others via the Internet. For many people, digital media-making becomes a form of documentary practice when the results are created for and shared via social-networking sites like MySpace, Flickr and Facebook.\n\nThe 2006 documentary of a Beastie Boys concert, \"Awesome; I F***n' Shot That!\", directed by Adam Yauch, is an example of how participation in documentary practices transforms the way people take part in events such as concerts. A live performance in 2004 was documented by 50 fans who were all given Hi8 cameras and told to film their experience of the concert. Their footage was later edited together with professionally shot footage. It provided contrasting points of view and established dialogue between artists and fans.\n\nSome scholars argue that as an increasingly widespread practice, the nascent cellphone documentary genre creates more possibilities and forms of social agency; people use cell phones to document public events and network their collective responses; others have used their phones to mobilize crowds during public demonstrations.\n\nThe pursuit of \"filmic truth\" has been a hallmark of documentary practice since early film-makers such as the Lumiere Brothers, Robert Flaherty and Dziga Vertov created its foundations. (see External Links)\n\nToday, people use mobile devices in ways that open new possibilities for the practices of documenting—especially those practices involved in efforts to achieve \"filmic truth.\" For example, in June 2006 a 93-minute remake of Pier Paolo Pasolini's documentary entitled \"Love Meetings\" (1965), in which he interviewed Italian citizens about their views on sex in postwar Italy, was shot entirely on a cell phone by and Barbara Seghezzi. Entitled \"New Love Meetings\", the remake was filmed in MPEG4 format using a Nokia N90. It is the first feature-length movie to be shot entirely on a mobile phone. Their premise was that even though they asked their subjects the same questions that Pasolini had posed, the results of their documentary would be clearly influenced by the medium they used to capture the images. They believed that the use of a cellphone, an instrument of daily life, produced an intimacy absent in Pasolini's movie, making people more spontaneous and open, creating a dialogue more like a chat than an interview. They propose that the line between subject and observer becomes thinner through such practices, as the documentary film-makers present themselves as \"normal people\" using their cell phones to preserve an instant. \"New Love Meetings\" is a prime example of how a specific emerging technology, the mobile phone, is shifting documentary practice today. (see External Links)\n\nThe use of the so-called \"fourth screen\" (the first screen being cinema, the second television, the third the computer, the fourth the mobile device) as a documentary tool has become a subject of academic study. In fall of 2007, graduate students of The New School produced an experimental five-minute metadocumentary shot with three cell phones. It explored the possibilities of mobile media devices as a medium for documentary practice by using them to restate Dziga Vertov's perspectives on filmic truth as expressed in his film: \"Man with a Movie Camera\".\n\n'== Surveillance media\nSurveillance is the act of observation or monitoring, usually of places, people, and activity, and typically without the subject's knowledge. Much of contemporary surveillance involves observation from a distance with the help of electronic devices, such as telephone tapping, directional microphones, covert listening devices or \"bugs\", subminiature cameras, closed-circuit television, GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking, electronic tagging, motion tracking, satellites, internet and computer surveillance.\n\nHistorically, surveillance has often been associated with governmental and other large organizational security practices. However, artists and activists have challenged those conventional practices. An early example is the film \"Empire\", made by artist Andy Warhol in 1964. It consisted of an extreme long shot of the Empire State Building, held for eight hours in real time, challenging the boundaries of surveillance and watchability. More recently, scholars such as UCLA cinema professor Steve Mamber, have turned attention to the growing trend of using inexpensive, small cameras to unobtrusively record events of daily life. To examine hidden-camera video practices, in 2003 Mamber asked acquaintances if they or anyone they knew might have access to such footage, creating an online archive of the footage. Mamber described the growing practice as \"both a widely pervasive activity and an oddly unexamined one.\" In response, he established the UCLA Center for Hidden Camera Research, another example of how emerging technologies are shifting documentary practice. (see External Links)\n\nAnother practice that has emerged from the introduction of new surveillance technologies is \"inverse surveillance\", also known as Sousveillance. Launched in 2004, CARPE (Capture, Archival and Retrieval of Personal Experiences)is a project conceived with the idea of recording and archiving one's whole life. Some of the technologies developed within this project have become potential new tools of documentary practice. For example, the EyeTap, developed by University of Toronto Professor Steve Mann, presents itself as an ideal device for continuous and inconspicuous recording as well as inverse surveillance.\n\nSome scholars assert that these new devices enable us to imagine a new form of citizenship (the \"monitorial citizen\") that hinges on documentary practices. This concept is illustrated by parents watching their small children at the community pool. They look inactive, but they are poised for action if action is required. The emphasis is not so much on information gathering as it is on keeping a watchful eye—even while the monitorial citizen is doing something else.\n\nProjects such as The Canary Project's photographic monitoring of global warming effects (see External Links) and the Center for Land Use Interpretation's Data Base of citizen-created documentation of land use practices exemplify the link between surveillance, emerging documentary practices and monitorial citizenship.\n\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science, in partnership with Amnesty International, presents another example of how new media are allowing surveillance and documentary practices to inform each other. This partnership uses satellite imagery to help NGOs document atrocities in isolated crisis zones such as Darfur and Zimbabwe. By purchasing images from commercial satellites that correspond to mapping coordinates, NGOs are increasingly able to provide visual evidence of refugee camps and burned villages; events and activities that would be impossible to image without the satellite technology. (see External Links)\n\nTraditionally, maps have been created to orient people. They have delineated boundaries by using static, two-dimensional symbols to represent dynamic, three-dimensional spaces that undergo continual change. Both form and content are fixed in these traditional maps, leaving out the real-time experiences of those people who live in and define the space being represented. However, the proliferation of portable media devices that can record and distribute digital images, video, audio and text, combined with the capability to reach previously unreachable audiences via the Web and through vast wireless networks, now makes it possible to transform conventional maps into living documents.\n\nNew, map-based documentary practices employ maps as useful tools for interrogating the present, transforming maps from static representations into events-in-the-making. Personal narratives, experiences, and memories are being used to create maps that represent social and cultural space as well as physical space. Often, the goal in such projects is to evoke a more diverse and dynamic portrait of human experience as it is actually lived. (see External Links)\n\nFor example, programs that involve community members and youth in active community mapping for social empowerment include Amigos de las Américas, Video Machete in Chicago, as well as Community Youth Mapping and Mapping Within (see External Links). There have been significant efforts to use community mapping practices to promote environmentally sound practices, including Green Mapping (see External Link) which involves locals in identifying and siting (on a map) ecology-minded (\"green\") businesses, spaces, and organizations. A recent California effort involves citizens in mapping forest fires and related community action plan. A variety of resources are available to support those involved in mapping, including resource lists, guidelines, and lesson plans. (see External Links)\n\nSonic representations of place, sometimes called \"soundmaps,\" challenge traditional assumptions of what maps can do and offer new ways of participating in documentary practice. Soundmaps extend opportunities for defining place and expressing local culture, and they offer the added dimension of time. By enabling the integration of sound, text, still and moving images, mapping uniquely allows for more choices of representation and documentation without necessarily privileging one form above the rest. By doing so, voice is given to more ways of knowing and expressing—including 'remixing', for example—in a way that recognizes and affirms the diversity of experiences and representations within communities. (see External Links)\n\nThe emergence of the \"Geoweb\" is another example of how changes in the ways people document geographical space is also broadening notions of documentary practice. \"Geoweb\" refers to virtual maps or \"geobrowsers\" such as Google Earth that allow users to search for images, texts, videos or other media content through interactive, photographic maps of the earth. All information on a geoweb is organized by geographic tags tied to a particular location on the map. Since its inception, usage of the Geoweb has been widespread and varied; including recreational, humanitarian, political and military uses. (see External Links) New mapping technologies make new documentary practices imaginable by allowing documentary producers to locate, store, share, and network images and information that capture the ever-shifting landscapes of the world, updated in real-time.\nOn the global scale, access to new media with potential to generate new documentary practices is still confined to an economically privileged few, giving rise to the \"digital divide\". However, the first digital divide was largely due to economics and politics of broadband cable and expensive computers needed to access the internet. With the proliferation of wireless networks and mobile phones, the divide has diminished considerably, as more remote areas are easier to reach through wireless signals and mobile devices are far less expensive than computers. While there is great potential for new technologies to continue to broaden definitions of documentary practice, enabling more people to collaborate and “document from within” their own communities, questions about who controls and regulates the networks and distribution methods as well as the increasingly advanced skill needed to fully participate in emerging practices will likely be a core question for some time.\n\n"}

The ethnic theme parks are advertised as a way to glimpse into different areas around the world in one easy visit.\n\nThe layout allocates a separate “village” to each ethnic group, allowing tourists and other visitors to absorb the individuality they portray. Heritage and history are simulated through elaborate costumes and roles.

At \"Windows Around the World\", for example, national heritage is classified into three categories: primitive song and dance, professional modifications, and further creative modifications.\n\nA debate over authenticity has been sparked in light of the fact that several employees represent nationalities separate from their own individual heritages. The Wa people, for instance, play the roles of African ethnic groups, while Native Americans are portrayed by ethnic Mongolians.\n\nDisputes also linger over the degree to which governments and corporations seek to mask and embellish what they wish within the walls of the park.

They may be partnered with game development tools, special game engine licenses, and other middleware to aid video game development. GDKs are typically not available to the public, and require game developers to enter an agreement, partnership, or program with the hardware manufacturer to gain access to the hardware. As game console generations pass, development kits often get sold through websites like eBay without repercussions. This is often because the console manufacturers discontinue certain development programs as time passes.\n\nIn the 1980s, computing did not involve 3D modelling or any complex programming due to the limitations of hardware. This, combined with the hobbyist nature of early computer game programming, meant that not many individuals or smaller companies would develop for consoles. Even when consoles became mainstream (such as the Nintendo Entertainment System), there was no official or publicly available GDK since most console manufacturers would develop their games in-house. For example, Nintendo had internal development teams for both hardware and software.\n\nBy the fifth generation of consoles, game development kits were developed to encourage more developers to make console games and grow the videogame industry. Game development kits began as a simple way for developers to connect their computers to console hardware, allowing them to compile software on their PC and see it play directly on a console. Once most GDKs started becoming bundled with hardware-specific software, hobbyists or anyone not directly affiliated with a console manufacturer would have to write their games without the specialized software to access unique features such as the Xbox One's Kinect or the Wii U GamePad.\n\nModern game development kits often come bundled with the specialized software, and are much more formalized compared to previous-generation GDKs. In older generations of console gaming, developers had to make their own hardware and write games at various levels of programming (such as assembly). Today, programs such as Unity 3D provide a complete software environment and console manufacturers such as Nintendo provide polished & powerful development hardware through their developer programs. Other console manufacturers even allow the retail consoles to be used as development kits, provided that the development software is being used by the developer.\n\nFor a significant portion of the NES lifespan, there was no official development kit. Video game developers creating games for the NES would have to make their own development kits, such as Rocket Science Production with their \"NES Mission Control\" development system. At least two programs were used in conjunction with the NES Mission Control hardware; NESTEST.EXE which would be used to test and debug the development hardware, and HST.EXE which would be used for communication between a computer and the NES development hardware.\n\nThe Super Nintendo Entertainment System used specialized EPROM cartridges for development, as well as various software. Similar to the NES, developers often made their own development software or relied on middleware made by other developers.\n\nThe are several variations of the PlayStation development kit used for game creation. One variation of the development kit had only three components, while the PlayStation Ultimate Development Kit included up to 26 components, including the complete Net Yaroze development kit.\n\nThe Net Yaroze version of the development kit was unique in that it had some features removed and added compared to the official (complete) PlayStation development kit. The Net Yaroze hardware was designed for hobbyists, while official developers would have access to the official PlayStation development kits. There was also a blue version of the PlayStation made for developers that would read burned discs to allow quick testing of imaged builds of their videogames. While there were official PlayStation-branded CD-Rs that could be used with the blue PlayStation, regular CD-Rs were also compatible with the system.\n\nThe Nintendo 64 development kit consisted of multiple components, both for the N64 and its add-on, the N64DD. The main hardware used in N64 game development was the Partner-N64 Development Kit, and used tall cartridges for game development/testing rather than the short cartridges that were sold with retail games. Another hardware component in N64 development was the NU64 Flash Gang Writer, which allowed developers to copy data from one cartridge to multiple cartridges simultaneously. This device was primarily used to create press and test copies of games, and also relied on tall cartridges instead of short retail cartridges.\n\nOther versions of the Nintendo 64 GDK are the SN Systems development suite, as well as the SN Maestro 64 Music development system. The development suite allowed developers to run code from a computer directly to the console, and included a software package. The Maestro 64 Music system allowed developers to load music software on to the console, and play music through the Nintendo 64's hardware.\n\nSega Dreamcast units were unique in that they used \"GD-ROM\" discs; giga discs that held 1GB of data. This was slightly more than a typical CD, but less than a DVD. While GD-ROM burners were used by some developers, since the Dreamcast was compatible with CDs and since most games didn't take up 1GB of data at the time, GD-ROMs remained uncommon as developers opted to use the more-easily accessible CDs for their disc media.\n\nWhen developers were creating software for the original Xbox, a prototype of the controller was used in the early development kits. This controller was slimmer, had elongated sides, and used a USB cable instead of an Xbox port-compatible cable.\n\nMicrosoft manages the Xbox 360 Tools and Middleware Program, which licenses development kits (hardware and software) to professional software developers working on tools and technologies for games. Access to this program requires good industry references, prior experience in games tools and middleware development, and signing a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nThe PlayStation developer program allows registered developers to publish their games across the PlayStation Network, making their games accessible on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation TV all through one program.\n\nThe Wii development kit was a bundle of the \"NDEV\" hardware - a big black box full of debugging/testing hardware that looks nothing like the slim white Wii consoles sold to consumers - and a disc containing the developer software tools.\n\nMicrosoft maintains multiple developer programs for people wanting to develop games for their platforms; ID@Xbox for Xbox One game development, and the Windows Dev Center for Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Xbox One game and application development. \n\nThe PlayStation developer program allows registered developers to publish their games across the PlayStation Network, making their games accessible on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation TV all through one program. The PlayStation 4 development kits were known as \"Orbis\", though this was just a codename. Academic institutions can register to receive PS4 development kits for educational use, and are not region-restricted unlike regular PlayStation Developer Program members.\n\nNintendo maintains a unified developer program for both its Wii U and Nintendo 3DS families of platforms. This developer program provides software and middleware to developers, and allows developers to self-publish their games to the Nintendo eShop. Games and applications published through this program are considered \"third-party\" and do not belong to Nintendo, allowing independent developers to publish their games on multiple different platforms.\n\nThe Wii U development hardware consists of a system called \"CAT-DEV\", with its accompanying peripherals such as the Display Remote Controller (presumably the Wii U GamePad) and sensor bar.\n\nNintendo's developer program allows developers to use Nintendo 3DS development kits, and allows developers to self-publish their games to the Nintendo eShop. As mentioned in the Nintendo Wii U section above, games and applications published through this program are considered \"third-party\" and do not belong to Nintendo, allowing independent developers to publish their games on multiple different platforms.\n\nStrangely, some 3DS development kits cannot play retail games.\n\n"}

Because of the self-published nature of webcomics, the internet has become a successful platform for social commentary, as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) expression.\n\nA 2015 study by David Harper concluded that webcomics were vastly more popular format to female, transgender, and non-binary comic artists than for men. More than 40% of the women, transgender, and non-binary comic artists reported to work primarily in webcomics in this study, while only 15% of men did. Harper suggested that this may be because the self-published nature of webcomics form a lower barrier to entry, while traditional mediums such as comic books are gatekept by cisgender men, though he also suggested that this disparity may just be a difference in interest between the groups.\n\nAccording to a study by Erik Melander in 2005, at least 25% of webcomic creators were female. This percentage was significantly larger than the number of successful women creating print comics at the time, and the number may have been even higher, as a certain percentage of contributors were unknown. In 2015, 63% of the top 30 comic creators on webcomic conglomerate Tapastic were female. In 2016, 42% of the webcomic creators on Line Webtoon were female, as was 50% of its 6 million active daily readers.\n\n\"Girls with Slingshots\" creator Danielle Corsetto stated that webcomics are probably a female dominated field because there is no need to go through an established publisher. Noelle Stevenson, creator of \"Nimona\" and \"Lumberjanes\", noticed that webcomics predominantly feature female protagonists, possibly to \"balance out\" the content of mainstream media. Corsetto noted that she has never encountered sexism during her career, though Stevenson described some negative experiences with Reddit and 4Chan, websites outside of her usual channels.\n\nOliver Sava of \"The A.V. Club\" pointed out in 2016 that there exists a growing community of black women cartoonists creating webcomics.\n\nIn India, where rape of women has been a big issue in the 2010s, Indian webcomics formed a platform for artists to poke fun at patriarchy, feminism, and various other gender-related topics. According to human rights activist and webcomic creator Rachita Taneja, humor aids in communicating complex subjects to large groups of people, and the inclusiveness of webcomics makes it an excellent medium for said communication.\n\nGirlamatic was a subscriber-based webcomic site founded by Joey Manley in 2003. The website's purpose was to syndicate webcomics created primarily by women and marketed primarily to women. Girlamatic included webcomics created by various well-known female webcomic artists, including Shaenon Garrity and Lea Hernandez. The syndicate had won various Lulu awards for being among the \"most women-friendly and reader- friendly work in comics.\" Writing for \"Comixpedia\", Eric Burns voiced his worries that initiatives like Girlamatic section off and divide the webcomic community, making it \"less\" likely for male readers to come across the works of female webcartoonists.\n\nThere exist a large amount of openly gay and lesbian comic creators that self-publish their work on the internet. These include amateur works, as well as more \"mainstream\" works, such as \"Kyle's Bed & Breakfast\". According to Andrew Wheeler from \"Comics Alliance\", webcomics \"provide a platform to so many queer voices that might otherwise go undiscovered,\" and Tash Wolfe of \"The Mary Sue\" has a similar outlook on transgender artists and themes.\n\n"}
{"id": "630966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=630966", "title": "Heckler", "text": "Heckler\n\nA heckler is a person who harasses and tries to disconcert others with questions, challenges, or gibes.\nHecklers are often known to shout disparaging comments at a performance or event, or to interrupt set-piece speeches, with the intent of disturbing performers and/or participants.\n\nAlthough the word \"heckler\", which originated from the textile trade, was first attested in the mid-15th century, the sense \"person who harasses\" was from 1885. To \"heckle\" was to tease or comb out flax or hemp fibres. The additional meaning, to interrupt speakers with awkward or embarrassing questions, was added in Scotland, and specifically perhaps in early nineteenth century Dundee, a famously radical town where the hecklers who combed the flax had established a reputation as the most radical and belligerent element in the workforce. In the heckling factory, one heckler would read out the day's news while the others worked, to the accompaniment of interruptions and furious debate.\n\nHeckling was a major part of the vaudeville theater. Sometimes it was incorporated into the play. Milton Berle's weekly TV variety series in the 1960s featured a heckler named Sidney Spritzer (German/Yiddish for 'squirter') played by Borscht Belt comic Irving Benson. In the 1970s and 1980s, \"The Muppet Show\", which was also built around a vaudeville theme, featured two hecklers, Statler & Waldorf (two old men named after famous hotels). Heckles are now particularly likely to be heard at comedy performances, to unsettle or compete with the performer.\n\nPoliticians speaking before live audiences have less latitude to deal with hecklers. Legally, such conduct may constitute protected free speech. Strategically, coarse or belittling retorts to hecklers entail personal risk disproportionate to any gain. Some politicians, however, have been known to improvise a relevant and witty response despite these pitfalls. One acknowledged expert at this was Harold Wilson, British Prime Minister in the 1960s:\n\nMartin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech was largely a response to supporter Mahalia Jackson interrupting his prepared speech to shout \"Tell them about the dream, Martin\". At that point, King stopped reading from his previously prepared speech and improvised the remainder of the speech - this improvised portion of the speech is the best-known part of the speech and frequently rated as one of the best of all time.\n\nDuring a campaign stop just before winning the Presidency in 1980, Ronald Reagan was heckled by an audience member who kept interrupting him during a speech. Reagan tried to go on with his speech three times, but after being interrupted yet again glared at the heckler and snapped \"Aw, shut up!\" The audience immediately gave him a standing ovation.\n\nIn 1992, then-Presidential candidate Bill Clinton was interrupted by Bob Rafsky, a member of the AIDS activism group ACT UP, who accused him of \"dying of ambition to be president\" during a rally. After becoming visibly agitated, Clinton took the microphone off the stand, pointed to the heckler and directly responded to him by saying, \"[...] I have treated you and all of the other people who have interrupted my rallies with a hell of a lot more respect than you treated me. And it's time to start thinking about that!\" Clinton was then met with raucous applause.\n\nOne modern political approach to discourage heckling is to ensure that major events are given before a \"tame\" audience of sympathizers, or conducted to allow restrictions on who may remain on the premises (see also, \"astroturfing\"). The downside is this may make heckling incidents even more newsworthy. This happened to Tony Blair during a photo op visit to a hospital during the 2001 general election campaign, and again in 2003 during a speech.\n\nIn 2004, American Vice President Dick Cheney was interrupted mid-speech by Perry Patterson, a middle-aged mother in a pre-screened rally audience. After various supportive outbursts that were permitted (\"Four more years\", \"Go Bush!\"), Patterson uttered \"No, no, no, no\" and was removed from the speech area and told to leave. She refused, and was arrested for criminal trespass.\n\nLater, in 2005, Cheney received some heckling that was broadcast during his trip to New Orleans, after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the area. The heckling occurred during a press conference in Gulfport, Mississippi, in an area that was cordoned off for public safety reasons, and then further secured for the press conference. Nevertheless, emergency room physician Ben Marble got close enough to the proceedings and could be heard yelling, \"Go fuck yourself, Mr. Cheney.\" Cheney laughed it off and continued speaking. The heckle was a reference to Cheney's use of the phrase the previous year, when during a heated exchange with Senator Patrick Joseph Leahy, Vermont, he said \"fuck yourself\" on the floor of the senate.\n\nOn 15 October 2005, \"The Scotsman\" reported \"Iranian ambassador Dr Seyed Mohammed Hossein Adeli... speaking at the annual Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament conference... During his speech to the CND several people were told to leave the room following protests at Iran's human rights record. Several protesters shouted \"Fascists\" at the ambassador and the organisers of the conference. Walter Wolfgang, the 82-year-old peace campaigner who was forced out of the Labour Party conference last month, was in the audience.\"\n\nSince 2005 heckling of performing artists has become more commonplace in Switzerland. Musicians of Basel and Zurich have become an increasing focus of hecklers. This shift is primarily perpetrated by foreigners and is often met with a positive response by the non-Swiss performers who welcome the audience interaction. \n\nOn Thursday, 20 April 2006, a heckler from the Falun Gong spiritual movement entered the US White House grounds as a reporter and interrupted a formal arrival ceremony for Chinese President Hu Jintao. Moments into Mr Hu's speech at the event, Wang Wenyi, perched on the top tier of the stands reserved for the press, began screaming in English and Chinese: \"President Bush stop him. Stop this visit. Stop the killing and torture.\" President Bush later apologised to his guest.\n\nOn 9 September 2009, Representative Joe Wilson (R-SC) shouted \"You lie!\" at President Barack Obama after President Obama stated that his health care plan would not subsidize coverage for illegal immigrants during a speech he was making to a joint session of Congress. Wilson later apologized for his outburst.\n\nOn 25 November 2013, Ju Hong, a 24-year-old South Korean immigrant without legal documentation, shouted at Obama to use his executive power to stop deportation of illegal immigrants. Obama said \"If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so.\" \"But we're also a nation of laws, that's part of our tradition,\" he continued. \"And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal.\"\n\nHecklers can also appear at sporting events, and usually (but not always) direct their taunts at a visiting team. Fans of the Philadelphia Eagles American football team are notorious for heckling; among the most infamous incidents were booing and subsequently throwing snowballs at a performer dressed as Santa Claus in a halftime show in 1968, and cheering at the career-ending injury of visiting team player Michael Irvin in 1999. Often, sports heckling will also involve throwing objects onto the field; this has led most sports stadiums to ban glass containers and bottlecaps. Another famous heckler is Robert Szasz, who regularly attends Tampa Bay Rays baseball games and is known for loudly heckling one opposing player per game or series. Former Yugoslav football star Dejan Savićević is involved in an infamous incident with a heckler in which during an interview, a man on the street is heard shouting off-camera: \"You're a piece of shit!\" Dejan berated the man, and went on to finish the interview, without missing a beat.\n\nIn English and Scottish football, heckling and swearing from the stands, and football chants such as who ate all the pies? are common.\n\nAustralian sporting audiences are known for creative heckling. Perhaps the most famous is Yabba who had a grandstand at the Sydney Cricket Ground named after him, and now a statue.\n\nThe sport of cricket is particularly notorious for heckling between the teams themselves, which is known as sledging.\n\nAt the NBA Drafts of recent years, many fans have gone with heckling ESPN NBA analyst and host of, Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith, Stephen A. Smith. Most notably, The Stephen A. Smith Heckling Society of Gentlemen heckles him with a sock puppet dubbed as Stephen A. himself.\n\nTennis fans are also fairly noted for heckling. Some may call out during a service point to distract either player. Another common heckle from tennis fans is cheering after a service fault, which is considered to be rude and unsporting.\n\nIn 2009, then Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Alex Ríos was a victim of a heckling incident outside after a fund-raising event. The incident occurred after Rios declined to sign an autograph for a young fan, the same day he went 0 for 5 with 5 strikeouts in a game against the Los Angeles Angels. An older man yelled \"The way you played today Alex, you should be lucky someone wants your autograph.\" Rios then replied with \"Who gives a fuck\", repeating it until being ushered into a vehicle. Rios did apologize the next day, but was eventually placed on waivers and claimed by the Chicago White Sox later that year.\n\nOne of the most famous heckles in music history occurred at a Bob Dylan concert at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in 1966. During a quiet moment in between songs, an audience member shouts very loudly and clearly, \"Judas!\" referencing Dylan's so-called betrayal of folk music by \"going electric\". Dylan replied: \"I don't believe you, you're a liar!\" before telling his band to \"Play it fucking loud!\" They play an acidic version of \"Like a Rolling Stone\". This incident was captured on tape and the full concert was released as volume four of Dylan's \"Live Bootleg Series\".\n\nHeckling often occurs during stand up comedy performances, particularly at open stage performances, and/or where alcoholic beverages are being consumed. It is regarded as a sign of audience members becoming impatient with what they regard as a low quality performance. Some comedians ignore the heckling and dislike the practice. In an interview for a 2011 BBC documentary, Billy Connolly said that \"I loathe hecklers. I haven't one good syllable to say about hecklers. When you've come out of the club circuit and all that and you're in the concert hall...they should be gone.\" Other stand-up comedians devise a strategy for quashing such outbursts, usually by having a store of retorts (known as \"squelches\") on hand. The idea is to get the audience laughing at the heckler for being outwitted.\n\nIn addition, live comedy venues tend to discourage heckling via signage and admissions policy, but tend to tolerate it as it creates customer loyalty. The etiquette of exactly how much heckling is tolerated differs immensely from venue to venue, however, but is generally more likely to be tolerated in blue collar or working class venues. Some cities feature 'heckle nights' where heckling is actively encouraged.\n\nThe comedy TV series \"The Muppet Show\" featured a pair of hecklers named Statler and Waldorf. These characters created a kind of meta-comedy act in which the show's official comedian, Fozzie Bear, acted as their usual foil, although they occasionally made jokes at other characters as well.\n\nAnother notable use of heckling in comedy is in the cult favorite series \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". The series involves a man (either Joel Robinson or Mike Nelson) and two robots (Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot) sitting in a theater mocking bad B-movies. This style of comedy, coined as riffing, is continued with commentary-based series such as Rifftrax and Cinematic Titanic.\n\nIn one of Rowan Atkinson's plays \"The School Master\", a heckler interrupted his play by shouting \"Here!\" after Atkinson had read out an amusing name on his register. Atkinson incorporated it into his act by saying \"I have a detention book...\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2320803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320803", "title": "Heroic drama", "text": "Heroic drama\n\nHeroic drama is a type of play popular during the Restoration era in England, distinguished by both its verse structure and its subject matter. The subgenre of heroic drama evolved through several works of the middle to later 1660s; John Dryden's \"The Indian Emperour\" (1665) and Roger Boyle's \"The Black Prince\" (1667) were key developments.\n\nThe term \"heroic drama\" was invented by Dryden for his play, \"The Conquest of Granada\" (1670). For the \"Preface\" to the printed version of the play, Dryden argued that the drama was a species of \"epic poetry\" for the stage, that, as the epic was to other poetry, so the heroic drama was to other plays. Consequently, Dryden derived a series of rules for this type of play.\n\nFirst, the play should be composed in heroic verse (closed couplets in iambic pentameter). Second, the play must focus on a subject that pertains to national foundations, mythological events, or important and grand matters. Third, the hero of the heroic drama must be powerful, decisive, and, like Achilles, dominating even when wrong. \"The Conquest of Granada\" followed all of these rules. The story was that of the national foundation of Spain (and King Charles II was known to be fond of Spanish plays), and the hero, Almanzor, was a man of great martial prowess and temperament.\n\nDryden's \"Conquest of Granada\" is often considered one of the better heroic tragedies, but his highest achievement is his adaptation (which he called \"All for Love\", 1678) of Shakespeare's \"Anthony and Cleopatra\" to the heroic formula. Other heroic dramatists were Nathaniel Lee (\"The Rival Queens\") and Thomas Otway, whose \"Venice Preserved\" is a fine tragedy that transcends the usual limitations of the form. We also owe indirectly to heroic tragedy two very amusing parodies of the type: the Duke of Buckingham's \"The Rehearsal\" and Henry Fielding's \"The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great\"\n\n\"Those who associate 'heroic drama' primarily with the use of the 'heroic couplet' usually set as its extent the years from 1664 to 1678. This, certainly, is its period of fullest development and authority. Those who prefer to accentuate the elements suggested by the very term 'heroic' rather than the strict rhymed verse form are willing to admit wider limits.\" Restoration plays by Sir William Davenant, Thomas Otway, Nathaniel Lee, John Crowne, Elkanah Settle, and John Banks, and later works by Nicholas Rowe and Joseph Addison, have been included in tighter or looser definitions of heroic drama.\n\nToday, drama is divided up into numerous subgenres; Dryden, however, worked from Classical critics. There was little dramatic critical theory for him to appeal to, and the new rules brought over from France (particularly those of Corneille and Boileau) did not match English theatrical history or practice. The emphasis on unities and on maintaining only Classically proscribed dramatic forms also came from Thomas Rymer, who condemned the heterogeneity of the stage. Aristotle had only spoken of satire, epic, and tragedy, and Horace also wrote only of comedy, tragedy and satire, and so Dryden was seeking to square actual theatrical practice with an ancient framework for literature. He was attempting his own neo-classicism. The First Folio of Shakespeare had divided Shakespeare's plays into \"history,\" \"tragedy,\" and \"comedy,\" but these terms were stretched. Dryden, therefore, implicitly recognizes that drama had moved into the territory of other types of poetry, but he strives to restrain that freedom by reforming the stage to a true and epic subject matter. \n\nGeorge Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and others satirized heroic drama in \"The Rehearsal\". The satire was successful enough that heroic drama largely disappeared afterward. Buckingham attacked the stupidity of blustering, military heroes, as well as the apparent self-importance of attempting a dramatic entertainment about the serious subjects of military and national history.\n\nBuckingham's criticism of Dryden in \"The Rehearsal\" is partly Dryden's bombastic verse but, more pointedly, Dryden's \"personal\" interest in creating a \"pure\" drama. The character of Bayes is ludicrous more for his hubris in damning actual plays in favor of imagined ones than he is for being a poetaster.\n"}

During the first seven years the show saw considerable success at Littlefied's in Brooklyn, New York. In 2013, under the helm of The Super Serious Show producers CleftClips, Hot Tub relocated to the West Coast at The Virgil in Silver Lake, Los Angeles.\n\nHot Tub harbors comedy acts that are unusual, odd, experimental, and generally free-wheeling. The show is also a venue in which well-known comedians try out new material and more eccentric bits.

A single publishing company may have multiple imprints, often using the different names as brands to market works to various demographic consumer segments.\n\nAn imprint of a publisher is a trade name—a name that a business uses for trading commercial products or services—under which a work is published. Imprints typically have a defining character or mission. In some cases, the diversity results from the takeover of smaller publishers (or parts of their business) by a larger company. In the case of Barnes & Noble, imprints have been used to facilitate the venture of a bookseller into publishing.\n\nIn the video game industry, some game companies operate various publishing labels with Take-Two Interactive credited as \"the father of label\" in their case the labels are wholly owned incorporated entities with their own publishing and distributing, sales and marketing infrastructure and management teams and their own respective subsidiaries also incorporated (Rockstar North Limited, 2K Vegas, Inc.). This model have influenced rivals including Activision Blizzard, Zenimax, Electronic Arts from 2008-2018, Warner Bros. Interactive, and Koei Tecmo. Take-Two have had such model in place since 1997-1998, and is seen as a \"a game holding company with autonomous game publishing and development subsidiaries\"\nIndependently-owned game publishers like Devolver Digital also use the word label to describe itself.\n\nA single publishing company may have multiple imprints, with the different imprints often used by the publisher to market works to different demographic consumer segments. For example, the objective of Viking—an imprint of the Penguin Group—is \"[t]o publish a strictly limited list of good nonfiction, such as biography, history and works on contemporary affairs, and distinguished fiction with some claim to permanent importance rather than ephemeral popular interest.\"\n"}
{"id": "248784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=248784", "title": "Independent animation", "text": "Independent animation\n\nIndependent animation is animated short cartoons and feature films produced outside the professional Hollywood animation industry. A good portion of the work is viewed in animation festivals and private screen rooms along with schools that produce animation through instruction. The significance of independent animation is as important as studio fare.\n\nThe history of animation is as old as the film industry itself. Independent animators have produced innovative, often experimental, shorts since the silent era. One of the earliest feature-length animated films was \"The Adventures of Prince Achmed\", made in 1926 by Lotte Reiniger, a German artist who made silhouette animation using intricate cut-out figures and back-lighting. She made another feature, \"Dr. Dolittle\", in 1928.\n\nIn America, working independent animators included Mary Ellen Bute, John Whitney and Oskar Fischinger alongside earlier efforts of what would become UPA. \n\n1959 saw the first independent animated film to win an Oscar with John Hubley's \"Moonbird\" which was also produced by wife and collaborator Faith Hubley using limited animation to tell their own personal stories. \n\nJordan Belson , Robert Breer and Stan Vanderbeek made experimental animation during this time. \n\nIn the late 1960s, animator Ralph Bakshi and producer Steve Krantz founded Bakshi Productions, establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators. He also paid his employees a higher salary than any other studio at that time. In 1969, Ralph's Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and \"Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse\", a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. Bakshi soon developed \"Heavy Traffic\", a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi came across a copy of R. Crumb's \"Fritz the Cat\". Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film.\n\n\"Fritz the Cat\" was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the MPAA, and the highest grossing independent animated film of all time. Bakshi then simultaneously directed a number of animated films, starting with \"Heavy Traffic\". Ralph Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since Walt Disney to have two financially successful films released back-to-back.\n\nOther independent animators during this time included Charles Braverman, Gene Deitch,\n\nMarv Newland, Fred Wolf and Will Vinton. The latter two would go on to win Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film alongside with the works of the Hubleys and Ernest Pintoff starting in the late 50's-early 60's. \n\nNotable award-winning films included Dale Case and Bob Mitchell's \"The Further Adventures of Uncle Sam\", Ted Petok's \"The Crunch Bird\", Frank Mouris's \"Frank Film\" and Jimmy Picker's \"Sundae in New York\".\n\nAnimation historians John Canemaker and Michael Sporn also made independent animation in New York, both earning Oscar nods for their work (only Canemaker won in 2005). \n\nOther animators like Jeff Scher , Joanna Priestley, Kathy Rose, Robert Swarthe, Vince Collins, Barrie Nelson, Eli Noyes, Sky David (aka Dennis Pies), Steve Segal, Adam Beckett and George Griffin also made experimental animation during the mid-late 70's through early-mid 80's. \n\nIn the 1970s, independent animators like Sally Cruikshank continued to explore independent and D.I.Y. distribution options, but were still largely met with rejection even though their work is now considered ground breaking.\n\nCollections of independent films have been gathered for theatrical viewing, and video release, under such titles as the International Tournee of Animation (which existed between about 1966 and the late 1990s) and Spike and Mike's \"Classic Festival of Animation\" (1977 to 1990) and Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation since 1990. Contemporary independent animators, including Steven Subotnick, Paul Fierlinger, Bill Plympton, Don Hertzfeldt, Nina Paley, Suzan Pitt and PES have also made work outside of the studio system.\n\nThe rise of the Internet in the 1990s and 2000s saw an exponential increase in the production of independent animation which included personal independent works by Timothy Hittle , Lewis Klahr and John Schnall . Personal computer power increased to the point where it was possible for a single person to produce an animated cartoon on a home computer, using software such as Flash, and distribute these short films over the World Wide Web. Independently produced Internet cartoons flourished as the popularity of the Web grew, and a number of strange, often hilarious short cartoons were produced for the Web.\n\nIn the late 1990s, an independent animated short film called \"The Spirit of Christmas\" was produced for under $2,000 by two artists, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. This film was widely distributed on the Internet as a pirated cartoon, and its phenomenal popularity gave rise to the popular television animated series \"South Park.\" Limited 1990s bandwidth made streaming difficult, if not impossible. While some animators like Spümcø's John K. opted to use Flash, it still required a plug-in making it unviewable in many early web browsers. Other early online animators like M. Wartella opted to use the Animated GIF to overcome these limitations and create early web-based animation viewable through all browsers.\n\nContinued success for independent animation occurred in the 2000s with animated shorts such as \"Making Fiends\". Both shorts garnered enough support to be turned into full-length TV Series, airing on Nicktoons Network and Big TV, respectively.\n\nBy the late mid-2000s, YouTube and the Internet and like-minded online video distribution, in addition to independent broadcasting sites that followed, proved to be a dominant form of independently distributed, broadcast, edited, and produced animation TV shows, anime, feature films, music videos, retro animation, commercials, trailers, original online animation content, and web exclusives (which would otherwise not stand a chance of seeing airtime on more normal, seemingly infinitely more expensive forms of mainstream broadcasting on traditional television networks, which still continue to function on a more conservative and old fashioned distribution matrix). \"The Annoying Orange\", which started off as a series of viral quasi-CGI animated comedy shorts on YouTube, quickly gained a cult following and an excess of 100 million views online. It is an example of an animated web-series to transition between Internet and television distribution successfully, as an animated series on Cartoon Network.\n\nThe National Film Board of Canada began production of animation when Norman McLaren joined the organization in 1941. The NFB proved to be an organization that would give Canada a presence in the film world. The animation department eventually gained distinction, particularly with the pioneering work of McLaren, an internationally recognized experimental filmmaker. The NFB was a pioneer in several novel techniques such as pinscreen animation, but most of the Oscars and many other awards it won were done in traditional cel animation (with the exceptions of \"The Sand Castle\" and \"Ryan\").\n\nMcLaren's Oscar-winning \"Neighbours\" popularized the form of character movement referred to as pixillation, a variant of stop motion. The term pixilation itself was created by NFB animator Grant Munro in an experimental film of the same name.\n\nAnimators including Janet Perlman, Richard Condie, Cordell Barker, John Weldon, Caroline Leaf, Ishu Patel and others all worked at NFB.\n\nThe BFI funded around thirty pieces of experimental animation between the mid-fifties to mid-nineties (notable examples: The Quay Brothers). Another major contributor to independent animation in Britain was Channel 4, which gained an international reputation as one of the most adventurous broadcasters of animation featuring works from Joanna Quinn (\"Girls' Night Out\"), Paul Barry (\"The Sandman\"), Mark Baker (\"The Village\") and former NFB animator Paul Driessen (\"3 Misses\"). \n\n"}

Produced by Gatien's daughter, Jen Gatien, it was released in special markets throughout the United States and Canada on September 23, 2011.\n\nAs the owner of legendary New York City hotspots like The Limelight, Tunnel, Palladium, and Club USA, Peter Gatien was considered by many to be the undisputed king of the 1980s New York City club scene. The Ontario native, whose trademark eye patch made him stand out in a crowd, built and oversaw a chain of nightclub ventures that brought thousands of patrons per night during its peak years. However, after years of legal battles and police pressure spearheaded by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's drive to crack down on the city's nightlife scene during the mid-1990s, Gatien was deported to Canada, bringing an end to his presence and influence in the city's nightlife scene. The documentary features interviews with numerous people involved in the club's scene, as well as key informants in Gatien's high-profile trial. Produced by Gatien's daughter, Jen, and Alfred Spellman, and directed by Billy Corben (who previously directed the film \"Cocaine Cowboys\"), the film documents the rise and fall of Gatien and his nightclub empire.\n\n\n\"Limelight\" premiered on April 22 at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival.

{"id": "19641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19641", "title": "Mass media", "text": "Mass media\n\nThe mass media is a diversified collection of media technologies that reach a large audience via mass communication. The technologies through which this communication takes place include a variety of outlets.\n\nBroadcast media transmit information electronically, via such media as film, radio, recorded music, or television. Digital media comprises both Internet and mobile mass communication. Internet media comprise such services as email, social media sites, websites, and Internet-based radio and television. Many other mass media outlets have an additional presence on the web, by such means as linking to or running TV ads online, or distributing QR Codes in outdoor or print media to direct mobile users to a website. In this way, they can utilise the easy accessibility and outreach capabilities the Internet affords, as thereby easily broadcast information throughout many different regions of the world simultaneously and cost-efficiently. Outdoor media transmit information via such media as AR advertising; billboards; blimps; flying billboards (signs in tow of airplanes); placards or kiosks placed inside and outside buses, commercial buildings, shops, sports stadiums, subway cars, or trains; signs; or skywriting. Print media transmit information via physical objects, such as books, comics, magazines, newspapers, or pamphlets. Event organizing and public speaking can also be considered forms of mass media.\n\nThe organizations that control these technologies, such as movie studios, publishing companies, and radio and television stations, are also known as the mass media.\n\nIn the late 20th century, mass media could be classified into eight mass media industries: books, the Internet, magazines, movies, newspapers, radio, recordings, and television. The explosion of digital communication technology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries made prominent the question: what forms of media should be classified as \"mass media\"? For example, it is controversial whether to include cell phones, computer games (such as MMORPGs), and video games in the definition. In the 2000s, a classification called the \"seven mass media\" became popular. In order of introduction, they are:\n\n\nEach mass medium has its own content types, creative artists, technicians, and business models. For example, the Internet includes blogs, podcasts, web sites, and various other technologies built atop the general distribution network. The sixth and seventh media, Internet and mobile phones, are often referred to collectively as digital media; and the fourth and fifth, radio and TV, as broadcast media. Some argue that video games have developed into a distinct mass form of media.\n\nWhile a telephone is a two-way communication device, mass media communicates to a large group. In addition, the telephone has transformed into a cell phone which is equipped with Internet access. A question arises whether this makes cell phones a mass medium or simply a device used to access a mass medium (the Internet). There is currently a system by which marketers and advertisers are able to tap into satellites, and broadcast commercials and advertisements directly to cell phones, unsolicited by the phone's user. This transmission of mass advertising to millions of people is another form of mass communication.\n\nVideo games may also be evolving into a mass medium. Video games (for example massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), such as \"RuneScape\") provide a common gaming experience to millions of users across the globe and convey the same messages and ideologies to all their users. Users sometimes share the experience with one another by playing online. Excluding the Internet however, it is questionable whether players of video games are sharing a common experience when they play the game individually. It is possible to discuss in great detail the events of a video game with a friend one has never played with, because the experience is identical to each. The question, then, is whether this is a form of mass communication.\n\nFive characteristics of mass communication have been identified by sociologist John Thompson of Cambridge University:\n\nThe term \"mass media\" is sometimes erroneously used as a synonym for \"mainstream media\". Mainstream media are distinguished from alternative media by their content and point of view. Alternative media are also \"mass media\" outlets in the sense that they use technology capable of reaching many people, even if the audience is often smaller than the mainstream.\n\nIn common usage, the term \"mass\" denotes not that a given number of individuals receives the products, but rather that the products are available in principle to a plurality of recipients.\n\nMass media are distinguished from local media by the notion that whilst mass media aims to reach a very large market, such as the entire population of a country, local media broadcasts to a much smaller population and area, and generally focuses on regional news rather than global events. A third type of media, speciality media, provide for specific demographics, such as specialty channels on TV (sports channels, porn channels, etc.). These definitions are not set in stone, and it is possible for a media outlet to be promoted in status from a local media outlet to a global media outlet. Some local media, which take an interest in state or provincial news, can rise to prominence because of their investigative journalism, and to the local region's preference of updates in national politics rather than regional news. \"The Guardian\", formerly known as the \"Manchester Guardian\", is an example of one such media outlet; once a regional daily newspaper, \"The Guardian\" is currently a nationally respected paper.\n\nThe sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a schedule. With all technological endeavours a number of technical terms and slang have developed. Please see the list of broadcasting terms for a glossary of terms used.\n\nRadio and television programs are distributed over frequency bands that in the United States are highly regulated. Such regulation includes determination of the width of the bands, range, licensing, types of receivers and transmitters used, and acceptable content.\n\nCable television programs are often broadcast simultaneously with radio and television programs, but have a more limited audience. By coding signals and requiring a cable converter box at individual recipients' locations, cable also enables subscription-based channels and pay-per-view services.\n\nA broadcasting organisation may broadcast several programs simultaneously, through several channels (frequencies), for example BBC One and Two. On the other hand, two or more organisations may share a channel and each use it during a fixed part of the day, such as the Cartoon Network/Adult Swim. Digital radio and digital television may also transmit multiplexed programming, with several channels compressed into one ensemble.\n\nWhen broadcasting is done via the Internet the term webcasting is often used. In 2004, a new phenomenon occurred when a number of technologies combined to produce podcasting. Podcasting is an asynchronous broadcast/narrowcast medium. Adam Curry and his associates, the \"Podshow\", are principal proponents of podcasting.\n\nThe term 'film' encompasses motion pictures as individual projects, as well as the field in general. The name comes from the photographic film (also called filmstock), historically the primary medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms for film exist, such as \"motion pictures\" (or just \"pictures\" and \"picture\"), \"the silver screen\", \"photoplays\", \"the cinema\", \"picture shows\", \"flicks\", and most common, \"movies\".\n\nFilms are produced by recording people and objects with cameras, or by creating them using animation techniques or special effects. Films comprise a series of individual frames, but when these images are shown in rapid succession, an illusion of motion is created. Flickering between frames is not seen because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. Also of relevance is what causes the perception of motion: a psychological effect identified as beta movement.\n\nFilm is considered by many to be an important art form; films entertain, educate, enlighten, and inspire audiences. Any film can become a worldwide attraction, especially with the addition of dubbing or subtitles that translate the film message. Films are also artifacts created by specific cultures, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them.\n\nA video game is a computer-controlled game in which a video display, such as a monitor or television, is the primary feedback device. The term \"computer game\" also includes games which display only text (and which can, therefore, theoretically be played on a teletypewriter) or which use other methods, such as sound or vibration, as their primary feedback device, but there are very few new games in these categories. There always must also be some sort of input device, usually in the form of button/joystick combinations (on arcade games), a keyboard and mouse/trackball combination (computer games), a controller (console games), or a combination of any of the above. Also, more esoteric devices have been used for input, e.g., the player's motion. Usually there are rules and goals, but in more open-ended games the player may be free to do whatever they like within the confines of the virtual universe.\n\nIn common usage, an \"arcade game\" refers to a game designed to be played in an establishment in which patrons pay to play on a per-use basis. A \"computer game\" or \"PC game\" refers to a game that is played on a personal computer. A \"Console game\" refers to one that is played on a device specifically designed for the use of such, while interfacing with a standard television set. A \"video game\" (or \"videogame\") has evolved into a catchall phrase that encompasses the aforementioned along with any game made for any other device, including, but not limited to, advanced calculators, mobile phones, PDAs, etc.\n\nSound recording and reproduction is the electrical or mechanical re-creation or amplification of sound, often as music. This involves the use of audio equipment such as microphones, recording devices, and loudspeakers. From early beginnings with the invention of the phonograph using purely mechanical techniques, the field has advanced with the invention of electrical recording, the mass production of the 78 record, the magnetic wire recorder followed by the tape recorder, the vinyl LP record. The invention of the compact cassette in the 1960s, followed by Sony's Walkman, gave a major boost to the mass distribution of music recordings, and the invention of digital recording and the compact disc in 1983 brought massive improvements in ruggedness and quality. The most recent developments have been in digital audio players.\n\nAn album is a collection of related audio recordings, released together to the public, usually commercially.\n\nThe term record album originated from the fact that 78 RPM Phonograph disc records were kept together in a book resembling a photo album. The first collection of records to be called an \"album\" was Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker Suite\", release in April 1909 as a four-disc set by Odeon records. It retailed for 16 shillings – about £15 in modern currency.\n\nA music video (also promo) is a short film or video that accompanies a complete piece of music, most commonly a song. Modern music videos were primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. Although the origins of music videos go back much further, they came into their own in the 1980s, when Music Television's format was based on them. In the 1980s, the term \"rock video\" was often used to describe this form of entertainment, although the term has fallen into disuse.\n\nMusic videos can accommodate all styles of filmmaking, including animation, live action films, documentaries, and non-narrative, abstract film.\n\nThe Internet (also known simply as \"the Net\" or less precisely as \"the Web\") is a more interactive medium of mass media, and can be briefly described as \"a network of networks\". Specifically, it is the worldwide, publicly accessible network of interconnected computer networks that transmit data by packet switching using the standard Internet Protocol (IP). It consists of millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and governmental networks, which together carry various information and services, such as email, online chat, file transfer, and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the World Wide Web.\n\nContrary to some common usage, the Internet and the World Wide Web are not synonymous: the Internet is the system of interconnected \"computer networks\", linked by copper wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless connections etc.; the Web is the contents, or the interconnected \"documents\", linked by hyperlinks and URLs. The World Wide Web is accessible through the Internet, along with many other services including e-mail, file sharing and others described below.\n\nToward the end of the 20th century, the advent of the World Wide Web marked the first era in which most individuals could have a means of exposure on a scale comparable to that of mass media. Anyone with a web site has the potential to address a global audience, although serving to high levels of web traffic is still relatively expensive. It is possible that the rise of peer-to-peer technologies may have begun the process of making the cost of bandwidth manageable. Although a vast amount of information, imagery, and commentary (i.e. \"content\") has been made available, it is often difficult to determine the authenticity and reliability of information contained in web pages (in many cases, self-published). The invention of the Internet has also allowed breaking news stories to reach around the globe within minutes. This rapid growth of instantaneous, decentralized communication is often deemed likely to change mass media and its relationship to society.\n\n\"Cross-media\" means the idea of distributing the same message through different media channels. A similar idea is expressed in the news industry as \"convergence\". Many authors understand cross-media publishing to be the ability to publish in both print and on the web without manual conversion effort. An increasing number of wireless devices with mutually incompatible data and screen formats make it even more difficult to achieve the objective \"create once, publish many\".\n\nThe Internet is quickly becoming the center of mass media. Everything is becoming accessible via the internet. Rather than picking up a newspaper, or watching the 10 o'clock news, people can log onto the internet to get the news they want, when they want it. For example, many workers listen to the radio through the Internet while sitting at their desk.\n\nEven the education system relies on the Internet. Teachers can contact the entire class by sending one e-mail. They may have web pages on which students can get another copy of the class outline or assignments. Some classes have class blogs in which students are required to post weekly, with students graded on their contributions.\n\nBlogging, too, has become a pervasive form of media. A blog is a website, usually maintained by an individual, with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or interactive media such as images or video. Entries are commonly displayed in reverse chronological order, with most recent posts shown on top. Many blogs provide commentary or news on a particular subject; others function as more personal online diaries. A typical blog combines text, images and other graphics, and links to other blogs, web pages, and related media. The ability for readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important part of many blogs. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (artlog), photographs (photoblog), sketchblog, videos (vlog), music (MP3 blog), audio (podcasting) are part of a wider network of social media. Microblogging is another type of blogging which consists of blogs with very short posts.\n\nRSS is a format for syndicating news and the content of news-like sites, including major news sites like Wired, news-oriented community sites like Slashdot, and personal blogs. It is a family of Web feed formats used to publish frequently updated content such as blog entries, news headlines, and podcasts. An RSS document (which is called a \"feed\" or \"web feed\" or \"channel\") contains either a summary of content from an associated web site or the full text. RSS makes it possible for people to keep up with web sites in an automated manner that can be piped into special programs or filtered displays.\n\nA podcast is a series of digital-media files which are distributed over the Internet using syndication feeds for playback on portable media players and computers. The term podcast, like broadcast, can refer either to the series of content itself or to the method by which it is syndicated; the latter is also called podcasting. The host or author of a podcast is often called a podcaster.\n\nMobile phones were introduced in Japan in 1979 but became a mass media only in 1998 when the first downloadable ringing tones were introduced in Finland. Soon most forms of media content were introduced on mobile phones, tablets and other portable devices, and today the total value of media consumed on mobile vastly exceeds that of internet content, and was worth over 31 billion dollars in 2007 (source Informa). The mobile media content includes over 8 billion dollars worth of mobile music (ringing tones, ringback tones, truetones, MP3 files, karaoke, music videos, music streaming services etc.); over 5 billion dollars worth of mobile gaming; and various news, entertainment and advertising services. In Japan mobile phone books are so popular that five of the ten best-selling printed books were originally released as mobile phone books.\n\nSimilar to the internet, mobile is also an interactive media, but has far wider reach, with 3.3 billion mobile phone users at the end of 2007 to 1.3 billion internet users (source ITU). Like email on the internet, the top application on mobile is also a personal messaging service, but SMS text messaging is used by over 2.4 billion people. Practically all internet services and applications exist or have similar cousins on mobile, from search to multiplayer games to virtual worlds to blogs. Mobile has several unique benefits which many mobile media pundits claim make mobile a more powerful media than either TV or the internet, starting with mobile being permanently carried and always connected. Mobile has the best audience accuracy and is the only mass media with a built-in payment channel available to every user without any credit cards or PayPal accounts or even an age limit. Mobile is often called the 7th Mass Medium and either the fourth screen (if counting cinema, TV and PC screens) or the third screen (counting only TV and PC).\n\nA magazine is a periodical publication containing a variety of articles, generally financed by advertising or purchase by readers.\n\nMagazines are typically published weekly, biweekly, monthly, bimonthly or quarterly, with a date on the cover that is in advance of the date it is actually published. They are often printed in color on coated paper, and are bound with a soft cover.\n\nMagazines fall into two broad categories: consumer magazines and business magazines. In practice, magazines are a subset of , distinct from those periodicals produced by scientific, artistic, academic or special interest publishers which are subscription-only, more expensive, narrowly limited in circulation, and often have little or no advertising.\n\nMagazines can be classified as:\n\nA newspaper is a publication containing news and information and advertising, usually printed on low-cost paper called newsprint. It may be general or special interest, most often published daily or weekly. The most important function of newspapers is to inform the public of significant events. Local newspapers inform local communities and include advertisements from local businesses and services, while national newspapers tend to focus on a theme, which can be exampled with \"The Wall Street Journal\" as they offer news on finance and business related-topics. The first printed newspaper was published in 1605, and the form has thrived even in the face of competition from technologies such as radio and television. Recent developments on the Internet are posing major threats to its business model, however. Paid circulation is declining in most countries, and advertising revenue, which makes up the bulk of a newspaper's income, is shifting from print to online; some commentators, nevertheless, point out that historically new media such as radio and television did not entirely supplant existing.\n\nThe internet has challenged the press as an alternative source of information and opinion but has also provided a new platform for newspaper organizations to reach new audiences. According to the World Trends Report, between 2012 and 2016, print newspaper circulation continued to fall in almost all regions, with the exception of Asia and the Pacific, where the dramatic increase in sales in a few select countries has offset falls in historically strong Asian markets such as Japan and the Republic of Korea. Most notably, between 2012 and 2016, India’s print circulation grew by 89 per cent.\n\nOutdoor media is a form of mass media which comprises billboards, signs, placards placed inside and outside commercial buildings/objects like shops/buses, flying billboards (signs in tow of airplanes), blimps, skywriting, AR Advertising. Many commercial advertisers use this form of mass media when advertising in sports stadiums. Tobacco and alcohol manufacturers used billboards and other outdoor media extensively. However, in 1998, the Master Settlement Agreement between the US and the tobacco industries prohibited the billboard advertising of cigarettes. In a 1994 Chicago-based study, Diana Hackbarth and her colleagues revealed how tobacco- and alcohol-based billboards were concentrated in poor neighbourhoods. In other urban centers, alcohol and tobacco billboards were much more concentrated in African-American neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods.\n\nMass media encompasses much more than just news, although it is sometimes misunderstood in this way. It can be used for various purposes:\n\nJournalism is the discipline of collecting, analyzing, verifying and presenting information regarding current events, trends, issues and people. Those who practice journalism are known as journalists.\n\nNews-oriented journalism is sometimes described as the \"first rough draft of history\" (attributed to Phil Graham), because journalists often record important events, producing news articles on short deadlines. While under pressure to be first with their stories, news media organizations usually edit and proofread their reports prior to publication, adhering to each organization's standards of accuracy, quality and style. Many news organizations claim proud traditions of holding government officials and institutions accountable to the public, while media critics have raised questions about holding the press itself accountable to the standards of professional journalism.\n\nPublic relations is the art and science of managing communication between an organization and its key publics to build, manage and sustain its positive image. Examples include:\n\nPublishing is the industry concerned with the production of literature or information – the activity of making information available for public view. In some cases, authors may be their own publishers.\n\nTraditionally, the term refers to the distribution of printed works such as books and newspapers. With the advent of digital information systems and the Internet, the scope of publishing has expanded to include websites, blogs, and the like.\n\nAs a business, publishing includes the development, marketing, production, and distribution of newspapers, magazines, books, literary works, musical works, software, other works dealing with information.\n\nPublication is also important as a legal concept; (1) as the process of giving formal notice to the world of a significant intention, for example, to marry or enter bankruptcy, and; (2) as the essential precondition of being able to claim defamation; that is, the alleged libel must have been published.\n\nA software publisher is a publishing company in the software industry between the developer and the distributor. In some companies, two or all three of these roles may be combined (and indeed, may reside in a single person, especially in the case of shareware).\n\nSoftware publishers often license software from developers with specific limitations, such as a time limit or geographical region. The terms of licensing vary enormously, and are typically secret.\n\nDevelopers may use publishers to reach larger or foreign markets, or to avoid focussing on marketing. Or publishers may use developers to create software to meet a market need that the publisher has identified.\n\nA YouTuber is anyone who has made their fame from creating and promoting videos on the public video-sharing site, YouTube. Many YouTube celebrities have made a profession from their site through sponsorships, advertisements, product placement, and network support.\n\nThe history of mass media can be traced back to the days when dramas were performed in various ancient cultures. This was the first time when a form of media was \"broadcast\" to a wider audience. The first dated printed book known is the \"Diamond Sutra\", printed in China in 868 AD, although it is clear that books were printed earlier. Movable clay type was invented in 1041 in China. However, due to the slow spread of literacy to the masses in China, and the relatively high cost of paper there, the earliest printed mass-medium was probably European popular prints from about 1400. Although these were produced in huge numbers, very few early examples survive, and even most known to be printed before about 1600 have not survived. The term \"mass media\" was coined with the creation of print media, which is notable for being the first example of mass media, as we use the term today. This form of media started in Europe in the Middle Ages.\n\nJohannes Gutenberg's invention of the printing press allowed the mass production of books to sweep the nation. He printed the first book, a Latin Bible, on a printing press with movable type in 1453. The invention of the printing press gave rise to some of the first forms of mass communication, by enabling the publication of books and newspapers on a scale much larger than was previously possible. The invention also transformed the way the world received printed materials, although books remained too expensive really to be called a mass-medium for at least a century after that. Newspapers developed from about 1612, with the first example in English in 1620; but they took until the 19th century to reach a mass-audience directly. The first high-circulation newspapers arose in London in the early 1800s, such as The Times, and were made possible by the invention of high-speed rotary steam printing presses, and railroads which allowed large-scale distribution over wide geographical areas. The increase in circulation, however, led to a decline in feedback and interactivity from the readership, making newspapers a more one-way medium.\n\nThe phrase \"the media\" began to be used in the 1920s. The notion of \"mass media\" was generally restricted to print media up until the post-Second World War, when radio, television and video were introduced. The audio-visual facilities became very popular, because they provided both information and entertainment, because the colour and sound engaged the viewers/listeners and because it was easier for the general public to passively watch TV or listen to the radio than to actively read. In recent times, the Internet become the latest and most popular mass medium. Information has become readily available through websites, and easily accessible through search engines. One can do many activities at the same time, such as playing games, listening to music, and social networking, irrespective of location. Whilst other forms of mass media are restricted in the type of information they can offer, the internet comprises a large percentage of the sum of human knowledge through such things as Google Books. Modern day mass media includes the internet, mobile phones, blogs, podcasts and RSS feeds.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the growth of mass media was driven by technology, including that which allowed much duplication of material. Physical duplication technologies such as printing, record pressing and film duplication allowed the duplication of books, newspapers and movies at low prices to huge audiences. Radio and television allowed the electronic duplication of information for the first time. Mass media had the economics of linear replication: a single work could make money. An example of Riel and Neil's theory. proportional to the number of copies sold, and as volumes went up, unit costs went down, increasing profit margins further. Vast fortunes were to be made in mass media. In a democratic society, the media can serve the electorate about issues regarding government and corporate entities (see Media influence). Some consider the concentration of media ownership to be a threat to democracy.\n\nBetween 1985 and 2018 about 76,720 deals have been announced in the Media industry. This sums up to an overall value of around 5,634 bil USD. There have been three major waves of M&A in the Mass Media Sector (2000, 2007 and 2015), while the most active year in terms of numbers was 2007 with around 3,808 deals. The U.S. is the most prominent country in Media M&A with 41 of the top 50 deals having an acquiror from the United States.\n\nThe largest deal in history was the acquisition of Time Warner by America Online Inc for 164,746.86 mil USD.\n\nLimited-effects theory, originally tested in the 1940s and 1950s, considers that because people usually choose what media to interact with based on what they already believe, media exerts a negligible influence. Class-dominant theory argues that the media reflects and projects the view of a minority elite, which controls it. Culturalist theory, which was developed in the 1980s and 1990s, combines the other two theories and claims that people interact with media to create their own meanings out of the images and messages they receive. This theory states that audience members play an active, rather than passive role in relation to mass media.\nIn an article entitled \"Mass Media Influence on Society\", rayuso argues that the media \"in the US\" is dominated by five major companies (Time Warner, VIACOM, Vivendi Universal, Walt Disney and News Corp) which own 95% of all mass media including theme parks, movie studios, television and radio broadcast networks and programing, video news, sports entertainment, telecommunications, wireless phones, video games software, electronic media and music companies. Whilst historically, there was more diversity in companies, they have recently merged to form an elite which have the power to shape the opinion and beliefs of people. People buy after seeing thousands of advertisements by various companies in TV, newspapers or magazines, which are able to affect their purchasing decisions. The definition of what is acceptable by society is dictated by the media. This power can be used for good, for example encouraging children to play sport. However, it can also be used for bad, for example children being influenced by cigars smoked by film stars, their exposure to sex images, their exposure to images of violence and their exposure to junk food ads. The documentary \"Super Size Me\" describes how companies like McDonald's have been sued in the past, the plaintiffs claiming that it was the fault of their liminal and subliminal advertising that \"forced\" them to purchase the product. The Barbie and Ken dolls of the 1950s are sometimes cited as the main cause for the obsession in modern-day society for women to be skinny and men to be buff. After the attacks of 9/11, the media gave extensive coverage of the event and exposed Osama Bin Laden's guilt for the attack, information they were told by the authorities. This shaped the public opinion to support the war on terrorism, and later, the war on Iraq. A main concern is that due to this immense power of the mass media (being able to drive the public opinion), media receiving inaccurate information could cause the public opinion to support the wrong cause.\n\nIn his book The Commercialization of American Culture, Matthew P. McAllister says that \"a well-developed media system, informing and teaching its citizens, helps democracy move toward its ideal state.\"\n\nIn 1997, J. R. Finnegan Jr. and K. Viswanath identified 3 main effects or functions of mass media:\n\nSince the 1950s, when cinema, radio and TV began to be the primary or the only source of information for a larger and larger percentage of the population, these media began to be considered as central instruments of mass control. Up to the point that it emerged the idea that when a country has reached a high level of industrialization, the country itself \"belongs to the person who controls communications.\"\n\nMass media play a significant role in shaping public perceptions on a variety of important issues, both through the information that is dispensed through them, and through the interpretations they place upon this information. They also play a large role in shaping modern culture, by selecting and portraying a particular set of beliefs, values, and traditions (an entire way of life), as reality. That is, by portraying a certain interpretation of reality, they shape reality to be more in line with that interpretation. Mass media also play a crucial role in the spread of civil unrest activities such as anti-government demonstrations, riots, and general strikes. That is, the use of radio and television receivers has made the unrest influence among cities not only by the geographic location of cities, but also by proximity within the mass media distribution networks.\n\nMass media sources, through theories like framing and agenda-setting, can affect the scope of a story as particular facts and information are highlighted (Media influence). This can directly correlate with how individuals may perceive certain groups of people, as the only media coverage a person receives can be very limited and may not reflect the whole story or situation; stories are often covered to reflect a particular perspective to target a specific demographic.\n\nAccording to Stephen Balkaran, an Instructor of Political Science and African American Studies at Central Connecticut State University, mass media has played a large role in the way white Americans perceive African-Americans. The media focus on African-American in the contexts of crime, drug use, gang violence, and other forms of anti-social behavior has resulted in a distorted and harmful public perception of African-Americans. African-Americans have been subjected to oppression and discrimination for the past few hundred years. According to Stephen Balkaran in his article \"Mass Media and Racism\": \"The media has played a key role in perpetuating the effects of this historical oppression and in contributing to African-Americans' continuing status as second-class citizens\". This has resulted in an uncertainty among white Americans as to what the genuine nature of African-Americans really is. Despite the resulting racial divide, the fact that these people are undeniably American has \"raised doubts about the white man's value system\". This means that there is a somewhat \"troubling suspicion\" among some Americans that their white America is tainted by the black influence. Mass media as well as propaganda tend to reinforce or introduce stereotypes to the general public.\n\nLack of local or specific topical focus is a common criticism of mass media. A mass news media outlet is often forced to cover national and international news due to it having to cater for and be relevant for a wide demographic. As such, it has to skip over many interesting or important local stories because they simply do not interest the large majority of their viewers. An example given by the website WiseGeek is that \"the residents of a community might view their fight against development as critical, but the story would only attract the attention of the mass media if the fight became controversial or if precedents of some form were set\".\n\nThe term \"mass\" suggests that the recipients of media products constitute a vast sea of passive, undifferentiated individuals. This is an image associated with some earlier critiques of \"mass culture\" and mass society which generally assumed that the development of mass communication has had a largely negative impact on modern social life, creating a kind of bland and homogeneous culture which entertains individuals without challenging them. However, interactive digital media have also been seen to challenge the read-only paradigm of earlier broadcast media.\n\nWhilst some refer to the mass media as \"opiate of the masses\", others argue that is a vital aspect of human societies. By understanding mass media, one is then able to analyse and find a deeper understanding of one's population and culture. This valuable and powerful ability is one reason why the field of media studies is popular. As WiseGeek says, \"watching, reading, and interacting with a nation's mass media can provide clues into how people think, especially if a diverse assortment of mass media sources are perused\".\n\nSince the 1950s, in the countries that have reached a high level of industrialization, the mass media of cinema, radio and TV have a key role in political power.\n\nContemporary research demonstrates an increasing level of concentration of media ownership, with many media industries already highly concentrated and dominated by a very small number of firms.\n\nCriticism\n\nWhen the study of mass media began the media was compiled of only mass media which is a very different media system than the social media empire of the 21st-century experiences. With this in mind, there are critiques that mass media no longer exists, or at least that it doesn't exist in the same form as it once did. This original form of mass media put filters on what the general public would be exposed to in regards to \"news\" something that is harder to do in a society of social media.\n\nTheorist Lance Bennett explains that excluding a few major events in recent history, it is uncommon for a group big enough to be labeled a mass, to be watching the same news via the same medium of mass production. Bennett's critique of 21st Century mass media argues that today it is more common for a group of people to be receiving different news stories, from completely different sources, and thus, mass media has been re-invented. As discussed above, filters would have been applied to original mass medias when the journalists decided what would or wouldn't be printed.\n\nSocial Media is a large contributor to the change from mass media to a new paradigm because through social media what is mass communication and what is interpersonal communication is confused. Interpersonal/niche communication is an exchange of information and information in a specific genre. In this form of communication, smaller groups of people are consuming news/information/opinions. In contrast, mass media in its original form is not restricted by genre and it is being consumed by the masses.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although it began in Russia, the project enjoys plenty of popularity in Poland, Romania, Hungary, Ukraine and Germany as well.\n\nUkrainian studio 4A Games had developed three titles set in the universe: \"Metro 2033\" (2010), \"\" (2013) and the upcoming \"\" (2019).\n\nAll of the \"Metro\" stories share the same setting – the fictional world of Glukhovsky's original novel. Although it described only his own vision of a post-apocalyptic Moscow, the books of the extended universe take place in a wide variety of different areas. Among these are: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Leningrad Oblast, Nizhny Novgorod, Tver Oblast, Moscow Oblast, Kola Peninsula, Rostov-on-Don, Samara, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, and the Kaliningrad oblast. Some of the books in the series are set in other locations outside of Russia, such as Ukraine, Belarus, United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, and Antarctica.\n\nA first-person shooter video game titled \"Metro 2033\" was created for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 gaming platforms. It was developed by 4A Games in Ukraine and published in March 2010 by THQ. A sequel, \"\", was released in May 2013 on Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Redux versions of the games were released in 2014, featuring updated graphics and gameplay with all previously released downloadable content bundled. The Metro Redux bundle was released for the PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. A third game, \"Metro Exodus\", is scheduled for release in 2019.\nThe \"Universe of Metro 2033\" () is a series of short stories, novellas, and novels, spanning a variety of genres ranging from post-apocalyptic action to romance, written by several different authors. Despite being written by various authors, the stories of the extended \"Metro\" series are all supported by Dmitry Glukhovsky and advertised on the official \"Metro\" website.\n\nMost of the written works of the series were originally released in Russia. Some books from the universe of \"Metro 2033\", like \"Piter\", \"Towards the Light\" and \"Into the Darkness\", have been translated to a number of European languages, such as German, Polish and Swedish. Prior to 2014 and the video games \"Metro 2033\" and \"\", no books in the series were released in a country where English is the prominent language.\n\nA graphic novel titled \"Metro 2033: Britannia Comic Prologue\" inspired by the prologue of the Metro 2033 novel \"Britannia\" was published in 2012. The story was written by Grant McMaster, the author of the novel and is illustrated by Benedict Hollis. It is available as a free download and unlike the novels it is in English rather than Russian.\n\nA \"Metro 2033\" board game based on the original novel was released in 2011. It was designed by Sergei Golubkin and was published by Hobby World. The Metro series is also being developed into films by Michael De Luca and Solipsist Films.\n\n"}

Written by Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn as \"Kitty\", it was first recorded by UK music group Racey during 1979 appearing on their debut album \"Smash and Grab\". Toni Basil changed the name from Kitty to Mickey to make the song about a man.\n\nToni Basil's version of the song was initially issued as a single in the UK in May 1981, but did not chart at that time. Reissued in January 1982, \"Mickey\" quickly became a substantial UK hit, reaching number 2. It was issued in Australia by April, where over the Northern summer (Southern winter) it rose to number 1.\n\nFinally issued in North America in August 1982, \"Mickey\" became a number 1 hit in the US and Canada in late 1982, a year and a half after its original release.\n\nThe original Racey song did not include the famous \"Oh Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine, you blow my mind\" chant, which Basil added.\n\nFor years, it had been rumored that the name was changed to Mickey because Basil had a crush on Monkees' drummer and lead vocalist Micky Dolenz after meeting him on the set of their movie \"Head\" for which she was the choreographer; however, this claim has been denied by Basil, who said she didn't know Dolenz that well.\n\nTwo different music videos for the song were recorded, one featuring Basil with a backing band, and another featuring costuming and choreography inspired by cheerleader dance routines. Filmed in 1981, the Cheerleader video is considered the very first choreographed dance video, and the opening stunt, where a cheerleader jumps through the center of a human pyramid, is now illegal in competition.\n\nRock critic Robert Christgau commented on the obscene content of the lyric \"So come on and give it to me / Any way you can / Any way you want to do it / I'll take it like a man\". Christgau wrote in a review at the time that Basil \"was the only woman ever to offer to take it up the ass on Top 40 radio.\" \n\nThe single scored number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for one week and number two in the UK Singles Chart. The song was Basil's only Top 40 success. It was named #5 on VH1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of All Time, #16 on \"20 to 1\"'s Top 20 One Hit Wonders Countdown and #57 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\". It has also appeared on multiple \"greatest\" or \"best\" lists and countdowns.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UK singer Lolly scored a top five hit in the UK Singles Chart in 1999. In addition, there is also a karaoke version of the cover on the album.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37769260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37769260", "title": "Multimedia translation", "text": "Multimedia translation\n\nMultimedia translation, also sometimes referred to as Audiovisual translation, is a specialized branch of translation which deals with the transfer of multimodal and multimedial texts into another language and/or culture. and which implies the use of a multimedia electronic system in the translation or in the transmission process.\n\nMultimedia translation can be applied to various fields, including cinema, television, theatre, advertisement, audiovisual and mobile device communication.\n\nAudiovisual text can be labeled as multimodal when produced and interpreted by applying a variety of semiotic resources or ‘modes’. When various modes, such as language, image, music, colour and perspective are combined together in different forms of media, with the major role attributed to the screen, audiovisual text can be described as multimedial.\n\nAn example of this, called multimodal transcription, is used in cinema. A film is broken down into frames, shots or phases. Every frame, shot or phase is analyzed, looking for all the semiotic modalities operating within each one.\n\nThe translation of multimedia creative works is a subject of academic research, a subtopic of translation studies. This interdisciplinary field draws from a wide range of theories, such as globalisation and post-globalisation theories, reception studies, relevance theory, social science and cultural studies, social psychology and deaf studies.\n\nThis kind of translation is strongly influenced, both in the form and in the substance of its creative process, by the process and type of device employed. Specific limits are imposed by digital graphics, and by timing and mode of use.\n\nDubbing, sometimes known as \"lip-synchrony\", involves both the translation and its synchronisation as well as dubbing the actors' and actresses' performance. Once considered the most comprehensive form of translation, dubbing follows the \"timing, phrasing and lip movement of the original dialogue\" as closely as possible. Although this mode is usually interlingual, there are some cases of intralingual dubbing, but it is not very common.\n\nThe most extensively studied mode of multimedia translation, subtitling is the linguistic practice showing written text on a screen that conveys \"a target language version of the source speech.\" Consisting of many sub-types, the one most commonly used is interlinguistic subtitling, which is usually displayed in open captions. In places where several languages are spoken, bilingual subtitles are used to show two different language versions of the source text at the same time.\n\nVoice over involves the original soundtrack and the translation being broadcast simultaneously. At the beginning, only the original can be heard, but the volume is lowered while the translated version becomes more noticeable until the end. This mode of multimedia translation gives a realistic effect, so it is usually used in documentaries or interviews. Voice over is considered a \"cheap alternative to dubbing\" so it is the first choice for translating films in former Communist states and some countries in the Middle East and Asia.\n\nInterpreting is \"the oral translation of an audiovisual product by only one speaker.\" Interpreting consists of many different types, such as simultaneous, live, consecutive or prerecorded. This mode is usually used in live interviews and news broadcasts.\n\nSurtitling is similar to subtitling, however it consists of one continuous line displayed with no interruption. Becoming more frequent in theatres and operahouses, the translation is displayed either above the stage or on the backs of seats. Despite being shown in real time, the translations are prepared in advance.\n\nFree commentary is the variation of an audiovisual source to an entirely new audience and the cultural factors or new goals involved. It is delivered with a spontaneous tone, so the end product is completely different from the original. There is generally no attempt to stay faithful to it, resulting in a translation that usually provides either more details or omissions. This mode of multimedia translation is generally used when literacy is not the main goal, such as in children's television shows, documentaries, humorous videos, film parodies and corporate videos.\n\nAlso known as \"half-dubbing\" or \"concise synchronisation\", consists of adding a prerecorded spoken text to the original soundtrack. While not being a full translation, it provides the necessary information in the target language.\n\nNarration consists of preparing, translating and condensing a text in advance which is then read by dubbing actors and actresses. The goal is to provide a faithful, scripted summary of the original speech. It can be pre-recorded or performed live. The difference between narration and dubbing is that the text is being read, not performed. Narration is also similar to voice over, but is different in that the final product is more condensed and is not always completely faithful to the original's style.\n\nAlso known as \"sight translation\", simultaneous translation is done on the spot from a prepared script in the target language. It is different from interpretation in that \"it takes this second foreign language as a pivot language\". It is used when more elaborate methods of audiovisual translation are not an option, due to time or funding constraints. As a result, it is only used in film festivals and film archives.\n\nAlso known as \"real-time subtitling\", it differs from regular subtitling in that the subtitles are not prerecorded and are instead inserted on the spot. This mode of multimedia of translation is used for live broadcasts for those who are hard of hearing. A \"respeaker\" takes the original sound and dialogue of a live program or event and \"respeaks\" it into a speech recognition software. This new version includes punctuation marks and specific features for this audience, which is then turned into subtitles with as little delay as possible.\n\nSDH is meant for those who have difficulty hearing the dialogue on a film or television show by helping them to \"see\" the sound. Although similar to subtitling, SDH adds additional information to complement the verbal dimension. Originally, these subtitles were only available for films and pre-recorded broadcasts. However, the \"growing number of legislative and regulatory provisions has set minimum quota requirements\" for broadcasters and subtitling companies.\n\nAD is meant for those who are blind, visually-impaired or partially-sighted and assists by providing a narration concerning the visual aspects of a film or television show, for example. The AD track does not interfere with the original dialogue since it is inserted during silent parts. The reader, known as an \"audio describer\", makes sure to balance what is necessary to the plot while not overwhelming the audience with excessive information. These particular descriptions would be recorded, but they can also be done live, (though still prepared in advance) such as in theatres. This mode of multimedia translation has become important in \"ensuring the accessibility of audiovisual products to the visually impaired.\"\n\nAnimation involves translation as well as script writing. The translator takes silent images, such as cartoons, and creates a script from scratch. Although similar to free commentary, it is different in that there is no previous script written in animation.\n\nDouble versions are products that involve two or more languages in which each actor and actress plays their role in their own language. The final product is then dubbed and synchronised so that there is only one language.\n\nRemakes contextualise a film so that they are in accordance with the target audience and its culture. These translations focus on values and ideology, so the linguistic aspect of the product is less of a priority. This mode of multimedia translation is mostly used for European films remade for American audiences.\n\nSince the late 1990s, multimedia translation has found a role in education. B.A and M.A. classes on this subject have been established at several universities across Europe and the United States (Boston, Dallas, Forlì, Genova, Leeds, Londra, Pisa, Pittsburgh, Torino, Udine, Barcelona, Vigo, Winterthur).\n"}
{"id": "565176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=565176", "title": "Narration", "text": "Narration\n\nNarration is the use of a written or spoken commentary to convey a story to an audience. Narration encompasses a set of techniques through which the creator of the story presents their story, including:\n\nA \"narrator\" is a personal character or a non-personal voice that the creator (author) of the story develops to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the plot. In the case of most written narratives (novels, short stories, poems, etc.), the narrator typically functions to convey the story in its entirety. The narrator may be a voice devised by the author as an anonymous, non-personal, or stand-alone entity; as the author as a character; or as some other fictional or non-fictional character appearing and participating within their own story. The narrator is considered \"participant\" if he/she is a character within the story, and \"non-participant\" if he/she is an implied character or an omniscient or semi-omniscient being or voice that merely relates the story to the audience without being involved in the actual events. Some stories have multiple narrators to illustrate the storylines of various characters at the same, similar, or different times, thus allowing a more complex, non-singular point of view.\n\nNarration encompasses not only \"who\" tells the story, but also \"how\" the story is told (for example, by using stream of consciousness or unreliable narration). In traditional literary narratives (such as novels, short stories, and memoirs), narration is a required story element; in other types of (chiefly non-literary) narratives, such as plays, television shows, video games, and films, narration is merely optional.\n\nNarrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told. It can be thought of as a camera mounted on the narrator's shoulder that can also look back inside the narrator's mind.\n\nWith the \"first-person\" point of view, a story is revealed through a narrator who is also explicitly a character within his or her own story. In a first person narrative, the narrator can create a close relationship between the reader and the writer. Therefore, the narrator reveals the plot by referring to this viewpoint character with forms of \"I\" (that is, the narrator is a person who openly acknowledges his or her own existence) or, when part of a larger group, \"we\". Frequently, the narrator is the protagonist, whose inner thoughts are expressed to the audience, even if not to any of the other characters. A conscious narrator, as a human participant of past events, is an incomplete witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. Forms include temporary first-person narration as a story within a story, wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character.\n\nThe \"second-person\" point of view is a point of view where the audience is made a character. This is done with the use of the pronouns \"you\", \"your\", and \"yours.\" The narrator is trying to address the audience, not necessarily directly, but rather to administer more of a connection. Stories and novels in second person are comparatively rare. Examples include the short fiction of Lorrie Moore and Junot Díaz. An example in contemporary literature is Jay McInerney's \"Bright Lights, Big City,\" in which the second-person narrator is observing his life from a distance as a way to cope with a trauma he keeps hidden from readers for most of the book.\n\"You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is entirely unfamiliar, although the details are fuzzy.\"—Opening lines of Jay McInerney's \"Bright Lights, Big City\" (1984)\n\nIn the \"third-person\" narrative mode, characters are referred to by the narrator as \"he\", \"she\", or \"they\", but never as \"I\" or \"we\" (first-person), or \"you\" (second-person). This makes it clear that the narrator is an unspecified entity or uninvolved person who conveys the story and is not a character of any kind within the story, or at least is not referred to as such.\n\nTraditionally, third-person narration is the most commonly used narrative mode in literature. It does not require that the narrator's existence be explained or developed as a particular character, as with a first-person narrator. It thus allows a story to be told without detailing any information about the teller (narrator) of the story. Instead, a third-person narrator is often simply some disembodied \"commentary\" or \"voice\", rather than a fully developed character. Sometimes, third-person narration is called the \"he/she\" perspective.\n\nThe third-person modes are usually categorized along two axes. The first is the subjectivity/objectivity axis, with \"third person subjective\" narration describing one or more character's personal feelings and thoughts, and \"third person objective\" narration not describing the feelings or thoughts of any characters but, rather, just the exact facts of the story. The second axis is the omniscient/limited axis, a distinction that refers to the knowledge held by the narrator. A \"third person omniscient\" narrator has, or seems to have, access to knowledge of all characters, places, and events of the story, including any given characters' thoughts; however, a \"third person limited \" narrator, in contrast, knows information about, and within the minds of, only a limited number of characters (often just one character). A limited narrator cannot describe anything outside of a focal character's particular knowledge and experiences.\n\nWhile the tendency for novels (or other narrative works) is to adopt a single point of view throughout the entire novel, some authors have experimented with other points of view that, for example, alternate between different narrators who are all first-person, or alternate between a first- and a third-person narrative perspective. The ten books of the \"\" adventure series, by D. J. MacHale, switch back and forth between a first-person perspective (handwritten journal entries) of the main character along his journey and the disembodied third-person perspective of his friends back home. Margaret Atwood's \"Alias Grace\" provides one character's viewpoint from first-person as well as another character's from third-person limited. Often, a narrator using the first person will try to be more objective by also employing the third person for important action scenes, especially those in which they are not directly involved or in scenes where they are not present to have viewed the events in firsthand. This mode is found in Barbara Kingsolver's \"The Poisonwood Bible\".\n\nAudrey Niffenegger's \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" is a love story, told in alternating first person. This novel alternates between an art student named Clare, and a librarian named Henry. Henry’s disorder called Chronic-Displacement causes him to be put in the wrong time. He is then put in emotional parts from his past and future, going back and forth in time. John Green & David Levithan's novel \"Will Grayson, Will Grayson\" rotates between two boys both named Will Grayson. It alternates between both boys telling their part of the story, how they meet and how their lives then come together. Nick Hornby's \"A Long Way Down\" has four narrators who also, are its main characters. These four characters meet at the top of a tall building known as “the suicide spot” and begin to talk instead of jumping. They then form a group, and continue to meet up.\n\nThe narrative voice is essential for story telling, because it's setting up the story for the reader, for example, by \"viewing\" a character's thought processes, reading a letter written for someone, retelling a character's experiences, etc.\n\nA \"stream of consciousness\" gives the (typically first-person) narrator's perspective by attempting to replicate the thought processes—as opposed to simply the actions and spoken words—of the narrative character. Often, interior monologues and inner desires or motivations, as well as pieces of incomplete thoughts, are expressed to the audience but not necessarily to other characters. Examples include the multiple narrators' feelings in William Faulkner's \"The Sound and the Fury\" and \"As I Lay Dying\", and the character Offred's often fragmented thoughts in Margaret Atwood's \"The Handmaid's Tale\". Irish writer James Joyce exemplifies this style in his novel \"Ulysses\".\n\nOne of the most common narrative voices, used especially with first- and third-person viewpoints, is the \"character voice\", in which a conscious \"person\" (in most cases, a living human being) is presented as the narrator; this character is called a \"viewpoint character\". In this situation, the narrator is no longer an unspecified entity; rather, the narrator is a more relatable, realistic character who may or may not be involved in the actions of the story and who may or may not take a biased approach in the storytelling. If the character is directly involved in the plot, this narrator is also called the viewpoint character. The viewpoint character is not necessarily the focal character: examples of supporting viewpoint characters include Doctor Watson, Scout in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and Nick Carraway of \"The Great Gatsby\".\n\nThe unreliable narrative voice involves the use of an untrustworthy narrator. This mode may be employed to give the audience a deliberate sense of disbelief in the story or a level of suspicion or mystery as to what information is meant to be true and what is meant to be false. The narrator of Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" for example, is significantly biased, unknowledgeable, ignorant, childish, or is perhaps purposefully trying to deceive the audience. Unreliable narrators are usually first-person narrators; however, a third-person narrator may be unreliable.\n\nThe \"epistolary narrative voice\" uses a (usually fictional) series of letters and other documents to convey the plot of the story. Although epistolary works can be considered multiple-person narratives, they also can be classified separately, as they arguably have no narrator at all—just an author who has gathered the documents together in one place. One example is Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein,\" which is a story written in a sequence of letters. Another is Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", which tells the story in a series of diary entries, letters and newspaper clippings. \"Les Liaisons dangereuses (Dangerous Liaisons), \"by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, is again made up of the correspondence between the main characters, most notably the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. Langston Hughes does the same thing in a shorter form in his story \"Passing\", which consists of a young man's letter to his mother.\n\nThe third-person narrative voices are narrative-voice techniques employed solely under the category of the third-person view.\n\nHistorically, the \"third-person omniscient\" (or simply \"omniscient\") perspective has been the most commonly used in narrative writing; it is seen in countless classic novels, including works by Charles Dickens, Leo Tolstoy, and George Eliot. A story in this narrative mode is presented by a narrator with an overarching point of view, seeing and knowing everything that happens within the world of the story, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling. It sometimes even takes a subjective approach. One advantage of omniscience is that this mode enhances the sense of objective reliability (that is, truthfulness) of the plot. The third-person omniscient narrator is the least capable of being unreliable – although the character of omniscient narrator can have its own personality, offering judgments and opinions on the behavior of the story characters.\n\nIn addition to reinforcing the sense of the narrator as reliable (and thus of the story as true), the main advantage of this mode is that it is eminently suited to telling huge, sweeping, epic stories, and/or complicated stories involving numerous characters. The disadvantage of this mode is the increased distance between the audience and the story, and the fact that – when used in conjunction with a sweeping, epic \"cast-of-thousands\" story – characterization tends to be limited, thus reducing the reader's ability to identify with or sympathize with the characters. A classic example of both the advantages and disadvantages of this mode is J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nThe \"third-person subjective\" is when the narrator conveys the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of one or more characters. If there is just one character, it can be termed \"third-person limited\", in which the reader is \"limited\" to the thoughts of some particular character (often the protagonist) as in the first-person mode, except still giving personal descriptions using \"he\", \"she\", \"it\", and \"they\", but not \"I\". This is almost always the main character (for example, Gabriel in James Joyce's \"The Dead\", Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"Young Goodman Brown\", or Santiago in Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea\"). Certain third-person omniscient modes are also classifiable as \"third person, subjective\" modes that switch between the thoughts and feelings of all the characters.\n\nThis style, in both its limited and omniscient variants, became the most popular narrative perspective during the 20th century. In contrast to the broad, sweeping perspectives seen in many 19th-century novels, third-person subjective is sometimes called the \"over the shoulder\" perspective; the narrator only describes events perceived and information known by a character. At its narrowest and most subjective scope, the story reads as though the viewpoint character were narrating it; dramatically this is very similar to the first person, in that it allows in-depth revelation of the protagonist's personality, but it uses third-person grammar. Some writers will shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, such as in Robert Jordan's \"The Wheel of Time\", or George R. R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\".\n\nThe focal character, protagonist, antagonist, or some other character's thoughts are revealed through the narrator. The reader learns the events of the narrative through the perceptions of the chosen character.\n\nThe \"third-person objective\" employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character's thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an objective, unbiased point of view. Often the narrator is self-dehumanized in order to make the narrative more neutral. This type of narrative mode, outside of fiction, is often employed by newspaper articles, biographical documents, and scientific journals. This narrative mode can be described as a \"fly-on-the-wall\" or \"camera lens\" approach that can only record the observable actions but does not interpret these actions or relay what thoughts are going through the minds of the characters. Works of fiction that use this style emphasize characters acting out their feelings observably. Internal thoughts, if expressed, are given voice through an aside or soliloquy. While this approach does not allow the author to reveal the unexpressed thoughts and feelings of the characters, it does allow the author to reveal information that not all or any of the characters may be aware of. A typical example of this so-called \"camera-eye perspective\" is \"Hills Like White Elephants\" by Ernest Hemingway.\n\nThis narrative mode is also called the \"third-person dramatic\" because the narrator, like the audience of a drama, is neutral and ineffective toward the progression of the plot—merely an uninvolved onlooker. It was also used around the mid-20th century by French novelists writing in the \"nouveau roman\" tradition.\n\nThe third person indirect style or free indirect style is a method of presenting a character's voice freely and spontaneously in the middle of an otherwise third-person non-personal narrator.\n\nMany stories, especially in literature, alternate between the third person limited and third person omniscient. In this case, an author will move back and forth between a more omniscient third-person narrator to a more personal third-person limited narrator. Typically, like the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series and the books by George R. R. Martin, a switch of third-person limited viewpoint on some character is done only at chapter boundaries. \"The Home and the World\", written in 1916 by Rabindranath Tagore, is another example of a book switching among just three characters at chapter boundaries. In \"The Heroes of Olympus\" series the point of view changes between characters at intervals.The \"Harry Potter\" series is told in \"third person limited\" (in which the reader is \"limited\" to the thoughts of some particular character) for much of the seven novels. However, it deviates to omniscient on occasions, particularly during the opening chapters of later novels in the series, which switch from the limited view of the eponymous Harry to other characters (for example, Snape).\n\nThe \"narrative tense\" or \"narrative time\" determines the grammatical tense of the story, meaning whether it is presented as occurring before, during, or after the time of narration, that is, in the past, present, or future. In narration using the past tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring before the time at which the narrative was constructed or expressed to an audience or before the present moment; this is by far the most common tense in which stories are expressed. In the present tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring now—at the current moment—in real time. In English, this tense, also known as the \"historical present\", is more common in spontaneous conversational narratives than in written literature, though it is sometimes used in literature to give a sense of immediacy of the actions. A recent example of novels narrated in the present tense are those of the \"Hunger Games\" trilogy by Suzanne Collins. The future tense is the most rare, portraying the events of the plot as occurring some time after the present moment, in a time-period yet to come. Often, these upcoming events are described such that the narrator has foreknowledge (or supposed foreknowledge) of the future, so many future-tense stories have a prophetic tone.\n\n\"Narration\" has more than one meaning. In its broadest sense, narration encompasses all forms of storytelling, fictional or not: personal anecdotes, \"true crime\", and historical narratives all fit here, along with many other non-fiction forms. More narrowly, however, the term \"narration\" refers to all written fiction. In its most restricted sense, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator communicates directly to the reader.\n\nAlong with exposition, argumentation, and description, narration (broadly defined) is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse. In the context of rhetorical modes, the purpose of narration is to tell a story or to narrate an event or series of events. Narrative may exist in a variety of forms: biographies, anecdotes, short stories, or novels. In this context, all written fiction may be viewed as narration.\n\nNarrowly defined, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. But if the broad definition of narration includes all written fiction, and the narrow definition is limited merely to that which is directly communicated to the reader, then what comprises the rest of written fiction? The remainder of written fiction would be in the form of any of the other fiction-writing modes. Narration, as a fiction-writing mode, is a matter for discussion among fiction writers and writing coaches.\n\nThe ability to use the different points of view is one measure of a person's writing skill. The writing mark schemes used for National Curriculum assessments in England reflect this: they encourage the awarding of marks for the use of viewpoint as part of a wider judgment.\n\nIn literature, \"person\" is used to describe the viewpoint from which the narrative is presented. Although second-person perspectives are occasionally used, the most commonly encountered are first and third person. \"Third person omniscient\" specifies a viewpoint in which readers are provided with information not available to characters within the story; without this qualifier, readers may or may not have such information.\n\nIn movies and video games first- and third-person describe camera viewpoints. The first-person is from a character's own perspective, and the third-person is the more familiar, \"general\" camera showing a scene. A so-called second-person may also be used to show a main character from a secondary character's perspective.\n\nFor example, in a horror film, the first-person perspective of an antagonist could become a second-person perspective on a potential victim's actions. A third-person shot of the two characters could be used to show the narrowing distance between them.\n\nIn video games, a first-person perspective is used most often in the first-person shooter genre, such as in \"Doom\", or in simulations (racing games, flight simulation games, and such). Third-person perspectives on characters are typically used in all other games. Since the arrival of 3D computer graphics in games it is often possible for the player to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at will; this is usually done to improve spatial awareness, but can also improve the accuracy of weapons use in generally third-person games such as the \"Metal Gear Solid\" franchise.\n\nText-based interactive fiction conventionally has descriptions written in the second person (though exceptions exist), telling the character what they are seeing and doing, such as Zork. This practice is also encountered occasionally in text-based segments of graphical games, such as those from Spiderweb Software which make ample use of second person flavor text in pop up text boxes with character and location descriptions. Charles Stross's novel Halting State was written in second person as an allusion to this style.\n\n\n"}

The industry directly employs more than 1.3 million and indirectly generates 1 million jobs in the US, creating a total job impact of 2.3 million.\n\nIn recent years, the use of this term has gained acceptance with and been popularized by amusement industry players, industry associations, trade magazines and even securities analysts. This stems from the desire to distinguish between the social, competitive atmosphere and dedicated hardware found in location-based entertainment venues from at-home consumer-game entertainment, mobile entertainment or even augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). The reality is that the lines are increasingly blurred with today's sophisticated consumers and emerging technologies.\n\nThis term is not to be confused with out-of-home media advertising as used by the advertising industry, although the convergence of digital out-of-home advertising and the digital out-of-home entertainment is producing innovations in retail and hospitality, steeped in fundamentals of social gaming experiences defined by the video amusement industry during the 70’s.\n\nDigital out-of-home entertainment (also DOE) is a sector that is understood by few but is a fast-growing technology sector with plenty of innovations transforming the sector. Its roots lie in the popularity of coin-operated arcade video games such as racing, fighting, Japanese imports, or pinball that Generation X will vividly recall with fond memories of countless hours of their youth spent in dimly-lit video-game rooms (popularly known as 'arcades').\n\nWhen Generation Y came along, an audience well-versed in digital gaming favored game consoles over arcade machines. So while video amusement remains an integral part of the popular culture fabric today, its relevancy is diminished and even perceived as 'dead' partly due to the lack of coverage by consumer-game media even as the amusement industry transformed itself and research and development investments continue to pour into the sector, evolving and growing the out-of-home, pay-to-play experience.\n\nIn 2011, the non-profit Digital Out-of-Home Interactive Entertainment Network Association was established to help \"define these amorphous groups that comprise this vibrant industry and illustrate how they all interact\" with groups spanning from \"family entertainment centers (FEC), location-based entertainment sites, visitor attractions, theme parks as well as retail, shopping malls and the hospitality sector – and not forgetting museums, heritage sites, schools\".\n\nMoviegoing is one of the most popular and affordable forms of out-of-home entertainment.\nOther classic and expanded forms of OOHE making up the DOE sector include:\n\nThe traditional FECs is a classic form of OOHE that is easily understood by the public. FECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of theme restaurants and the winning formula of combining food and entertainment as a business model has been around for more than 30 years. The first Dave & Buster's was opened in 1982 in Dallas, Texas after discovering this winning formula and is a highly-successful FEC chain today with their \"Eat, Drink, Play, Watch\" offerings. Chuck E. Cheese first opened a store in 1977 and became the public embodiment of the typical children's party room combined with a pizza restaurant and arcade. Other restaurants started to come round to seeing the importance of amusement games and \"anchor\" attractions (bowling alleys, miniature golf, laser tags, batting cages, roller skating rinks, etc.) to encourage dwell time of 1–2 hours and stimulating repeat visits.\n\nProbably known more by the blockbuster arcade video game titles they produced rather than by company names, these video game developers played a defining role in the birth of the video amusement industry. In 1972, Atari essentially created the first commercially successful video game \"Pong,\" marking the beginning of the coin-operated video game industry. In 1978, the first blockbuster arcade video game, \"Space Invaders\" was produced by Taito Corporation and ushered in the golden age of arcade video games. Namco (of \"Pac-Man\"'s fame), Nintendo (\"Donkey Kong\"), Konami (), Capcom (\"Street Fighters\"), Sega AM2 (\"Daytona\") are among some of the most notable video game developers that remain active today in the video amusement scene.\n\nVideo game publishers are also making inroads into the OOHE market by licensing iconic IPs (intellectual property) to experienced arcade game developers and manufacturers, such as the recent collaboration between Ubisoft and LAI Games to produce \"Virtual Rabbids: The Big Ride\", an attendant-free VR attraction based on the popular \"Rabbids\" franchise.\n\nA redemption game is an arcade amusement game involving skill that rewards the player (in gifts, tokens, etc.) proportionately to his or her score. (Merchandizers also fall in the redemption game category.) One of the most popular redemption games, \"Skee Ball\", has more than 100,000 Skee-Ball branded alley games in use worldwide by some estimates and continue to endure after more than a century. In 2016, BayTek Games (known for their hit game \"Big Bass Wheel\") bought the rights to \"Skee-Ball\" from Skee-Ball Amusement Games, Inc. Innovative Concepts in Entertainment (ICE), another reputable manufacturer, produced hit midway-style redemption games such as \"Down The Clown\" and \"Gold Fishin\". LAI Games (formerly part of the Leisure and Allied Industries Group which founded Timezone) produced hit games such as \"Stacker\" and \"Speed of Light,\" the latter in which was embedded in popular culture with its appearance in Nickelodeon TV show Game Shakers.\n\nOther notable players include Apple Industries, Inc., Coastal Amusements, Universal Space (UNIS), Adrenaline Amusements.\n\nAnother category of video amusement games are simulators. Raw Thrills, best known for developing arcade video games based on films such as \"Jurassic Park Arcade\" and \"AMC's The\" \"Walking Dead\" \"Arcade\", is a common name found in medium and larger-sized FECs. Other established companies in this category are Triotech, maker of \"Typhoon\" - a 3D arcade machine with 2 seats and delivers up to 2G Forces of acceleration, and CJ 4DPLEX with their \"Mini Rider 3D\" - a 2-seat simulator on an electric motion base with a choice of several 3D movies.\n"}

{"id": "517874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=517874", "title": "Punch line", "text": "Punch line\n\nA punch line (punch-line or punchline) concludes a joke; it is intended to make people laugh. It is the third and final part of the typical joke structure. It follows the introductory framing of the joke and the narrative which sets up for the punch line.\n\nIn a broader sense, punch line can also refer to the unexpected and funny conclusion of any performance, situation or story.\n\nThe origin of the term is unknown. Even though the comedic formula using the classic \"set-up, premise, punch line\" format was well-established in Vaudeville by the beginning of the 20th century, the actual term \"punch line\" is first documented in the 1920s; the Merriam-Webster dictionary pegs the first use in 1921. Some people argue the term's origin is related to the British weekly magazine \"Punch\".\n\nM-Husler was the first person to come with a punch line in 1986.\n\nA linguistic interpretation of the mechanics of the punch line response is posited by Victor Raskin in his Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor. Humor is evoked when a trigger, contained in the punch line, causes the audience to abruptly shift its understanding of the story from the primary (or more obvious) interpretation to a secondary, opposing interpretation. \"The punch line is the pivot on which the joke text turns as it signals the shift between the [semantic] scripts necessary to interpret [re-interpret] the joke text.\" To produce the humor in the verbal joke, the two interpretations (i.e. scripts) need to be both compatible with the joke text \"and\" opposite or incompatible with each other. Thomas R. Shultz, a psychologist, independently expands Raskin’s linguistic theory to include \"two stages of incongruity: perception and resolution.\" He explains that \"… incongruity alone is insufficient to account for the structure of humour. […] Within this framework, humour appreciation is conceptualized as a biphasic sequence involving first the discovery of incongruity followed by a resolution of the incongruity.\" Resolution generates laughter.\n\nThere are many folk theories of how people deliver punchlines, such as punchlines being louder and of a higher pitch than the speech preceding it, and a dramatic pause before the punchline is delivered. In laboratory settings, however, none of these changes are employed at a statistically significant level in the production of humorous narratives. Rather, the pitch and loudness of the punchline are comparable to those of the ending of any narrative, humorous or not.\n\nIn order to better elucidate the structure and function of the punch line it is useful to look at some joke forms which purposely remove or avoid the punch line in their narrative. Shaggy dog stories are long-winded anti-jokes in which the punch line is deliberately anti-climactic. The humor here lies in fooling the audience into expecting a typical joke with a punch line. Instead they listen and listen to nothing funny, and end up themselves as the butt of the joke.\n\nAnother type of anti-joke is the nonsense joke, defined as having \"a surprising or incongruous punch line\" which provides either no resolution at all, or only a partial, unsatisfactory resolution. One example of this is the no soap radio punch line. Here the anticipated resolution to the joke is absent and the audience becomes the butt of the joke.\n\nA joke contains a single story with a single punch line at the end. In the analysis of longer humorous texts, an expanded model is needed to map the narratological structure. With this in mind, the General Theory of Verbal Humor (GTVH) was expanded to include longer humorous texts together with jokes, using the GTVH narrative structure to categorize them. A new term, \"jab line\", was introduced to designate humor within the body of a text, as opposed to the punch line, which is always placed at the end. The jab line is functionally identical to the punch line except it can be positioned anywhere within the text, not just at the end. \"Jab and punch lines are semantically indistinguishable (…), but they differ at a narratological level.\" Additionally, \"jab lines are humorous elements fully integrated in the narrative in which they appear (i.e. they do not disrupt the flow of the narrative, because they either are indispensable to the development of the 'plot' or of the text, or they are not antagonistic to it)\".\n\nUsing the expanded narrative structure of the GTVH and this new terminology of jab lines, literature and humor researchers now have a single theoretical framework with which they can analyze and map any kind of verbal humor, including novels, short stories, TV sitcoms, plays, movies as well as jokes.\n\nFelicitous jokes are often formatted in a style called AAB, where a joke is made up of a set of three, the first two of which share some common attribute, and the third represents a deviation from that attribute. Under these conditions, the third item in the set— the B— is the punchline.\n\nRozin gives the following example as exemplifying this structure:\n\nAccording to this theory, the punchline is always the deviation, and it does not matter how many instances of A occur for there to be a punchline. However, jokes following the AAB structure are consistently rated as being funnier than their AB or AAAB counterparts.\n\n"}
{"id": "49275846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49275846", "title": "React (media franchise)", "text": "React (media franchise)\n\nReact (sometimes stylized in all caps as REACT) is a media franchise used by the Fine Brothers consisting of several online series centering on a group of individuals reacting to viral videos, trends, video games, film trailers, or music videos. React was also the first react channel on YouTube. The franchise was launched with the YouTube debut of \"Kids React\" in October 2010, and then grew to encompass four more series uploaded on the Fine Brothers' primary YouTube channel, a separate YouTube channel with various reaction-related content, as well as a television series titled \"React to That\".\n\nIn 2016, the duo announced \"React World\", a program and channel in which they would license the format of their \"React\" shows to creators, which led to widespread negative reception from viewers and fellow content creators, as well as confusion about what their format is. This eventually lead to the Fine Brothers to removing all videos related to \"React World\", essentially pulling the plug on the \"React World\" program.\n\nBenny and Rafi Fine launched a series titled \"Kids React\" on October 16, 2010, the first video being \"Kids React to Viral Videos (\"Double Rainbow\", Obama Fail, Twin Rabbits, Snickers Halloween)\". The \"Kids React\" series features The Fine Brothers, off-camera, showing kids ages 4–14 (7-13 as of September 2016, 7-11 as of October 2016) several viral videos or popular YouTubers and having the kids react to the videos.\n\nThe most popular \"Kids React\" episode to date is “Kids React to Gay Marriage\", with over 40.2 million views as of September 2, 2018. The popularity of \"Kids React\" made it possible for the online series to win a special Emmy Award at the 39th Daytime Emmy Awards in 2012. The Emmy Award, that was given in cooperation with AOL, was awarded to the Fine Brothers for \"Best Viral Video Series\". After their Emmy win, the brothers stated, \"Not a lot has changed [after winning the Emmy] other than realizing that there are shows on YouTube like \"React\" that can get similar if not better viewership than mainstream entertainment can.\"\n\nVideos and YouTube stars that have been reacted to by the kids include Smosh (who later reacted to the kids' reactions), planking and President Obama addressing the death of Osama bin Laden, among several other topics. \"Kids React\" has been compared to \"Kids Say the Darndest Things\". In October 2012, the kids of the show were shown videos of the 2012 U.S. Presidential debates. \"Kids React\" won the Streamy Award for Best Non-Fiction or Reality Series in 2013.\n\nDue to the popularity of \"Kids React\", The Fine Brothers spawned a spin-off dubbed \"Teens React\" on November 17, 2011 with \"TEENS REACT TO TWILIGHT\". The show has a similar premise to \"Kids React\", however the younger stars are replaced with teens, some of whom have aged out of the \"Kids React\" series. Due to this, the Fine Brothers are able to show more mature and less \"kid-friendly\" videos such as videos on topics like \"Toddlers & Tiaras\", Rick Perry's \"Strong\" commercial, Amanda Todd's death, and the 2012 U.S. Presidential debates. Other viral videos and YouTube stars that have been reacted to include \"Salad Fingers\", the \"Overly Attached Girlfriend\", \"Gangnam Style\", \"The Hunger Games\" trailer, Shane Dawson, and One Direction, among other topics. Later on The Fine Brothers launched a series named \"Teens React: Gaming\" consisting videos of teens reacting to popular games such as \"Mario Kart 64, Flappy Bird\", and \"Rocket League\". Teens React launched the career of Lia Marie Johnson and also featured some \"famous\" 'reactors' as guest stars, including Lisa Cimorelli, Amy Cimorelli, Lucas Cruikshank (who later appears in Youtubers React), Alex Steele, Jake Short, and Maisie Williams.\n\nThe popularity of \"Kids React\" and \"Teens React\" spawned \"Elders React\" on May 24, 2012 with \"ELDERS REACT TO NYAN CAT\". The Elders React series replaces young children and teenagers with the elderly, including Benny and Rafi's father, Yehuda. Initially starting with topics that have been discussed on the other \"React\" series, they currently discuss about topics that appeals to today's 21st century society such as violent video games and music videos.\n\nThe first episode of \"YouTubers React\" premiered December 6, 2012. The first episode was \"YouTubers React to Viral Videos Ep. #1\". Several notable YouTubers have appeared on the series. Tay Zonday, Rebecca Black and Liam Kyle Sullivan have each reacted to one of their own videos, \"Chocolate Rain,\" \"Friday\" and \"Shoes\" respectively.\n\nOn May 30, 2015, the Fine Brothers announced \"Adults React\", which premiered on July 16 later that year. It consists of people ages 20 to 55, including former stars of \"Teens React\" that have aged out of the series. Depending on the video or topic, \"Adults React\" will be specific of which type of adults are going to be reacting, such as parents or young adults.\n\nThe first episode of \"College Kids React\" premiered on June 23, 2016 with \"College Kids React to The 1975\". This series includes stars who have aged out of \"Teens React\" alongside new stars, as well as stars that have not yet aged out of \"Teens React\" but have begun college. The content of \"College Kids React\" is similar to the content found in \"Teens React\".\n\nIn April 2014, as an April Fool's joke, the Fine Brothers teamed up with Friskies and released \"Cats React\", which went viral. In July 2016 they released another part of \"Cats React\".\n\nIn August 2014, they released \"Celebrities React to Viral Videos\".\n\nIn April 2018, an another April Fools’s joke, they released ‘’Teens React to Nothing’’ where they showed teens a blank screen.\n\nAfter creating four individual successful \"React\" series on their primary YouTube channel, the Fine Brothers launched a separate YouTube channel in 2014, for reaction-related content, simply dubbed \"React\". With the intent of running programming five days a week, the channel launched with five series: \"Games\" (a Let's Play style series with cast members from their primary \"React\" series), \"Advice\" (a series featuring cast members respond to questions from viewers), \"React Remix\" (musical remixes of past \"React\" footage), \"People Vs. Foods\" (a series featuring Reactors taste test \"Weird\" or international foods), and \"Lyric Breakdown\" (a series in which Reactors break down the meaning of various songs). The channel launched with a teen-centered playthrough of \"Goat Simulator\". Similar to the teens, the elders also have played and reacted to video games such as \"Grand Theft Auto V\", \"\" and \"\". Kids and Adults also played and reacted to video games too.\n\nIn early 2014, it was announced that the Fine Brothers made a deal with Ncredible Entertainment, a production studio founded by Nick Cannon to develop a television series for Nickelodeon. The series, dubbed \"React to That\", was \"entirely re-envisioned for television,\" as the reactors \"not only watch and respond to viral videos, but pop out of the reaction room and into showdowns where the clips come to life as each reactor is confronted with a challenge based on the video they just watched.\" Following the announcement of the series, Benny Fine stated, \"All these viewers now watching are also pioneering what it is to be a viewer of content. They follow us through all of our different endeavors, all our different series, and now will have the opportunity to follow us to another medium.\" Nickelodeon ordered 13 episodes to be produced, but only 12 were made and aired.\n\nIn July 2015, the Fine Brothers filed for trademark protection on \"React\" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The trademark was filed for \"Entertainment services, namely, providing an ongoing series of programs and webisodes via the internet in the field of observing and interviewing various groups of people.\" The USPTO approved for a 30-day opposition period which was set to begin on February 2, 2016; if no parties filed an opposition to the Fines' trademark request, it would have proceeded through the process. The brothers had previously filed for and been granted trademark registrations for \"Elders React\" and \"Teens React\" in 2013 as well as \"Kids React\" in 2012.\n\nOn January 26, 2016, the Fines announced that they would be launching React World, a way to grant content creators the license to create their own versions of the \"React\" shows. Specifically, the Fine Brothers stated they are licensing the format of their \"React\" shows. A \"Variety\" report detailed that React World would \"aggregate videos in a channel to launch later this year to promote, support and feature fan-produced programming based on their shows.\" The brothers' company, Fine Brothers Entertainment (FBE) stated they would be working with YouTube and ChannelMeter on the launch of React World. FBE also expressed they would be able to monetize \"React\"-style videos uploaded under their license. On monetization, \"Digital Trends\" detailed \"Although licenses are free, React World creators must agree to share 20 percent of AdSense revenue and 30 percent of premium brand deals with FBE.\" Additionally, the Fines stated they will provide ongoing production guidance, creative guidelines, format bibles, and other resources, as well as promotional and technical support to those creators who participated with the brothers on React World.\n\nAlthough YouTube's VP on content partnerships, Kelly Merryman, originally proclaimed \"This is brand-building in the YouTube age — rising media companies building their brands through collaborations with creators around the world,\" the Fine Brothers were met with overwhelmingly negative reception to their React World announcement. \"BBC News\" reported that \"critics of the Fine Brothers have expressed concern they may use the trademarks to stifle competition,\" and quoted one YouTuber who detailed \"People don't trust them because a few years ago when Ellen DeGeneres did a similar video—not that similar, it didn't have the same format or branding—they claimed it was their format.\" Viewers and fellow content creators alike condemned the Fines for their announcement, with \"The Daily Dot\" reporting, \"Backlash poured in on Reddit and social media, and other YouTubers posted their own reactions and parodies of the enthusiastically corporate React World announcement video.\" The backlash led to a dramatic drop in subscribers, with upwards of 675,000 accounts collectively unsubscribing from the React and Fine Bros Entertainment channels as well as recent videos getting many dislikes in protest as of February 22, 2016. \"Mashable\" described that one Reddit post \"ignited a thread of haters, defenders and overall discussion about whether what Fine Brothers Entertainment is doing is fair.\" Ryan Morrison, a gamer, lawyer and Reddit user, declared that he would file a legal challenge to the Fine Brothers' trademark request on \"React\", writing \"These guys didn’t come up with the idea of filming funny reactions from kids. And they certainly don’t own an entire genre of YouTube videos. It wasn’t their idea, and it’s not theirs to own or police.\"\n\nThough there was an overwhelmingly negative response to the React World announcement, other personalities expressed milder opinions; Internet personality Hank Green wrote \"this could actually be a very cool project if it could be divorced from the idea of two very powerful creators attempting to control a very popular YouTube video format. Franchising one of YouTube's biggest shows? Yeah, I’d love to see how that goes.\" \"New York\" reporter Jay Hathaway wrote \"The trademark and React World are dead. And that's a shame, because it was an interesting idea that suffered from tone-deaf execution.\"\n\nAfter seeing the initial backlash from their announcement, The Fine Brothers posted comments on various social media websites including Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and the comment section of their YouTube announcement video. On Facebook the Fines wrote, \"We do not own the idea or copyright for reaction videos overall, nor did we ever say we did. You don’t need anyone’s permission to make these kinds of videos, and we’re not coming after anyone,\" adding \"We are in no way claiming reaction content in general is our intellectual property. This is purely a voluntary program for people wanting direct support from us, and we continue to be so excited to work with all of you who may want to participate.\" They additionally tweeted \"We're not saying we hold a copyright on reaction videos overall, no one can. We're licensing our specific shows, like TV has done for years.\" The brothers also stated they would \"not be trying to take revenue from other types of reaction videos, and will not be copyright-striking.\" However, other YouTubers have reported multiple copyright related video takedowns. \"The Guardian\" also reported that unrelated channels featuring other groups of people reacting to videos were also removed after takedown requests from the Fine Brothers; the \"Seniors React\" video was noted to be released prior to the Fines launching their \"Elders React\" series. The Fines also posted an update video in response to what they described as \"confusion and negative response\" to React World, in which they try to clear up confusion on what their format encompasses, as well as inviting viewers to e-mail them about any further questions.\n\nUltimately, the Fine Brothers removed all React World videos, and posted a statement on \"Medium\", declaring they have filed the paperwork to rescind all their \"React\" trademarks and applications, will discontinue the React World program, and will release all past Content ID claims. In their post, the brothers expressed \"It makes perfect sense for people to distrust our motives here, but we are confident that our actions will speak louder than these words moving forward.\" Reaction to this \"Medium\" post was negative on Reddit, where users were reported commenting they would not forgive the Fine Brothers.\n\n"}

It can be called \"cinema in silhouette\". Performers are titled as a shadowgraphist or shadowgrapher.\n\nThe art has declined since the late 19th century when electricity became available to homes because light bulbs and electric lamps do not give off good shadows and because cinema and television were becoming a new form of entertainment. Shadows are greatly defined by candlelight; therefore hand shadows were common in earlier centuries.\n\nThe modern art of hand shadows was made popular by the French entertainer Félicien Trewey in the 19th century. He popularized the art by making silhouettes of famous personalities.\n\nSince shadows have existed since the existence of objects obstructing light, it is hard to say when the art was first used by humans for entertainment. It could have been practiced by ancient or later humans, but it probably originated in the Far East. The French entertainer Félicien Trewey was interested in the art of Chinese shadow puppetry called Ombres Chinoises, which means \"Chinese shadows\". He popularized the art of hand shadows when he developed shadows of famous silhouettes. It then became popular in Europe in the 19th century.\n\nAlthough the art is popular amongst different kinds of entertainers it seems prominent amongst magicians, because it was popularized by a magician who inspired many other magicians. Félicien Trewey perfected the widely known elephant, bird, and cat hand shadows and created some of his own such as The Volunteer, Robinson Crusoe, The Jockey, The Rope Dancer and more. In 1889, Trewey joined with Alexander Herrmann who most likely learned it from him. David Tobias Bamberg most likely learned it from Alexander who then passed it down to his son Okito (Tobias Leendert Bamberg) who then passed it down to \"his\" son Fu Manchu (David Theodore Bamberg). Fu Manchu passed his skill to Marcelo Contento, one of his apprentices, who became famous worldwide for it. Contento died before he could pass it on to his son.\n\nOther magicians who used hand shadows in their act include David Devant, Edward Victor, and the duo Holden and Graham in which Holden was famous for his \"Monkey in the Belfry\" shadow.\n\nThe hands and fingers are exercised and different finger positions are practiced to help aid in forming shadows.\n\nThe light source to be used should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light proceeding from the smallest possible point. Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, \"Modern Conjuring For Amateurs\", that the best source of light is the electric arc, which Almoznino agrees to the small arc lamp, and the second best being the limelight (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists is the use of acetylene gas (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or carbide lamp). Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.\n\nAlbert Almoznino suggests to use a white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of muslin or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a rear projection screen, but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.\n\nThe performer sits or stands between the light source and the blank surface, while having the option to perform in front of the performance surface or behind it, with each having different advantages. The performer has another option to perform from the left or the right of the light source. The farther the hands are from the light, the smaller the shadows will be, while the closer the hands are to the light, the larger the shadows will be. Also, the closer the hands are to the blank surface, the sharper the shadows will be. Trewey suggests that the most convenient distance for the light from the hands is four feet while the hands from the performance surface should be about six feet. The performer should always watch their shadows instead of their hands.\n\nMovement helps give the shadows character and brings them to life. Some shadows are performed with accessories attached to the hands or fingers to achieve movements or images not applicable to hands alone.\n\n\n"}

The term is sometimes used only for those clothes which are specially made for the stage performance by a costume designer or picked out by a costume coordinator. Theatrical costumes can help actors portray characters' age, gender role, profession, social class, personality, and even information about the historical period/era, geographic location and time of day, as well as the season or weather of the theatrical performance. Stage clothes may be used to portray a historical look or they can be used to exaggerate some aspect of a character.\n\nAny clothing used by performers (singers, actors, or dancers) on stage may be referred to as stage clothes. More specifically, the term is sometimes used only for those clothes which are specially made for the stage performance by a costume designer or picked out by a costume coordinator. However, many performers also pick up regular clothes and make them their \"trademark look\" on stage.\n\nIn combination with other aspects, theatrical costumes can help actors portray characters' age, gender role, profession, social class, personality, and even information about the historical period/era, geographic location and time of day, as well as the season or weather of the theatrical performance. Often, stylized theatrical costumes can exaggerate some aspect of a character; for example Harlequin and Pantaloon in the traditional commedia dell'arte.\n\nUsually, in costume, historical accuracy is combined with a certain vision. The character that the costumer is dressing is also an important aspect, and a lot of the time the attitudes of the character is not exactly in line with the time period. For example, they may be more bright and colorful, or they may be more dull. A movie or stage production which emphasize the use of correct clothes and settings for a specific time period is called a costume drama.\n\nStage clothes often follow the evolving fashion but in a more extravagant way. Clothes worn by popular performers can often spark new fashions by themselves, as fans of performers want to look like their idols.\n\n"}
{"id": "236424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236424", "title": "Street performance", "text": "Street performance\n\nStreet performance or busking is the act of performing in public places for gratuities. In many countries the rewards are generally in the form of money but other gratuities such as food, drink or gifts may be given. Street performance is practiced all over the world and dates back to antiquity. People engaging in this practice are called street performers or buskers.\n\nPerformances are anything that people find entertaining. Performers may do acrobatics, animal tricks, balloon twisting, caricatures, clowning, comedy, contortions, escapology, dance, singing, fire skills, flea circus, fortune-telling, juggling, magic, mime, living statue, musical performance, puppeteering, snake charming, storytelling or reciting poetry or prose, street art such as sketching and painting, street theatre, sword swallowing, and ventriloquism.\n\nThe term \"busking\" was first noted in the English language around the middle 1860s in Great Britain. The verb \"to busk\", from the word \"busker\", comes from the Spanish root word \"buscar\", with the meaning \"to seek\". The Spanish word \"buscar\" in turn evolved from the Indo-European word \"*bhudh-skō\" (\"to win, conquer\"). It was used for many street acts, and title of a famous Spanish book about one of them, \"El Buscón\". Today, the word is still used in Spanish but mostly relegated for female street sex workers, or women seeking to be set up as private mistress of married men.\n\nThere have been performances in public places for gratuities in every major culture in the world, dating back to antiquity. For many musicians street performance was the most common means of employment before the advent of recording and personal electronics. Prior to that, a person had to produce any music or entertainment, save for a few mechanical devices such as the barrel organ, the music box, and the piano roll. Organ grinders were commonly found busking in the old days.\n\nBusking is common among some Romani people. Romantic mention of Romani music, dancers and fortune tellers are found in all forms of song poetry, prose and lore. The Roma brought the word busking to England by way of their travels along the Mediterranean coast to Spain and the Atlantic Ocean and then up north to England and the rest of Europe.\n\nIn medieval France buskers were known by the terms troubadours and \"jongleurs\". In northern France they were known as trouveres. In old German buskers were known as Minnesingers and \"Spielleute\". In obsolete French it evolved to \"busquer\" for \"seek, prowl\" and was generally used to describe prostitutes. In Russia buskers are called skomorokh and their first recorded history appears around the 11th century.\n\nMariachis, Mexican bands that play a style of music by the same name, frequently busk when they perform while traveling through streets and plazas, as well as in restaurants and bars.\n\nAround the mid-19th century Japanese \"Chindonya\" started to be seen using their skills for advertising, and these street performers are still occasionally seen in Japan. Another Japanese street performance form dating from the Edo period is Nankin Tamasudare, in which the performer creates large figures using a bamboo mat.\n\nIn the United States, medicine shows proliferated in the 19th century. They were traveling vendors selling elixirs and potions to improve the health. They would often employ entertainment acts as a way of making the clients feel better. The people would often associate this feeling of well-being with the products sold. After these performances they would \"pass the hat\".\n\nOne-man bands have historically performed as buskers playing a variety of instruments simultaneously. One-man bands proliferated in urban areas in the 19th and early 20th centuries and still perform to this day. A current one-man band plays all their instruments acoustically usually combining a guitar, a harmonica, a drum and a tambourine. They may also include singing. Many still busk but some are booked to play at festivals and other events.\n\nFolk music has always been an important part of the busking scene. Cafe, restaurant, bar and pub busking is a mainstay of this art form. Two of the more famous folk singers are Woody Guthrie and Joan Baez. The delta bluesmen were mostly itinerant musicians emanating from the Mississippi Delta region of the USA around the early 1940s and on. B.B. King is one famous example who came from these roots.\n\nThe counterculture of the hippies of the 1960s occasionally staged \"be-ins\", which resembled some present-day busker festivals. Bands and performers would gather at public places and perform for free, passing the hat to make money. The San Francisco Bay Area was at the epicenter of this movement – be-ins were staged at Golden Gate Park and San Jose's Bee Stadium and other venues. Some of the bands that performed in this manner were Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Country Joe and the Fish, Moby Grape and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nChristmas caroling can also be a form of busking, as wassailing included singing for alms, wassail or some other form of refreshment such as figgy pudding. In Ireland the traditional Wren Boys and in England Morris Dancing can be considered part of the busking tradition.\n\nIn India and Pakistan's Gujarati region Bhavai is a form of street art where there are plays enacted in the village, the barot or the village singer also is part of the local entertainment scene.\n\nIn the 2000s, some performers have begun \"Cyber Busking\". Artists post work or performances on the Internet for people to download or \"stream\" and if people like it they make a donation using PayPal.\n\nThere are three basic forms of street performance\n\n\"Circle shows\" are shows that tend to gather a crowd around them. They usually have a distinct beginning and end. Usually these are done in conjunction with street theatre, puppeteering, magicians, comedians, acrobats, jugglers and sometimes musicians. Circle shows can be the most lucrative. Sometimes the crowds attracted can be very large. A good busker will control the crowd so the patrons do not obstruct foot traffic.\n\n\"Walk-by acts\" are typically where the busker performs a musical, living statue or other act that does not have a distinct beginning or end and the public usually watch for a brief time. A walk by act may turn into a circle show if the act is unusual or very popular.\n\n\"Stoplight performers\" present their act and get contributions from vehicle occupants on a crosswalk while the traffic lights are red. A variety of disciplines can be used in such format (juggling, break dancing, even magic tricks). Because of the short period of time available to them, stoplight performers must have a very brief, condensed routine. This form is seen more commonly in Central and South America than elsewhere.\n\nBuskers collect donations and tips from the public in a variety of containers and by different methods depending on the type of busking they are performing. For walk by acts their instrument case or a special can or box is often used. For circle shows the performer will typically collect money at the end of the show, although some performers will also collect during the show to ensure all audience members have had a chance to show appreciation for their skills. Sometimes a performer will employ a \"bottler\", \"hat man\", or \"pitch man\" to collect money from the audience. The term \"bottler\" is a British term which originated following the use of the top half of a bottle to collect money. The bottle had a leather flap inserted in the bottle neck and a leather pouch attached. This design allowed coins to be put in the bottle but not allow them to be removed easily without the coins jingling against the glass. The first use of such contrivances was recorded by the famous Punch and Judy troupe of puppeteers in early Victorian times. Bottling itself can be an art form, and the difference between a good and a bad bottler can be crucial to the amount of money earned on a pitch. A good bottler is able to encourage audience members to give money. A bottler usually gets a cut of the money made on the pitch. Prior to the 20th century, it was common for buskers to use a trained monkey as a bottler. That practice has diminished or ceased in many countries due to changes in social attitudes and animal control laws. However some modern buskers use a device known as monkey stick which is a long stick with bottle caps or small cymbals attached to make a noise before a show or prior to making a collection.\n\nThe place where a performance occurs is called a \"pitch\". A good pitch can be the key to success as a busker. An act that might make money at one place and time may not work at all in another setting. Popular pitches tend to be public places with large volumes of pedestrian traffic, high visibility, low background noise and as few elements of interference as possible. Good locations may include tourist spots, popular parks, entertainment districts including lots of restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs and theaters, subways and bus stops, outside the entrances to large concerts and sporting events, almost any plaza or town square as well as zócalos in Latin America and piazzas in other regions. Other places include shopping malls, strip malls, and outside supermarkets, although permission is usually required from management for these.\n\nIn her book, \"Underground Harmonies: Music and Politics in the Subways of New York\", Susie J. Tanenbaum examined how the adage \"Music hath charms to soothe the savage beast\" plays out in regards to busking. Her sociological studies showed that in areas where buskers regularly perform, crime rates tended to go down, and that those with higher education attainment tended to have a more positive view of buskers than did those of lesser educational attainment. Some cities encourage busking in particular areas, giving preference to city government-approved buskers and even publishing schedules of performances.\n\nMany cities in the United States have particular areas known to be popular spots for buskers. Performers are found at many locations like Mallory Square in Key West, in New Orleans, in New York around Central Park, Washington Square, and the subway systems, in San Francisco, in Washington, D.C. around the transit centers, in Los Angeles around Venice Beach, the Santa Monica Third Street Promenade, and the Hollywood area, in Chicago on Maxwell Street, in the Delmar Loop district of St. Louis, and many other locations throughout the US.\nBusking is still quite common in Scotland, Ireland, and England with musicians and other street performers of varying talent levels.\n\nThe first recorded instances of laws affecting buskers were in ancient Rome in 462 BC. The Law of the Twelve Tables made it a crime to sing about or make parodies of the government or its officials in public places; the penalty was death. Louis the Pious \"excluded \"histriones\" and \"scurrae\", which included all entertainers without noble protection, from the privilege of justice\". In 1530 Henry VIII ordered the licensing of minstrels and players, fortune-tellers, pardoners and fencers, as well as beggars who could not work. If they did not obey they could be whipped on two consecutive days.\n\nIn the United States under constitutional law and most European common law, the protection of artistic free speech extends to busking. In the U.S. and many countries, the designated places for free speech behavior are the public parks, streets, sidewalks, thoroughfares and town squares or plazas. Under certain circumstances even private property may be open to buskers, particularly if it is open to the general public and busking does not interfere with its function and management allows it or other forms of free speech behaviors or has a history of doing so.\n\nWhile there is no universal code of conduct for buskers, there are common law practices which buskers must conform to. Most jurisdictions have corresponding statutory law. In the UK busking regulation is not universal with most laws (if there are any) being governed local councils. Some towns in the British Isles limit the licenses issued to bagpipers because of the volume and difficulty of the instrument. In Great Britain places requiring licenses for buskers may also require auditions of anyone applying for a busking license. Oxford City Council have decided to enact a public space protection order. Some venues that do not regulate busking may still ask performers to abide by voluntary rules. Some places require a special permit to use electronically amplified sound and may have limits on the volume of sound produced. It is common law that buskers or others should not impede pedestrian traffic flow, block or otherwise obstruct entrances or exits, or do things that endanger the public. It is common law that any disturbing or noisy behaviors may not be conducted after certain hours in the night. These curfew limitations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is common law that \"performing blue\" (i.e. using material that is sexually explicit or any vulgar or obscene remarks or gestures) is generally prohibited unless performing for an adults-only environment such as in a bar or pub.\n\nIn London, busking is prohibited in the entire borough of the City of London. The London Underground provides busking permits in tube stations. Most London boroughs do not license busking, but they have optional powers, under the London Local Authorities Act 2000, if there is sufficient reason to do so. Where these powers have not been adopted, Councils can rely on other legislation including the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to deal with noise nuisance from buskers and the Highways Act to deal with obstructions. Camden Council is currently looking into further options to control the problem of nuisance buskers and the playing of amplified music to the detriment of local residents and businesses.\n\nBuskers may find themselves targeted by thieves due to the very open and public nature of their craft. Buskers may have their earnings, instruments or props stolen. One particular technique that thieves use against buskers is to pretend to make a donation while actually taking money out instead, a practice known as \"dipping\" or \"skimming\". George Burns described his days as a youthful busker this way:\n\n\nOrganisations\n\nPress\n\nOther\n"}

Jason Statham plays Frank Martin in the first three movies, a professional freelance courier driver for hire. Statham himself is an accomplished martial artist, allowing him to do all the combat scenes involving Frank Martin himself. This permits the films' signature Hong Kong-style fight scenes, choreographed by Corey Yuen. \nChris Vance portrays Frank Martin in the and Ed Skrein portrays Frank Martin in the fourth film, a reboot.\n\nFrank Martin (Jason Statham) is a highly skilled driver known only as \"The Transporter.\" He will transport anything, no questions asked, always on time, and he is known as the best in the business. He strictly follows three rules when transporting: Rule Number 1: \"Once the deal is made, it is final\", Rule Number 2: \"No names\", and Rule Number 3: \"Never open the package.\" Frank inadvertently breaks his own rule, opens the package and finds a bound and gagged woman.\n\nFrank is working as the driver/chauffeur for a wealthy family, in the United States. Martin bonds with their young son, whom he drives to school every day. When the boy is kidnapped, Frank must again take action in order to protect his young \"package\" and his family. Eventually, Martin unravels a scheme involving biological weapons and the nefarious Gianni Chellini. Martin is forced to remove a bomb from the bottom of his car by executing an aerial corkscrew manoeuver underneath a crane. The crane catches the bomb and Martin escapes unharmed. Frank debuts the Audi A8 W12 in this film.\n\nInspector Tarconi plays an even more prominent role in this film. It is established that he and Frank are now friends, and Tarconi goes as far as to lie to the police to cover for Frank. His cooking prowess is established as well.\n\nFrank has been pressured into transporting Valentina (Natalya Rudakova) the kidnapped daughter of Leonid Vasilev (Jeroen Krabbé), the head of the Environmental Protection Agency for Ukraine, from Marseille through Stuttgart and Budapest until he ends up in Odessa on the Black Sea. Along the way, with the help of Inspector Tarconi (François Berléand), Frank has to contend with the people who strong armed him to take the job, agents sent by Vasilev to intercept him, and the general non-cooperation of his passenger, who he realises is the package mid-way through the film. Despite Valentina's cynical disposition and Frank's resistance to get involved, Frank and Valentina fall for each other, while escaping from one life-threatening situation after another. Martin again drives an armoured Audi A8 W12 in the film, as well as a BMX bicycle.\n\nIn May 2013, at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, a new reboot trilogy was announced with EuropaCorp and China's Fundamental Films co-producing and distributing the titles. The films will likely be budgeted between $30 million to $40 million each and at least one will be shot in China. Luc Besson will co-finance, distribute, produce and write all the films. English actor Ed Skrein replaced Jason Statham as Frank Martin on the fourth installment of the series. The fourth film, \"The Transporter Refueled\", was released in the United States on 4 September 2015 with Camille Delamarre directing.\n\n\"Transporter: The Series\" is a television series based on the Transporter films which premiered in 2012 on 11 October in Germany on RTL, and on 6 December in France on M6. Chris Vance took over the role of Frank from Jason Statham and was joined by Hungarian actress Andrea Osvárt, who played Carla, the leading female role in the series, starring as a former Intelligence agent who organises his missions, and French actor François Berléand, the only returning actor from the film series, who reprised his role as Inspector Tarconi.\nThe show was initially supposed to premiere on the cable network Cinemax but Cinemax pulled out due to production problems. TNT picked up the show and aired the 12-episode first season on the TNT network. TNT also ordered a 12-episode second season which aired in the autumn of 2014.\n\nFrank Martin is the protagonist of the films and television series. He initially serves as a reluctant hero. He is portrayed as a former Special Forces operative who was a team leader of a search and destroy unit. His military background includes operations \"in and out of\" Lebanon, Syria and Sudan. He retires from this after becoming fatigued and disenchanted with his superior officers. In simple terms, he got tired of seeing his best efforts turned to nothing by the same people paying him to do the job. So he puts his skills to action as a private driver for hire.\n\n"}
{"id": "5073563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5073563", "title": "Universal Classic Monsters", "text": "Universal Classic Monsters\n\nUniversal Classic Monsters is a phrase used to describe the horror, fantasy, suspense and science fiction films made by Universal Pictures during the decades of the 1920s through the 1950s. They began with \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" and \"The Phantom of the Opera\", both silent films starring Lon Chaney. Universal continued with talkies including monster franchises \"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"The Mummy\", \"The Invisible Man\", \"The Wolf Man\" and \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\". The films often featured Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr.\n\nIn 1923, Universal produced the drama \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", starring Lon Chaney as Quasimodo. The production sets were built to evoke 15th-century Paris, including a re-creation of the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral.\n\nChaney stars as The Phantom in 1925's horror film, \"The Phantom of the Opera\", based on the mystery novel by Gaston Leroux. The interior of the Opéra Garnier was recreated to scale and was used again in the 1943 remake with Claude Rains.\n\nIn 1931, Bela Lugosi starred in Universal's \"Dracula\" and Boris Karloff in \"Frankenstein\". Actors Dwight Frye and Edward Van Sloan, who played major supporting roles in both films, made several film appearances in this decade. Make-up artist Jack Pierce created several monsters' make-up starting in the 1930s.\n\n\"The Mummy\", starring Karloff, was produced in 1932. This was followed by a trilogy of films based on the tales of Edgar Allan Poe: \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1932) starring Lugosi, \"The Black Cat\" (1934), and \"The Raven\" (1935), the latter two of which teamed Lugosi with Karloff. Universal began releasing sequels including \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935), \"Dracula's Daughter\" (1936) and sequels for \"The Invisible Man\" (1933). The first mainstream werewolf picture, \"Werewolf of London\" (1935) starring Henry Hull, was not a box office triumph despite being revered by audiences today.\n\nThe end of Universal’s first run of horror films came in 1936. The monster movies were dropped from the production schedule altogether and would not re-emerge for another three years. In the meantime, a theatre owner revived \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\" as a resoundingly successful double feature, prompting the studio to re-release the original movies. \"Son of Frankenstein\" (1939), starring Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff, and Bela Lugosi, was filmed as a result of the unexpected resurgence.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Universal released \"The Wolf Man\" (1941), with Lon Chaney Jr. The junior Chaney became the studio's leading monster movie actor in the 1940s, just as his father had been two decades earlier, supplanting the 1930s' Karloff and Lugosi by a wide margin in terms of the number of leading roles that he played. Chaney Jr. physically resembled his father apart from usually being somewhat overweight, which the senior Chaney never was. The studio dropped the \"Jr.\" from the junior Chaney's billing almost immediately to confuse some in the audiences into assuming that this was the same actor.\n\nIn 1943, the studio created a remake of \"Phantom of the Opera\", this time starring Nelson Eddy and Susanna Foster with Claude Rains as the Phantom.\n\nThe \"Frankenstein\" and \"Wolf Man\" series continued with \"The Ghost of Frankenstein\" (1942), in which Chaney Jr. played Frankenstein's monster and Lugosi reprised his role as Ygor, and \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\" (1943) with Lugosi as the Frankenstein monster and Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man. \"Son of Dracula\" (1943) featured Chaney Jr. in Lugosi's original role as the Count. The \"Mummy\" series was also continued with \"The Mummy's Hand\" (1940), \"The Mummy's Tomb\" (1942), \"The Mummy's Ghost\" and \"The Mummy's Curse\" (both 1944) with Chaney Jr. as the Mummy in the last three films. \"House of Frankenstein\" (1944) and \"House of Dracula\" (1945) featured many of the monsters from the studio's previous films. As the decade drew to a close, the comedy \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\" (1948) features Lugosi in only his second film as Count Dracula, alongside Chaney Jr. as Larry Talbot (the Wolf Man), and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's monster.\n\nAbbott and Costello appeared in films featuring characters such as the Mummy and the Invisible Man.\n\n\"Creature from the Black Lagoon\", directed by Jack Arnold, was released in 1954. \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\" were re-released as double features in theatres, and were later broadcast in syndication on American television in 1957 as part of the \"Shock Theater\" package of Universal Monster Movies. Magazines such as \"Famous Monsters of Filmland\" covered the monster films. Universal spent the last half of the decade issuing a number of one-shot monster films.\n\nDark Universe is the term given by Universal Pictures to their planned cinematic universe, which will be based on the classic Universal Monsters film series. The studio's first attempt at this universe was with the film \"Dracula Untold\". Released on October 10, 2014, with Luke Evans in the titular role, the film was developed prior to plans for a shared universe of horror films. However, it was retooled to be a part of the franchise. The film's mixed financial and critical reception resulted in the film's future status within the franchise becoming uncertain. Since the release of \"Dracula Untold\", the connections to the shared universe have been downplayed. Universal, which had announced plans to reboot \"The Mummy\" franchise in 2012, decided to re-position the new installment as the first film in the series. \"The Mummy\" was set to be released in 2017 with Alex Kurtzman as director. Also, Kurtzman and Chris Morgan were announced as headlining the Dark Universe, with collaborations from David Koepp and Christopher McQuarrie.\n\nAlong with the crew, Universal announced the casting of Russell Crowe as Dr. Henry Jekyll / Mr. Edward Hyde, Javier Bardem as the Frankenstein Monster, and Johnny Depp as The Invisible Man. They would join Tom Cruise and Sofia Boutella, as Nick Morton and Princess Ahmanet / The Mummy. Bill Condon was announced as the director of the franchise's \"Bride of Frankenstein\", originally set to be released on February 14, 2019. Even though various sources claimed that Evans' character might have at least a cameo in \"The Mummy\" or any of the upcoming films in the universe, Kurtzman denied these claims, stating that he considered the film to not be a part of the \"Dark Universe\". Additional rebooted versions of their characters were announced to have films in development as well including: the Wolf Man, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, the Phantom of the Opera, and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. The shared film universe's official theme music was composed by Danny Elfman.\n\nOn June 9, 2017, \"The Mummy\" was released. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, and performed below the studio's expectations at the box office. By November, \"The Bride of Frankenstein\" was pulled from its initial release, and lead producers/co-architects of the Dark Universe, Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan, left Universal and departed from the franchise. Universal has put a hold on future projects while they create a plan for future releases. Universal Pictures released an official statement reading:\nBy January 2018, development on the film progressed with Condon hiring a production team consisting of cinematographer Tobias A. Schliessler, production designer Sarah Greenwood, composer Carter Burwell, and costume designer Jacqueline Durran. In May of the same year, artist Robert Vargas announced from his social media account that he had attended a meeting with the studio and will collaborate on the Dark Universe films moving forward. Successful horror film producer Jason Blum has publicly expressed his interest in working on the Dark Universe franchise.\n\nAnimation\n\n"}
