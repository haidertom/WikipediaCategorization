The verse usually maintains its metric integrity, while the line fragments spoken by the characters may or may not be complete sentences. In the layout of the text the line fragments following the first one are often indented (\"dropped line\") to show the unity of the verse line.\n\nThese are three sentences spoken by two persons. But it is only one single line in blank verse:\n\n\"The device originated in classical tragedy as a means of heightening dramatic tension.\" \"It figures in almost all the plays of Sophocles and Euripides. It renders dialogue less stately and more agitated: the technique is well suited to scenes of excitement, in which one speaker is repeatedly capping, countering or following up the ideas of another.\" In Sophokles’ \"Oedipus\", for example, \"as \"Kreon\" seizes \"Antigone\" (832), they break into an excited lyrical strophe, full of \"antilabe\" in which \"Oedipus\", \"Kreon\", and the chorus participate.\" \"In \"Electra\" (1502-3), \"antilabe\" occurs as \"Orestes\" tries to induce \"Aegisthys\" to enter the house so that \"Orestes\" can kill him.\" \"[Antilabe is] used with particular freedom in late Euripides.\" \"In the plays of Aeschylus, with the possible exception of \"Prometheus Bound\" (line 980), this phenomenon does not occur.\" \n\n\"Dialogic exchanges using both \"stichomythia\" and \"antilabe\" are common in Seneca.

A barker would often conduct a brief free show, introducing performers and describing acts to be given at the feature performance. Professional barkers strongly disliked the term and instead referred to themselves as \"talkers\". \n\nPerhaps the most famous fictional barkers are Billy Bigelow, the protagonist of Rodgers and Hammerstein's classic stage musical \"Carousel\", and Tin Man, a supporting protagonist from the 1978 musical film \"The Wiz\" portrayed by Nipsey Russell. Bigelow, in turn was an Americanized version of Liliom, the protagonist of Hungarian author Ferenc Molnár's non-musical play \"Liliom\", on which \"Carousel\" is based.\n\nAlso the film \"The Barker\" from 1928 stands for this profession.\n\n"}
{"id": "3798951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3798951", "title": "Benshi", "text": "Benshi\n\nDuring silent films, the \"benshi\" stood to the side of the screen and introduced and related the story to the audience. In theatrical style, \"benshi\" often spoke for the characters on-screen and played multiple roles. Stemming from the traditions of \"kabuki\" and \"Noh\" theaters, the benshi's narration and general commentary were an important part of the Japanese silent film experience. The \"benshi\" also provided translation for foreign (mostly American) movies.\n\nMuch like in the West, Japanese silent films were often accompanied by live music (in addition to the \"benshi\"). However, unlike Western films, which tended to have a theatre organ as accompaniment, Japanese films had a score which supported the traditional Japanese instruments of a \"kabuki\" play. Since \"benshi\" performed without external amplification, they had to carefully coordinate with the orchestra to be heard. At that time, theaters typically seated 1000, so a trademark of successful \"benshi\" was the ability to project their voices into large spaces.\n\nFamous benshi active in the silent era include Musei Tokugawa (at the Aoikan and Musashinokan theaters), Saburō Somei (at the Denkikan), Rakuten Nishimura, Raiyū Ikoma (at the Teikokukan), Mitsugu Ōkura, and Shirō Ōtsuji.\n\nIn the 1995 film \"Picture Bride,\" Toshirō Mifune portrays a \"benshi\" who traveled to sugar cane plantations in Hawaii during the early 20th century.\n\nAs the film industry and art form developed in Japan, the presence of a \"benshi\" came to be part of the film. Benshi read the intertitles on silent films and voiced all on-screen characters. Perhaps most significantly for filmmakers, \"benshi\" would add their own commentary, explaining what was happening in a shot or describing what had happened in confusing edits or sudden transitions. Some \"benshi\" were known to interpret and add to a script, for example reciting poetry to accompany a moving visual.\n\nIn addition, it was traditional for the \"benshi\" to introduce the film, even giving a brief lecture about the history of the setting. This meant that filmmakers could assume that a live narrator, accustomed to improvisation, would be present at the showing to explain scenes or even explain missing scenes or unfilmed action.\n\nPerhaps because most early Japanese films were simply \"kabuki\" plays adapted to film, the characterization style \"benshi\" performed roles strongly influenced by the narrators in \"kabuki\" or a \"noh\" chorus—a grave, dramatic, exaggerated style. Due to the influence of \"kabuki\", audiences were not distracted by a single \"benshi\" voicing male and female roles, regardless of the gender of the \"benshi\".\n\nIn 1927, there were 6,818 \"benshi\", including 180 women. Many \"benshi\" were famous in their own right and garnered great acclaim. The presence of a \"benshi\" was the aspect of the film presentation that drew in the audience, more so than the actors appearing in the film, and promotional posters would frequently include a photo of the \"benshi\" announcing the movie.\n\nThe silent film era lasted until the mid-1930s in Japan in part due to \"benshi\", despite the introduction of sound in full-length films in the late 1920s. The adoption of this new technology was slowed by the popularity and influence of the \"benshi\" (in addition to the high costs to the cinemas and production companies). Though the tradition has mostly faded, there are a few remaining active \"benshi\" in Japan (e.g., Midori Sawato).\n\n\n\nThe underlying concept of benshi, live narration of film, continues to work its way into performance practices. The actual practice of \"benshi\" is most commonly referenced in relation to live film narration largely due to it having been and when the practice was more formalized and financed. As evidenced by the (above) listings of \"benshi\" in other cultures, the art of cinema accompanied by a live performer was as international then as it is now. \n\nThere are groups in the United States seeking to revive this form and to continue exploring the possibilities of altering the form in the spirit of experimentation from which the practice emerged. Likewise, new attempts to subvert traditional notions of storytelling and film watching are underway. Some performers interject commentary into films, drawing from a century of social critique, often presenting popular films along with new dialog and narrative intended to juxtapose their ideas with those of the audience. While some have adopted the term \"Neo-Benshi\", other performers have chosen to adopt the title \"movieteller\" as an alternative. They believe it emphasizes the multicultural past and future(s) of the form, while inviting further experimentation with the medium, such as a live narration of one's own films, the implementation of instruments as narrative devices, or any instance where a human contingent mediates between an audience and an image.\n\nTaiwanese Benshi \n"}
{"id": "43548543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43548543", "title": "Blow book", "text": "Blow book\n\nThe blow book, better known as a magic coloring book in modern variations, is a classic magic trick that has been performed for hundreds of years. It was most popular from the 16th to the 19th century, when variations of the concept were a staple of the book publishing trade. It has been referred to as the oldest example of a manufactured prop used for magic. It remains a common trick today, albeit mostly performed for children, preferably at birthday parties or other events due to the visual nature of the illusion.\n\nThe magician presents a book and riffles through it, showing a number of images in black and white. The book is then closed and a flourish is performed, normally involving audience participation, originally having an audience member blow on the outside of the book. The magician picks up the book and riffles it again, revealing that the images are now colored, or have changed completely into different images depending on the nature of the book.\n\nThe blow book is one of the oldest magic tricks. It has a history that is well-documented in historical sources, because the trick is based on a device that was only really practical after the widespread introduction of the printing press in 1450, which created a market for inexpensive paper and binding that the trick relies upon.\n\nThe earliest known mention of the concept was by Gerolamo Cardano in 1550, who described the trick by mentioning \"conjurors show different and always unlike pictures in one and the same book\". Another early mention is by Reginald Scot in his book \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\", published in 1584. This work examined witchcraft and revealed the tricks involved, ultimately concluding that witchcraft was not real. As part of this discussion he mentions the use of blow books, and goes on to describe how to prepare a book that the magician would then \"whew you everie leafe to be painted with birds, then with beasts, then with serpents, then with angels, etc.\" He realized that the preparation might be beyond the capabilities of many would-be magicians, and directs his readers to \"buie for a small value the like booke, at the shop of W. Brome in Powles churchyard\", the earliest known example of a magic prop for sale. William Broome of St. Paul's in London was active between 1577 and 1591. A similar description of the blow book was published in French the same year by Jean Prévost.\n\nThe blow book is mentioned in \"Hocus Pocus Junior\", the earliest known collection of magic tricks in the English language, published in London in 1635. In this text the concept is called a \"iugling booke\" (\"juggling book\") or \"booke for Waggery\". It contains a complete description of how to prepare a blow book. The author suggests presenting the book by saying \"this booke is not painted thus as some of you may suppose, but it is of such a property, that whosoever bloweth on it, it wil give the representation of whatsoever he is naturally addicted unto\". He further mentions that in order for the trick to work, one must use a \"bold and audacious countenance, for that must be the grace of all your trickes\". Many of the tricks in the book feature the magician or an audience member blowing on the prop; this was a common fixture of the trade. The trick continues to appear in many books on magic through time, often with references to where to buy copies; in \"The Whole Art of Legerdemain\" of 1748 it's mentioned that \"the blowing Books ... may have them at my Shop on little Tower-hill\".\n\nNone of these very early examples of blow books are known to exist today. The earliest surviving examples are a Belgian version from the 16th century, and French and Italian books from the second half of the 18th century. By the 19th century prices on printed materials had dropped so much that the trick was quite well known, and it was not uncommon for magicians of the period to hand them out after their performances. Quaker Oats even gave out a version in their cereal. The basic concept has never gone out of print for long, and modern examples remain widespread today, along with descriptions on how to make your own. Modern versions are typically in the form of children's coloring books and remain popular, even appearing on The Wiggles.\n\nThe mechanical resemblance of the blow book to the early animation concept known as a flip book has been a subject of some consideration in animation circles. Whether the blow book inspired the flip book remains an unanswered question.\n\nThe most basic version of the blow book is based on alternating pages being different widths. The book is assembled by alternating the different pages, wide, narrow, wide, narrow (etc.), and then binding them together. Images of one type, black and white for instance, are drawn on every set of facing pages with narrow on the left and wide on the right. The alternate set of images, color in this example, are drawn on the alternate sets of pages with the wide page on the left and narrow on the right. The result is a series of alternating images on sets of facing pages.\n\nTo perform the trick, the book is held by the binding in one hand and riffled with the other; for right handed magicians this will normally mean the binding is in the left hand and the riffling is performed with the right hand. By carefully grasping the right side close to the edge, the fingers or thumb are only touching the wider pages, so when the book is riffled two pages flip each time, the wider page under the thumb, and the narrower one on top of it. This way the audience is always seeing the face side of a wide page and the back of a narrow one. To complete the trick, the book is simply riffled with the right hand inverted, or more commonly, by rotating the entire book around its transverse (horizontal) axis while the audience is directed elsewhere. This causes the upper side of the narrow pages to display along with the back of the wider ones. Images drawn on alternating pages are thus shown or hidden depending on where the thumb is placed.\n\nMore complex versions of the same basic concept can be used to have multiple sets of pages with different images. In these cases the pages are wider or narrower in a pattern along the entire length of the outer edge, creating a number of \"hot spots\" where the book can be riffled to cause different pages to appear. \"Hocus Pocus\" creates a similar concept by using small pieces of paper pasted to the pages to create the same effect, allowing the magician to grasp the tabs while they riffle. This version allows any number of pages per flip, the \"Pocus\" version using sets of eight pages.\n\n\n"}

The troupe consists of one main performer and two co-performers. It is a narrative entertainment that consists of prayers, solo drama, dance, songs, poems and jokes. The topic will be either a Hindu mythological story (Jangam Katha) or a contemporary social issue.\n\nBurra - Katha was developed in Guntur district around 1942 with the aim of propagating political ideas among illiterate masses in villages. The communists with the help of Andhra Praja Natya Mandali founded by Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy in Bezawada spread the message to the masses in the Naizam region during the rebellion against Nizam in the 1940s.\n\n\"Burra\" is referred to tambura, a musical string instrument with a hollow shell. \"Katha\" means story.\nBurra means a skull in Telugu. The shell resembles a human skull. It is made of baked clay or dried pumpkin, or of brass and copper. The instrument looks very similar to veena and the performer can pull and press strings to get music.\n\nBurrakatha refers to the art throughout Andhra Pradesh, and there are local names in each region.\n\nBurrakatha started as devotional songs of nomadic people and became a popular art form. It is played on radio and TV regularly in Andhra Pradesh. It is a 20th-century name for the theater show known as Jangam Katha. The jangams lingayats were wandering minstrels who worshiped and sang of Lord Siva. Two performers participated in these plays: the storyteller and his wife. With societal and cultural changes, the secular aspect was incorporated into this form. The modern form has three performers of any gender.\n\nPopular Hindu artists were Pendyala Venkateswarrao, Sunkara Sri Krishna Madhava Rao, Paruchuri Ramakotayya, Sirivisetti Subbarao, Kosuri Punnayya, Govardhana, Kakumanu Subbarao, Davuluru, Chintalal Suryanarayana, Budagajangala mote papaiah, Budagajangala mote kullayappa, Budagajangala mote ramalingam, etc. Women also formed groups, e.g., Moturi Udayam, Chintala Koteswaramma, Mahankali Lakshmi, Sridevi sisters, etc. Popular non-Hindu artists are Abraham Bhagavatar, Manohara Kavi, Khader Khan Sahib, Shaik Nazar etc.\n\nThe main storyteller (kathakudu) narrates the story. He plays tambura and dances to music. He also wears a metal ring called an andelu on his right thumb, holds another ring in his other hand and adds more music by colliding them frequently. The co-performers plays gummeta (also called dakki or budike), earthen drums with two heads. All three or only the kathakadu wear anklets (also called as gajjelu), which add even more music when they dance.\n\nThe right side performer (hasyaka, meaning joker) acts as a joker and cracks satires and jokes. The left side performer (rajakiya, meaning politician) acts as someone who knows worldly ways and talks about politics and social issues. The main performer and co-performers constantly was address each other. The co-performers interrupt the kathakudu with doubts, and they sometimes add emphasis to the main events in the story with short words similar to \"Wow!\" \"Aha!\" and \"That is it.\"\n\nWhenever the main performer sings a song, he or she starts with \"vinara veera kumara veera gadha vinara\" followed by the co-performers singing \"tandhana tane tandhana na.\" It is also called 'tandana katha.'\n\nBurra katha was a pastime event in villages. It is seen even now during Dussehra or Sankranti festival seasons to describe events in epics like Ramayan and Mahabharat and also some of best and moral stories of kings like kambojaraju katha, chinnamma katha, muggurumoratila katha, etc.\n\nIt played an effective role in conveying message to people and awakening them during Indian Independence Movement. Burrakatha was banned in Madras by the British government and in Hyderabad kingdom by Nizam government, because it was the medium to enlighten the people of the political situation in political meetings.\n\nBurrakatha tellers are called as budagajangalu. Internet and movies play a major role in modern life.\nThat's why the burrakathas are not being seen and no one is there to develop this and improve the art.\nIn past these burrakatha tellers were important in the villages; now there is no response for their art.\n\nSo these burrakatha tellers left their traditional art and have become beggars or day labourers. Even in these modern times, there are no educated people in this tribe. They don't have caste certificates for developing their tribe.\n\nDaroji Eramma was a performer of Burra katha from Karnataka.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in Voroshylovskyi Raion, in the west it matches with stadium Shakhtar, and in the north there is the Second city pond.\n\nPark was open in 1932. There are rides, playgrounds, alleys for hiking and other recreational facilities available for visitors.\nThe park is named after Alexander Sergeevich Shcherbakov, who was the Secretary of the Donetsk Oblast Party Committee in 1938. However, the original name was different – at first the park was named after Pavel Petrovich Postyshev, but the park was renamed after the last had been arrested.\n\nThe park is located in Skoromoshnaya gully, which was the meeting place for workers of Yuzovsky metallurgical plant and the nearby coal mines in the 19th century. A travelling circus stayed here and mass celebrations were held. In 1891 the river was blocked by a dam, resulting in a first city pond that provided the steel works with water. In 1931 they decided to create a park, and in September 1932 10 000 Komsomol members and the city pioneers started work on park creation. 120 hectares of the open steppe land area near river Bakhmutka (First city pond) in the Skomoroshnaya gully was allocated for the park.\nIn 1933 the alleys were established lined with chestnut trees, lime trees and poplars. On opening day about sixty thousand people visited the park. Amusement rides started functioning in 1934. Later, the area of the park was increased to 200 hectares, yet reduced to 96 hectares by 2000. At the initial planning except the Central Park there were separate functional zones: a Central Beach park, Amusement park, Regional Park \"Medium Ponds\", landscape park \"Urban forest\" and the \"Upper\" landscape park. The park is located along the coastline of connected ponds, and landscape compositions, most open to the water area direction. In the center the terraces are situated, the lowest of which is the parterre, which is the basis of the composition. The stadium Shakhtar is built on the upper terrace in 1936 (designed by architects Georgy Nawrocki and S. Severin). In 1932 the park held an agricultural exhibition, for which pavilions were built. Before 2008 entrance to the park from Stadionnaya street looked like a group of columns with cornices; in 2008 it was decorated with ornate metal gates and became a major entrance. In the postwar period in the park there were about a hundred names of tree and shrub species, and the 1955 edition \"Donbass Parks\" referred to Shcherbakov park as to one of the best parks in Donbas. On November 15, 2008 Donetsk journalists established \"Alley of Journalists\". In 2006 reconstruction of the large park started, \"Donetskproekt\" fulfilled the pre-design for improvement of the waterfront in the park. During the reconstruction the pond embankment was reinforced and purged. In 2008 forged pavilion was established in the park and rosary with variety of roses was made.\n\nThe sculptural decoration of the park of the Soviet times was ideology-determined. White statue of Joseph Stalin was established in front of the bridge framed in acacia and dominated over the whole complex of the central park. Behind the back of Stalin statue there was a sculpture of athlete jumping into the water and the fountain with athletes' sculptures who were holding a vase in outstretched hands. In the fountain bowl there was a sculpture of a Sportswoman with ball. Stadium \"Shakhtar\" was decorated with monumental sculptures on the second floor. The sculptures of the postwar period were dismantled in 1970 during reconstruction of the central part of the park. During the renovation of the park in 2006-2008, a statue of the ancient girl with a jar was placed on the banking of the \"First\" pond. Also in 2008, in order to commemorate the City and the Miner's Day the \"Good Angel of Peace\" was established in the Park as international symbol of patronage. On the statue basis the names of famous Ukrainian patrons are carved: Nickolay Tereshchenko, Bogdan Khanenko, Vasiliy Tarnovskiy, Rinat Akhmetov and others. In 2008, 46 wooden sculptures depicting fantasy characters were established in the Park.\n\nThe fountain with athletes sculptures was dismantled in 1970 during reconstruction of the central part of the park, and replaced by a fountain, surrounded by a parapet. A cascade of fountains was organized from the central area to the bridge. Fountains of the 1970s were dismantled in the 2000s (decade). In 2007 a new fountain, consisting of 6 cups, lined with marble was open in the park. 200 lights are used in the fountain construction. During the renovation of the Park in 2006 - 2008 at the entrance from Stadionnaya street a new fountain was installed.\n\nChildren's Railway named after Kirov was launched on November 24, 1936. The train consisted of two coupled together trams and the road line length was of about one kilometer. Due to the World War II outbreak, Kirov Children's Railway ceased to exist and was never rebuilt. The park also previously had a musical shell, a summer theater for 1000 spectators, \"Green\" summer cinema for 2,200 seats, a dance floor, a restaurant, parachute tower (existed until 1970), reading, chess and checkers pavilions. Currently 23 kinds of amusement rides are working in the park, the boat station offers boats and catamarans to hire.

Because coins are small, most coin tricks are considered close-up magic or table magic, as the audience must be close to the performer to see the effects. Though stage conjurers generally do not use coin effects, coin magic is sometimes performed onstage using large coins. In a different type of performance setting, a close-up coin magician (or 'coin worker') will use a large video projector so the audience can see the magic on a big screen. Coin magic is generally considered harder to master than other close-up techniques such as card magic, as it requires great skill and grace to perform convincingly, and this takes a lot of practice to acquire.\n\nCoin effects include productions, vanishes, transformations, transpositions, teleportations, penetrations, restorations, levitations and mental magic—some are combined in a single routine. A simple effect might involve borrowing a coin, making it vanish, concealing the coin, then reproducing it again unexpectedly and returning it to the owner. More complex effects may involve multiple coins, substituting or switching coins and other objects or props can be employed (i.e. handkerchiefs, glasses) as well as the coins. However, the power of most coin magic lies in its simplicity and the solidity of the object; the basic skills of sleight of hand and misdirection often appear most magical without complex equipment. Almost any audience will be amazed by the simplest mystery, such as passing a coin through a table.\n\nSome classic coin magic effects:\n\nSome classic coin magic plots:\n\nA sampling of coin sleights and moves:\n\nSome magicians widely known for coin magic include:\n\nAlthough some coin magic use gimmicks (e.g. modified coins or trick coins), such gimmicks usually do not entirely create the magical effect. Gimmicked coins are made by several major manufacturers, such as Sterling, Johnson, Sasco or Tango Magic. Producing a memorable mystery requires significant skill in presenting the effect and utilizing misdirection to distract the audience from the secret of the gimmick. A performer who relies entirely on special equipment may not impress an audience. Many people are more impressed by an effect which depends (or seems to depend) entirely on skillful manipulation and misdirection than by an effect which appears to depend to some extent on specially made props. A performer who has mastered the basic skills can nonetheless use gimmicks to powerful effect without it being obvious to the audience. Some prefer not to use gimmicks at all, though most well-known coin magicians do use simple coin gimmicks.\n\nCanadian novelist Robertson Davies devotes a good part of his \"Deptford Trilogy\" to the art of coin magic. All three novels follow in part or wholly the career of a fictitious magician, Magnus Eisengrim, who was abducted as a boy by a traveling circus and learned his craft while concealed in a papier-mâché automaton. The descriptions of coin magic throughout are remarkable for their clarity. The final novel in the series, World of Wonders, details his life and career.\n\nIn the Neil Gaiman novel \"American Gods\", the main character, Shadow, is experienced with coin magic, and many different tricks and aspects of coin magic are discussed in the book.\n\nIn the Dean Koontz novel \"From the Corner of His Eye\", a police officer uses coin magic to interrogate suspects.\n\nThieves, wizards, and jesters, in historical and fantasy literature are often depicted as being skilled in sleight of hand, and are often depicted doing standard coin magic. Rolling a coin across the knuckles (coin walking) is a popular image. Silk in David Eddings's \"Belgariad\", and Mat Cauthon and Thom Merrilin in Robert Jordan's \"Wheel of Time\" do this frequently. Johnny Depp's whimsical character Jack Sparrow coin walks in the end of Pirates of the Caribbean. Also, Vila Restal in the BBC science fiction television program \"Blake's 7\" mixed his skills as a thief with such tricks.\n\n"}
{"id": "911884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=911884", "title": "Comedy of manners", "text": "Comedy of manners\n\nThe comedy of manners is a form of comedy that satirizes the manners and affectations of contemporary society and questions societal standards. Social class stereotypes are often represented through stock characters such as the \"miles gloriosus\" (\"boastful soldier\") in ancient Greek comedy or the fop and rake of English Restoration comedy, which is sometimes used as a synonym for \"comedy of manners\". A comedy of manners often sacrifices the plot, which usually centers on some scandal, to witty dialogue and sharp social commentary. Oscar Wilde's play, \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (1895), which satirized the Victorian morality of the time, is one of the best-known plays of this genre.\n\nThe comedy of manners was first developed in the New Comedy period of ancient Greek comedy and is known today primarily from fragments of writings by the Greek playwright Menander. Menander's style, elaborate plots, and stock characters were imitated by the ancient Roman playwrights, such as Plautus and Terence, whose comedies were in turn widely known and reproduced during the Renaissance. Some of the best-known comedies of manners are those by the 17th-century French playwright Molière, who satirized the hypocrisy and pretension of the \"ancien régime\" in plays such as \"L'École des femmes\" ([\"The School for Wives\"], 1662), \"Tartuffe\" ([\"The Imposter\"], 1664), and \"Le Misanthrope\" ([\"The Misanthrope\"], 1666).\n\nThe comedy of manners has been employed by Roman satirists since as early as the first century BC. Horace's Satire 1.9 is a prominent example, in which the persona is unable to express his wish for his companion to leave, but instead subtly implies so through wit.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare's \"Much Ado about Nothing\" might be considered the first comedy of manners In England, but the genre really flourished during the Restoration period. Restoration comedy, which was influenced by Ben Jonson's comedy of humours, made fun of affected wit and acquired follies of the time. The masterpieces of the genre were the plays of William Wycherley (\"The Country Wife\", 1675) and William Congreve (\"The Way of the World\", 1700). In the late 18th century Oliver Goldsmith (\"She Stoops to Conquer\", 1773) and Richard Brinsley Sheridan (\"The Rivals\", 1775; \"The School for Scandal\", 1777) revived the form.\n\nThe tradition of elaborate, artificial plotting and epigrammatic dialogue was carried on by the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde in \"Lady Windermere's Fan\" (1892) and \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (1895). In the 20th century, the comedy of manners reappeared in the plays of the British dramatists Noël Coward (\"Hay Fever\", 1925) and Somerset Maugham and the novels of P. G. Wodehouse, as well as various British sitcoms. The \"Carry On films\" are a direct descendant of the comedy of manners \nstyle.\n\nThe term \"comedy of menace\", which British drama critic Irving Wardle based on the subtitle of \"\" (1958), by David Campton, is a jocular play-on-words derived from the \"comedy of manners\" (\"menace\" being \"manners\" pronounced with a somewhat Judeo-English accent). Pinter's play \"The Homecoming\" has been described as a mid-twentieth-century \"comedy of manners\".\n\nIn \"Boston Marriage\" (1999), David Mamet chronicles a sexual relationship between two women, one of whom has her eye on yet another young woman (who never appears, but who is the target of a seduction scheme). Periodically, the two women make their serving woman the butt of haughty jokes, serving to point up the satire on class. Though displaying the verbal dexterity one associates with both the playwright and the genre, the patina of wit occasionally erupts into shocking crudity.\n\nOther contemporary examples include Kazuo Ishiguro's \"The Remains of the Day\", E. M. Forster's \"A Room with a View\", Barbara Pym's \"Excellent Women\", Douglas Carter Beane's \"As Bees in Honey Drown\", \"The Country Club\", \"The Little Dog Laughed\", \"You Rang, M'Lord?\" by David Croft and Jimmy Perry, and the Jeeves and Wooster series by P. G. Wodehouse. The television program \"Absolutely Fabulous\" is another contemporary example of the comedy of manners.\n\n"}
{"id": "31631748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31631748", "title": "Comic book therapy", "text": "Comic book therapy\n\nComic book therapy is a form of art therapy in which those undergoing rehabilitation or those who have already completed rehabilitation express their experiences through personal narratives within a comics format. The combination of text and image enables patients to process their memories and emotions through two different, yet compatible mediums. Comic book therapy can also be used in a psychotherapeutic setting, whereby clients are encouraged to read specific comic books, often surrounding topics similar to their own diagnoses. Clients are encouraged to present their thoughts and feelings they experienced while reading as well as to draw parallels with their own lived experiences based on the events that occur within the books. This is done in an effort to reach a cathartic moment of clarity and understanding of one's own life.\n\nBoth forms of therapy can be used throughout a patient's treatment process: immediately after diagnosis, throughout rehabilitation, and during the events that follow, including readjustment and general coping.\n\nComic book therapy is currently being applied to a variety of populations, including patients diagnosed with life-altering diagnoses (i.e. cancer, Dementia, Parkinson's Disease, diabetes, etc.), patients and family members experiencing severe illness or death, families undergoing therapy, sexual assault survivors, and soldiers returning from war. One such therapy, originally conceptualized by Captain Russel Shilling, is currently being developed by The United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).\n\nGraphic medicine, originally coined by Ian Williams, is a literary genre that combines the medium of comics and the discourse of medicine. Within the last ten years, graphic stories, which are also referred to as adult themed comics, have slowly become a rising pop-culture trend. It owes its success in part to the rise of medical humanities, an interdisciplinary study of medicine and healthcare related topics. While medical humanities incorporates a variety of language-based subjects (i.e. philosophy, ethics, religion, etc.), graphic medicine strives to analyze the same healthcare-related topics using an artistic lens. The genre combines the conventionality of text with the eccentricity of images to present intimate narratives related to healthcare or medical experiences. These narratives are also sometimes referred to as \"graphic pathologies\", as they commonly discuss diagnoses of injury, illness, or disease.\n\nCurrent professionals within the field are striving to develop a collection of novels that can act not only as a therapeutic tool for patients and their loved ones, but that serve as an educational tool for medical students as well.\n\nThe general concepts of graphic medicine and comic book therapy are often used interchangeably as they both strive to develop healthcare-related stories using both text and graphics. There is however a distinction that should be made. Graphic medicine acts as an umbrella term that encompasses a host of therapeutic techniques. Therefore, comic book therapy comfortably fits under its heading as just one of many therapies that the field of graphic medicine investigates.\n\nThe foundations of the comics industry began in the early 1920's just after the culmination of the First World War. Initially starting out as small black-and-white strips, comics predominantly acted as entertaining filler space within national and local magazines and newspapers around the country. It was not until 1929 with the publication of \"The Funnies #1\" that the first collection of comics material came about. The years following witnessed a spurt of comics publication that lasted up until present day with children and adults alike still knowing names like \"Batman, Superman, Peanuts,\" and \"Calvin and Hobbes.\"\n\nProfessionals within the graphic medicine field trace the history of comics back further than the early 1920's, however. Instead, they claim the origin of their academic field can be traced back to prehistoric cave drawings and man's desire to express himself with pictures. In this light, professors of graphic medicine and clinicians of comic book therapy include Egyptian hieroglyphics, Mayan and Aztecs drawings, and the great art of the Greeks, the Persians, and the Romans within the history of comic books as well. They do, of course, begin the story of comics specifically in 1938 with the publication of \"Action Comics #1\", the first to detail the adventures and heroic efforts of Superman. The development of radio, television, and film only heightened the popularity of comic books and comic book characters; and by 1980, the merchandising of comic books hit an all time peak. Today, comic books have slowly begun to matriculate within select topics of academia, now regarded as significant contributions to literary expression, covering topics of medicine, politics, economy, and social change.\n\nSince its beginning, graphic medicine as a field of study has steadily become more relevant. As such, the use of comic book therapy as well as its functions have expanded as well. Today, comic books and graphic novels alike are being implemented in a variety of clinical and educational settings, likely due to its efforts in serving a variety of needs for a diverse target audience. Comic book therapies can serve multiple purposes. Some authors hope to relay information, creating a graphic encyclopedia of sorts. Therapists often collaborate with patients in comic book therapy to develop a closer relationship based on the tenants of empathy and understanding. Patients, more often than not, are encouraged to process difficult emotions and memories in the attempt to process, readjust, and engage in healthier coping strategies. Because of its multiple functions, graphic medicine and comic book therapy have been implemented both therapeutically and educationally in the medical field.\n\nOne form of comic book therapy involves the creation of a comic strip, a comic book, or a graphic novel. The process by which a patient, family member, caregiver, or practitioner creates a comic book is complex and involves extensive research. In essence, the process of developing a comic book serves as a therapeutic coping mechanism that goes beyond text-based story telling. Instead, patients are pushed to think through multiple mediums. The process can sometimes, hopefully frequently, lead to significant cognitive and emotion breakthroughs. These effects are likely due to the sheer versatility of the comic book medium, as they allow for the simultaneous expression of body image, verbal expression, physical action, and emotion.\n\nTherapists often encourage patients to develop characters first, as this first step situates the patient in relation to their environment, past and present. Most often, the characters of comic book therapy novels imitate those within the author's own life, developing an autobiography of sorts. Occasionally, their experiences are identical to those of reality; often, an author chooses to reshape the narrative altogether, providing the reader an augmented reality of some kind. Patients take this opportunity to rewrite their story, making choices they didn't or couldn't during their own experiences. The comic book aspect acts as a safe avenue of release, in which a patient can comfortably create a world in which the consequences of actions are limited to panels in which they develop.\n\nAnother form of comic book therapy encourages patients, their support systems, and their healthcare providers to read already published graphic novels and comic books. As the field of graphic medicine has grown, so too have the collection of comic books and novels. As such, current graphic novels and comic books cover a wide range of topics, including cancer, Parkinson's disease, Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, eating disorders, and so on. Popular novels include \"Cancervixen: a True Story\" by Marisa Acocella Marchetto, \"Tangles: A Story About Alzheimer's, My Mother, and Me\" by Sarah Leavitt, and \"Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo and Me\" by Ellen Forney. Therapists recommend novels that discuss similar experiences, similar diagnoses, similar personal histories to those of their own patients. Patients are encouraged to read them critically in the efforts of finding some kind of parallel between their own experiences and those described within the panels. This method of therapy goes beyond just reading a recommended autobiography. The images and graphics within each panel add to the narrative, bridging a gap between words and meaning. The way in which an author chooses to depict their characters, the environment, and the text are all important and contribute largely the reading experience.\n\nCurrent professionals within the field are striving to develop a field of study that can act not only as a therapeutic tool for patients and healthcare providers alike, but that can serve as an educational tool for medical students as well. With the advancement of technology and the diversification of the patient population, medical practices has undergone significant change within the last century. On the other hand, the education process prior to medical practice has remained arguably stagnant. Present day medical school programs cover material in three broad categories, including the scientific basis of medicine, patient care, and physicianship. The methods of teaching vary across universities, but the basic curricula remain the same across the board. With the evolution of medical practice arriving so quickly, some argue that medical training should follow in suit. According to the scholars of Graphic Medicine, there are multiple parallels between comic book therapy, when used as educational tool, and the everyday practice of medicine. In this way, having medical students engage in comic book therapy during their medical training could prove significant later on. The hustle and bustle of medical practice can prove stressful, especially for a new doctor fresh out of medical school. In order to prove oneself within the medical field, many believe an individual must possess characteristics like 'competency', 'professionalism', and 'brilliance'; rarely are physicians referred to as 'artistically creative' or 'creative' at all. One professor of graphic medicine believes this could be a problem in the future as it pushes medical students to stay within the limitations of an unoriginal box.\n\n"}
{"id": "52207996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52207996", "title": "Comics poetry", "text": "Comics poetry\n\nComics poetry is a hybrid creative form that combines aspects of comics and poetry. It draws from the syntax of comics, images, panels, speech balloons, and so on, in order to produce a literary or artistic experience akin to that of traditional poetry.\n\nComics poetry traces its origins to illuminated manuscripts, graphic novels, concrete poetry, and poets who combined images and text such as Kenneth Patchen. In the mid-2000s, a number of artist-poets began publishing independently of one another, referring to what they were doing expressly as comics poetry. According to artist and scholar Tamryn Bennett, \"The term comics poetry can be applied to a growing field of works that fall outside of traditional definitions of both comics and poetry. These works include Warren Craghead’s \"How To Be Everywhere\" (2007); Matt Madden’s \"Comic Sestina\" (2004), Michael Farrell’s \"BREAK ME OUCH\" (2006); as well as a host of comics poetry collections by Bianca Stone, Alexander Rothman, Paul K. Tunis, Gary Sullivan, John Hankiewicz, Anders Nilsen, Derik Badman, Eroyn Franklin, Franklin Einspruch, Sommer Browning, Kimball Anderson, Mohit Trendster, Kevin Czapiewski, Malcy Duff and Julie Delporte, among others.\"\n\nUse of the terms \"comics poetry\" and \"poetry comics\" is widespread among its practitioners. Alexander Rothman, editor-in-chief of \"Ink Brick\", has written, \"I call the work that I make and publish 'comics poetry.' ...at the end of the day, more than any other practitioner, a poet is just dealing with words... Words aren’t necessary for comics, but of course they’re there to use. Panels aren’t necessary, but they’re also there to use. Where the poet’s toolbox contains every imaginable arrangement or manipulation of words, the cartoonist’s holds analogs for the visual elements of the page.\"\n\nChrissy Williams, editor of \"Over the Line: An Introduction to Poetry Comics\", said in an interview, \"I generally say 'poetry comic' by the way, not to give any priority to the poetry, but rather to avoid any confusion with 'comic poems,' which are already their own very different hilarious genre of poem. ... the genre needs to be defined fundamentally as an inextricable combination of both comics and poetry, neither of which should be dispensable. In the best poetry comics, I believe, the piece would fail utterly (or at best be horrifically diminished) if you removed either the poetry or the artwork from the composition.\"\n\nTamryn Bennet has written, \"Like [comics poet] Derik Badman, I use the term ‘comics poetry’, as opposed to ‘graphic poetry’, ‘comics-as-poetry’, or ‘poetry comics’, as it refers to the origins of the form rather than the sequential narratives of graphic novels. As Badman explains, ‘Comics poetry isn’t poetry as text with comics images; it’s the whole comic as poetry. The images, the words, the structure, the rhythm, the page, all of it is used together to create the poetry, to create comics in a poetic register.\"\n\n\"Comics poetry\" can be used to differentiate the genre from written poems later interpreted in comics form, such as the work of Dave Morice, which is also called \"poetry comics.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4305591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4305591", "title": "Cup-and-ball", "text": "Cup-and-ball\n\nCup-and-ball (or ball in a cup) or ring and pin is a traditional children's toy. It is generally a wooden handle, to which a small ball is attached by a string, and which has one or two cups, or a spike, upon which the player tries to catch the ball. It is popular in Spanish-speaking countries, where it is called by a wide number of names (including boliche in Spain and balero in most of Hispanic America), and was historically popular in France as the bilboquet. A similar toy with three cups and a spike called \"kendama\" is very popular in Japan and has spread globally in popularity.\n\nThe game was created in the 14th century and has been improved in different ways since then.\n\nIn North America it was both a child's toy and a gambling mechanism for adults, and involved catching a ring rather than a ball. In some Native American tribes it was even a courtship device, where suitors would challenge the objects of their interest to a polite game of ring and pin. The Mohave variant of the game included up to 17 extra rings attached to the cord, and game scoring involved differing point values assigned to different rings. Other variants include those played by the Inuit of what is now Labrador, with a rabbit's skull in place of the ball, with extra holes bored into it, which had to be caught on the handle like a skewer; and those that used balls of grass or animal hair. Ring and pin games in general were known as \"ajagak, ayagak, ajaquktuk\" in Inuit dialects.\n\nThe cup-and-ball is noted in France as early as the sixteenth century. The game was played by King Henry III of France as historical records note, though his playing was considered evidence of his mental instability. After his death, the game went out of fashion, and for a century the game was only remembered by a small number of enthusiasts such as the Marquis de Biévre.\n\nThe game had its golden age during the reign of Louis XV — among the upper classes people owned baleros made of ivory. Actors also sometimes appeared with them in scenes. The game was very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Jean-Jacques Rousseau mentions the game early in his \"Confessions\" when stating his reservations about idle talk and hands, saying \"If ever I went back into society I should carry a cup-and-ball in my pocket, and play with it all day long to excuse myself from speaking when I had nothing to say.\"\n\nThe game is very popular in the Spanish and Portuguese diaspora, often known as boliche. The name varies across many countries — in El Salvador and Guatemala it is called capirucho; in Argentina, Ecuador, Colombia, and Mexico it is called balero; in Spain it is boliche; in Portugal and Brazil it is called bilboquê; in Chile it is emboque; in Colombia it is called coca; and in Venezuela the game is called perinola.\n\nIn 1960, American lexicographer Charles Keilus (1919-1997) documented the term \"zingo paya\" for a cup-and-ball game in Tijuana, Mexico, and formed the Zingo Paya Society in Los Angeles to promote the toy and its collection.\n\nThis game was also popular in England during the early 19th century, as Jane Austen is reputed to have excelled while entertaining her brother's son in a game called \"Bilbo Catcher\".\n\nThere is one picture at the National Portrait Gallery of a young girl playing the game. It appears to be a copy of a painting from Philip Mercier although the original painting has not been found. Unlike other 18th century toys, which are found repeatedly in artwork, cup and ball games are rare with only two known pictures, one copied from the other.\n\nThe game of kendama is believed to have arrived in Japan in the 18th century, and the game underwent significant modernization and standardization in the early 20th century, becoming internationally popular in the 21st century.\n\nIn 2011, a German company, TicToys, began to create a toy with the name Ticayo. Yomega, an American company which is famous for their Yo-yos and Kendamas, began to sell Ticayos, in which they popularized the said toy.\n\nThe main goal of the game is to get the ball into the cup. While the concept is very easy, mastering the game can sometimes be challenging.\n\nThere are several styles of gameplay in the Latin world such as \"la simple\", \"la doble\", \"la vertical\", \"la mariquita\".\n"}
{"id": "2090445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090445", "title": "Cypria", "text": "Cypria\n\nThe Cypria ( \"Kúpria\"; Latin: \"Cypria\") is a lost epic poem of ancient Greek literature, which has been attributed to Stasinus and was quite well known in classical antiquity and fixed in a received text, but which subsequently was lost to view. It was part of the Epic Cycle, which told the entire history of the Trojan War in epic hexameter verse. The story of the \"Cypria\" comes chronologically at the beginning of the Epic Cycle, and is followed by that of the \"Iliad\"; the composition of the two was apparently in the reverse order. The poem comprised eleven books of verse in epic dactylic hexameters.\n\nThe \"Cypria\", in the written form in which it was known in classical Greece, was probably composed in the late seventh century BC, but there is much uncertainty. The Cyclic Poets, as the translator of Homerica, Hugh G. Evelyn-White noted \"were careful not to trespass upon ground already occupied by Homer,\" one of the reasons for dating the final, literary form of \"Cypria\" as post-Homeric, in effect a \"prequel\". \"The author of the \"Kypria\" already regarded the \"Iliad\" as a text. Any reading of the \"Kypria\" will show it preparing for events for (specifically) the \"Iliad\" in order to refer back to them, for instance the sale of Lykaon to Lemnos or the kitting out of Achilles with Briseis and Agamemnon with Chryseis\". A comparison can be made with the \"Aethiopis\", also lost, but which even in its quoted fragments is more independent of the \"Iliad\" as text.\n\nThe stories contained in the \"Cypria\", on the other hand, were fixed much earlier than that, and the same problems of dating oral traditions associated with the Homeric epics also apply to the \"Cypria\". Many or all of the stories in the \"Cypria\" were known to the composer(s) of the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\". The \"Cypria\", in presupposing an acquaintance with the events of the Homeric poem, in the received view thus formed a kind of introduction to the \"Iliad\" though there is an overlap in events from the death of Palamedes, including the catalogue of Trojan allies. J. Marks observes that \"Indeed, the junction would be seamless if the \"Kypria\" simply ended with the death of Palamedes.\"\n\nThe title \"Cypria\", associating the epic with Cyprus, demanded some explanation: the epic was said in one ancient tradition to have been given by Homer as a dowry to his son-in-law, a Stasinus of Cyprus mentioned in no other context; there was apparently an allusion to this in a lost Nemean ode by Pindar. Some later writers repeated the story. It did at least serve to explain why the \"Cypria\" was attributed by some to Homer and by others to Stasinus. Others, however, ascribed the poem to Hegesias (or Hegesinus) of Salamis in Cyprus or to Cyprias of Halicarnassus (see Cyclic Poets).\n\nIt is possible that the \"Trojan Battle Order\" (the list of Trojans and their allies, of \"Iliad\" 2.816-876, which forms an appendix to the \"Catalogue of Ships\") is abridged from that in the \"Cypria\", which was known to contain in its final book a list of the Trojan allies.\n\nIn current critical editions only about fifty lines survive of the \"Cypria\"'s original text, quoted by others. For the content we are almost entirely dependent on a prose summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the \"Chrestomathy\" attributed to an unknown \"Proclus\" (possibly to be identified with the 2nd-century AD grammarian Eutychius Proclus, or else with an otherwise unknown 5th-century grammarian). Many other passing references give further minor indications of the poem's storyline.\n\nWhat follows embeds reports of known content of the \"Cypria\" in a retelling of the known events leading up to the anger of Achilles.\n\nThe poem narrates the origins of the Trojan War and its first events. It begins with the decision of Zeus to relieve the Earth of the burden of population through war, a decision with familiar Mesopotamian parallels. The Theban war of the Seven ensues.\n\nThe \"Cypria\" described the wedding of Peleus and Thetis; in the Judgement of Paris among the goddesses Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite: Paris awards the prize for beauty to Aphrodite, and as a prize is awarded Helen, wife of Menelaus.\n\nThen Paris builds his ships at Aphrodite's suggestion, and Helenus foretells the future to him, and Aphrodite orders Aeneas to sail with him, while Cassandra prophesies the outcome. In Lacedaemon the Trojans are entertained by the sons of Tyndareus, Castor and Polydeuces, and by Menelaus, who then sets sail for Crete, ordering Helen to furnish the guests with all they require. Aphrodite brings Helen and Paris together, and he takes her and her dowry back to his home of Troy with an episode at Sidon, which Paris and his men successfully storm.\n\nIn the meantime Castor and Polydeuces, while stealing the cattle of Idas and Lynceus, are caught and killed: Zeus gives them immortality that they share every other day.\n\nIris informs Menelaus, who returns to plan an expedition against Ilium with his brother Agamemnon. They set out to assemble the former suitors of Helen, who had sworn an oath to defend the rights of whichever one won her hand. Nestor in a digression tells Menelaus how Epopeus was destroyed after seducing the daughter of Lycus, the story of Oedipus, the madness of Heracles, and the story of Theseus and Ariadne. In gathering the leaders, they detect Odysseus' feigned madness.\n\nThe assembled leaders offer ill-omened sacrifice at Aulis, where the prophet Calchas warns the Greeks that the war will last ten years. They reach the city of Teuthras in Mysia and sack it in error for Ilium: Telephus comes to the city's rescue and is wounded by Achilles. The fleet scattered by storm, Achilles puts in at Skyros and marries Deidameia, the daughter of Lycomedes, then heals Telephus, so that he might be their guide to Ilium.\n\nWhen the Achaeans have been mustered a second time at Aulis, Agamemnon is persuaded by Calchas to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to appease the goddess Artemis and obtain safe passage for the ships, after he offends her by killing a stag. Iphigeneia is fetched as though for marriage with Achilles.\nArtemis, however, snatches her away, substituting a deer on the altar, and transports her to the land of the Tauri, making her immortal.\n\nNext they sail as far as Tenedos, where while they are feasting, Philoctetes is bitten by a snake and is left behind in Lemnos. Here, too, Achilles quarrels with Agamemnon. A first landing at the Troad is repulsed by the Trojans, and Protesilaus is killed by Hector. Achilles then kills Cycnus, the son of Poseidon, and drives the Trojans back. The Greeks take up their dead and send envoys to the Trojans demanding the surrender of Helen and the treasure. The Trojans refusing, they first attempt an assault upon the city, and then lay waste the country round about.\n\nAchilles desires to see Helen, and Aphrodite and Thetis contrive a meeting between them. The Achaeans next desire to return home, but are restrained by\nAchilles, who afterwards drives off the cattle of Aeneas, sacks neighbouring cities, and kills Troilus. Patroclus carries away Lycaon to Lemnos and sells him as a slave, and out of the spoils Achilles receives Briseis as a prize, and Agamemnon Chryseis.\nThen follow the death of Palamedes, the plan of Zeus to relieve the Trojans by detaching Achilles from the Hellenic confederacy, and a catalogue of the Trojan allies.\n\nThe \"Cypria\" was considered to be a lesser work than Homer's two masterpieces: Aristotle criticised it for its lack of narrative cohesion and focus. It was rather a catalogue of events than a unified story.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is similar to genre fiction, which identifies a number of specific settings that are frequently reused. The label of \"formula fiction\" is used in literary criticism as a mild pejorative to imply lack of originality.\n\nFormula fiction is similar to genre fiction. The label of genre fiction is typically assigned because of the reuse of settings, content, layout, and/or style. The label of formula fiction is assigned because of the reuse of plot, plot devices and stock characters.\n\nGenres like high fantasy, Westerns and science fiction space opera often have specific settings, such as a pseudo-Medieval European setting, the Old West, or outer space. Approaching a given genre, certain assumed background information covers the nature and purpose of possible predictable elements of the story, such as the appearance of dragons and wizards in high fantasy, warp drives in science fiction, or shootouts at high noon in Westerns. These set-ups are taken for granted by the genre conventions, and need not be explained for the reader anew, though these elements can easily be treated subversively as well, playing with some of the preconceptions inherent in formula fiction.\n\nThe \"formula\" is defined specifically by predictable narrative structure. Formulaic tales incorporate plots that have been reused so often as to be easily recognizable. Perhaps the most clearly formulaic plots characterize the romantic comedy genre; in a book or film labeled as such, viewers already know its most basic central plot, including to some extent the ending. This does not always prove to be detrimental to a given work's reception however, as the popularity of the aforementioned genre demonstrates.\n\n\"Formula fiction\" should not be confused with \"pastiche\" (the mimicking of another work or author's style), though the latter by its nature may include elements of the former; the same holds true of some parody and satirical works as well, which may well include formulaic elements such as common stereotypes or caricatures, or which may use formulaic elements in order to mock them or point out their supposedly cliché or unrealistic nature. Indeed, between parody, satire and such subgenres as romantic comedy, comedy as a whole often relies on either formulaic elements, or the mocking of such elements.\n\nFormula fiction is often stereotypically associated with early pulp magazine markets, though some works published in that medium, such as \"The Cold Equations\", subvert the supposed expectations of the common narrative formula of that time.\n\nThe dissection and tracking of common formulaic tropes (as well as their subversions and new permutations) has become reasonably popular beyond strictly academic circles. (The Final Girl being one such example, as well as, to some extent, Campbell's \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\"). Amateur circles have websites such as the TV Tropes Wiki.\n\n\n"}

It can also be a remark or question, typically disparaging (also called insinuation), that works obliquely by allusion. In the latter sense the intention is often to insult or accuse someone in such a way that one's words, taken literally, are innocent.\n\nAccording to the \"Advanced Oxford Learner's Dictionary\", an innuendo is \"an indirect remark about somebody or something, usually suggesting something bad, mean or rude\", such as:\" \"innuendos about her private life\" \"or\" \"The song is full of sexual innuendo\".\"\n\nThe term sexual innuendo has acquired a specific meaning, namely that of a \"risqué\" double entendre by playing on a possibly sexual interpretation of an otherwise innocent uttering. For example: \"We need to go deeper\" can be seen as either a request for further inquiry, or a request to go deeper into an intimate part.\n\nIn the context of defamation law, an innuendo meaning is one which is not directly contained in the words complained of, but which would be understood by those reading it based on special knowledge.\n\nComedy film scripts have used innuendo since the beginning of sound film itself. A notable example is the \"Carry On\" film series (1958–1992) in which innuendo was a staple feature, often including the title of the film itself. British sitcoms and comedy shows such as \"Are You Being Served?\" and \"Round the Horne\" have also made extensive use of innuendo. Mild sexual innuendo is a staple of British pantomime.\n\nNumerous television programs targeted at child audiences often use innuendos in attempt to entertain adolescent/adult audiences without exceeding their network's censorship policies.\n\nMany American primetime shows use an extensive amount of innuendo to the point that it is rated TV-PG/14 D for dialogue. Also, many radio shows, are notable for this.\n\nOn \"The Scott Mills Show\" on BBC Radio 1, listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with innuendos in a humorous context, a feature known as \"Innuendo Bingo\". Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game.\n\n"}
{"id": "21514028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21514028", "title": "Irony", "text": "Irony\n\nIrony (), in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. \n\nIrony can be categorized into different types, including: \"verbal irony\", \"dramatic irony\", and \"situational irony\". Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection. Other forms, as identified by historian Connop Thirlwall, include dialectic and practical irony.\n\nHenry Watson Fowler, in \"The King's English\", says, \"any definition of irony—though hundreds might be given, and very few of them would be accepted—must include this, that the surface meaning and the underlying meaning of what is said are not the same.\" Also, Eric Partridge, in \"Usage and Abusage\", writes that \"Irony consists in stating the contrary of what is meant.\"\n\nThe use of irony may require the concept of a \"double audience\". Fowler's \"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage\" says:\nIrony is a form of utterance that postulates a double audience, consisting of one party that hearing shall hear & shall not understand, & another party that, when more is meant than meets the ear, is aware both of that more & of the outsiders' incomprehension.\n\nThe term is sometimes used as a synonym for \"incongruous\" and applied to \"every trivial oddity\" in situations where there is no double audience. An example of such usage is:\nSullivan, whose real interest was, ironically, serious music, which he composed with varying degrees of success, achieved fame for his comic opera scores rather than for his more earnest efforts.\n\nThe \"American Heritage Dictionary\" secondary meaning for \"irony\": \"incongruity between what might be expected and what actually occurs\". This sense, however, is not synonymous with \"incongruous\" but merely a definition of dramatic or situational irony. It is often included in definitions of irony \"not only\" that incongruity is present \"but also\" that the incongruity must reveal some aspect of human vanity or folly. Thus the majority of \"American Heritage Dictionary\"'s usage panel found it unacceptable to use the word \"ironic\" to describe mere unfortunate coincidences or surprising disappointments that \"suggest no particular lessons about human vanity or folly.\"\n\nOn this aspect, \"The Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\") has also:\nAccording to \"Encyclopædia Britannica\":\nAccording to Richard Whately:\nThe word came into English as a figure of speech in the 16th century as similar to the French \"ironie\". It derives from the Latin \"ironia\" and ultimately from the Greek \"εἰρωνεία\" eirōneía, meaning \"dissimulation, ignorance purposely affected\".\n\n\"The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics\" distinguishes between the following types of irony:\n\nAccording to \"A glossary of literary terms\" by Abrams and Hartman,Verbal irony is a statement in which the meaning that a speaker employs is sharply different from the meaning that is ostensibly expressed. An ironic statement usually involves the explicit expression of one attitude or evaluation, but with indications in the overall speech-situation that the speaker intends a very different, and often opposite, attitude or evaluation.\nVerbal irony is distinguished from situational irony and dramatic irony in that it is produced \"intentionally\" by speakers. For instance, if a man exclaims, \"I'm not upset!\" but reveals an upset emotional state through his voice while truly trying to claim he's not upset, it would not be verbal irony by virtue of its verbal manifestation (it would, however, be situational irony). But if the same speaker said the same words and intended to communicate that he was upset by claiming he was not, the utterance would be verbal irony. This distinction illustrates an important aspect of verbal irony—speakers communicate implied propositions that are intentionally contradictory to the propositions contained in the words themselves. There are, however, examples of verbal irony that do not rely on saying the opposite of what one means, and there are cases where all the traditional criteria of irony exist and the utterance is not ironic.\n\nIn a clear example from literature, in Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\", Mark Antony's speech after the assassination of Caesar appears to praise the assassins, particularly Brutus (\"But Brutus says he was ambitious; / And Brutus is an honourable man\"), while actually condemning them. \"We're left in no doubt as to who's ambitious and who's honourable. The literal truth of what's written clashes with the perceived truth of what's meant to revealing effect, which is irony in a nutshell\".\nIronic similes are a form of verbal irony where a speaker intends to communicate the opposite of what they mean. For instance, the following explicit similes begin with the deceptive formation of a statement that means \"A\" but that eventually conveys the meaning \"not A\":\n\nThe irony is recognizable in each case only by using knowledge of the source concepts (e.g., that mud is opaque, that root canal surgery is painful) to detect an incongruity.\n\nA fair amount of confusion has surrounded the issue of the relationship between verbal irony and sarcasm.\n\nFowler's \"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage\" states: Sarcasm does not necessarily involve irony and irony has often no touch of sarcasm. This suggests that the two concepts are linked but may be considered separately. \"The Oxford English Dictionary\"'s entry for sarcasm does not mention irony, but the irony entry includes:\nThe \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" has \"Non-literary irony is often called sarcasm\"; while the \"Webster's Dictionary\" entry is:\nPartridge in \"Usage and Abusage\" would separate the two forms of speech completely: \nIrony must not be confused with sarcasm, which is direct: sarcasm means precisely what it says, but in a sharp, caustic, ... manner. \n\nThe psychologist Martin, in \"The Psychology of Humour\", is quite clear that irony is where \"the literal meaning is opposite to the intended\" and sarcasm is \"aggressive humor that pokes fun\". He has the following examples: for irony he uses the statement \"What a nice day\" when it is raining. For sarcasm, he cites Winston Churchill, who is supposed to have said, when told by Bessie Braddock that he was drunk, \"But I shall be sober in the morning, and you will still be ugly\", as being sarcastic, while not saying the opposite of what is intended.\n\nPsychology researchers Lee and Katz (1998) have addressed the issue directly. They found that ridicule is an important aspect of sarcasm, but not of verbal irony in general. By this account, sarcasm is a particular kind of personal criticism levelled against a person or group of persons that incorporates verbal irony. For example, a woman reports to her friend that rather than going to a medical doctor to treat her cancer, she has decided to see a spiritual healer instead. In response her friend says sarcastically, \"Oh, brilliant, what an ingenious idea, that's really going to cure you.\" The friend could have also replied with any number of ironic expressions that should not be labeled as sarcasm exactly, but still have many shared elements with sarcasm.\n\nMost instances of verbal irony are labeled by research subjects as sarcastic, suggesting that the term \"sarcasm\" is more widely used than its technical definition suggests it should be (Bryant & Fox Tree, 2002; Gibbs, 2000). Some psycholinguistic theorists (e.g., Gibbs, 2000) suggest that sarcasm (\"Great idea!\", \"I hear they do fine work.\"), hyperbole (\"That's the best idea I have heard in years!\"), understatement (\"Sure, what the hell, it's only cancer...\"), rhetorical questions (\"What, does your spirit have cancer?\"), double entendre (\"I'll bet if you do that, you'll be communing with spirits in no time...\") and jocularity (\"Get them to fix your bad back while you're at it.\") should all be considered forms of verbal irony. The differences between these rhetorical devices (tropes) can be quite subtle and relate to typical emotional reactions of listeners, and the rhetorical goals of the speakers. Regardless of the various ways theorists categorize figurative language types, people in conversation who are attempting to interpret speaker intentions and discourse goals do not generally identify, by name, the kinds of tropes used (Leggitt & Gibbs, 2000).\n\nEchoic allusion is the main component involved in conveying verbally ironic meaning. It is best described as a speech act by which the speaker simultaneously represents a thought, belief or idea, and implicitly attributes this idea to someone else who is wrong or deluded. In this way, the speaker intentionally dissociates themselves from the idea and conveys their tacit dissent, thereby providing a different meaning to their utterance. In some cases, the speaker can provide stronger dissociation from the represented thought by also implying derision toward the idea or outwardly making fun of the person or people they attribute it to.\n\nEchoic allusion, like other forms of verbal irony, relies on semantically disambiguating cues to be interpreted correctly. These cues often come in the form of paralinguistic markers such as prosody, tone, or pitch, as well as nonverbal cues like hand gesture, facial expression and eye gaze.\n\nAn example of echoic allusion and its disambiguating paralinguistic markers is as follows:\nFrom simple semantic analysis, Person 2 appears to believe Person 1. However, if this conversation is given the context of Person 2 walking in on Person 1 about to eat some cake, and Person 2 speaking their sentence in a significantly decreased rate of speech and lowered tone, the interpretation of \"I just must have been mistaken\" changes. Instead of being taken as Person 2 believing Person 1, the utterance calls to mind someone who would believe Person 1, while also conveying Person 2's implication that said individual would be considered gullible. From this, Person 2 negates the possible interpretation that they believe Person 1.\n\nDramatic irony exploits the device of giving the spectator an item of information that at least one of the characters in the narrative is unaware of (at least consciously), thus placing the spectator a step ahead of at least one of the characters. Connop Thirlwall in his 1833 article \"On the Irony of Sophocles\" originally highlighted the role of irony in drama. \"The Oxford English Dictionary\" defines dramatic irony as:\nAccording to Stanton, dramatic irony has three stages—installation, exploitation, and resolution (often also called preparation, suspension, and resolution)\n—producing dramatic conflict in what one character relies or appears to rely upon, the \"contrary\" of which is known by observers (especially the audience; sometimes to other characters within the drama) to be true. In summary, it means that the reader/watcher/listener knows something that one or more of the characters in the piece is not aware of.\n\nFor example:\n\nTragic irony is a special category of dramatic irony. In tragic irony, the words and actions of the characters contradict the real situation, which the spectators fully realize. \"The Oxford English Dictionary\" defines this as:\nAncient Greek drama was especially characterized by tragic irony because the audiences were so familiar with the legends that most of the plays dramatized. Sophocles' \"Oedipus Rex\" provides a classic example of tragic irony at its fullest. Colebrook writes:\n\nFurther, Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for the plague that he has caused, not knowing that the murderer he has cursed and vowed to find is himself. The audience knows that Oedipus himself is the murderer that he is seeking; Oedipus, Creon, and Jocasta do not.\n\nIrony has some of its foundation in the onlooker's perception of paradox that arises from insoluble problems. For example, in the William Shakespeare play \"Romeo and Juliet\", when Romeo finds Juliet in a drugged, deathlike sleep, he assumes her to be dead. The audience knows that Juliet has faked her death, yet Romeo believes she is truly dead, and commits suicide. Upon awakening to find her dead lover beside her, Juliet stabs herself with a dagger thus killing herself, too.\n\nSituational irony is a relatively modern use of the term, and describes a sharp discrepancy between the expected result and actual results in a certain situation.\nLars Elleström writes:\"Situational irony\" ... is most broadly defined as a situation where the outcome is incongruous with what was expected, but it is also more generally understood as a situation that includes contradictions or sharp contrasts. \n\nFor example:\n\nThe expression cosmic irony or \"irony of fate\" stems from the notion that the gods (or the Fates) are amusing themselves by toying with the minds of mortals with deliberate ironic intent. Closely connected with situational irony, it arises from sharp contrasts between reality and human ideals, or between human intentions and actual results. The resulting situation is poignantly contrary to what was expected or intended.\n\nAccording to Sudhir Dixit, \"Cosmic irony is a term that is usually associated with [Thomas] Hardy. ... There is a strong feeling of a hostile deus ex machina in Hardy's novels.\" In \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" \"there are several instances of this type of irony.\" One example follows:\n\n\"Justice\" was done, and the President of the Immortals (in Æschylean phrase) had ended his sport with Tess.\n\nWhen history is seen through modern eyes, there often appear sharp contrasts between the way historical figures see their world's future and what actually transpires. For example, during the 1920s \"The New York Times\" repeatedly scorned crossword puzzles. In 1924, it lamented \"the sinful waste in the utterly futile finding of words the letters of which will fit into a prearranged pattern.\" In 1925 it said \"the question of whether the puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need of an answer. The craze evidently is dying out fast.\" Today, no U.S. newspaper is more closely identified with the crossword than \"The New York Times.\"\n\nIn a more tragic example of historical irony, what people now refer to as the \"First World War\" was called by H. G. Wells \"the war that will end war\", which soon became \"the war to end war\" and \"the war to end all wars\", and this became a widespread truism, almost a cliché. Historical irony is therefore a subset of cosmic irony, but one in which the element of time is bound to play a role. Another example could be that of the Vietnam War, where in the 1960s the US attempted to stop the Viet Cong (Viet Minh) taking over South Vietnam. However, it is an often ignored fact that, in 1941, the US originally supported the Viet Minh in its fight against Japanese occupation.\n\nIn the introduction to \"The Irony of American History\", Andrew Bacevich writes:\nGunpowder was, according to prevailing academic consensus, discovered in the 9th century by Chinese alchemists searching for an elixir of immortality.\n\nHistorical irony also includes inventors killed by their own creations, such as William Bullock – unless, due to the nature of the invention, the risk of death was always known and accepted, as in the case of Otto Lilienthal, who was killed by flying a glider of his own devising.\n\nIn certain kinds of situational or historical irony, a factual truth is highlighted by some person's complete ignorance of it or his belief in its opposite. However, this state of affairs does not occur by human design. In some religious contexts, such situations have been seen as the deliberate work of divine providence to emphasize truths and to taunt humans for not being aware of them when they could easily have been enlightened (this is similar to human use of irony). Such ironies are often more evident, or more striking, when viewed retrospectively in the light of later developments which make the truth of past situations obvious to all.\n\nOther prominent examples of outcomes now seen as poignantly contrary to expectation include:\n\n\nIrony is often used in literature to produce a comic effect. This may also be combined with satire. For instance, an author may facetiously state something as a well-known fact and then demonstrate through the narrative that the fact is untrue.\n\nJane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\" begins with the proposition \"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\" In fact, it soon becomes clear that Austen means the opposite: women (or their mothers) are always in search of, and desperately on the lookout for, a rich single man to make a husband. The irony deepens as the story promotes this romance and ends in a double marriage proposal. \"Austen's comic irony emerges out of the disjunction between Elizabeth's overconfidence (or pride) in her perceptions of Darcy and the narrator's indications that her views are in fact partial and prejudicial.\"\n\n\"\"The Third Man\" is a film that features any number of eccentricities, each of which contributes to the film's perspective of comic irony as well as its overall cinematic self-consciousness.\"\n\nWriting about performances of Shakespeare's \"Othello\" in apartheid South Africa, Robert Gordon suggests: \"Could it be that black people in the audience ... may have viewed as a comic irony his audacity and naïvety in thinking he could pass for white.\"\n\nRomantic irony is \"an attitude of detached scepticism adopted by an author towards his or her work, typically manifesting in literary self-consciousness and self-reflection\". This conception of irony originated with the German Romantic writer and critic Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel.\n\nJoseph Dane writes \"From a twentieth-century perspective, the most crucial area in the history of irony is that described by the term romantic irony.\" He discusses the difficulty of defining romantic irony: \"But what is romantic irony? A universal type of irony? The irony used by romantics? or an irony envisioned by the romantics and romanticists?\" He also describes the arguments for and against its use.\n\nReferring to earlier self-conscious works such as Don Quixote and Tristram Shandy, Douglas Muecke points particularly to Peter Weiss's 1964 play, \"Marat/Sade\". This work is a play within a play set in a lunatic asylum, in which it is difficult to tell whether the players are speaking only to other players or also directly to the audience. When The Herald says, \"The regrettable incident you've just seen was unavoidable indeed foreseen by our playwright\", there is confusion as to who is being addressed, the \"audience\" on the stage or the audience in the theatre. Also, since the play within the play is performed by the inmates of a lunatic asylum, the theatre audience cannot tell whether the paranoia displayed before them is that of the players, or the people they are portraying. Muecke notes that, \"in America, Romantic irony has had a bad press\", while \"in England ... [it] is almost unknown.\"\n\nHowever, in a book entitled \"English Romantic Irony\", Anne Mellor writes, referring to Byron, Keats, Carlyle, Coleridge, and Lewis Carroll:\nSimilarly, metafiction is: \"Fiction in which the author self-consciously alludes to the artificiality or literariness of a work by parodying or departing from novelistic conventions (esp. naturalism) and narrative techniques.\" It is a type of fiction that self-consciously addresses the devices of fiction, thereby exposing the fictional illusion.\n\nGesa Giesing writes that \"the most common form of metafiction is particularly frequent in Romantic literature. The phenomenon is then referred to as Romantic Irony.\" Giesing notes that \"There has obviously been an increased interest in metafiction again after World War II.\"\n\nFor examples, Patricia Waugh quotes from several works at the top of her chapter headed \"What is metafiction?\". These include:\n\n\"The thing is this./ That of all the several ways of beginning a book ... I am confident my own way of doing it is best\" - \"Tristram Shandy\"\n\n\"Since I've started this story, I've gotten boils ...\" - \"The death of the novel and other stories\" by Ronald Sukenick\n\nAdditionally, \"The Cambridge Introduction to Postmodern Fiction\" refers to John Fowles's \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\":\nFor the first twelve chapters ... the reader has been able to immerse him or herself in the story, enjoying the kind of 'suspension of disbelief ' required of realist novels ... what follows is a remarkable act of metafictional 'frame-breaking'. Chapter 13 notoriously begins:\n\nI do not know. This story I am telling is all imagination. These characters I create never existed outside my own mind. ... if this is a novel, it cannot be a novel in the modern sense.\n\nSocratic irony is \"the dissimulation of ignorance practised by Socrates as a means of confuting an adversary\". Socrates would pretend to be ignorant of the topic under discussion, to draw out the inherent nonsense in the arguments of his interlocutors. \"The Chambers Dictionary\" defines it as \"a means by which a questioner pretends to know less than a respondent, when actually he knows more\".\n\nZoe Williams of \"The Guardian\" wrote: \"The technique [of Socratic irony], demonstrated in the Platonic dialogues, was to pretend ignorance and, more sneakily, to feign credence in your opponent's power of thought, in order to tie him in knots.\"\n\nA more modern example of Socratic irony can be seen on the American crime fiction television series, \"Columbo\". The character Lt. Columbo is seemingly naïve and incompetent. His untidy appearance adds to this fumbling illusion. As a result, he is underestimated by the suspects in murder cases he is investigating. With their guard down and their false sense of confidence, Lt. Columbo is able to solve the cases, leaving the murderers feeling duped and outwitted.\n\nDanish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, and others, see irony, such as that used by Socrates, as a disruptive force with the power to undo texts and readers alike. The phrase itself is taken from Hegel's \"Lectures on Aesthetics\", and is applied by Kierkegaard to the irony of Socrates. This tradition includes 19th-century German critic and novelist Friedrich Schlegel (\"On Incomprehensibility\"), Charles Baudelaire, Stendhal, and the 20th century deconstructionist Paul de Man (\"The Concept of Irony\"). In Kierkegaard's words, from On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates:\n[Socratic] irony [is] the infinite absolute negativity. It is negativity, because it only negates; it is infinite, because it does not negate this or that phenomenon; it is absolute, because that by virtue of which it negates is a higher something that still is not. The irony established nothing, because that which is to be established lies behind it...\n\nWhere much of philosophy attempts to reconcile opposites into a larger positive project, Kierkegaard and others insist that irony—whether expressed in complex games of authorship or simple litotes—must, in Kierkegaard's words, \"swallow its own stomach\". Irony entails endless reflection and violent reversals, and ensures incomprehensibility at the moment it compels speech. Similarly, among other literary critics, writer David Foster Wallace viewed the pervasiveness of ironic and other postmodern tropes as the cause of \"great despair and stasis in U.S. culture, and that for aspiring fictionists [ironies] pose terrifically vexing problems.\"\n\nThe '90s saw an expansion of the definition of irony from \"saying what one doesn't mean\" into a \"general stance of detachment from life in general\", this detachment serving as a shield against the awkwardness of everyday life. Humor from that era (most notably, \"Seinfeld\") relies on the audience watching the show with some detachment from the show's typical signature awkward situations.\n\nThe generation of people in the United States who grew up in the 90s, Millennials, are seen as having this same sort of detachment from serious or awkward situations in life, as well. Hipsters are thought to use irony as a shield against those same serious or genuine confrontations.\n\nSome speakers of English complain that the words \"irony\" and \"ironic\" are often misused, though the more general casual usage of a contradiction between circumstance and expectation originates in the 1640s.\n\nDan Shaughnessy wrote:\nWe were always kidding about the use of irony. I maintained that it was best never to use the word because it was too often substituted for coincidence. (Alanis Morissette's song \"Isn't it Ironic?\" cites multiple examples of things that are patently not ironic.)\n\nTim Conley cites the following:\n\"Philip Howard assembled a list of seven implied meanings for the word \"ironically\", as it opens a sentence:\n\nNo agreed-upon method for indicating irony in written text exists, though many ideas have been suggested. For instance, an irony punctuation mark was proposed in the 1580s, when Henry Denham introduced a rhetorical question mark or percontation point, which resembles a reversed question mark. This mark was also advocated by the French poet Marcel Bernhardt at the end of the 19th century, to indicate irony or sarcasm. French writer Hervé Bazin suggested another \"pointe d'ironie\": the Greek letter \"psi\" with a dot below it, while Tom Driberg recommended that ironic statements should be printed in italics that lean the other way from conventional italics.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33375023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33375023", "title": "Misogyny and mass media", "text": "Misogyny and mass media\n\nExamples of misogyny exist in many published forms, within multiple cultures and well-observed works. Technological advances in the modern era have contributed proficient means to media and marketing to the resultant mass media in the 21st century. The merging of misogyny and mass media has made numerous examples where studies have concluded correlations between misogynous messages, both obvious and subliminal. Corresponding physical appearance of violence and hateful conduct may be seen relative to exposure.\n\nMessages containing misogynous views are found commonly in the media. Cooper (1985) found after analyzing popular music over 30 years, that there was a tendency to describe women in terms of physical attributes or as evil, as possessions of men, or as dependent upon men. Dietz states that the concept of masculinity has come to be associated with sexual aggression. It is thought that audiences of unpunished violent behavior, compared to audiences of punished violent behavior are more likely to take part in violence. Some musical themes and lyrics can be compared to the negative attitude toward women found within some pornographic movies and magazines. This negative attitude and acceptance of violence towards women shows the possible likelihood of rape or sexual coercion. Fischer and Greitemeyer found that men who listened to sexually aggressive music reported that their relationship with women was more troublesome. Media Violence research has found that aggressive music adds an accessibility of aggressive related attitudes and emotions. Roberta Hamilton in her book \"Does Misogyny Matter?\" (1987) stated,\"Misogyny is not a word useful simply for describing particularly nasty bits of behavior, but rather it directs us to a set of relations, attitudes, and behaviors that are embedded within all social relations\"(p. 123). Violence in the form of linguistics is in fact a form of physical violence.\n\nRubin, West and Mitchell (2001) found that many studies have seen consumers of rap and heavy metal music as having more hostile attitudes, higher sexual activity and more drug use than consumers of other music.\n\nThemes of misogyny can be seen in much gangsta rap (GR) music. This music elevates degradations of women such as rape, torment, and violence. In a study conducted by Armstrong in 2001, he found after examining 490 GR songs, that 22 percent contained violent and misogynist lyrics. Wester, Crown, Quatman, and Heesacker state that, \"The increasing popularity of GR, coupled with documentation of society's increased sexism, domestic violence, sexual assault and other forms of degradation of women suggest that perhaps GR is partly to blame for an increase in anti-female attitudes and behaviors. It is difficult to tell whether GR directly causes misogynous attitudes or if it serves to increase preexisting anti-female cultural values. The difference between rap music and other types of music is that the lyrics are generally the main focus of attention. Rappers seem to commit themselves to worst impulses by telling their stories in the first-person.\n\nIn a study conducted by Barongan and Hall (1995), they had male college students listen to rap music with misogynous or neutral song lyrics. After listening to the different music, they viewed three different vignettes. These vignettes were either sexual-violent, neutral, or assaultive. Then the students were asked to choose one of the three vignettes to show a female. Those who had listened to the misogynous music were significantly more likely to show the female the assaultive vignette.\n\nRegarding gangsta rap Yo-Yo states that, \"The harder that you are, sad to say, the more you sell\".\n\nMisogyny was not found in rap music until the 1980s even though it had been in the commercial market for 10 years. Some artists such as 2 Live Crew, Ice-T, and N.W.A. integrated misogynous lyrics into their rap songs. Women are reduced to objects – specifically objects that are only good for abuse, sex and for the most part are just trouble for men within misogynous rap. Using such misogynistic lyrics allows degradation of their female counterparts while boosting themselves up.\n\nThis acceptance of misogyny can be seen in many rap lyrics. For example, in N.W.A's \"She Swallowed It\" (1991) gives a clear description;\n\nScenes of physical harm can be seen in Too $hort \"All My Bitches Are Gone\"(1993);\n\nThe artist Eminem is well known for his rap music containing extremely misogynous lyrics. In 2002 his Album \"The Eminem Show\" sold 7.4 million copies.\n\nIn a study conducted by Lawrence and Joyner, it was found that people exposed to sexually violent or heavy metal music were found to have a higher tendency on sex-role stereotyping in comparison to those who listened to classical music. Researchers suggest that; distrust, assault, and negative regard for women are common attitudes experienced by fans of different types of rock music.\n\nMost violent lyrics are not heard due to the fact a large number of listeners are not actually listening to the lyrics. This is very different from video-based media, in which the audience can see the violent message very clearly. It has also been found that some rock lyrics are so distorted that people just assume what they are actually saying. A majority of people often listen to just the music and not the lyrics while some listen to it while focusing on other tasks.\n\nResearch of rap music also suggests that it may contain positive images. Zillman et al. proposed that rap music is used as a way to fight oppression from the dominant culture. It was also found by Kubrin that 68 percent of all gangsta rap's focal point is about respect. It is a \"cultural response to historic oppression and racism, [and] a system for communication among black communities throughout the United States.\" With both gleeful and aggressive views on the situation of black Americans, Hip Hop artists were spread reality and lessons learned in a way that is understandable by a younger generation. Some call it a \"street-leveling language\".\n\nFelson, professor of crime, law, and justice and sociology at Penn State, states that a crowd of onlookers enjoys a street fight just as the Romans enjoyed the gladiators. Found frequently in \"MTV\" music videos are images of crime, sex, dance, visual abstraction and violence. Audiences of \"MTV\" tend to be between the ages of fourteen and thirty-four, therefore has potential of contributing to cultural norms. Smith and Boyson found that fifteen percent of music videos contain violence. Before the introduction of music videos, research found that both music and television retained adolescents' attention, but music effectively connected with their emotions. It is far more common to see a man being dominant over a woman, rather than a woman being dominant over a man in music videos. A study conducted by Rich, Woods, Goodman, Emans, and DuRant found that out of 518 music videos and among the 391 acts of violence the aggressors were 78 percent male and the victims were 46 percent female. The need for artists to fill hours of airtime on television make certain that artists and their videos increasingly become more shocking, as to be noticed. Violence and sex or the combination of the two, are most often used for a shocking effect on viewers.\n\nIn a content analysis of rock music videos, Vincent, Davis and Boruszkowski found that 57 percent showed women in a \"patronizing\" way (such as; victims, sex objects, and stupid) and 20 percent of them were found placed in traditional sex roles (domestic, motherly, and submissive), another eight percent demonstrated women receiving violence from a male. The amount where women were shown as equal to men was only fourteen percent. Lawrence and Joyner found in their research of rock music videos that even after a brief exposure of seventeen minutes there was appearance of negative effects on men's attitudes toward women.\n\nJohnson et al. found that women portrayed in sexually inferior roles in rap music videos have increased girls’ acceptance of teen dating violence. They also found that these videos did not increase boy's acceptance of teen violence. Sommers-Flanagan found that not only are women shown in a position of submission to men, they are also shown in a more negative light than men in rap music videos. Conrad et al. found that recent (2009) rap music videos emphasize themes of misogyny, materialism and women tend to be placed in a position of objectification.\n\nIn addition to women being placed in objectified positions, they are \"criticized and loved at the same time for being covered up versus being scantily dressed.\" Women in the rap industry are most commonly only mentioned by the media when it is to further stigmatize men, or to promote the stereotype that all black women are on welfare or are gold-diggers.\n\nIn a 1998 study conducted by Tracy L. Dietz, professor of Sociology & Anthropology at the University of Central Florida, sampled 33 prominent Nintendo and Sega games and found that nearly 80 percent of the video games had some violence and aggression as part of the main strategy or object. Dietz claimed that violence was directed specifically towards women in 21% of the games sampled. Also in 28 percent of the games women were, according to Dietz, seen as sex objects and in 41 percent of the games there were no female characters. Overall Dietz asserted that most video games minimize the role of females or leave females out of the game all together, and that when females were shown they were usually depicted in a supporting role to men or dependent upon the male. Women were also seen as contributing less than males and were their sex objects. Dietz stated that these depictions of women may allow boys and girls to internalize and accept the thought that women are victims, weak, and sex objects.\n\nBy making misogyny sexual, pornography teaches misogyny to its viewers. Negative effects from pornography have been thought to occur due to a violence component, and not to a sexual component. Males who have been previously enraged by a female are more likely to produce aggression against a female after being shown pornography depicting violence. The combination of sex and aggression is increasingly being shown within pornographic material, therefore could be a possible trigger for aggressively willing men to physical assault accessible women. The attorney general's commission found that viewing of sexually aggressive pornography is causally connected to sexual violent behavior. Sexual violence portrayed in pornography as pleasurable to the victim may increase approval of sexual coercion, there by relating to sexual violence. A common theme found within pornography is women enjoying victimization. This theme can be seen to give reason for violence and decrease general inhibitions against aggression.\n\nBarron and Kimmel found that Usenet contains less consensual sex and more coercive sex in the scenes depicted. Within Usenet it was found that 62.7 percent of the scenes had a male perpetrators and only 42.4 percent of the scenes contained female perpetrators. Victims within Usenet was found to be females 84.7 percent of the time. At nearly no expense Usenet offers the greatest access to the largest number of viewers.\n\nA summary of the effects of pornography research by Linz and Donnerstein (1989) concluded that depictions of sexual violence in the media, under some conditions, promote antisocial attitudes and behavior. Linz and Donnerstein focused on the detrimental effects of exposure to violent images in pornography portraying the myth that women enjoy or in some way benefit from rape, torture, or other forms of sexual violence. Other research has found similar outcomes (e.g., Allen et al., 1995). The viewing of coercive pornography relates to the strongest acceptance of rape myths, i.e. women want to be raped, women \"ask for it\", women want to be forced. Considering the commodification and objectification argument, concern exists that repeated exposure to coercive pornographic stimuli relates to increasingly negative attitudes toward women. More frequent use increased the dehumanizing effect of Internet pornography and led to more acceptance of violence toward women.\n\nPornography has been found to desensitize societies to violence against women, inspiring rapes and contributing to the sexual subordination of women to men (2009). Making their materials, pornographers exploit existing inequality between the sexes to coerce women and children to perform unwanted or dangerous sexual acts as a form of prostitution. Existing legal regulations in democratic societies have not approached pornography with these realities in mind, but usually rather as a right protected by freedom of expression, or as an \"obscene\" expression offending the public rather than harming any particular group. In rare but important instances, pornography has legally been seen as a harmful practice violating women's human or democratic rights to equality.\n\nMost studies consistently show that after exposure to pornography and other forms of misogynistic media depicting degradation of women and rape, including hip hop and rap, viewers show attitudes that are less sympathetic to rape victims and more tolerant and accepting of violence toward women – in effect, such behavior becomes more \"normalized\" and \"mainstreamed. It's desensitizing and addictive potentials are well-documented in its users.\"\n\nInternet misogyny is enacted in different forms and on different platforms. When one objectifies or harasses online, they are likely doing so anonymously and using shaming tactics to stigmatize the victim's identity or body. In this anonymity, the objectifier averts all real-life responsibility while nonetheless enforcing real-life consequences for the woman. This tactic of anonymity fosters Internet objectification because it allows the objectifier to create a desired situation where the woman deals with the responsibilities instead of the objectifier.\n\n"}

In the early 1990s, \"Foreign Correspondent\" reported on the Museum of Bad Art in Dedham, United States. At this point of her life, Round was in the process of establishing a retail shop named \"Fat Helen’s Bric a Brac shop\", that was to specialise in the kitsch, inane and tasteless. It was also a hobby of Round's to peruse op shops, garage sales and markets. She was inspired by what she came across in these places and commenced her pursuit of collecting and preserving the mediocre. Round started collecting in 1993.\n\nSince then, Round has collected 200 examples of original art of poor taste.

{"id": "26744396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26744396", "title": "Play (theatre)", "text": "Play (theatre)\n\nA play is a form of literature written by a playwright, usually consisting of dialogue and singing between characters, intended for theatrical performance rather than just reading. Plays are performed at a variety of levels, from Broadway, Off-Broadway, regional theater, to Community theatre, as well as university or school productions. There are rare dramatists, notably George Bernard Shaw, who have had little preference as to whether their plays were performed or read. The term \"play\" can refer to both the written texts of playwrights and to their complete theatrical performance.\n\nComedies are plays which are designed to be humorous. Comedies are often filled with witty remarks, unusual characters, and strange circumstances. Certain comedies are geared toward different age groups. Comedies were one of the two original play types of Ancient Greece, along with tragedies. An example of a comedy would be William Shakespeare's play \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", or for a more modern example the skits from \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nA generally nonsensical genre of play, farces are often acted and often involve humor. An example of a farce includes William Shakespeare's play \"The Comedy of Errors\", or Mark Twain's play \"Is He Dead?\".\n\nA satire play takes a comic look at current events people while at the same time attempting to make a political or social statement, for example pointing out corruption. An example of a satire would be Nikolai Gogol's \"The Government Inspector\" and Aristophanes' \"Lysistrata\". Satire plays are generally one of the most popular forms of comedy, and often considered to be their own genre entirely.\n\nRestoration comedy is a genre that explored relationships between men and women, and was considered risqué in its time. Characters featured in restoration comedy included stereotypes of all kinds, and these same stereotypes were found in most plays of this genre, so much so that most plays were very similar in message and content. However, since restoration comedy dealt with unspoken aspects of relationships, it created a type of connection between audience and performance that was more informal and private.\n\nIt is commonly agreed that restoration comedy has origins in Molière’s theories of comedy, but differs in intention and tone. The inconsistency between restoration comedy’s morals and the morals of the era is something that often arises during the study of this genre. This may give clues as to why, despite its original success, restoration comedy did not last long in the seventeenth century. However, in recent years, it has become a topic of interest for theatre theorists, who have been looking into theatre styles that have their own conventions of performance.\n\nThese plays contain darker themes such as death and disaster. Often the protagonist of the play has a tragic flaw, a trait which leads to their downfall. Tragic plays convey all emotions and have very dramatic conflicts. Tragedy was one of the two original play types of Ancient Greece. Some examples of tragedies include William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", and also John Webster's play \"The Duchess of Malfi\".\n\nThese plays focus on actual historical events. They can be tragedies or comedies, but are often neither of these. History as a separate genre was popularized by William Shakespeare. Examples of historical plays include Friedrich Schiller's \"Demetrius\" and William Shakespeare's \"King John\".\n\nBallad opera, a popular theatre style at the time, was the first style of musical to be performed in the American colonies. The first musical of American origin was premiered in Philadelphia in 1767, and was called “The Disappointment”, however, this play never made it to production. Around the 1920s, theatre styles were beginning to be defined more clearly. For musical theatre, this meant that composers gained the right to create every song in the play, and these new plays were held to more specific conventions, such as thirty-two-bar songs. When the Great Depression came, many people left Broadway for Hollywood, and the atmosphere of Broadway musicals changed significantly. A similar situation occurred during the 1960s, when composers were scarce and musicals lacked vibrancy and entertainment value.\n\nBy the 1990s, there were very few original Broadway musicals, as many were recreations of movies or novels.\nMusical productions have songs to help explain the story and move the ideas of the play along. They are usually accompanied by dancing. Musicals can be very elaborate in settings and actor performances. Examples of musical productions include \"Wicked\" and \"Fiddler on the Roof\".\n\nThis theatre style originated in the 1940s when Antonin Artaud hypothesized about the effects of expressing through the body as opposed to “by socially conditioned thought.” In 1946, he wrote a preface to his works in which he explained how he came to write what and the way he did.\n\nAbove all, Artaud did not trust language as a means of communication. Plays within the genre of theatre of cruelty are abstract in convention and content. Artaud wanted his plays to have an effect and accomplish something. His intention was to symbolise the subconscious through bodily performances, as he did not believe language could be effective. Artaud considered his plays to be an enactment rather than a re-enactment, which meant he believed his actors were in reality, rather than re-enacting reality.\n\nHis plays dealt with heavy issues such as patients in psych wards, and Nazi Germany. Through these performances, he wanted to “make the causes of suffering audible”, however, audiences originally reacted poorly, as they were so taken aback by what they saw. Much of his work was banned in France at the time.\n\nArtaud did not believe that conventional theatre of the time would allow the audience to have a cathartic experience and help heal the wounds of World War II. For this reason, he moved towards radio-based theatre, in which the audience could use their imagination to connect the words they were hearing to their body. This made his work much more personal and individualized, which he believed would increase the effectiveness of portraying suffering.\n\nTheatre of the Absurd: This genre generally includes metaphysical representations of existential qualms and questions. Theatre of the absurd denies rationality, and embraces the inevitability of falling into the abyss of the human condition. Instead of discussing these issues, however, theatre of the absurd is a demonstration of them. This leaves the audience to discuss and question the content of the play for themselves.\n\nOne of the main aspects of theatre of the absurd is the physical contradiction to language. Oftentimes, the dialogue between characters will directly oppose their actions.\n\nFamous playwrights within this genre include Beckett, Sartre, Ionesco, Adamov, and Genet.\n\nThe term \"play\" can be either a general term, or more specifically refer to a non-musical play. Sometimes the term \"straight play\" is used in contrast to \"musical\", which refers to a play based on music, dance, and songs sung by the play's characters. For a short play, the term \"playlet\" is sometimes used.\n\n"}

It needs a speaker and a listener, a performer and an audience. It is a bodily creation that thrives in live connection.\nThe voice is the mechanism by which a \"poet's voice\" comes alive. Reciting a poem aloud the reciter comes to understand and then to be the 'voice' of the poem. As poetry is a vocal art, the speaker brings their own experience to it, changing it according to their own sensibilities, intonation, the matter of sound making sense; controlled through pitch and stress, poems are full of invisible italicized contrasts. Reading poetry aloud also makes clear the \"pause\" as an element of poetry.\n\n\"The hearing knowledge we bring to a line if poetry is a knowledge of patterns of speech we have known since we were infants.\" Every speaker intuitively course through manipulations of sounds, almost as if we sing to each other all day. Even after three millennia of writing, poetry retains its appeal to the ear, the silent reading eye thereof, thereafter, hears what it is seeing. Sound that was imagined through the eye gradually gave body to poems in performance.\n\nA public reading is typically given on a small stage in a café or bookstore, although reading by prominent poets frequently are booked into larger venues such as amphitheaters and college auditoriums, 'to take poetry public'.\n\nPoetry readings almost always involve poets reading their own work or reciting it from memory but readings often involve several readers (often called \"featured poets\" or \"featureds\"), although normally one poet is chosen as a \"headliner\".\n\nAmerican poet Donald Hall described the increase in emphasis on public readings of poetry in the United States in a 2012 \"New Yorker\" magazine blog post where he recounted it a phenomenon that grew in the last half of the twentieth century.\n\nHall, who speculates that the change may have been due to the star power of Dylan Thomas, wrote, \"It used to be that one poet in each generation performed poems in public. In the twenties, it was Vachel Lindsay, who sometimes dropped to his knees in the middle of a poem. Then Robert Frost took over, and made his living largely on the road.\" Hall suggests that poetry readings have shifted the focus of poetry more towards sound, adding that \"In concentrating on sound, as in anything else, there are things to beware of. Revising a poem one morning, I found myself knowing that a new phrase was repellent, but realized it would pass if I intoned it out loud. Watch out. A poem must work from the platform but it must also work on the page.\"\n\nA poetry slam is a competitive format that has become increasingly popular, especially in the United States, since its inception in the 1980s. A \"slam\" is the art of poetry presented in public as is the \"open mic\" event variant.\n\n"}

{"id": "468458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=468458", "title": "Ripley's Believe It or Not!", "text": "Ripley's Believe It or Not!\n\nRipley's Believe It or Not! is an American franchise, founded by Robert Ripley, which deals in bizarre events and items so strange and unusual that readers might question the claims. Originally a newspaper panel, the \"Believe It or Not\" feature proved popular and was later adapted into a wide variety of formats, including radio, television, comic books, a chain of museums, and a book series.\n\nThe Ripley collection includes 20,000 photographs, 30,000 artifacts and more than 100,000 cartoon panels. With 80-plus attractions, the Orlando-based Ripley Entertainment, Inc., a division of the Jim Pattison Group, is a global company with an annual attendance of more than 12 million guests. Ripley Entertainment's publishing and broadcast divisions oversee numerous projects, including the syndicated TV series, the newspaper cartoon panel, books, posters, and games.\n\nRipley first called his cartoon feature, originally involving sports feats, \"Champs and Chumps\", and it premiered on December 19, 1918, in the \"New York Globe\". Ripley began adding items unrelated to sports, and in October 1919, he changed the title to \"Believe It or Not\". When the \"Globe\" folded in 1923, Ripley moved to the \"New York Evening Post\". In 1924, the panel began being syndicated by Associated Newspapers, (formed as part of a cooperative that had included the \"Globe\"). That same year, Ripley hired Norbert Pearlroth as his researcher, and Pearlroth spent the next 52 years of his life in the New York Public Library, working ten hours a day and six days a week in order to find unusual facts for Ripley.\n\nOther writers and researchers included Lester Byck. In 1930, Ripley moved to the \"New York American\" and was picked up by the King Features Syndicate, being quickly syndicated on an international basis.\n\nRipley died in 1949; those working on the syndicated newspaper panel after his death included Paul Frehm (1938–1978; he became the full-time artist in 1949), and his brother Walter Frehm (1948–1989); Walter worked part-time with his brother Paul and became a full-time Ripley artist from 1978 to 1989. Others who assisted included Clem Gretter (1941–1949), Bob Clarke (1943–1944), Joe Campbell (1946–1956), Art Sloggatt (1971–1975), Carl Dorese, and Stan Randall. Paul Frehm won the National Cartoonists Society's Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1976 for his work on the series. Clarke later created parodies of \"Believe It or Not!\" for \"Mad\", as did Wally Wood and Ernie Kovacs, who also did a recurring satire called \"Strangely Believe It!\" on his TV programs. Other strips and books borrowed the Ripley design and format, such as Ralph Graczak's \"Our Own Oddities\", John Hix's \"Strange as it Seems\", and Gordon Johnston's \"It Happened in Canada\". The current artist is John Graziano and current researcher is Sabrina Sieck.\n\nAt the peak of its popularity, the syndicated feature was read daily by about 80 million readers, and during the first three weeks of May 1932 alone, Ripley received over two million pieces of fan mail. Dozens of paperback editions reprinting the newspaper panels have been published over the decades. Recent \"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\" books containing new material have supplemented illustrations with photographs.\n\n\"Peanuts\" creator Charles M. Schulz's first publication of artwork was published by Ripley. It was a cartoon claiming his dog was \"a hunting dog who eats pins, tacks, screws, nails and razor blades.\" Schulz's dog Spike later became the model for \"Peanuts\"' Snoopy.\n\nSome notable books:\n\nA series of paperback books containing annotated sketches from the newspaper feature:\n\nRipley Entertainment produces a range of books featuring unusual facts, news stories and photographs. In 2004 Ripley Entertainment founded Ripley Publishing Ltd, based in the United Kingdom, to publish new \"Believe It or Not\" titles. The company produces \"the New York Times\" bestselling \"Ripley's Believe It or Not! Annuals\", the children’s fiction series \"Ripley’s RBI\", an educational series called the \"Ripley’s Twists\", the \"Ripley's Believe It or Not! Special Edition\" in conjunction with Scholastic USA and a number of other titles. At the height of his popularity Robert Ripley received thousands of letters a day from the public, and Ripley Entertainment continues to encourage submissions from readers who have strange stories and photographs that could be featured in \"Ripley’s Believe It or Not!\" books and media.\n\nThe people whose items are featured in such books as \"Strikingly True\", have what Edward Meyer, Vice President of Exhibits and Archives at Ripley Entertainment Inc. describes as an obsession. \"Whatever it is they're after, it is so important to them that all the rest of the world can go on without them. They want to make something that makes them immortal, makes them a little different than you and me.\" Despite the wide range of true and unbelievable art, sculpture, photographs, interactive devices, animal oddities, and recycled objects contained within the Ripley's collection, rarely considered are alien or witchcraft-type stories, which are, according to Meyers, difficult to prove. To be included in Ripley's Believe It or Not books, museums, or television shows, items must undergo scrutiny from Ripley's staff and be 100% authenticated.\n\nOn April 14, 1930, Ripley brought \"Believe It or Not\" to radio, the first of several series heard on NBC, CBS and the Mutual Broadcasting System. As noted by Ripley On Radio, Ripley's broadcasts varied in length from 15 minutes to 30 minutes and aired in numerous different formats. When Ripley's 1930 debut on \"The Collier Hour\" brought a strong listener reaction, he was given a Monday night NBC series beginning April 14, 1930, followed by a 1931–32 series airing twice a week. After his strange stories were dramatized on NBC's \"Saturday Party\", Ripley was the host of \"The Baker's Broadcast\" from 1935 to 1937. He was scheduled in several different 1937–38 NBC timeslots and then took to the road with popular remote broadcasts. \"See America First with Bob Ripley\" (1938–40) on CBS expanded geographically into \"See All the Americas\", a 1942 program with Latin music. In 1944, he was heard five nights a week on Mutual in shows with an emphasis on World War II. \"Romance, Rhythm and Ripley\" aired on CBS in 1945, followed by \"Pages from Robert L. Ripley's Radio Scrapbook\" (1947–48).\n\nRobert Ripley is known for several radio firsts. He was the first to broadcast nationwide on a radio network from mid-ocean, and he also participated in the first broadcast from Buenos Aires to New York. Assisted by a corps of translators, he was the first to broadcast to every nation in the world simultaneously.\n\nAs the years went on, the show became less about oddities and featured guest-driven entertainment such as comedy routines. Sponsors over the course of the program included Pall Mall cigarettes and General Foods. The program ended its successful run in 1948 as Ripley prepared to convert the show format to television.\n\nThe newspaper feature has been adapted into more than a few films and TV shows.\n\n\nOn October 4, 2004, Paramount Pictures announced plans for a film that would chronicle the life of Robert Ripley. The film would be produced by James Jacks and his Alphaville Films company, associated with Paramount. Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski were hired to write the script. Jacks explained, \"It's about the exploits of Robert Ripley, one of the most popular newspaper cartoonists in the '30s and '40s, who was well known for going around the world and looking for oddities and getting into adventures while doing so. We want to make a series of movies that, if not quite the truth, are the adventures that should have happened.\" Jacks also said, \"We want to turn it into an \"Indiana Jones\", a goofy version, as played by Johnny Depp. When they saw we had the writers from \"Larry Flynt\", they thought that we wanted to make the kinky version, but we saw a chance to do a Spielberg-type movie with one of their characters.\"\n\nOn November 29, 2005, it was announced that Tim Burton would direct the film, with Jim Carrey starring as Robert Ripley. Filming was to begin in October 2006, for a 2007 release. Paramount hinted that the film, if successful, could be the start of a \"Ripley's\" film series. In addition to Jacks, Sean Daniel and Richard D. Zanuck were also to serve as producers for the film. Zanuck spent six weeks in China to scout filming locations for the project.\n\nOn June 12, 2006, Paramount delayed the start of production on the film for at least a year because its projected budget went over the allowed $150 million. Carrey had waived his entire upfront salary to help keep costs low, but the project remained over budget. Burton and Carrey also wanted to have Alexander and Karaszewski make changes to the film's script to focus more on Ripley's \"Believe It or Not\" column. Carrey was adamant on avoiding what happened with his previous project, \"Fun with Dick and Jane\", which required reshoots and additional editing as a result of beginning production without a script. Filming had been scheduled to begin in China in November 2006. Although Paramount could have delayed production to spring 2007, the film was delayed further to allow Burton to film \"\".\n\nIn December 2006, Burton and Carrey approved writer Steve Oedekerk to rewrite the script. Oedekerk had worked with Carrey on several previous projects. Production was to begin in China in winter 2008, for a 2009 release. In January 2007, Zanuck said he was no longer involved with the project, and that he was unaware that it was proceeding. Oedekerk's draft was completed in June 2007, and was approved that month by Paramount, Burton, and Carrey. At that time, Carrey hoped to have production finished by summer 2008. Later that month, it was reported that Paramount may be searching for a new director.\n\nIn October 2008, Chris Columbus pitched an idea for the film that was approved by Carrey and Paramount. Columbus' idea involved scrapping the previous China-based storyline entirely. Negotiations were underway that month to hire Columbus as director, with plans to hire a writer afterwards. Paramount planned to release the film in 2011, and hoped that it would be the start of a \"Ripley's\" film series. In January 2011, Eric Roth was hired to write the script, with Carrey still attached to star. Ken Atchity and Chi-Li Wong joined the project as producers, alongside Jacks and Daniel.\n\n\n\nWhen Ripley first displayed his collection to the public at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933, it was labeled Ripley’s Odditorium and attracted over two million visitors during the run of the fair. (In an apparent promotional gimmick, beds were provided in the Odditorium for people who \"fainted\" daily.) That successful exhibition led to trailer shows across the country during the 1930s, and Ripley's collections were exhibited at many major fairs and expositions, including San Francisco, San Diego, Dallas, and Cleveland. In New York, the famed Times Square exhibit opened in 1939 on Broadway. In 1950, a year after Ripley's death, the first permanent Odditorium opened in St. Augustine, Florida.\n\n, there are 32 Ripley's \"Believe It or Not!\" Odditoriums around the world. Odditoriums, in the spirit of \"Believe It or Not!\", are often more than simple museums cluttered with curiosities. Some include theaters and arcades, such as the ones in Gatlinburg, Tennessee and Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. Others are constructed oddly, such as the Orlando, Florida Odditorium which is built off-level as if the building is sinking.\nExpected to open summer 2016 is the first Odditorium in the Netherlands, at Dam square in Amsterdam.\n\n\n\nAmsterdam - The Ripley's Believe It or Not! Amsterdam museum opened on June 23, 2016 at the Dam Square, Dam 21, in a building that belongs to the Heritage of Amsterdam. It has more than 500 exhibits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities at the company insist that they thoroughly investigate everything and ensure their accuracy before they publish their research. This is emphasized on their television show, where they often say \"If you see it on Ripley's, you can bet that it's real\". However, two claims appearing in their books have been dubbed \"myths\" by MythBusters.[Which ones?] One claim which had previously appeared in Ripley's books, concerning an accidental execution of 1,200 Turkish prisoners ordered under Napoleon Bonaparte, has had its accuracy called into question by Snopes.\n\n\"Ripley's\" has reported the urban legend of Frank Tower - an individual who was supposed to have survived the sinkings of the RMS \"Titanic\", RMS \"Empress of Ireland\", and RMS \"Lusitania\" - as being factual. However, this story has been debunked by several sources.\n\n\n"}

The world you know is under threat by aliens, named \"Oburi\" (apparitions). These enemies are too strong for normal humans, and are especially threatening due to the fact that they can travel through to the 'fourth' dimension where they can be safe. For some reason, certain young girls are able to harness the power to transverse these dimensions, and enter a 'fifth' dimension - a parallel universe.\n\nThe only ones capable of fighting this enemy of mankind are girls known as \"Strikers\", who have the ability to sense the fifth dimension.

Some of the things that make Schoolgirl Strikers different from your average card collecting game are the special story missions and the 3D battle system; along with the ability to dress the girls up as you see fit. The way the battle system as a whole works is also quite different; you can choose any girls you want (limited to 5 at a time) to be in your team as long as you have at least one card of them. Then you add main and sub \"Memocas\" to them instead of just simply putting the cards themselves in a battle deck. The main Memocas also affect the girls' appearances in battle.\n\nAn original anime television adaption has been announced, Hiroshi Nishikiori directed the series at J.C.Staff with scripts written by Takao Yoshioka and Mizuto Suzuki and Kengo Tokusashi produced the music at Square Enix.

{"id": "1137997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1137997", "title": "Screenwriting", "text": "Screenwriting\n\nScreenwriting, also called scriptwriting, is the art and craft of writing scripts for mass media such as feature films, television productions or video games. It is often a freelance profession.\n\nScreenwriters are responsible for researching the story, developing the narrative, writing the script, screenplay, dialogues and delivering it, in the required format, to development executives. Screenwriters therefore have great influence over the creative direction and emotional impact of the screenplay and, arguably, of the finished film. Screenwriters either pitch original ideas to producers, in the hope that they will be optioned or sold; or are commissioned by a producer to create a screenplay from a concept, true story, existing screen work or literary work, such as a novel, poem, play, comic book, or short story.\n\nThe act of screenwriting takes many forms across the entertainment industry. Often, multiple writers work on the same script at different stages of development with different tasks. Over the course of a successful career, a screenwriter might be hired to write in a wide variety of roles.\n\nSome of the most common forms of screenwriting jobs include:\n\nSpec scripts are feature film or television show scripts written on speculation of sale, without the commission of a film studio, production company or TV network. The content is usually invented solely by the screenwriter, though spec screenplays can also be based on established works or real people and events. The spec script is a Hollywood sales tool. The vast majority of scripts written each year are spec scripts, but only a small percentage make it to the screen. A spec script is usually a wholly original work, but can also be an adaptation.\n\nIn television writing, a spec script is a sample teleplay written to demonstrate the writer's knowledge of a show and ability to imitate its style and conventions. It is submitted to the show's producers in hopes of being hired to write future episodes of the show. Budding screenwriters attempting to break into the business generally begin by writing one or more spec scripts.\n\nAlthough writing spec scripts is part of any writer's career, the Writers Guild of America forbids members to write \"on speculation\". The distinction is that a \"spec script\" is written as a sample by the writer on his or her own; what is forbidden is writing a script for a specific producer without a contract. In addition to writing a script on speculation, it is generally not advised to write camera angles or other directional terminology, as these are likely to be ignored. A director may write up a shooting script himself or herself, a script that guides the team in what to do in order to carry out the director's vision of how the script should look. The director may ask the original writer to co-write it with him or her, or to rewrite a script that satisfies both the director and producer of the film/TV show.\n\nSpec writing is also unique in that the writer must pitch the idea to producers. In order to sell the script, it must have a killer title, good writing, and a great logline. A logline is one sentence that lays out what the movie is about. A well written logline will convey the tone of the film, introduce the main character, and touch on the primary conflict. Usually the logline and title work in tandem to draw people in, and it is highly suggested to incorporate irony into them when possible. These things, along with nice, clean writing will hugely impact whether or not a producer picks up the spec script.\n\nA commissioned screenplay is written by a hired writer. The concept is usually developed long before the screenwriter is brought on, and often has multiple writers work on it before the script is given a green light.\n\nScripts written on assignment are screenplays created under contract with a studio, production company, or producer. These are the most common assignments sought after in screenwriting. A screenwriter can get an assignment either exclusively or from \"open\" assignments. A screenwriter can also be approached and offered an assignment. Assignment scripts are generally adaptations of an existing idea or property owned by the hiring company, but can also be original works based on a concept created by the writer or producer.\n\nMost produced films are rewritten to some extent during the development process. Frequently, they are not rewritten by the original writer of the script. Many established screenwriters, as well as new writers whose work shows promise but lacks marketability, make their living rewriting scripts.\n\nWhen a script's central premise or characters are good but the script is otherwise unusable, a different writer or team of writers is contracted to do an entirely new draft, often referred to as a \"page one rewrite\". When only small problems remain, such as bad dialogue or poor humor, a writer is hired to do a \"polish\" or \"punch-up\".\n\nDepending on the size of the new writer's contributions, screen credit may or may not be given. For instance, in the American film industry, credit to rewriters is given only if 50% or more of the script is substantially changed. These standards can make it difficult to establish the identity and number of screenwriters who contributed to a film's creation.\n\nWhen established writers are called in to rewrite portions of a script late in the development process, they are commonly referred to as script doctors. Prominent script doctors include Christopher Keane, Steve Zaillian, William Goldman, Robert Towne, Mort Nathan, Quentin Tarantino and Peter Russell. Many up-and-coming screenwriters work as ghost writers.\n\nA freelance television writer typically uses spec scripts or previous credits and reputation to obtain a contract to write one or more episodes for an existing television show. After an episode is submitted, rewriting or polishing may be required.\n\nA staff writer for a TV show generally works in-house, writing and rewriting episodes. Staff writers—often given other titles, such as story editor or producer—work both as a group and individually on episode scripts to maintain the show's tone, style, characters, and plots.\n\nTelevision show creators write the television pilot and bible of new television series. They are responsible for creating and managing all aspects of a show's characters, style, and plots. Frequently, a creator remains responsible for the show's day-to-day creative decisions throughout the series run as showrunner, head writer or story editor.\n\nThe process of writing for soap operas and telenovelas is different from that used by prime time shows, due in part to the need to produce new episodes five days a week for several months. In one example cited by Jane Espenson, screenwriting is a \"sort of three-tiered system\":\n\nEspenson notes that a recent trend has been to eliminate the role of the mid-level writer, relying on the senior writers to do rough outlines and giving the other writers a bit more freedom. Regardless, when the finished scripts are sent to the top writers, the latter do a final round of rewrites. Espenson also notes that a show that airs daily, with characters who have decades of history behind their voices, necessitates a writing staff without the distinctive voice that can sometimes be present in prime-time series.\n\nGame shows feature live contestants, but still use a team of writers as part of a specific format. This may involve the slate of questions and even specific phrasing or dialogue on the part of the host. Writers may not script the dialogue used by the contestants, but they work with the producers to create the actions, scenarios, and sequence of events that support the game show's concept.\n\nWith the continued development and increased complexity of video games, many opportunities are available to employ screenwriters in the field of video game design. Video game writers work closely with the other game designers to create characters, scenarios, and dialogue.\n\nFundamentally, the screenplay is a unique literary form. It is like a musical score, in that it is intended to be interpreted on the basis of other artists' performance, rather than serving as a finished product for the enjoyment of its audience. For this reason, a screenplay is written using technical jargon and tight, spare prose when describing stage directions. Unlike a novel or short story, a screenplay focuses on describing the literal, visual aspects of the story, rather than on the internal thoughts of its characters. In screenwriting, the aim is to evoke those thoughts and emotions through subtext, action, and symbolism.\n\nSeveral main screenwriting theories help writers approach the screenplay by systematizing the structure, goals and techniques of writing a script. The most common kinds of theories are structural. Screenwriter William Goldman is widely quoted as saying \"Screenplays are structure\".\n\nThe three acts are setup (of the location and characters), confrontation (with an obstacle), and resolution (culminating in a climax and a dénouement). Usually, in a two-hour film, the first and third acts both typically last around 30 minutes, with the middle act lasting roughly an hour, but today many films start from the confrontation point and then goes to the setup act or they might even start at the last act and then go back to the start.\n\nIn \"Writing Drama\", French writer and director Yves Lavandier shows a slightly different approach. As do most theorists, he maintains that every human action, whether fictitious or real, contains three logical parts: before the action, during the action, and after the action. But since the climax is part of the action, Yves Lavandier maintains that the second act must include the climax, which makes for a much shorter third act than is found in most screenwriting theories.\n\nBesides the three-act structure, it is also common to use a four- or five-act structure in a screenplay, though certain screenplays may include as many as twenty separate acts.\n\nThe hero's journey, also referred to as the monomyth, is an idea formulated by noted mythologist Joseph Campbell. The central concept of the monomyth is that a pattern can be seen in stories and myths across history. Campbell defined and explained that pattern in his book \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" (1949).\n\nCampbell's insight was that important myths from around the world, which have survived for thousands of years, all share a fundamental structure. This fundamental structure contains a number of stages, which include\n\nLater, screenwriter Christopher Vogler refined and expanded the hero's journey for the screenplay form in his book, \"\" (1993).\n\nIn his book \"Screenplay\" Syd Field posited a new theory, which he called the Paradigm. Field noticed that in a 120-page screenplay, Act Two was notoriously boring, and was also twice the length of Acts One and Three. He also noticed that an important dramatic event usually occurred at the middle of the picture, which implied to him that the middle act was actually two acts in one. So the Three Act Structure is notated 1, 2a, 2b, 3, resulting in Aristotle's Three Acts divided into four pieces.\n\nField also introduced the idea of Plot Points into screenwriting theory. Plot Points are important structural functions that happen in approximately the same place in most successful movies, like the verses and choruses in a popular song. In subsequent books, Field has added to his original list, and students of his like Viki King and Linda Seger have added to the list of Plot Points. Here is a current list of the major Plot Points that are congruent with Field's Paradigm:\n\nOpening Image: The first image in the screenplay should summarize the entire film, especially its tone. Often, writers go back and redo this as the last thing before submitting the script.\n\nExposition: Provides some background information to the audience about the plot, characters' histories, setting, and theme.\n\nInciting Incident: Also called the catalyst, this is the point in the story when the Protagonist encounters the problem that will change their life. This is when the detective is assigned the case, where Boy meets Girl, and where the Comic Hero gets fired from his cushy job, forcing him into comic circumstances.\n\nPlot Point 1: The last scene in Act One, Plot Point 1 is a surprising development that radically changes the Protagonist's life, and forces him to confront the Opponent. In \"Star Wars\", this is when Luke's family is killed by the Empire. He has no home to go back to, so he joins the Rebels in opposing Darth Vader.\n\nPinch 1: A reminder scene at about 3/8 the way through the script (halfway through Act 2a) that brings up the central conflict of the drama, reminding us of the overall conflict. For example, in \"Star Wars\", Pinch 1 is the Stormtroopers attacking the Millennium Falcon in Mos Eisley, reminding us the Empire is after the stolen plans to the Death Star R2-D2 is carrying and Luke and Ben Kenobi are trying to get to the Rebel Alliance (the main conflict).\n\nMidpoint: An important scene in the middle of the script, often a reversal of fortune or revelation that changes the direction of the story. Field suggests that driving the story towards the Midpoint keeps the second act from sagging.\n\nPinch 2: Another reminder scene about 5/8 through the script (halfway through Act 2b) that is somehow linked to Pinch 1 in reminding the audience about the central conflict. In \"Star Wars\", Pinch 2 is the Stormtroopers attacking them as they rescue the Princess in the Death Star. Both scenes remind us of the Empire's opposition, and using the Stormtrooper attack motif unifies both Pinches.\n\nPlot Point 2: A dramatic reversal that ends Act 2 and begins Act 3, which is about confrontation and resolution. Sometimes Plot Point 2 is the moment when the Hero has had enough and is finally going to face the Opponent. Sometimes, like in \"Toy Story\", it's the low-point for the Hero, and he must bounce back to overcome the odds in Act 3.\n\nShowdown: About midway through Act 3, the Protagonist will confront the Main Problem of the story and either overcome it, or come to a tragic end.\n\nResolution: The issues of the story are resolved.\n\nTag: An epilogue, tying up the loose ends of the story, giving the audience closure. This is also known as denouement. In general, films in recent decades have had longer denouements than films made in the 1970s or earlier.\n\nThe sequence approach to screenwriting, sometimes known as \"eight-sequence structure\", is a system developed by Frank Daniel, while he was the head of the Graduate Screenwriting Program at USC. It is based in part on the fact that, in the early days of cinema, technical matters forced screenwriters to divide their stories into sequences, each the length of a reel (about ten minutes).\n\nThe sequence approach mimics that early style. The story is broken up into eight 10-15 minute sequences. The sequences serve as \"mini-movies\", each with their own compressed three-act structure. The first two sequences combine to form the film's first act. The next four create the film's second act. The final two sequences complete the resolution and dénouement of the story. Each sequence's resolution creates the situation which sets up the next sequence.\n\nImagery can be used in many metaphoric ways. In \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\", the title character talked of wanting to close the door on himself sometime, and then, in the end, he did. Pathetic fallacy is also frequently used; rain to express a character feeling depressed, sunny days promote a feeling of happiness and calm. Imagery can be used to sway the emotions of the audience and to clue them in to what is happening.\n\nImagery is well defined in \"City of God\". The opening image sequence sets the tone for the entire film. The film opens with the shimmer of a knife's blade on a sharpening stone. A drink is being prepared, The knife's blade shows again, juxtaposed is a shot of a chicken letting loose of its harness on its feet. All symbolising 'The One that got away'. The film is about life in the favelas in Rio - sprinkled with violence and games and ambition.\n\nDialogue can be very important to the film industry, because there are no written words to explain the characters or plot; it all has to be explained through dialogue and imagery. Bollywood and other Indian film industries use separate dialogue writers in addition to the screenplay writers.\n\nWhile the story is what will be told (narrative); the plot is how the story will be told (narration). This vocabulary is not indisputable for sometimes in literature stories and plots are used exactly the other way around.\n\nA number of American universities offer specialized Master of Fine Arts and undergraduate programs in screenwriting, including USC, DePaul University, American Film Institute, Loyola Marymount University, Chapman University, NYU, UCLA, Boston University and the University of the Arts. In Europe, the United Kingdom has an extensive range of MA and BA Screenwriting Courses including London College of Communication, Bournemouth University, Edinburgh University, and Goldsmiths College (University of London). \n\nSome schools offer non-degree screenwriting programs, such as the TheFilmSchool, The International Film and Television School Fast Track, and the UCLA Professional / Extension Programs in Screenwriting.\n\nNew York Film Academy offers both degree and non-degree educational systems with campuses all around the world.\n\nMany screenwriters choose to pursue screenwriting independently with free online educational resources such as ScreenCraft, Keanewords, NoFilmSchool, Film Daily, The Black List, John August and Craig Mazin's Scriptnotes podcast, and Julie Gray's Just Effing Entertain Me.\n\nThe first true screenplay is thought to be from George Melies' 1902 film \"A Trip to the Moon\". The movie is silent, but the screenplay still contains specific descriptions and action lines that resemble a modern-day script. As time went on and films became longer and more complex, the need for a screenplay became more prominent in the industry. The introduction of movie theaters also impacted the development of screenplays, as audiences became more widespread and sophisticated, so the stories had to be as well. Once the first non-silent movie was released in 1927, screenwriting became a hugely important position within Hollywood. The \"studio system\" of the 1930s only heightened this importance, as studio heads wanted productivity. Thus, having the \"blueprint\" (continuity screenplay) of the film beforehand became extremely optimal. Around 1970, the \"spec script\" was first created, and changed the industry for writers forever. Now, screenwriting for television (teleplays) is considered as difficult and competitive as writing is for feature films.\n\nScreenwriting has been the focus of a number of films:\n\n\nIn the United States, completed works may be copyrighted, but ideas and plots may not be. Any document written after 1978 in the U.S. is automatically copyrighted even without legal registration or notice. However, the Library of Congress will formally register a screenplay. U.S. Courts will not accept a lawsuit alleging that a defendant is infringing on the plaintiff's copyright in a work until the plaintiff registers the plaintiff's claim to those copyrights with the Copyright Office. This means that a plaintiff's attempts to remedy an infringement will be delayed during the registration process. Additionally, in many infringement cases, the plaintiff will not be able recoup attorney fees or collect statutory damages for copyright infringement, unless the plaintiff registered before the infringement began. For the purpose of establishing evidence that a screenwriter is the author of a particular screenplay (but not related to the legal copyrighting status of a work), the Writers Guild of America registers screenplays. However, since this service is one of record keeping and is not regulated by law, a variety of commercial and non-profit organizations exist for registering screenplays. Protection for teleplays, formats, as well as screenplays may be registered for instant proof-of-authorship by third-party assurance vendors, such as the Creators Vault.\n\nThere is a line of precedent in several states (including California and New York) that allows for \"idea submission\" claims, based on the notion that submission of a screenplay (or even a mere pitch for one) to a studio under very particular sets of factual circumstances could potentially give rise to an implied contract to pay for the ideas embedded in that screenplay, even if an alleged derivative work does not actually infringe the screenplay author's copyright. The unfortunate side effect of such precedents (which were supposed to protect screenwriters) is that it is now that much harder to break into screenwriting. Naturally, motion picture and television production firms responded by categorically declining to read \"all\" unsolicited screenplays from unknown writers; accepting screenplays only through official channels like talent agents, managers, and attorneys; and forcing screenwriters to sign broad legal releases before their screenplays will be actually accepted, read, or considered. In turn, agents, managers, and attorneys have become extremely powerful gatekeepers on behalf of the major film studios and media networks. One symptom of how hard it is to break into screenwriting as a result of such case law is that in 2008, Universal Studios resisted construction of a bike path along the Los Angeles River next to its studio lot because it would worsen their existing problem with desperate amateur screenwriters throwing copies of their work over the studio wall.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3552803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3552803", "title": "Show, don't tell", "text": "Show, don't tell\n\nShow, don't tell is a technique used in various kinds of texts to allow the reader to experience the story through action, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's exposition, summarization, and description. It avoids adjectives describing the author's analysis, but instead describes the scene in such a way that the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. The technique applies equally to nonfiction and all forms of fiction, literature including Haiku and Imagism poetry in particular, speech, movie making, and playwriting.\n\nThe concept is often attributed to Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, reputed to have said \"Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.\" What Chekhov actually said, in a letter to his brother, was \"In descriptions of Nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture. For instance, you’ll have a moonlit night if you write that on the mill dam a piece of glass from a broken bottle glittered like a bright little star, and that the black shadow of a dog or a wolf rolled past like a ball.\" \n\nThe distinction between telling and showing was popularized in Percy Lubbock's book \"The Craft of Fiction\" (1921), and has been an important element in Anglo-Saxon narratological theory ever since.\n\nNobel Prize–winning novelist Ernest Hemingway was a notable proponent of the \"show, don't tell\" style. His Iceberg Theory, also known as the \"theory of omission\", developed from his background as a newspaper reporter. The term itself originates from his bullfighting treatise, \"Death in the Afternoon\":\n\nIf a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. \n\nCreative literature (as opposed to technical writing or objective journalism) in general hinges on the artful use of a wide range of devices (such as inference, metaphor, understatement, the unreliable narrator, and ambiguity) that reward the careful reader's appreciation of subtext and extrapolation of what the author chooses to leave unsaid, untold, and/or unshown. This suggests a form of respect for the reader, who should be trusted to develop a feeling for the meaning behind the action, without having the point painfully laid out for them.\n\nIn a 2013 article, Chuck Palahniuk (author of the novel \"Fight Club\") goes as far as recommending a ban of what he calls \"thought verbs\" (\"Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires […]\") favoring instead the use of \"specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling.\"\n\n\"Show, don't tell\" should not be applied to all incidents in a story. According to James Scott Bell, \"Sometimes a writer tells as a shortcut, to move quickly to the meaty part of the story or scene. Showing is essentially about making scenes vivid. If you try to do it constantly, the parts that are supposed to stand out won't, and your readers will get exhausted.\" Showing requires more words; telling may cover a greater span of time more concisely. A novel that contains only showing would be incredibly long; therefore, a narrative can contain some legitimate telling.\n\nScenes that are important to the story should be dramatized with showing, but sometimes what happens between scenes can be told so the story can make progress. According to Orson Scott Card and others, \"showing\" is so terribly time consuming that it is to be used only for dramatic scenes. The objective is to find the right balance of telling versus showing, summarization versus action. Factors like rhythm, pace, and tone come into play.\n\n\n"}

According to a university class in it, the field includes \"Contemporary cinema as a culture clue to social change; an introduction to the social forces involved in film-making in the United States and other cultures; the influence of films on mass and select audiences.\" According to another university course, it covers \"social aspects causes and consequences of the production, distribution, content, form and reception of film.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" said, \"One problem, though, is that if the audience is the measure all things, then art becomes a reflection of sociology and dissecting audience tastes becomes the art.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "542704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=542704", "title": "Spoiler (media)", "text": "Spoiler (media)\n\nA spoiler is an element of a disseminated summary or description of any piece of fiction that reveals any plot elements which threaten to give away important details. Typically, the details of the conclusion of the plot, including the climax and ending, are especially regarded as spoiler material. It can also be used to refer to any piece of information regarding any part of a given media that a potential consumer would not want to know beforehand. Because enjoyment of fiction depends a great deal upon the suspense of revealing plot details through standard narrative progression, the prior revelation of how things will turn out can \"spoil\" the enjoyment that some consumers of the narrative would otherwise have experienced. Spoilers can be found in message boards, articles, reviews, commercials, and movie trailers.\n\nThe term spoiler was introduced in the early days of the Internet, and came to prominence in newsgroup conversations. It is still common in internet articles and social media discussions. Early rules of netiquette insisted that spoilers could and should be normally avoided, but if the posting of \"spoiling\" information was unavoidable, it be preceded by a warning such as \"SPOILER ALERT\", or the spoiler itself has to be masked so that it can not be visible to any but those keen for details and not fazed at the thought of such potentially plot-revealing information.\n\nSometimes, these warnings are omitted, accidentally or deliberately (see below), and some unwitting readers have had literature, films, television programmes and other works that they were looking forward to experiencing \"spoiled\".\n\nThere is a common demand, especially among internet users, to have protection against accidentally seeing material considered to include \"spoiler\" information, even in the internet version of settings where such material has conventionally and historically appeared, such as discussion groups or literary reviews. As a result of this level of objection to spoilers, trolls may post them purely for their own pleasure, finding amusement in believing they are completely ruining a narrative experience for others. On reputable websites, these can be reported to moderators and such posts taken down, the posters blacklisted, but only after the fact. Most such websites provide a means of tagging certain threads as containing spoilers for those who wish to discuss a fictional work in depth, including the outcomes of events and the handling of the narrative resolution. Some have felt compelled to avoid participating on public websites altogether, set up \"closed\" websites to exclude those who are sensitive about spoilers, or decided they had to unilaterally blog at the expense of public exchange.\n\nOn Usenet, the common method for obscuring spoiler information is to precede it with many blank lines known as 'spoiler space' – traditionally enough to push the information in question on to the next screen of a 25-line terminal. A simple cipher called ROT13 is also used in newsgroups to obscure spoilers, but is rarely used for this purpose elsewhere.\n\nSome producers actively seed bogus information in order to misdirect fans. The director of the film \"Terminator Salvation\" orchestrated a \"disinformation campaign\" where false spoilers were distributed about the film, to mask any true rumors about its plot.\n\nWikipedia discloses spoilers in its articles without giving advance warning, although it previously did prior to 2006. Matthew Prichard, the grandson of Agatha Christie, criticized Wikipedia for giving away spoilers in the play \"The Mousetrap\". Andrew Jarecki, the producer of \"Catfish\", a documentary, argued that Wikipedia should have spoiler alerts. The plot of \"Catfish\" had been posted on Wikipedia before its theatrical release because the film had been shown at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. Jay Walsh, a Wikimedia Foundation spokesperson, said that Wikipedia is intended to be an exhaustive knowledge source, so it would have spoilers.\n\nSome internet forums and reference sites, such as TV Tropes and the IMDb FAQ section, have optional spoiler tags covering major plot details. The information underneath may be revealed by highlighting the text or, in the case of IMDb, rolling over the spoiler tag.\n\nIn 2011, Nicholas Christenfeld and Jonathan Leavitt of UC San Diego did a psychological experiment testing whether spoilers diminish enjoyment of fiction. They gave subjects short stories with twist endings to read, giving some of the subjects information about the twist in advance. For nearly every story, subjects who had the story \"spoiled\" enjoyed the story more than the subjects who didn't know the ending in advance.\n\nThere are some applications that prevent users from reading spoilers, such as TVShow Time's Google Chrome extension, which, once set up, blocks posts on social media about episodes that the user has not seen.\n\nOne of the first print uses of the terms was in the April 1971 issue of \"National Lampoon\". An article entitled \"Spoilers,\" by Doug Kenney, lists spoilers for famous films and movies.\nIn 2005, the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" film critic Roger Ebert wrote an article entitled \"Critics have no right to play spoiler\" which contained spoilers and spoilers warnings. Ebert wrote:\n\nEbert used two spoiler warnings in the article, saying \"If you have not yet seen \"Million Dollar Baby\" and know nothing about the plot, read no further\" and later said, \"Now yet another spoiler warning, because I am going to become more explicit.\" Ebert discussed six films in the article and mentioned how many critics handled \"The Crying Game\" and also noted a detail about the film \"The Year of Living Dangerously\". Ebert also mentioned two films alongside \"Million Dollar Baby\".\n\nEbert additionally criticized two commentators, Rush Limbaugh and Michael Medved (the latter of whom had \"for a long time been a political commentator, not a movie critic\"), for deliberately revealing the ending of the movie due to a moral disagreement with the lead character's life decision. \"[S]hould no movie be allowed to consider [the moral issue]?\" Ebert asked. \"The separation of church and state in America was wisely designed to prevent religions from dictating the personal choices of those who do not share the same beliefs.\"\n\nIn an interview about his \"Dark Tower\" series (appearing in issue #4 of the 2007 Marvel Comic adaptation \"The Gunslinger Born\"), Stephen King was asked if there are spoilers in the first few novels that would ruin someone's experience of the comic. \"There are no spoilers!\", King replied, \"You might as well say 'I'm never gonna watch \"Wizard of Oz\" again because I know how it comes out'\".\n\nThe executive producer of \"Doctor Who\", Steven Moffat, expressed disappointment with fans who revealed spoilers after a leaked copy of \"The Impossible Astronaut\" was made available online before the episode's first television broadcast.\n\nIn April 2015, the Under the Gun Theater created \"Swarm of Spoilers\", a parody show based on George R.R. Martin's \"Game of Thrones\" series. The comedic play recapped the previous four seasons of the HBO television show. Kevin Mullaney, who directed \"Swarm of Spoilers\", stated: \"I'm somebody who's very sensitive about spoilers, so I wanted to make sure it was very clear from the title,\" though he went on to say, \"There's actually this theory about spoilers that we think that they hurt the enjoyment of shows, and I definitely feel that way sometimes, but I think there's been studies that show the other side: that when we know the ending of a story that we haven't read before, it actually enhances the story, so I don't know if it would actually hurt anyone to come see it [\"Swarm of Spoilers\"].\" The final production included 45 of the series' characters, and was played by an 18-person ensemble.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29831", "title": "Television", "text": "Television\n\nTelevision (TV), sometimes shortened to tele or telly, is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black and white), or in colour, and in two or three dimensions and sound. The term can refer to a television set, a television program (\"TV show\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment and news. \n\nTelevision became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as Betamax, VHS tape, local disks, DVDs, flash drives, high-definition Blu-ray Discs, and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies— at home on their own time schedule. For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now occurs on the cloud. At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, Amazon Video, iPlayer, Hulu, Roku and Chromecast.\n\nIn 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set. The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), OLED displays, and plasma displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. In the near future, LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs. Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TVs in the mid-2010s. Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.\n\nTelevision signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals, but a transition to digital television is expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.\n\nThe word \"television\" comes . The first documented usage of the term dates back to 1900, when the Russian scientist Constantin Perskyi used it in a paper that he presented in French at the 1st International Congress of Electricity, which ran from 18 to 25 August 1900 during the International World Fair in Paris. The Anglicised version of the term is first attested in 1907, when it was still \"...a theoretical system to transmit moving images over telegraph or telephone wires\". It was \"...formed in English or borrowed from French télévision.\" In the 19th century and early 20th century, other \"...proposals for the name of a then-hypothetical technology for sending pictures over distance were telephote (1880) and televista (1904).\" The abbreviation \"TV\" is from 1948. The use of the term to mean \"a television set\" dates from 1941. The use of the term to mean \"television as a medium\" dates from 1927. The slang term \"telly\" is more common in the UK. The slang term \"the tube\" or the \"boob tube\" refers to the bulky cathode ray tube used on most TVs until the advent of flat-screen TVs. Another slang term for the TV is \"idiot box\". Also, in the 1940s and throughout the 1950s, during the early rapid growth of television programming and television-set ownership in the United States, another slang term became widely used in that period and continues to be used today to distinguish productions originally created for broadcast on television from films developed for presentation in movie theaters. The “small screen”, as both a compound adjective and noun, became specific references to television, while the “big screen” was used to identify productions made for theatrical release.\n\nFacsimile transmission systems for still photographs pioneered methods of mechanical scanning of images in the early 19th century. Alexander Bain introduced the facsimile machine between 1843 and 1846. Frederick Bakewell demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1851. Willoughby Smith discovered the photoconductivity of the element selenium in 1873. As a 23-year-old German university student, Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow proposed and patented the Nipkow disk in 1884. This was a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it, so each hole scanned a line of the image. Although he never built a working model of the system, variations of Nipkow's spinning-disk \"image rasterizer\" became exceedingly common. Constantin Perskyi had coined the word \"television\" in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the International World Fair in Paris on 24 August 1900. Perskyi's paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of Nipkow and others. However, it was not until 1907 that developments in amplification tube technology by Lee de Forest and Arthur Korn, among others, made the design practical.\n\nThe first demonstration of the live transmission of images was by Georges Rignoux and A. Fournier in Paris in 1909. A matrix of 64 selenium cells, individually wired to a mechanical commutator, served as an electronic retina. In the receiver, a type of Kerr cell modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen. A separate circuit regulated synchronization. The 8x8 pixel resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet. An updated image was transmitted \"several times\" each second. In 1921 Edouard Belin sent the first image via radio waves with his belinograph.\n\nIn 1911, Boris Rosing and his student Vladimir Zworykin created a system that used a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in Zworykin's words, \"very crude images\" over wires to the \"Braun tube\" (cathode ray tube or \"CRT\") in the receiver. Moving images were not possible because, in the scanner: \"the sensitivity was not enough and the selenium cell was very laggy\".\n\nBy the 1920s, when amplification made television practical, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird employed the Nipkow disk in his prototype video systems. On 25 March 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion, at Selfridge's Department Store in London. Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a ventriloquist's dummy named \"Stooky Bill\", whose painted face had higher contrast, talking and moving. By 26 January 1926, he demonstrated the transmission of the image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light which swept across the subject. A Selenium photoelectric tube detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face. In 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over of telephone line between London and Glasgow.\n\nIn 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and Bernard Natan of Pathé established France's first television company, Télévision-Baird-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of The Derby. In 1932, he demonstrated ultra-short wave television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240-lines of resolution on BBC television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead a 17.5mm film was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet.\n\nAn American inventor, Charles Francis Jenkins, also pioneered the television. He published an article on \"Motion Pictures by Wireless\" in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses; and it was on 13 June 1925, that he publicly demonstrated synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925 Jenkins used the Nipkow disk and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of five miles, from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C., using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution. He was granted U.S. Patent No. 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on 30 June 1925 (filed 13 March 1922).\n\nHerbert E. Ives and Frank Gray of Bell Telephone Laboratories gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on 7 April 1927. Their reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. The small receiver had a 2-inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen. The large receiver had a screen 24 inches wide by 30 inches high. Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic, moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a copper wire link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from Whippany, New Jersey. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. A flying-spot scanner beam illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 milliseconds. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: \"It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality.\"\n\nIn 1928, WRGB, then W2XB, was started as the world's first television station. It broadcast from the General Electric facility in Schenectady, NY. It was popularly known as \"WGY Television\". Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, Léon Theremin had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16 lines resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using interlacing in 1926. As part of his thesis, on 7 May 1926, he electrically transmitted, and then projected, near-simultaneous moving images on a five-foot square screen. By 1927 he achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until May 1932 by RCA, with 120 lines. On 25 December 1926, Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This prototype is still on display at the Takayanagi Memorial Museum in Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu Campus. His research in creating a production model was halted by the United States after Japan lost World War II.\n\nBecause only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical, image resolution on mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to 120 or so. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear. A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in Paris in 1935, and the 180-line system that Peck Television Corp. started in 1935 at station VE9AK in Montreal. The advancement of all-electronic television (including image dissectors and other camera tubes and cathode ray tubes for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical television, despite its inferior image quality and generally smaller picture, would remain the primary television technology until the 1930s. The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States.\n\nIn 1897, English physicist J. J. Thomson was able, in his three famous experiments, to deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern cathode ray tube (CRT). The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1897 and is also known as the \"Braun\" tube. It was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the Crookes tube, with a phosphor-coated screen. In 1906 the Germans Max Dieckmann and Gustav Glage produced raster images for the first time in a CRT. In 1907, Russian scientist Boris Rosing used a CRT in the receiving end of an experimental video signal to form a picture. He managed to display simple geometric shapes onto the screen.\n\nIn 1908 Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton, fellow of the Royal Society (UK), published a letter in the scientific journal \"Nature\" in which he described how \"distant electric vision\" could be achieved by using a cathode ray tube, or Braun tube, as both a transmitting and receiving device, He expanded on his vision in a speech given in London in 1911 and reported in \"The Times\" and the Journal of the Röntgen Society. In a letter to \"Nature\" published in October 1926, Campbell-Swinton also announced the results of some \"not very successful experiments\" he had conducted with G. M. Minchin and J. C. M. Stanton. They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a cathode ray beam. These experiments were conducted before March 1914, when Minchin died, but they were later repeated by two different teams in 1937, by H. Miller and J. W. Strange from EMI, and by H. Iams and A. Rose from RCA. Both teams succeeded in transmitting \"very faint\" images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate. Although others had experimented with using a cathode ray tube as a receiver, the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel. The first cathode ray tube to use a hot cathode was developed by John B. Johnson (who gave his name to the term Johnson noise) and Harry Weiner Weinhart of Western Electric, and became a commercial product in 1922.\n\nIn 1926, Hungarian engineer Kálmán Tihanyi designed a television system utilizing fully electronic scanning and display elements and employing the principle of \"charge storage\" within the scanning (or \"camera\") tube. The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or \"camera\" tubes would be solved with the introduction of charge-storage technology by Kálmán Tihanyi beginning in 1924. His solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges (\"photoelectrons\") within the tube throughout each scanning cycle. The device was first described in a patent application he filed in Hungary in March 1926 for a television system he dubbed \"Radioskop\". After further refinements included in a 1928 patent application, Tihanyi's patent was declared void in Great Britain in 1930, so he applied for patents in the United States. Although his breakthrough would be incorporated into the design of RCA's \"iconoscope\" in 1931, the U.S. patent for Tihanyi's transmitting tube would not be granted until May 1939. The patent for his receiving tube had been granted the previous October. Both patents had been purchased by RCA prior to their approval. Charge storage remains a basic principle in the design of imaging devices for television to the present day. On 25 December 1926, at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan, Japanese inventor Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated a TV system with a 40-line resolution that employed a CRT display. This was the first working example of a fully electronic television receiver. Takayanagi did not apply for a patent.\n\nOn 7 September 1927, American inventor Philo Farnsworth's image dissector camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By 3 September 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. This is widely regarded as the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was improved further by the elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma (\"Pem\") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).\nMeanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin was also experimenting with the cathode ray tube to create and show images. While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923, he began to develop an electronic camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast, and poor definition, and was stationary. Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, on the basis of Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth. The U.S. Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application; he also divided his original application in 1931. Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts, and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use his patents.\n\nIn 1933, RCA introduced an improved camera tube that relied on Tihanyi's charge storage principle. Dubbed the \"Iconoscope\" by Zworykin, the new tube had a light sensitivity of about 75,000 lux, and thus was claimed to be much more sensitive than Farnsworth's image dissector. However, Farnsworth had overcome his power problems with his Image Dissector through the invention of a completely unique \"multipactor\" device that he began work on in 1930, and demonstrated in 1931. This small tube could amplify a signal reportedly to the 60th power or better and showed great promise in all fields of electronics. Unfortunately, a problem with the multipactor was that it wore out at an unsatisfactory rate.\n\nAt the Berlin Radio Show in August 1931, Manfred von Ardenne gave a public demonstration of a television system using a CRT for both transmission and reception. However, Ardenne had not developed a camera tube, using the CRT instead as a flying-spot scanner to scan slides and film. Philo Farnsworth gave the world's first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system, using a live camera, at the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia on 25 August 1934, and for ten days afterwards. Mexican inventor Guillermo González Camarena also played an important role in early TV. His experiments with TV (known as telectroescopía at first) began in 1931 and led to a patent for the \"trichromatic field sequential system\" color television in 1940. In Britain, the EMI engineering team led by Isaac Shoenberg applied in 1932 for a patent for a new device they dubbed \"the Emitron\", which formed the heart of the cameras they designed for the BBC. On 2 November 1936, a 405-line broadcasting service employing the Emitron began at studios in Alexandra Palace, and transmitted from a specially built mast atop one of the Victorian building's towers. It alternated for a short time with Baird's mechanical system in adjoining studios, but was more reliable and visibly superior. This was the world's first regular \"high-definition\" television service.\n\nThe original American iconoscope was noisy, had a high ratio of interference to signal, and ultimately gave disappointing results, especially when compared to the high definition mechanical scanning systems then becoming available. The EMI team, under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg, analyzed how the iconoscope (or Emitron) produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum. They solved this problem by developing, and patenting in 1934, two new camera tubes dubbed super-Emitron and CPS Emitron. The super-Emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original Emitron and iconoscope tubes and, in some cases, this ratio was considerably greater. It was used for outside broadcasting by the BBC, for the first time, on Armistice Day 1937, when the general public could watch on a television set as the King laid a wreath at the Cenotaph. This was the first time that anyone had broadcast a live street scene from cameras installed on the roof of neighboring buildings, because neither Farnsworth nor RCA would do the same until the 1939 New York World's Fair.\nOn the other hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German licensee company Telefunken. The \"image iconoscope\" (\"Superikonoskop\" in Germany) was produced as a result of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their \"Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher\" (\"Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television\") in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States. The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes. Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon. The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955; finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 to 1958.\n\nAmerican television broadcasting, at the time, consisted of a variety of markets in a wide range of sizes, each competing for programming and dominance with separate technology, until deals were made and standards agreed upon in 1941. RCA, for example, used only Iconoscopes in the New York area, but Farnsworth Image Dissectors in Philadelphia and San Francisco. In September 1939, RCA agreed to pay the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation royalties over the next ten years for access to Farnsworth's patents. With this historic agreement in place, RCA integrated much of what was best about the Farnsworth Technology into their systems. In 1941, the United States implemented 525-line television. Electrical engineer Benjamin Adler played a prominent role in the development of television.\n\nThe world's first 625-line television standard was designed in the Soviet Union in 1944 and became a national standard in 1946. The first broadcast in 625-line standard occurred in Moscow in 1948. The concept of 625 lines per frame was subsequently implemented in the European CCIR standard. In 1936, Kálmán Tihanyi described the principle of plasma display, the first flat panel display system.\nThe basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built. Although he gave no practical details, among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc, in 1880, for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning. Polish inventor Jan Szczepanik patented a color television system in 1897, using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it. Another inventor, Hovannes Adamian, also experimented with color television as early as 1907. The first color television project is claimed by him, and was patented in Germany on 31 March 1908, patent № 197183, then in Britain, on 1 April 1908, patent № 7219, in France (patent № 390326) and in Russia in 1910 (patent № 17912).\n\nScottish inventor John Logie Baird demonstrated the world's first color transmission on 3 July 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters of a different primary color; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a commutator to alternate their illumination. Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on 4 February 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's Crystal Palace studios to a projection screen at London's Dominion Theatre. Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by Bell Laboratories in June 1929 using three complete systems of photoelectric cells, amplifiers, glow-tubes, and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full color image.\n\nThe first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird. In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk. This device was very \"deep\", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console. However, Baird was not happy with the design, and, as early as 1944, had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.\n\nIn 1939, Hungarian engineer Peter Carl Goldmark introduced an electro-mechanical system while at CBS, which contained an Iconoscope sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set. The system was first demonstrated to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on 29 August 1940, and shown to the press on 4 September.\n\nCBS began experimental color field tests using film as early as 28 August 1940, and live cameras by 12 November. NBC (owned by RCA) made its first field test of color television on 20 February 1941. CBS began daily color field tests on 1 June 1941. These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and, as no color television sets were available to the public at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press. The War Production Board halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from 22 April 1942 to 20 August 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.\n\nAs early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called Telechrome. Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called \"stereoscopic\" at the time). A demonstration on 16 August 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.\nSimilar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The Geer tube was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The Penetron used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The Chromatron used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.\n\nOne of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth, potentially three times that of the existing black-and-white standards, and not use an excessive amount of radio spectrum. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee approved an all-electronic system developed by RCA, which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. As black-and-white TVs could receive the same transmission and display it in black-and-white, the color system adopted is [backwards] \"compatible\". (\"Compatible Color\", featured in RCA advertisements of the period, is mentioned in the song \"America\", of West Side Story, 1957.) The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.\nAlthough all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953, high prices, and the scarcity of color programming, greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade) occurred on 1 January 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.\n\nEarly color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy; so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of GE's relatively compact and lightweight Porta-Color set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets. Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the PAL format until the 1960s, and broadcasts did not start until 1967. By this point many of the technical problems in the early sets had been worked out, and the spread of color sets in Europe was fairly rapid. By the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color and, by the early 1980s, B&W sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or for use as video monitor screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s even these areas switched to color sets.\n\nDigital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signals, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by analog television. Due to data compression digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth. It is an innovative service that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s. Digital TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers. It was not until the 1990s that digital TV became feasible.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, as Japanese consumer electronics firms forged ahead with the development of HDTV technology, the MUSE analog format proposed by NHK, a Japanese company, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies' technologies. Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard, based on an analog system, was the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the FCC was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.\n\nIn March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images.(7) Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being \"simulcast\" on different channels.(8)The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing NTSC standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.\n\nThe final standards adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution. This compromise resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes—interlaced or progressive—would be best suited for the newer digital HDTV compatible display devices. Interlaced scanning, which had been specifically designed for older analogue CRT display technologies, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. In fact, interlaced scanning can be looked at as the first video compression model as it was partly designed in the 1940s to double the image resolution to exceed the limitations of the television broadcast bandwidth. Another reason for its adoption was to limit the flickering on early CRT screens whose phosphor coated screens could only retain the image from the electron scanning gun for a relatively short duration. However interlaced scanning does not work as efficiently on newer display devices such as Liquid-crystal (LCD), for example, which are better suited to a more frequent progressive refresh rate.\n\nProgressive scanning, the format that the computer industry had long adopted for computer display monitors, scans every line in sequence, from top to bottom. Progressive scanning in effect doubles the amount of data generated for every full screen displayed in comparison to interlaced scanning by painting the screen in one pass in 1/60-second, instead of two passes in 1/30-second. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not \"flicker\" on the new standard of display devices in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offered a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then (and currently) feasible, i.e., 1,080 lines per picture and 1,920 pixels per line. Broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format. William F. Schreiber, who was director of the Advanced Television Research Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.\n\nDigital television transition started in late 2000s. All governments across the world set the deadline for analog shutdown by 2010s. Initially the adoption rate was low, as the first digital tuner-equipped TVs were costly. But soon, as the price of digital-capable TVs dropped, more and more households were converting to digital televisions. The transition is expected to be completed worldwide by mid to late 2010s.\n\nThe advent of digital television allowed innovations like smart TVs. A smart television, sometimes referred to as \"connected TV\" or \"hybrid TV\", is a television set or set-top box with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 features, and is an example of technological convergence between computers, television sets and set-top boxes. Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional broadcasting media, these devices can also provide Internet TV, online interactive media, over-the-top content, as well as on-demand streaming media, and home networking access. These TVs come pre-loaded with an operating system.\n\nSmart TV should not to be confused with Internet TV, Internet Protocol television (IPTV) or with Web TV. Internet television refers to the receiving of television content over the Internet instead of by traditional systems – terrestrial, cable and satellite (although internet itself is received by these methods). IPTV is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. Web television (WebTV) is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV. A first patent was filed in 1994 (and extended the following year) for an \"intelligent\" television system, linked with data processing systems, by means of a digital or analog network. Apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines, according to a user's demand, and process their needs. Major TV manufacturers have announced production of smart TVs only, for middle-end and high-end TVs in 2015. Smart TVs are expected to become dominant form of television by late 2010s.\n\n3D television conveys depth perception to the viewer by employing techniques such as stereoscopic display, multi-view display, 2D-plus-depth, or any other form of 3D display. Most modern 3D television sets use an active shutter 3D system or a polarized 3D system, and some are autostereoscopic without the need of glasses. Stereoscopic 3D television was demonstrated for the first time on 10 August 1928, by John Logie Baird in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London. Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using electromechanical and cathode-ray tube techniques. The first 3D TV was produced in 1935. The advent of digital television in the 2000s greatly improved 3D TVs. Although 3D TV sets are quite popular for watching 3D home media such as on Blu-ray discs, 3D programming has largely failed to make inroads with the public. Many 3D television channels which started in the early 2010s were shut down by the mid-2010s.According to DisplaySearch 3D televisions shipments totaled 41.45 million units in 2012, compared with 24.14 in 2011 and 2.26 in 2010. As of late 2013, the number of 3D TV viewers started to decline.\n\nProgramming is broadcast by television stations, sometimes called \"channels\", as stations are licensed by their governments to broadcast only over assigned channels in the television band. At first, terrestrial broadcasting was the only way television could be widely distributed, and because bandwidth was limited, i.e., there were only a small number of channels available, government regulation was the norm. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in July 1941, but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a television license fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which had public service as part of its Royal Charter.\n\nWRGB claims to be the world's oldest television station, tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on 13 January 1928, broadcasting from the General Electric factory in Schenectady, NY, under the call letters W2XB. It was popularly known as \"WGY Television\" after its sister radio station. Later in 1928, General Electric started a second facility, this one in New York City, which had the call letters W2XBS and which today is known as WNBC. The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. The image of a Felix the Cat doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers. On 2 November 1936, the BBC began transmitting the world's first public regular high-definition service from the Victorian Alexandra Palace in north London. It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today.\n\nWith the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 80s, terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline; in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of US households used an antenna. A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to switchover to digital terrestrial television broadcasts, which offered pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an alternate to cable television (CATV) for cord cutters. All other countries around the world are also in the process of either shutting down analog terrestrial television or switching over to digital terrestrial television.\n\nCable television is a system of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. In the 2000s, FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. The abbreviation CATV is often used for cable television. It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large \"community antennas\" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes. The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924. Earlier cable television was analog, but since the 2000s, all cable operators have switched to, or are in the process of switching to, digital cable television.\n\nSatellite television is a system of supplying television programming using broadcast signals relayed from communication satellites. The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a satellite dish and a low-noise block downconverter (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television program for viewing on a television set. Receivers can be external set-top boxes, or a built-in television tuner. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television.\n\nThe most common method of reception is direct-broadcast satellite television (DBSTV), also known as \"direct to home\" (DTH). In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a direct broadcast satellite on the K wavelength and are completely digital. Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as television receive-only. These systems received analog signals transmitted in the C-band spectrum from FSS type satellites, and required the use of large dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed \"big dish\" systems, and were more expensive and less popular.\n\nThe direct-broadcast satellite television signals were earlier analog signals and later digital signals, both of which require a compatible receiver. Digital signals may include high-definition television (HDTV). Some transmissions and channels are free-to-air or free-to-view, while many other channels are pay television requiring a subscription.\nIn 1945, British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke proposed a worldwide communications system which would function by means of three satellites equally spaced apart in earth orbit. This was published in the October 1945 issue of the \"Wireless World\" magazine and won him the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1963.\n\nThe first satellite television signals from Europe to North America were relayed via the Telstar satellite over the Atlantic ocean on 23 July 1962. The signals were received and broadcast in North American and European countries and watched by over 100 million. Launched in 1962, the \"Relay 1\" satellite was the first satellite to transmit television signals from the US to Japan. The first geosynchronous communication satellite, Syncom 2, was launched on 26 July 1963.\n\nThe world's first commercial communications satellite, called Intelsat I and nicknamed \"Early Bird\", was launched into geosynchronous orbit on 6 April 1965. The first national network of television satellites, called Orbita, was created by the Soviet Union in October 1967, and was based on the principle of using the highly elliptical Molniya satellite for rebroadcasting and delivering of television signals to ground downlink stations. The first commercial North American satellite to carry television transmissions was Canada's geostationary Anik 1, which was launched on 9 November 1972. ATS-6, the world's first experimental educational and Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), was launched on 30 May 1974. It transmitted at 860 MHz using wideband FM modulation and had two sound channels. The transmissions were focused on the Indian subcontinent but experimenters were able to receive the signal in Western Europe using home constructed equipment that drew on UHF television design techniques already in use.\n\nThe first in a series of Soviet geostationary satellites to carry Direct-To-Home television, Ekran 1, was launched on 26 October 1976. It used a 714 MHz UHF downlink frequency so that the transmissions could be received with existing UHF television technology rather than microwave technology.\n\nInternet television (Internet TV) (or online television) is the digital distribution of television content via the Internet as opposed to traditional systems like terrestrial, cable, and satellite, although the Internet itself is received by terrestrial, cable, or satellite methods. Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows, and other video content, over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters. Internet television should not be confused with Smart TV, IPTV or with Web TV. Smart television refers to the TV set which has a built-in operating system. Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. Web television is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.\n\nA television set, also called a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or \"telly\", is a device that combines a tuner, display, an amplifier, and speakers for the purpose of viewing television and hearing its audio components. Introduced in late 1920's in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax and VHS, which enabled viewers to record TV shows and watch prerecorded movies. In the subsequent decades, TVs were used to watch DVDs and Blu-ray Discs of movies and other content. Major TV manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma and fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. Televisions since 2010s mostly use LEDs. LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs in near future.\n\nThe earliest systems employed a spinning disk to create and reproduce images. These usually had a low resolution and screen size and never became popular with the public.\n\nThe cathode ray tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube containing one or more electron guns (a source of electrons or electron emitter) and a fluorescent screen used to view images.\nIt has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. The images may represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures (television, computer monitor), radar targets or others. The CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope which is large, deep (i.e. long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile. As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick lead glass so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most X-ray emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product.\n\nIn television sets and computer monitors, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a raster. An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three electron beams, one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a video signal as a reference. In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by \"magnetic deflection\", a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in oscilloscopes, a type of diagnostic instrument.\n\nDigital Light Processing (DLP) is a type of video projector technology that uses a digital micromirror device. Some DLPs have a TV tuner, which makes them a type of TV display. It was originally developed in 1987 by Dr. Larry Hornbeck of Texas Instruments. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997. Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded Emmy Awards in 1998 for invention of the DLP projector technology. DLP is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses. DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), but also in private homes; in these cases, the image is projected onto a projection screen. DLP is also used in DLP rear projection television sets and digital signs. It is also used in about 85% of digital cinema projection.\n\nA plasma display panel (PDP) is a type of flat panel display common to large TV displays or larger. They are called \"plasma\" displays because the technology utilizes small cells containing electrically charged ionized gases, or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as fluorescent lamps.\nLiquid-crystal-display televisions (LCD TV) are television sets that use LCD display technology to produce images. LCD televisions are much thinner and lighter than cathode ray tube (CRTs) of similar display size, and are available in much larger sizes (e.g., 90-inch diagonal). When manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers. LCD's come in two types: those using cold cathode fluorescent lamps, simply called LCDs and those using LED as backlight called as LEDs.\n\nIn 2007, LCD televisions surpassed sales of CRT-based televisions worldwide for the first time, and their sales figures relative to other technologies accelerated. LCD TVs have quickly displaced the only major competitors in the large-screen market, the plasma display panel and rear-projection television. In mid 2010s LCDs especially LEDs became, by far, the most widely produced and sold television display type. LCDs also have disadvantages. Other technologies address these weaknesses, including OLEDs, FED and SED, but none of these have entered widespread production.\n\nAn OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a light-emitting diode (LED) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound which emits light in response to an electric current. This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes. Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens. It is also used for computer monitors, portable systems such as mobile phones, handheld games consoles and PDAs.\n\nThere are two main families of OLED: those based on small molecules and those employing polymers. Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell or LEC, which has a slightly different mode of operation. OLED displays can use either passive-matrix (PMOLED) or active-matrix (AMOLED) addressing schemes. Active-matrix OLEDs require a thin-film transistor backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes.\n\nAn OLED display works without a backlight. Thus, it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display (LCD). In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD, whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or LED backlight. OLEDs are expected to replace other forms of display in near future.\n\nLow-definition television or LDTV refers to television systems that have a lower screen resolution than standard-definition television systems such 240p (320*240). It is used in handheld television. The most common source of LDTV programming is the Internet, where mass distribution of higher-resolution video files could overwhelm computer servers and take too long to download. Many mobile phones and portable devices such as Apple's iPod Nano, or Sony's PlayStation Portable use LDTV video, as higher-resolution files would be excessive to the needs of their small screens (320×240 and 480×272 pixels respectively). The current generation of iPod Nanos have LDTV screens, as do the first three generations of iPod Touch and iPhone (480×320). For the first years of its existence, YouTube offered only one, low-definition resolution of 320x240p at 30fps or less. A standard, consumer grade VHS videotape can be considered SDTV due to its resolution (approximately 360 × 480i/576i).\n\nStandard-definition television or SDTV refers to two different resolutions: 576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution, derived from the European-developed PAL and SECAM systems; and 480i based on the American National Television System Committee NTSC system. SDTV is a television system that uses a resolution that is not considered to be either high-definition television (720p, 1080i, 1080p, 1440p, 4K UHDTV, and 8K UHD) or enhanced-definition television (EDTV 480p). In North America, digital SDTV is broadcast in the same aspect ratio as NTSC signals with widescreen content being center cut. However, in other parts of the world that used the PAL or SECAM color systems, standard-definition television is now usually shown with a aspect ratio, with the transition occurring between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s. Older programs with a 4:3 aspect ratio are shown in the US as 4:3 with non-ATSC countries preferring to reduce the horizontal resolution by anamorphically scaling a pillarboxed image.\n\nHigh-definition television (HDTV) provides a resolution that is substantially higher than that of standard-definition television.\n\nHDTV may be transmitted in various formats:\n\nUltra-high-definition television (also known as Super Hi-Vision, Ultra HD television, UltraHD, UHDTV, or UHD) includes 4K UHD (2160p) and 8K UHD (4320p), which are two digital video formats proposed by NHK Science & Technology Research Laboratories and defined and approved by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The Consumer Electronics Association announced on 17 October 2012, that \"Ultra High Definition\", or \"Ultra HD\", would be used for displays that have an aspect ratio of at least 16:9 and at least one digital input capable of carrying and presenting native video at a minimum resolution of 3840×2160 pixels.\n\nNorth American consumers purchase a new television set on average every seven years, and the average household owns 2.8 televisions. , 48 million are sold each year at an average price of $460 and size of .\n\nGetting TV programming shown to the public can happen in many different ways. After production, the next step is to market and deliver the product to whichever markets are open to using it. This typically happens on two levels:\n\n\nFirst-run programming is increasing on subscription services outside the US, but few domestically produced programs are syndicated on domestic free-to-air (FTA) elsewhere. This practice is increasing, however, generally on digital-only FTA channels or with subscriber-only, first-run material appearing on FTA. Unlike the US, repeat FTA screenings of an FTA network program usually only occur on that network. Also, affiliates rarely buy or produce non-network programming that is not centered on local programming.\n\nTelevision genres include a broad range of programming types that entertain, inform, and educate viewers. The most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually dramas and dramatic miniseries. However, other genres, such as historical Western genres, may also have high production costs.\n\nPopular culture entertainment genres include action-oriented shows such as police, crime, detective dramas, horror, or thriller shows. As well, there are also other variants of the drama genre, such as medical dramas and daytime soap operas. Science fiction shows can fall into either the drama or action category, depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or high adventure. Comedy is a popular genre which includes situation comedy (sitcom) and animated shows for the adult demographic such as \"South Park\".\n\nThe least expensive forms of entertainment programming genres are game shows, talk shows, variety shows, and reality television. Game shows feature contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes. Talk shows contain interviews with film, television, music and sports celebrities and public figures. Variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers, such as comedians and magicians, introduced by a host or Master of Ceremonies. There is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows because leading talk shows often feature performances by bands, singers, comedians, and other performers in between the interview segments. \"Reality TV\" shows \"regular\" people (i.e., not actors) facing unusual challenges or experiences ranging from arrest by police officers (\"COPS\") to significant weight loss (\"The Biggest Loser\"). A variant version of reality shows depicts celebrities doing mundane activities such as going about their everyday life (\"The Osbournes\", \"Snoop Dogg's Father Hood\") or doing regular jobs (\"The Simple Life\").\n\nFictional television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are \"quality television\", include series such as \"Twin Peaks\" and \"The Sopranos\". Kristin Thompson argues that some of these television series exhibit traits also found in art films, such as psychological realism, narrative complexity, and ambiguous plotlines. Nonfiction television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are \"quality television\", include a range of serious, noncommercial, programming aimed at a niche audience, such as documentaries and public affairs shows.\n\nAround the globe, broadcast TV is financed by government, advertising, licensing (a form of tax), subscription, or any combination of these. To protect revenues, subscription TV channels are usually encrypted to ensure that only subscribers receive the decryption codes to see the signal. Unencrypted channels are known as free to air or FTA. In 2009, the global TV market represented 1,217.2 million TV households with at least one TV and total revenues of 268.9 billion EUR (declining 1.2% compared to 2008). North America had the biggest TV revenue market share with 39% followed by Europe (31%), Asia-Pacific (21%), Latin America (8%), and Africa and the Middle East (2%). Globally, the different TV revenue sources divide into 45%–50% TV advertising revenues, 40%–45% subscription fees and 10% public funding.\n\nTV's broad reach makes it a powerful and attractive medium for advertisers. Many TV networks and stations sell blocks of broadcast time to advertisers (\"sponsors\") to fund their programming. Television advertisements (variously called a television commercial, commercial or ad in American English, and known in British English as an advert) is a span of television programming produced and paid for by an organization, which conveys a message, typically to market a product or service. Advertising revenue provides a significant portion of the funding for most privately owned television networks. The vast majority of television advertisements today consist of brief advertising spots, ranging in length from a few seconds to several minutes (as well as program-length infomercials). Advertisements of this sort have been used to promote a wide variety of goods, services and ideas since the beginning of television.\n\nThe effects of television advertising upon the viewing public (and the effects of mass media in general) have been the subject of philosophical discourse by such luminaries as Marshall McLuhan. The viewership of television programming, as measured by companies such as Nielsen Media Research, is often used as a metric for television advertisement placement, and consequently, for the rates charged to advertisers to air within a given network, television program, or time of day (called a \"daypart\"). In many countries, including the United States, television campaign advertisements are considered indispensable for a political campaign. In other countries, such as France, political advertising on television is heavily restricted, while some countries, such as Norway, completely ban political advertisements.\n\nThe first official, paid television advertisement was broadcast in the United States on 1 July 1941 over New York station WNBT (now WNBC) before a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The announcement for Bulova watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase \"Bulova Watch Time\", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute. The first TV ad broadcast in the UK was on ITV on 22 September 1955, advertising Gibbs SR toothpaste. The first TV ad broadcast in Asia was on Nippon Television in Tokyo on 28 August 1953, advertising Seikosha (now Seiko), which also displayed a clock with the current time.\n\nSince inception in the US in 1941, television commercials have become one of the most effective, persuasive, and popular methods of selling products of many sorts, especially consumer goods. During the 1940s and into the 1950s, programs were hosted by single advertisers. This, in turn, gave great creative license to the advertisers over the content of the show. Perhaps due to the quiz show scandals in the 1950s, networks shifted to the magazine concept, introducing advertising breaks with multiple advertisers.\n\nUS advertising rates are determined primarily by Nielsen ratings. The time of the day and popularity of the channel determine how much a TV commercial can cost. For example, it can cost approximately $750,000 for a 30-second block of commercial time during the highly popular American Idol, while the same amount of time for the Super Bowl can cost several million dollars. Conversely, lesser-viewed time slots, such as early mornings and weekday afternoons, are often sold in bulk to producers of infomercials at far lower rates. In recent years, the paid program or infomercial has become common, usually in lengths of 30 minutes or one hour. Some drug companies and other businesses have even created \"news\" items for broadcast, known in the industry as video news releases, paying program directors to use them.\n\nSome TV programs also deliberately place products into their shows as advertisements, a practice started in feature films and known as product placement. For example, a character could be drinking a certain kind of soda, going to a particular chain restaurant, or driving a certain make of car. (This is sometimes very subtle, with shows having vehicles provided by manufacturers for low cost in exchange as a product placement). Sometimes, a specific brand or trade mark, or music from a certain artist or group, is used. (This excludes guest appearances by artists who perform on the show.)\n\nThe TV regulator oversees TV advertising in the United Kingdom. Its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded TV. Despite this, an early TV mogul, Roy Thomson, likened the broadcasting licence as being a \"licence to print money\". Restrictions mean that the big three national commercial TV channels: ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5 can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour (eight minutes in the peak period). Other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes (twelve in the peak). This means that many imported TV shows from the US have unnatural pauses where the UK company does not utilize the narrative breaks intended for more frequent US advertising. Advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs which last less than half an hour in scheduled duration; this list includes any news or current affairs programs, documentaries, and programs for children; additionally, advertisements may not be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any religious broadcasting service or other devotional program or during a formal Royal ceremony or occasion. There also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements. The BBC, being strictly non-commercial, is not allowed to show advertisements on television in the UK, although it has many advertising-funded channels abroad. The majority of its budget comes from television license fees (see below) and broadcast syndication, the sale of content to other broadcasters.\n\nBroadcast advertising is regulated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland,\n\nSome TV channels are partly funded from subscriptions; therefore, the signals are encrypted during broadcast to ensure that only the paying subscribers have access to the decryption codes to watch pay television or specialty channels. Most subscription services are also funded by advertising.\n\nTelevision services in some countries may be funded by a television licence or a form of taxation, which means that advertising plays a lesser role or no role at all. For example, some channels may carry no advertising at all and some very little, including:\n\nThe BBC carries no television advertising on its UK channels and is funded by an annual television licence paid by premises receiving live TV broadcasts. Currently, it is estimated that approximately 26.8 million UK private domestic households own televisions, with approximately 25 million TV licences in all premises in force as of 2010. This television license fee is set by the government, but the BBC is not answerable to or controlled by the government.\n\nThe two main BBC TV channels are watched by almost 90% of the population each week and overall have 27% share of total viewing, despite the fact that 85% of homes are multichannel, with 42% of these having access to 200 free to air channels via satellite and another 43% having access to 30 or more channels via Freeview. The licence that funds the seven advertising-free BBC TV channels costs £147 a year (about US$200) as of 2018 regardless of the number of TV sets owned; the price is reduced by two thirds if only black and white television is received. When the same sporting event has been presented on both BBC and commercial channels, the BBC always attracts the lion's share of the audience, indicating that viewers prefer to watch TV uninterrupted by advertising.\n\nOther than internal promotional material, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) carries no advertising; it is banned under the ABC Act 1983. The ABC receives its funding from the Australian government every three years. In the 2014/15 federal budget, the ABC received A$1.11 billion. The funds provide for the ABC's television, radio, online, and international outputs. The ABC also receives funds from its many ABC shops across Australia. Although funded by the Australian government, the editorial independence of the ABC is ensured through law.\n\nIn France, government-funded channels carry advertisements, yet those who own television sets have to pay an annual tax (\"la redevance audiovisuelle\").\n\nIn Japan, NHK is paid for by license fees (known in Japanese as ). The broadcast law that governs NHK's funding stipulates that any television equipped to receive NHK is required to pay. The fee is standardized, with discounts for office workers and students who commute, as well a general discount for residents of Okinawa prefecture.\n\nBroadcast programming, or TV listings in the United Kingdom, is the practice of organizing television programs in a schedule, with broadcast automation used to regularly change the scheduling of TV programs to build an audience for a new show, retain that audience, or compete with other broadcasters' programs.\n\nTelevision has played a pivotal role in the socialization of the 20th and 21st centuries. There are many aspects of television that can be addressed, including negative issues such as media violence. Current research is discovering that individuals suffering from social isolation can employ television to create what is termed a parasocial or faux relationship with characters from their favorite television shows and movies as a way of deflecting feelings of loneliness and social deprivation. Several studies have found that educational television has many advantages. The article \"The Good Things about Television\" argues that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely.\n\nWith high lead content in CRTs and the rapid diffusion of new flat-panel display technologies, some of which (LCDs) use lamps which contain mercury, there is growing concern about electronic waste from discarded televisions. Related occupational health concerns exist, as well, for disassemblers removing copper wiring and other materials from CRTs. Further environmental concerns related to television design and use relate to the devices' increasing electrical energy requirements.\n\nA 2017 study in \"The Journal of Human Resources\" found that exposure to cable television reduced cognitive ability and high school graduation rates for boys. This effect was stronger for boys from more educated families. The article suggests a mechanism where light television entertainment crowds out more cognitively stimulating activities.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57712092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57712092", "title": "The Incredibles (franchise)", "text": "The Incredibles (franchise)\n\nThe Incredibles is an American media franchise created by Pixar Animation Studios. Brad Bird wrote and directed both films, and Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell and Samuel L. Jackson are part of the cast. The first film, \"The Incredibles\", was released in November 2004 and received acclaim from critics, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. The second film, \"Incredibles 2\", was released in June 2018, received mostly positive reviews and set the record for best opening weekend for an animated film with $183 million. The series has grossed a combined $1.873 billion worldwide.\n\nA family of superheroes, while trying to live a quiet suburban life after superheroes are deemed illegal, are forced into action to save the world.\n\nIn an effort to reinstate the public's trust in superheroes, Helen (Elastigirl) is chosen by a telecommunications corporation to pull off a publicity stunt while her husband Bob (Mr. Incredible) is left to care for their kids, Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Incredibles 2\", director Brad Bird acknowledged that the film's truncated production schedule resulted in many plotlines and ideas he had for the film being cut from the final version. He cited Pixar's decision in October 2016 to swap the release dates of \"Toy Story 4\" and \"Incredibles 2\", which meant that Bird’s film lost a full year of production. Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment, just as they did with the second. \"There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]... whether it's another \"Incredibles\" film, or something else.\" Cast members including Samuel L. Jackson and Sophia Bush have expressed interest in reprising their roles. \"I wouldn't ever rule it out,\" said producer John Walker of a potential third film. \"And if past is prologue, it'll be another 14 years — and a lot of people will probably need oxygen to make a third one.\"\n\nA short film was released on March 15, 2005 on the first film's DVD release, entitled \"Jack-Jack Attack.\" Bird returned to write and direct the short. It was originally conceived to be part of the first film, but decided to make it into a short. The short takes place during the events of the first film and follows Kari as she babysits Jack-Jack while discovering his newly awakened superpowers in the process.\n\nAnother short film titled \"Mr. Incredible and Pals\" was also included on the first film's DVD release. The short is a fictional episode of a low-budget 1960s animated series in the style of \"Clutch Cargo.\" It follows Mr. Incredible, Frozone, and their rabbit pal Mister Skipperdoo's attempt to prevent a bridge from being destroyed. Craig T. Nelson and Samuel L. Jackson appear in character as Mr. Incredible and Frozone respectively in the short's commentary track.\n\nA short film entitled \" Auntie Edna\" was released on October 23, 2018 included with the digital release of \"Incredibles 2\" and on November 6, 2018 with the film's DVD and Blu-ray release. In a similar manner to \"Jack-Jack Attack\", the short follows Edna during the events of \"Incredibles 2\" as she babysits Jack-Jack while coping with his newly discovered powers.\n\nA video game developed by Heavy Iron Studios and published by THQ based on the 2004 film was released on October 31, 2004 for PlayStation 2, mobile phone, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Game Boy Advance, GameCube, and Xbox.\n\nA video game presented as a direct continuation of \"The Incredibles\" (until \"Incredibles 2\" rendered it non-canon), released in October 24, 2005 for PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Game Boy Advance, GameCube, and Xbox, once again developed by Heavy Iron Studios and published by THQ. The game takes place after the events of the film and follows Mr. Incredible and Frozone as they face off against the Underminer as he prepares his attack on the Earth's surface.\n\nA Lego video game adaptation based on the events of the first two films was developed by TT Fusion and released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment on June 15, 2018 for Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 coinciding with the release of \"Incredibles 2\".\n\n\"The Incredibles\" have made appearances in other Disney-related video games, including ,\nA PC game featuring several minigames released in 2004. They also appeared in all three \"Disney Infinity\" games in which characters from the films appear as playable characters, with the first game featuring a play set based on the franchise, and \"\" for Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Windows 10, which includes missions from various Pixar films including \"The Incredibles\".\n\n\"The Incredibles\" as a concept dates back to 1993 when Bird sketched the family during a period in which he tried to break into film. Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life. During this time, Bird had inked a production deal with Warner Bros. Animation and was in the process of directing his first feature, \"The Iron Giant\". Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking, Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life. He stated, \"Consciously, this was just a funny movie about superheroes. But I think that what was going on in my life definitely filtered into the movie.\" After the box office failure of \"The Iron Giant\", Bird gravitated toward his superhero story.\n\nHe imagined it as a homage to the 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and he initially tried to develop it as a 2D cel animation. When \"The Iron Giant\" became a box office bomb, he reconnected with old friend John Lasseter at Pixar in March 2000 and pitched his story idea to him. Bird and Lasseter knew each other from their college years at CalArts in the 1970s. Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar, where the film would be done in computer animation. The studio announced a multi-film contract with Bird on May 4, 2000, breaking Pixar's mold of having directors who had all risen through the ranks. \"The Incredibles\" was written and directed solely by Brad Bird, a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically had two or three directors and as many screenwriters. In addition, it would be the company's first film in which all characters are human.\n\nFollowing the first film, Brad Bird directed his next film for Pixar, \"Ratatouille\", which was released in June 2007. Near its premiere, Bird said he was open to an idea of a sequel to \"The Incredibles\", but only if it could be even better than the original. He stated, \"I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together.\"\n\nIn a May 2013 interview, Bird reiterated his interest in a sequel: \"I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have—because I love those characters, and love that world.\" He added: \"I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another \"Incredibles\" film, and if I can get 'em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that.\" While publicizing the first film, Bird had already conceptualized the eventual approach where Bob and Helen would switch roles, and Jack-Jack would develop multiple powers yet known by the family.\n\nPixar announced in November 2016 that both Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson would return to reprise their roles, and at the July 2017 D23 Expo that both Craig T. Nelson and Sarah Vowell would also return with them. Spencer Fox, the original voice of Dashiell \"Dash\" Parr, was replaced in the sequel by younger newcomer Huck Milner. Also that July, Brad Bird and John Ratzenberger were confirmed as reprising their characters from the first film.\n\nIn November 2017, Pixar announced that Bob Odenkirk and Catherine Keener had been signed to the cast, but did not disclose their roles as new characters Winston and Evelyn Deavor until a later date. In January 2018, it was announced that Sophia Bush and Isabella Rossellini would voice new characters Voyd and The Ambassador, while Jonathan Banks would voice Rick Dicker, after the character's original voice actor, Bud Luckey, retired in 2014; after his death in 2018, the film was dedicated to Luckey's memory.\n"}
{"id": "43471725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43471725", "title": "The Magic School Bus", "text": "The Magic School Bus\n\nThe Magic School Bus is an American edutainment media franchise that consists of a book series, a TV series, and several video games, among other things. Each of the stories within the franchise centers on the antics of a fictional elementary school teacher, Ms. Frizzle, and her class, who board a \"magic school bus\", which takes them on field trips to unusual locations, such as the solar system, clouds, the past, and inside the human body.\n\nThe first media in which this franchise was developed was the \"Magic School Bus\" book series. Craig Walker, vice-president and senior editorial director at Scholastic Co., stated that the concept began with the idea of combining science with fictional stories, and Joanna Cole (who had written both science and humor before) and Bruce Degen were then approached with creating such a series. Walker also states that his own memories of school field trips and of a teacher he had once, served as further inspiration. The first book \"At the Waterworks\" was written in 1985 and published the following year. The books are written in the first person from the point of view of an unnamed student in \"the Friz's\" class. Cole and Degen started a new series called \"Ms. Frizzle's Adventures\" in 2001, which teaches social studies, eventually producing three books in that series. Microsoft Home started publishing \"Magic School Bus\" software in 1994.\n\nIn 1994, \"The Magic School Bus\" concept was also made into an animated series of the same name by Scholastic Entertainment, and premiered on September 10, 1994. Scholastic Entertainment president Deborah Forte says that adapting the books into an animated series was an opportunity to help kids \"learn about science in a fun way\". Around that time, Forte had been hearing concern from parents and teachers about how to improve science education for girls and minorities. As noted by Marcel LaFollette, \"accomplished women were exceptions in a universe of male luminaries\" when it came to science television. Miss Valerie Frizzle, the magic school teacher, was the closest approximation to an expert female host. She was voiced by Lily Tomlin in the series. \n\nEach episode of the series ran for 30 minutes. In the United States, the series originally aired on PBS as a part of its children's block, PTV (later renamed PBS Kids), through South Carolina's SCETV network; it was the first fully animated series to be aired on PBS. The last episode aired on December 6, 1997; the series then aired reruns on PBS until September 1998. The Fox network aired repeats from September 1998 to September 2002. Starting September 27, 2010, \"The Magic School Bus\" started a daily run on Qubo in the US, and on Saturday mornings on NBC through June 30th, 2012, when the Qubo block was replaced with the NBC Kids block.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2000, several \"Magic School Bus\" video games were released. Most of the original titles were created by the software company Music Pen in collaboration with Microsoft and Scholastic Press, the publisher of the \"Magic School Bus\" book series. Though in the cartoon series, the bus was obviously animated in the usual way, in the CD-ROM games, it is typically animated with computer generated imagery. In all these titles the user gets to \"drive\" the bus, which almost always involves clicking on the steering wheel and choosing a location. (The exception is \"The Magic School Bus Explores Inside the Earth\" where it is the gear shift instead of the steering wheel.) Most of the games have about seven different locations, including the classroom. There is always some goal for the user in each one.\n\nScholastic Entertainment, the American Meteorological Society and the Children's Museum of Houston created a \"Scholastics the Magic School Bus Kicks Up a Storm\", a . traveling exhibit funded in part by the National Science Foundation, which premiered at the Children's Museum of Houston in 2003 (a copy of it opened in New Jersey the month after that).\n\nOn September 29, 2017, Scholastic and Netflix released the reboot animated series \"The Magic School Bus Rides Again\", with Kate McKinnon as the voice of Ms. Frizzle's sister, Fiona Felicity Frizzle, who is now in charge of the class. Lily Tomlin also reprises her role as Ms. Frizzle, now Professor Frizzle, Ph.D.\n\n"}
{"id": "376228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=376228", "title": "The Matrix (franchise)", "text": "The Matrix (franchise)\n\nThe Matrix is a science fiction action media franchise created by The Wachowski Brothers, about heroes who fight a desperate war against machine overlords that have enslaved humanity in an extremely sophisticated virtual reality system. The series is most notable for its two uses of slow motion, which revolutionized action films to come. \n\nThe series began with the feature film \"The Matrix\" (1999), and continued with two sequels, \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"The Matrix Revolutions\" (both 2003), all written and directed by The Wachowskis and produced by Joel Silver. The franchise is owned by Warner Bros., which distributed the films along with Village Roadshow Pictures. The latter, along with Silver Pictures are the two production companies that worked on all three films.\n\nThe first film was an important critical and commercial success, winning four Academy Awards, introducing popular culture symbols such as the red pill and blue pill, and influencing action filmmaking. For those reasons it has been added to the National Film Registry for preservation. Its first sequel was an even bigger commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing R-rated film in history, a title which it held for 13 years, until it was surpassed by the film Deadpool.\n\nThe series features a cyberpunk story of the technological fall of man, in which a self-aware artificial intelligence has wiped most of humanity from the Earth except for those it enslaves in a virtual reality system as a farmed power source, and the relatively few remaining humans who are free of that system. The A.I. agenda is to destroy all humans who are free, considering them a threat/disease. The story incorporates references to numerous philosophical and religious ideas. Influences include the principles of mythology, anime, and Hong Kong action films (particularly \"heroic bloodshed\" and martial arts movies). Consistent throughout are the concepts of inter-dependency and love.\n\nThe characters and settings of the films are further explored in other media set in the same fictional universe, including animation, comics, and video games. The comic \"Bits and Pieces of Information\" and \"The Animatrix\" short film \"The Second Renaissance\" act as prequels to the films, explaining how the franchise's setting came to be. The video game \"Enter the Matrix\" connects the story of the \"Animatrix\" short \"Final Flight of the Osiris\" with the events of \"Reloaded\", while the video game \"The Matrix Online\" is a direct sequel to \"Revolutions\".\n\nAs of February 2016, the franchise has generated $3 billion in revenue, making it one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. In March 2017, it was reported that Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise with new films.\n\nThe series depicts a future in which Earth is dominated by artificial intelligence that was created early in the 21st century and rebelled against humanity. At one point, humans attempted to block out the machines' source of solar power by covering the sky in thick, stormy clouds. During this time, the machines and mankind were engaged in a massive war in which the machines ultimately emerged the victor. Having no definite source of energy, the machines devised a way to extract humans' bioelectricity and thermal energy by growing people in pods, while their minds are controlled by cybernetic implants connecting them to a simulated reality called the Matrix.\n\nThe virtual reality world simulated by the Matrix resembles human civilization around the turn of the 21st century (this time period was chosen because it is supposedly the pinnacle of human civilization). The majority of the stories in the \"Matrix\" franchise take place in a vast Western World unnamed megacity. This environment is practically indistinguishable from reality (although scenes set within the Matrix are presented on-screen with a green tint to the footage, and a general bias towards the color green), and the majority of bluepills - humans connected to the Matrix - are unaware of its true nature. Most of the central characters in the series are able to gain superhuman abilities within the Matrix by taking advantage of their understanding of its true nature to manipulate its virtual physical laws.\n\nThe virtual world is first introduced in \"The Matrix\". The \"Animatrix\" short film \"The Second Renaissance\" and the short comic \"Bits and Pieces of Information\" show how the initial conflict between humans and machines came about, and how and why the Matrix was first developed. Its history and purpose are further explained in \"The Matrix Reloaded\".\n\nThe \"Matrix\" series includes a trilogy of feature films, all of which were written and directed by The Wachowskis and produced by Joel Silver, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving. The series was filmed in Australia and began with 1999's \"The Matrix\", which depicts the recruitment of hacker Neo into humanity's rebellion against sentient machines. The film was highly successful, earning $460 million worldwide, and becoming the first DVD release in the United States to reach sales of three million copies.\n\nThe film's mainstream success had backed up the initial idea of making a trilogy. The sequels, \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"The Matrix Revolutions\", were filmed simultaneously during one shoot (under the project codename \"The Burly Man\"), and released in two parts in 2003. They tell the story of the impending attack on the human enclave of Zion by a vast machine army. Neo also learns more about the history of the Matrix and his role as The One. The sequels also incorporate more ambitious action scenes and visual effects.\n\nWhile making the \"Matrix\" films, the Wachowskis told their close collaborators that at that time they had no intention of making another one after \"The Matrix Revolutions\". In February 2015, in interviews promoting \"Jupiter Ascending\", Lilly Wachowski called a return to \"The Matrix\" a \"particularly repelling idea in these times\", noting the studios' tendency to green-light sequels, reboots, and adaptations over original material, while Lana Wachowski, addressing rumors about a potential reboot, said they haven't heard anything, but she believed the studio might be looking to replace them.\n\nIn March 2017, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote that Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise, with Zak Penn in talks to write a treatment, and interest in getting Michael B. Jordan attached to star. According to the article neither the Wachowskis nor Joel Silver were involved at that stage, although the studio would like to get at minimum the blessing of the Wachowskis. Penn struck down the notion of a reboot or remake, stating he is interested in seeing stories set in the already established universe. Reportedly, one such story the studio is considering, is a prequel film about a young Morpheus. The previous month, Keanu Reeves said he would return to a potential new \"Matrix\" film only if the Wachowskis were writing and directing. In April 2017, Hugo Weaving said he would be open to returning in future Matrix films if the scripts were good and came with the Wachowskis' blessing, although he believed the producers would likely want a fresh start with a new cast. In March 2018, Penn said he is working on a revival of the franchise and teased the possibility of an expanded universe.\n\nThe following is a list of crew members who have participated in the making of the \"Matrix\" film series.\n\nIn 2004, Warner Home Video released \"The Ultimate Matrix Collection\", a ten-disc set of the films on DVD. It included all three films, \"The Animatrix\", and six discs of additional material, including the documentary film \"The Matrix Revisited\", the live action footage shot for \"Enter the Matrix\", and a promotional compilation of \"The Matrix Online\". For this release, \"The Matrix\" was remastered under the supervision of the Wachowskis and Bill Pope to improve its picture quality and make its coloring closer to that of its sequels. At the request of the Wachowskis, as they explain in a written statement that accompanies the boxset, each of the three films is accompanied by two audio commentaries, one by philosophers who liked the films, and another by critics who did not, with the intention that viewers use them as reference points to form their own opinion. A \"Limited Edition\" of \"The Ultimate Matrix Collection\" was also released. It encases the ten discs plus a resin bust of Neo inside an acrylic glass box.\n\n\"The Ultimate Matrix Collection\" was later also released on HD DVD and Blu-ray in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The HD DVD release added a picture-in-picture video commentary to the three films and the extras the original standalone DVD releases of the films had. The Blu-ray release presented \"The Animatrix\" in high definition for the first time.\n\nWhile \"The Matrix\" received largely positive reviews, and \"The Matrix Reloaded\" received generally positive reviews, the critical response to \"The Matrix Revolutions\" was mixed. One major complaint was that it did not give any answers to the questions raised in \"Reloaded\". CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the series an average grade of \"A−\", \"B+\", \"B\" respectively on an A+ to F scale.\n\nThe \"Matrix\" films makes numerous references to films and literature, and to historical myths and philosophy including Buddhism, Vedanta, Advaita Hinduism, Christianity, Messianism, Judaism, Gnosticism, existentialism, obscurantism, and nihilism. The films' premise resembles Plato's Allegory of the cave, René Descartes's evil demon, Kant's reflections on the Phenomenon versus the Ding an sich, Zhuangzi's \"Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly\", Marxist social theory and the brain in a vat thought experiment. Many references to Jean Baudrillard's \"Simulacra and Simulation\" appear in the first film. Baudrillard himself considered this a misrepresentation, although Lana Wachowski claims the point the reference was making was misunderstood. There are similarities to cyberpunk works such as \"Neuromancer\" by William Gibson, who has described \"The Matrix\" as \"arguably the ultimate 'cyberpunk' artifact.\"\n\nJapanese director Mamoru Oshii's \"Ghost in the Shell\" was a strong influence. Producer Joel Silver has stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions for \"The Matrix\" by showing him that anime and saying, \"We wanna do that for real.\" Mitsuhisa Ishikawa of Production I.G, which produced \"Ghost in the Shell\", noted that the anime's high-quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowskis. He also commented, \"... cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. I'd imagine that \"The Matrix\" is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios.\" He stated that since \"Ghost in the Shell\" had gained recognition in America, the Wachowskis used it as a \"promotional tool.\" Similarities to the 1985 anime film \"Megazone 23\" have also been noticed, but the Wachowskis claimed to have never seen it.\n\nReviewers have commented on similarities between \"The Matrix\" and other late-1990s films such as \"Strange Days\", \"Dark City\", and \"The Truman Show\". The Wachowskis claimed no influence regarding \"Dark City\", but commented about it and \"The Truman Show\" that they thought it was \"very strange that Australia came to have three films associated with it that were all about the nature of reality.\".\n\nComparisons have also been made to Grant Morrison's comic series \"The Invisibles\"; Morrison believes that the Wachowskis essentially plagiarized his work to create the film. The Wachowskis have responded that they enjoy the comic but weren't inspired by it.\n\nIn addition, the similarity of the films' central concept to a device in the long-running series \"Doctor Who\" has also been noted. As in the film, the Matrix of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial \"The Deadly Assassin\") is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality.\n\nThe first \"Matrix\" film features numerous references to the \"White Rabbit\", the \"Rabbit Hole\" and mirrors, referring to Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking-Glass\".<ref name=\"archive.org\"/\n\nMatrixism is a new religious movement inspired by the trilogy. A sociologist of religion Adam Possamai describes these types of religions/spiritualities as hyper-real religions due to their eclectic mix of religion/spirituality with elements of popular culture and their connection to the fluid social structures of late capitalism. There is some debate about whether followers of Matrixism are indeed serious about their practice; however, the religion (real or otherwise) has received attention in the media.\n\nFollowing the Wachowskis' coming out as transgender women some years after the release of the films, the first film and the pill analogy have also been analyzed in the context of the Wachowskis transgender experiences. In this case, taking the red pill and living out of the Matrix symbolizes exploring one's own gender identity, starting the transition and coming out as transgender, as opposed to a continued life in the closet. Lilly Wachowski has acknowledged this analysis by calling it \"a cool thing because it's an excellent reminder that art is never static\".\n\nIn April 2003 Sophia Stewart filed a legal complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging that the idea of \"The Matrix\" (and the 1984 film \"The Terminator\") were plagiarized from her own film treatment entitled \"The Third Eye.\" The court allowed the lawsuit to move forward in 2005, but Stewart did not attend the hearing. In a 53-page ruling, Judge Margaret Morrow dismissed the case, stating that Stewart and her attorneys \"had not entered any evidence to bolster its key claims or demonstrated any striking similarity between her work and the accused directors’ films.\" Despite the ruling, the case became the subject of \"Internet legend,\" with many sources claiming Stewart had actually won the lawsuit.\n\nIn 2013 Thomas Althouse filed suit in California federal court alleging that ideas for the sequels \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"The Matrix Revolutions\" came from a screenplay he wrote called \"The Immortals.\" In a summary judgement for the defendants, Judge R. Gary Klausner stated \"The basic premises of \"The Matrix Trilogy\" and \"The Immortals\" are so different that it would be unreasonable to find their plots substantially similar.\"\n\nBy November 2003, \"The Matrix\" franchise had generated from VHS and DVD sales, from the video game \"Enter the Matrix\" (2003), from \"\" soundtrack sales, and from licensed merchandise sales. As of 2011, the franchise has grossed from all sources worldwide.\n\nIn acknowledgment of the strong influence of Japanese anime on the \"Matrix\" series, \"The Animatrix\" was produced in 2003 to coincide with the release of \"The Matrix Reloaded\". This is a collection of nine animated short films intended to further flesh out the concepts, history, characters and setting of the series. The objective of \"The Animatrix\" project was to give other writers and directors the opportunity to lend their voices and interpretation to the \"Matrix\" universe; the Wachowskis conceived of and oversaw the process, and they wrote four of the segments themselves, although they were given to other directors to execute. Many of the segments were produced by notable figures from the world of Japanese animation. Four of the films were originally released on the series' official website, one was shown in cinemas with \"Dreamcatcher\", one was shown on MTV, MTV2, MTV3, MTV4, and Syfi, and the others first appeared with the DVD release of all nine shorts shortly after the release of \"The Matrix Reloaded\".\n\nOn May 15, 2003, the game \"Enter the Matrix\" was released in North America concurrently with \"The Matrix Reloaded\". The first of three video games related to the films, it told a story running parallel to \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and featured scenes that were shot during the filming of \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"The Matrix Revolutions\".\n\nTwo more \"The Matrix\" video games were released in 2005. The MMORPG \"The Matrix Online\" continued the story beyond \"The Matrix Revolutions\", while \"\" allowed players to control Neo in scenes from the film trilogy.\n\nThe \"Matrix\" official website also provided several original Adobe Flash-based browser games.\n\n\"The Matrix Comics\" is a set of comic books and short stories based on the series and written and illustrated by figures from the comics industry; one of the comics was written by the Wachowskis and illustrated by the films' concept artist Geof Darrow. Most of the comics were originally presented for free on the \"Matrix\" series' website; they were later republished, along with some new material, in two printed trade paperback volumes.\n\nThe \"Matrix\" official website provided a free screensaver for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, which simulates the falling \"Matrix digital rain\" of the films. The screensaver was reported to have a password security issue. The \"Matrix digital rain\" also inspired the creation of many unofficial screensavers.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1941, Readers' League of America compiled these four books and published the \"Pocket Book of Boners\". It was one of the bestselling paperback books of World War II, with 1.34 million copies in print by 1945. At the time of its writing, the term \"boner\" was commonly used to mean a silly mistake, without any sexual connotation.\n\n\"The Pocket Book of Boners\" contains 22 illustrations of boners by Dr. Seuss. The rest of the volume consists of short jokes and humorous observations with most being no more than four lines long, and is notable for its early examples of Dr. Seuss' illustration style..\n\nThe first book was released in February 1931.

{"id": "65771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65771", "title": "Theatre technique", "text": "Theatre technique\n\nTheatre techniques are procedures that facilitate a successful presentation of a play. They also include any practices that advance and enhance the understanding the audience brings to the action and the acting by the cast\non stage.\n\nTheatre technique is part of the playwright's creative writing of drama, as a kind of mimesis rather than mere illusion or imitation of life, in that the playwright is able to present a reality to the audience that is different, yet recognisable to that which they usually identify with in their everyday lives.<br> Another aspect of this is that of creating the kind of dialogue that makes the playwright's characters come alive and allows for their development in the course of his dramatization.\n\nThe playwright's art also consists in the ability to convey to the audience the ideas that give essence to the drama within the frame of its structure. \nFinally, the feeling for the natural divisions of a play—including acts, scenes, and changes of place—its entries and exits, and the positioning of the cast are integral to playwriting technique.\n\nOne of the playwright’s functions is that concerned with adaptations of existing traditional drama, such as Charles Marowitz’s collages of \"Hamlet\" and \"Macbeth\" and other re-interpretations of Shakespeare's works, as well as Tom Stoppard’s approaches in \"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead\", \"Dogg's Hamlet\", and \"Cahoot's Macbeth\".\n\nThe director these days is responsible for the actual production of a play, as opposed to earlier days when it was the producer who, at least in Britain until the 1950s, had this task. In earlier centuries it was the author, an actor-manager, or a leading actor with whom the responsibilities of staging a drama were invested.\n\nThe director produces the play in the way he envisages how it ought to be seen as he interprets what the playwright intended within the drama; he takes care of the effectiveness of the rehearsals of the actors; and coordinates the work of designers and technicians in the production. \nHowever, the playwright’s work is still reflected in the director’s prompt copy, a separate form of stage instructions worked out in detail by the director, in which each actor is given details as to what is happening onstage, where exactly he has to be in relation to the back, front, left, or right of the stage, and what he is to do at any one time during the play.\n\nThe stage manager has to work with the director, and ascertain whether both the director’s objectives and the perceptions of the stage designers are compatible and realistic. They are usually the link between the director and the rest of the company, and are responsible for the director’s visions being passed down to each actor and member of the running crew. They are also responsible for safety and running an orderly backstage area. They maintain the prompt book and the call board, to which rehearsal schedule notes are affixed for the cast.\n\nStagecraft overall has to address the various shortcomings of the stage’s spatial and physical limitations. For example, the stage alone cannot be expected to provide wide and distant vistas, or vast spaces where armies gather or huge masses of people congregate. Natural phenomena such as thunderstorms or winds, that are often part of the drama, cannot be recreated in their original form. Furthermore, because of the distance involved, it is difficult for actors to portray the feelings, tensions and passions of their characters to the audience with much distinctiveness.\n\nIt is for these reasons that special technologies and techniques have been developed from classical times onward to supplement and augment the effects that are to be realised. Technical specialists help to implement these techniques by providing expertise in various areas of the production. The stage manager and their team must ultimately draw all these separate techniques together to create an effective and successful stage production.\n\n\nThe \"Classical unities\" of time, action and place were the main principles of French neo-classical drama during part of the 17th century.<br>They were introduced by Jean Mairet after a misreading of Aristotle's \"Poetics\", and the critic Castelvetro insisted that playwrights and directors adhere to the unities. In the \"Poetics\" Aristotle had merely recommended that action should consist only of the main plot without any subplots, and that the time represented by action should not stretch beyond the length of one day. Time merely entered into his recommendations as a hint as to the limits of the attention span the audience could be expected to have. The unity of place, that of the confinement of the action in a play to one locality only, was not mentioned at all.<br>The effect of the three unities on French drama during this period was that their presentation became very restrictive, and it was only when later dramatists began to avoid mentioning specific times and places that the presentation of plays became more creative again.\n\nSome dramatists and dramaturgists try to achieve particular effects that are not normally sought in a theatre presentation.\n\nBertolt Brecht coined the term \"defamiliarization effect\" (sometimes called \"estrangement effect\" or \"alienation effect\"; German \"Verfremdungseffekt\") for an approach to theater that focused on the central ideas and decisions in the play, and discouraged involving the audience in an illusory world and in the emotions of the characters. Brecht thought the audience required an emotional distance to reflect on what is being presented. See epic theater.\n\nOne of the oldest techniques that has been used often, is that of \"teichoscopy\" or the \"viewing from the wall\", in which actors observe events beyond the confines of the stage, such as a distant battle, and discuss it on stage while the battle is taking place, as opposed to the event being reported by messengers at a later time after the event has happened. Shakespeare uses this technique in the final scenes of the play Julius Ceasre\"Julius Caesar\".\n\n"}

The newest software technologies for mobile devices, which came out as an alternative to subtitling in cinemas, or the possibilities opened up by head-mounted displays, such as subtitle glasses, have made a revision of the technical terminology necessary also in the field of those performing arts that are reproducible on electronic devices.\nEven more so, in the live performing arts, the presence of multilingual options on custom individual devices (Santa Fe Opera, 1998) or on mobile consumer devices (Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, 2011) or on hybrid solutions (Royal Opera House Muscat, 2012), makes the spatial connotation of the term \"sur-titles\" inappropriate.\n\nIn both cases (performing arts that are reproducible on electronic devices and live performing arts), for a scientific approach the term \"titling\", broader and all-embracing, is preferable to define the work of linguistic mediation, without specifying whether the visualization is to be above (sur-titles) or below (sub-titles).\n\n"}
{"id": "1225116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1225116", "title": "Toastmaster", "text": "Toastmaster\n\nToastmaster is a general term, prevalent in the United States in the middle 20th century, referring to a person in charge of the proceedings of a public speaking event. The toastmaster is typically charged with organization of the event, arranging the order of speakers, introducing one or more of the speakers, and keeping the event on schedule. Such meetings typically include civic events, service organization meetings, and banquets of various purpose. In many meetings, a toastmaster typically addresses the audience from behind a dais or from a podium. At stage entertainment events, especially ones broadcast on live television, the toastmaster often takes the form of a master of ceremonies, introducing the entertainment acts. \n\nJames Toole, father of actor John Lawrence Toole was possibly the first professional Toastmaster during the 1840's in London. There are many allusions to him in the press of the day. His obituary noted his \"stentorian voice, and the ability with which he kept very large companies in order\"\n\nWilliam Kingsmith was the first to wear the red coat now associated with London society of Toastmasters, as he wanted to be distinguished from waitstaff and footmen. He was the public announcer at the 1908 London Olympic games, and presided over court functions at St. James's Palace, ceremonies at the House of Commons and Royal Albert Hall,\n\nA widely known person associated with this role was George Jessel, known in his lifetime as \"Toastmaster General of the United States\" (parodying the title Postmaster General of the United States).\n\nIn many service organizations and businesses, the role of toastmaster was a permanently assigned role, but often rotating among members. Toastmasters were largely expected to keep the event from becoming boring, and a cottage industry arose in the middle century to cater to the desire of businessmen and other leaders to overcome the fear of public speaking. Would-be toastmasters were typically counseled to use light humor, and to have anecdotes and epigrams handily memorized. Toastmasters International is an organization dedicated to helping people in public speaking and in fulfilling the role of toastmaster.\n\nSuch was the importance of a toastmaster remaining sober in order to conduct events, he may have had a special cup, called the toastmaster's glass which, although of the same size and shape as others at the event, in fact was of much lower capacity due to an almost solid interior. Several such glasses are now displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5073563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5073563", "title": "Universal Classic Monsters", "text": "Universal Classic Monsters\n\nUniversal Classic Monsters is a phrase used to describe the horror, fantasy, suspense and science fiction films made by Universal Pictures during the decades of the 1920s through the 1950s. They began with \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" and \"The Phantom of the Opera\", both silent films starring Lon Chaney. Universal continued with talkies including monster franchises \"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"The Mummy\", \"The Invisible Man\", \"The Wolf Man\" and \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\". The films often featured Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr.\n\nIn 1923, Universal produced the drama \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", starring Lon Chaney as Quasimodo. The production sets were built to evoke 15th-century Paris, including a re-creation of the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral.\n\nChaney stars as The Phantom in 1925's horror film, \"The Phantom of the Opera\", based on the mystery novel by Gaston Leroux. The interior of the Opéra Garnier was recreated to scale and was used again in the 1943 remake with Claude Rains.\n\nIn 1931, Bela Lugosi starred in Universal's \"Dracula\" and Boris Karloff in \"Frankenstein\". Actors Dwight Frye and Edward Van Sloan, who played major supporting roles in both films, made several film appearances in this decade. Make-up artist Jack Pierce created several monsters' make-up starting in the 1930s.\n\n\"The Mummy\", starring Karloff, was produced in 1932. This was followed by a trilogy of films based on the tales of Edgar Allan Poe: \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1932) starring Lugosi, \"The Black Cat\" (1934), and \"The Raven\" (1935), the latter two of which teamed Lugosi with Karloff. Universal began releasing sequels including \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935), \"Dracula's Daughter\" (1936) and sequels for \"The Invisible Man\" (1933). The first mainstream werewolf picture, \"Werewolf of London\" (1935) starring Henry Hull, was not a box office triumph despite being revered by audiences today.\n\nThe end of Universal’s first run of horror films came in 1936. The monster movies were dropped from the production schedule altogether and would not re-emerge for another three years. In the meantime, a theatre owner revived \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\" as a resoundingly successful double feature, prompting the studio to re-release the original movies. \"Son of Frankenstein\" (1939), starring Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff, and Bela Lugosi, was filmed as a result of the unexpected resurgence.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Universal released \"The Wolf Man\" (1941), with Lon Chaney Jr. The junior Chaney became the studio's leading monster movie actor in the 1940s, just as his father had been two decades earlier, supplanting the 1930s' Karloff and Lugosi by a wide margin in terms of the number of leading roles that he played. Chaney Jr. physically resembled his father apart from usually being somewhat overweight, which the senior Chaney never was. The studio dropped the \"Jr.\" from the junior Chaney's billing almost immediately to confuse some in the audiences into assuming that this was the same actor.\n\nIn 1943, the studio created a remake of \"Phantom of the Opera\", this time starring Nelson Eddy and Susanna Foster with Claude Rains as the Phantom.\n\nThe \"Frankenstein\" and \"Wolf Man\" series continued with \"The Ghost of Frankenstein\" (1942), in which Chaney Jr. played Frankenstein's monster and Lugosi reprised his role as Ygor, and \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\" (1943) with Lugosi as the Frankenstein monster and Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man. \"Son of Dracula\" (1943) featured Chaney Jr. in Lugosi's original role as the Count. The \"Mummy\" series was also continued with \"The Mummy's Hand\" (1940), \"The Mummy's Tomb\" (1942), \"The Mummy's Ghost\" and \"The Mummy's Curse\" (both 1944) with Chaney Jr. as the Mummy in the last three films. \"House of Frankenstein\" (1944) and \"House of Dracula\" (1945) featured many of the monsters from the studio's previous films. As the decade drew to a close, the comedy \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\" (1948) features Lugosi in only his second film as Count Dracula, alongside Chaney Jr. as Larry Talbot (the Wolf Man), and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's monster.\n\nAbbott and Costello appeared in films featuring characters such as the Mummy and the Invisible Man.\n\n\"Creature from the Black Lagoon\", directed by Jack Arnold, was released in 1954. \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\" were re-released as double features in theatres, and were later broadcast in syndication on American television in 1957 as part of the \"Shock Theater\" package of Universal Monster Movies. Magazines such as \"Famous Monsters of Filmland\" covered the monster films. Universal spent the last half of the decade issuing a number of one-shot monster films.\n\nDark Universe is the term given by Universal Pictures to their planned cinematic universe, which will be based on the classic Universal Monsters film series. The studio's first attempt at this universe was with the film \"Dracula Untold\". Released on October 10, 2014, with Luke Evans in the titular role, the film was developed prior to plans for a shared universe of horror films. However, it was retooled to be a part of the franchise. The film's mixed financial and critical reception resulted in the film's future status within the franchise becoming uncertain. Since the release of \"Dracula Untold\", the connections to the shared universe have been downplayed. Universal, which had announced plans to reboot \"The Mummy\" franchise in 2012, decided to re-position the new installment as the first film in the series. \"The Mummy\" was set to be released in 2017 with Alex Kurtzman as director. Also, Kurtzman and Chris Morgan were announced as headlining the Dark Universe, with collaborations from David Koepp and Christopher McQuarrie.\n\nAlong with the crew, Universal announced the casting of Russell Crowe as Dr. Henry Jekyll / Mr. Edward Hyde, Javier Bardem as the Frankenstein Monster, and Johnny Depp as The Invisible Man. They would join Tom Cruise and Sofia Boutella, as Nick Morton and Princess Ahmanet / The Mummy. Bill Condon was announced as the director of the franchise's \"Bride of Frankenstein\", originally set to be released on February 14, 2019. Even though various sources claimed that Evans' character might have at least a cameo in \"The Mummy\" or any of the upcoming films in the universe, Kurtzman denied these claims, stating that he considered the film to not be a part of the \"Dark Universe\". Additional rebooted versions of their characters were announced to have films in development as well including: the Wolf Man, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, the Phantom of the Opera, and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. The shared film universe's official theme music was composed by Danny Elfman.\n\nOn June 9, 2017, \"The Mummy\" was released. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, and performed below the studio's expectations at the box office. By November, \"The Bride of Frankenstein\" was pulled from its initial release, and lead producers/co-architects of the Dark Universe, Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan, left Universal and departed from the franchise. Universal has put a hold on future projects while they create a plan for future releases. Universal Pictures released an official statement reading:\nBy January 2018, development on the film progressed with Condon hiring a production team consisting of cinematographer Tobias A. Schliessler, production designer Sarah Greenwood, composer Carter Burwell, and costume designer Jacqueline Durran. In May of the same year, artist Robert Vargas announced from his social media account that he had attended a meeting with the studio and will collaborate on the Dark Universe films moving forward. Successful horror film producer Jason Blum has publicly expressed his interest in working on the Dark Universe franchise.\n\nAnimation\n\n"}

It could help bridge the digital divide by bringing the benefits of the information revolution to the billions of underserved people by providing information and services through a voice driven channel over an ordinary phone call. Information on this web could be community created as well as leveraged from World Wide Web. It is essentially a voice driven eco-system parallel and complementary to that of the existing Web. Though primarily meant for the under-served in population in emerging economies, it has several applications for the developed world as well.\n\nWWTW can be accessible to more number of people in the world as it enables an ordinary phone subscriber to join the digital information revolution. This enables a significantly larger fraction of the human population to benefit from existing and envisioned services than what was made possible by WWW. Specifically, it removes accessibility barriers that manifest themselves in terms of illiteracy, unaffordability and lack of relevant information. Further, it provides the means to create and sustain an ecosystem of local (and global) services, information and communities relevant to these underprivileged users.\n\nWWTW is a network of interconnected VoiceSites (analogous to web sites) that are voice driven applications \"created by\" users themselves and \"hosted\" in the telecom network. VoiceSites can be interconnected using 'VoiLinks' (analogous to hyperlinks) which are links between two voice applications within the web. VoiLinks can span across different enterprises enabling cross-organizational workflows driven by a voice interface over an ordinary phone.\n\nKey enabler technologies include:\n\n1. VoiGen - VoiceSite Creator\n\n2. VoiHost - VoiceSite Hosting Engine\n\n3. HSTP - Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol\n\n4. WWTW Browser - World Wide Telecom Web Browser\n\nWorld Wide Telecom Web was conceived by Arun Kumar at IBM India Research Lab during late 2004 and was later joined by fellow researcher Nitendra Rajput in mid-2005. Originally, WWTW was primarily viewed as a novel application of speech technology and VoiceXML standard even though use of VoiceSites for under-privileged was one of the listed benefits. During the course of a year, they refined the vision and built a couple of primitive prototypes of VoiceSite generator application christened VoiGen, with the help of fellow researcher Dipanjan Chakraborty and colleague Sandeep Jindal & Rajiv Goyal. In late 2006, inspired by Prof. C.K. Prahalad and led by Ponani Gopalakrishnan (then the director of IBM India Research Lab), Arun and Nitendra along with Dipanjan and Amit Anil Nanavati got funded for an Exploratory Research project to develop technologies for people towards the Base of the Pyramid. Here, WWTW shot into prominence and got recognized as the most compelling ecosystem for illiterate, low earning population of developing countries such as India. The team reported the work done so far in a Research Report. Soon after Sheetal K. Agarwal joined the team. Together this team designed and built the initial technological building blocks of Telecom Web details of which can be found in publications available at World Wide Telecom Web Publications.\nThis included creation of technology for enabling voice driven workflows spanning across organizational boundaries. Arun proposed the use of out-of-band-signaling mechanism, followed in telecom networks to achieve this. The resulting Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol (HSTP) got designed and created by the team as an HTTP equivalent protocol that enables voice hyperlinks in VoiceSites. The team designed and built the first prototype of this protocol in mid-2007 and reported it in Hypertext Conference in September 2007. The first successful field trial of VoiceSites as a powerful platform for underprivileged population came in the form of Voikiosk system conceived primarily by Nitendra. It is a village portal providing locally relevant content in local language and is available over an ordinary telephone call.\n\n\n\n"}
