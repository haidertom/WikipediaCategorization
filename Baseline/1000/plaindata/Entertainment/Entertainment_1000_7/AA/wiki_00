The games were formally opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. She referred to the Commonwealth's \"shared ideals and ambitions\" and the \"bonds that unite\" its members.\n\nThe programme, which included about 2,000 performers, featured Karen Dunbar, John Barrowman, Amy Macdonald, Rod Stewart, Susan Boyle, Nicola Benedetti, Julie Fowlis, Pumeza Matshikiza, Eric Whitacre and the National Youth Choir of Scotland, as well as a message from the International Space Station. The ceremony began with a countdown and a recorded video message from Scottish actor Ewan McGregor, explaining the partnership between the Games and UNICEF.\n\nFollowing the arrival of the Queen there was a flypast by the Red Arrows display team. The venue featured the largest LED video screen in Europe, supplied by Sports Technology. Scotland's then First Minister Alex Salmond welcomed the participants and spectators, and introduced a moment of silence in memory of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 disaster.\n\nThe final part of the Queen's Baton Relay was run by 32 Scottish volunteers nominated for giving their time to developing the nation's youth through sport. The baton was then passed to Sir Chris Hoy, who delivered it to President of the Commonwealth Games Federation HRH Prince Imran and the Queen. The display of the message concealed within the baton was delayed by a difficulty in opening the device.\n\nThe Games were launched in partnership with UNICEF, to save and change children’s lives. The unique partnership aimed \"to use the power of sport to reach every child in Scotland and benefit children in every Commonwealth nation and territory.\"\n\nThe ceremony was broadcast by BBC One, and was introduced by Gary Lineker, Hazel Irvine, Clare Balding and Huw Edwards. The estimated worldwide television audience was one billion, with 9 million in the UK.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3329308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3329308", "title": "Applied Drama", "text": "Applied Drama\n\nApplied Drama, also known as Applied Theatre, Interactive Theatre or Applied Drama and Theatre (ADT) is an umbrella term for the use of drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context. It is often done in non-theatrical spaces, with participants who do not consider themselves to be artists.\n\nThere are several forms and practices considered to be under the umbrella of Applied Drama. In all these fields approaches and methods of Applied Improvisation are used. \n\nApplied Drama is a term that has been contested, gaining popularity towards the end of the 20th century to describe drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.\n\nJames Thompson states that \"Applied theatre is a participatory theatre created by people who would not usually make theatre. It is, I would hope, a practice by, with and for the excluded and marginalised.\" \n\nJudith Ackyroyd confirms the inclusion of both of these elements in ADT: \"I have identified two features which I believe to be central to our understanding of applied theatre; an intention to generate change (of awareness, attitude, behaviour, etc), and the participation of the audience.\"\n\nApplied drama can be either scripted or unscripted. Some practitioners focus primarily on improvisation, whereas others introduce a range of artistic practices, such as developing scripted plays, devised performances, or indigenous forms of cultural performance, sometimes combined with new forms of digital communication.\n\nPlayback Theatre involves audience or group members telling stories from their lives and viewing them as enacted by actors improvising. It can also be used in conjunction with Narrative Therapy.\n\nDrama in healthcare is drama created in medical contexts, often with the intention of rehabilitation.\n\nThis form of Applied Drama focuses on using theatre to educate, engage, and stimulate healing in medical professionals, patients, and the general public. Theatre and drama in healthcare are tilted towards conscientizing the populace about their health and improving their health and longevity irrespective of status or social stratification. This form of drama is often used to educate people on important health issues such as healthy eating, grief and loss, exercise, and sexual assault prevention. Examples include using actors to role-play health ailments in order to train healthcare professionals, performing plays focused on primary prevention, and facilitating drama workshops for patients.\n\nDrama therapy is the use of Applied Drama techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote mental health.\n\nDrama therapy is rooted in a clinical practice, facilitated by licensed clinicians, that stimulates language, cognitive development and builds resilience.\n\nTheatre for Development uses Applied Drama techniques to facilitate development in less developed countries.\n\nDrama in Education can allow students to develop an understanding of themselves and others. Kathleen Galllagher has argued that 'What is clear is that there is no correct pedagogical model on offer for drama education. [...] In theatre pedagogy, we not only endow experience with meaning, but we are - as players - invited to make manifest our own subjectivities in the world evoked through character and play, a world laden with metaphor and nuance, a world where relationship to other and self-spectatorship are in dynamic and unrelenting interaction.'\n\nTheatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in the mid-1960s. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cite TIE as \"one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice.\" TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.\n\nPractitioner Lynn Hoare defines TIE as a combination of \"theatrical elements with interactive moments in which audience participants (in or out of role) work with actor-teachers towards an educational or social goal, using the tools of theatre in service of this goal.\"\n\nScholar Helen Nicholson notes that this work \"involves professional theatre-makers working with young people in all kinds of educational settings and learning environments, including schools, hospitals, theaters, museums and heritage sites.\"\n\nTIE seeks to educate young people in issues that are relevant to both them and their communities, for example: bullying, dating violence, environmental preservation, and peer conflict resolution. \"TIE companies have always been among the most socially conscious of theatre groups, consistently choosing to examine issues they believe to be of direct relevance to the lives of the children with whom they work.\"\n\n\"Theatre for Dialogue\" (TFD) is a more recent term describing a model that was created specifically for the University of Texas at Austin campus community which pulls methods and theory from a variety of applied theatre practices such as TO and TIE. In her thesis, Spring Snyder explains that \"Theatre For Dialogue performances explore the intersection between theatre and education as a way to investigate, reflect, provoke dialogue and serve as a rehearsal for reality without asking participants to share their own personal experiences. Although some of the Theatre For Dialogue’s roots originate from an adapted form of Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed’s forum structure, it is Theatre in Education (TIE) that more closely aligns with TFD.\"\n\nIn prison theatre, practitioners engage offenders in correctional facilities, jails, prisons, and detention centers in exploring drama work often with the objective of education or rehabilitation.\n\nExamples include Wabash Valley Correctional Facility’s \"Shakespeare in Shackles\" where maximum security prisoners learn about and perform Shakespeare. The University of Texas’ Center for Women and Gender Studies’ Performing Justice Project works with incarcerated female youth to learn about gender and racial justice while devising a play based on the youth’s unique experiences.\n\nThe Theatre of the Oppressed (TO) describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal first developed in the 1960s, initially in Brazil and later in Europe. Boal's techniques aim to use theatre as means of promoting social and political change through allowing the audience to take an active role in the creation of the show. Theatre of the Oppressed can include aspects of Forum Theatre, Invisible Theatre, Legislative Theatre and Image Theatre.\n\nMuseum theatre aims to use theatrical techniques to add emotion and value to the museum experience. It is typically more common in cultural institutions like heritage sites, history museums, and science and industry museums. As with the other forms of applied drama, it can involve a variety of theatrical techniques.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "881842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=881842", "title": "Aristeia", "text": "Aristeia\n\nAn aristeia or aristia (; , \"excellence\") is a scene in the dramatic conventions of epic poetry as in the \"Iliad\", where a hero in battle has his finest moments (\"aristos\" = \"best\"). An aristeia can result in the death of the hero at the aristeia's end.\n\nOne of the most prototypical examples of \"aristeia\" is in \"Book 21\" of the Iliad when Achilles almost single-handedly routs the Trojan army. This includes his chase of Hector around Troy; Achilles eventually succeeds in killing him and dragging his corpse around the city. Other instances of this phenomenon in the \"Iliad\" are found in Diomedes' performance in battle while empowered by Athena (\"Book V\"), Hector's leading of the Trojan assault on the Achaian camp in \"Book VIII\" (with the help of Zeus), Agamemnon's aristeia in Book XI where he's on such a rampage that Zeus himself has to warn Hector against meeting him in battle, as well as Patroclus' aristeia in \"Book XVI\", which ultimately leads to his demise at the hands of Hector. In \"Book XXII\" of the Odyssey, Greek hero Odysseus slaughters all of the suitors in his palace in another homeric display of martial excellence.\nIt is also seen, to some extent, in the Aeneid, when Nisus and Euryalus leave the Trojan defenses to slaughter the Latin captains while they sleep. It also features in \"Book X\", when Mezentius takes the place of Turnus and strikes down all in his path: it draws upon homeric models, using a simile.\n\nArete (excellence)\n\n"}

{"id": "18400732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18400732", "title": "Authoritarian literature", "text": "Authoritarian literature\n\nAuthoritarian literature is a term used by John Gardner to designate the body of literature written by persons living under an authoritarian governmental regime. Literary works produced in these regimes share common characteristics that make the designation useful. Authoritarian regimes revere their leaders, who historically were typically referred to as kings, along with advisors to the king. These leaders were considered innately better than ordinary people. The authoritarian leader, and his approved circle, if not directly writing about a subject themselves, were the only ones who could designate, approve, and sanction writers as acceptable authorities. Government authorities also financially supported writers under a patronage system. The writers in such a system therefore must necessarily be careful to ensure the composition of their work met (or would meet) the approval of authorities. Failure to comply risked official warnings, loss of governmental sanction, and sometimes even imprisonment or loss of life.\n\nFiction produced under authoritarian regimes tends to be didactic. Subject matter can vary in terms of plot, but the didactic point of the work is almost always to illustrate what authorities would consider the proper comportment of individuals within the authoritarian society. This didactic point is conveyed to readers in order to idealize the existing social structure and thus, hopefully, perpetuate it. Authoritarian fiction is considered to be demonstrative in purpose rather than explorative. The author's narrative voice is also usually authoritarian in order to impart something known by the author that is presumably not known by the reader. Since most people don't enjoy and resist being spoken to as an inferior, the more successful (or popular) authors of such literature are the ones who best disguise, or sugarcoat, their didactic purpose. One common way to achieve such indirectness is through the use of the form allegory.\n\nGood examples of authoritarian literature include \"Beowulf\", \"Pilgrim's Progress\", and in English literature we see vestiges as late as Charles Dickens. While didacticism forms a significant component of Shaw's, Orwell's and C. S. Lewis' fiction as well, their works can not strictly be considered as authoritarian literature because they were not writing at the whim of political leaders. Dickens was not writing for the British government either, but he used the same forms of his predecessors, who did write for the court, particularly in his earlier novels, such as \"A Tale of Two Cities\" and \"David Copperfield\", where we most easily observe a certain preachiness. Dickens constructed his plots for the sake of demonstration rather than the purpose of exploration. However, Charles Dickens is a transitional figure, and in his later novels, such as \"Great Expectations\", we can \"feel the two impulses warring in the writer's mind\".\n\nAuthoritarian literature is, of course, not a purely historical phenomenon. It persists as the dominant form of everyday literature of Middle Eastern countries (Turkey, Israel, Lebanon, and arguably Palestine and Iran's literature excepted), and, until recently, Chinese literature. To understand the nature of authoritarian literature's purpose is to better understand the reason for the forms in which we see literature currently being produced in these countries.\n\nThe antithesis to Authoritarian literature is Anti-Authoritarian literature. Practitioners of this genre in the aforementioned countries are routinely subjected to harsh sanctions, and many choose to go into exile in order to write freely. Still other writers suffer censorship and imprisonment at their government's hands (e.g. Sunallah Ibrahim and Abdul Rahman Munif). Authoritarian literature authors, however, who write works of fiction that support or praise governments, as expected, often see promotion to positions of authority within their respective country's governing cultural body\n"}

It opened in 2005 with one hundred names, and was a temporary installation to accompany a TV show to celebrate ITV's 50th birthday. The Avenue of Stars was a walkway through Covent Garden passing St Paul's Church, commonly known as the \"Actors' Church\". It honoured individuals or groups from the entertainment industry with notable achievements. As on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the individual or group was represented by a five-pointed star containing the name set into the walkway. To qualify for a star, the individual or group had to have been from the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, or a Commonwealth nation.\n\nThe first inductee onto the Avenue of Stars was Jimmy Page, guitarist with Led Zeppelin. In 2006, all of the stars were removed, and only the old flagstones are visible in the courtyard.

The lead character, Avery Ryan, was inspired by cyber-psychologist Mary Aiken who was attached to the series as a producer. The final active series, \"CSI: Cyber\", was canceled on May 12, 2016.\n\nA total of 797 episodes of the \"CSI\" franchise have aired.\n\nThe CSI franchise is available in 200 territories with an audience of two billion people. Various spin-offs have been developed to cater for the market including novels, comic books, and computer games.\n\nThe franchise has had a large cultural impact. It has spawned what has been called the \"\"CSI\" effect,\" in which juries often have unreasonable expectations of real-life forensics because of what they have seen on \"CSI\". Equally, the new-found popularity of forensics dramas on television has led to an increase in applications for courses dealing with forensic science or archaeological science—in the United Kingdom applications are up by 30%. The franchise is so influential that fellow CBS show \"How I Met Your Mother\" advertised itself as \"not a Crime Scene Investigation show\". In some ways the franchise may also fill a cultural need:\n\nHowever, the \"\"CSI\" effect\" also has a negative side, as criminals are frequently covering up evidence that could be used to trace them using techniques learned by watching CSI and other shows in the same genre.\n\n\"CSI:Miami\" and \"CSI:Cyber\" spun off from \"CSI\", and \"CSI:NY\" spun off from \"CSI:Miami\", all via backdoor-pilot episodes.\n\nMethods<br>\nThe Las Vegas team are scientists foremost and follow the evidence.\n\nCrimes<br>\nThe crimes the Las Vegas CSI team face (other than the standard murders, attempted murders, kidnappings, and rapes) include casino robberies, bodies buried in the Nevada desert, and murders during different conventions at casinos.\n\nCrime lab<br>\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Crime Lab is a modern crime lab and shares a lot (but not a building) with the Las Vegas Police Department. It reports to the sheriff's office. In early episodes of season one the lab is frequently referred to as the number-two crime lab in the United States, solving cases believed unsolvable. The lab consists of specialist laboratories, a Supervisor's office, an Assistant Supervisor's office, a locker room, a break-room, and stairs leading to a second floor, believed to house the offices of the Day-shift and Swing-shift supervisors. \n\n\nMethods<br>\nThe Miami team are detectives foremost and mainly use theories to solve crimes.\n\nCrimes<br>\nThe crimes the Miami CSI team face (other than the standard murders, attempted murders, kidnappings, and rapes) include drug running, murdered refugees from Cuba, bodies found washed up on the beach and dumped in the everglades, and crimes involving the rich and famous who have secrets to hide in their mansions and beach front properties.\n\nCrime lab<br>\nFirst stationed out of a broom-closet next to the MDPD's bull-pen in the backdoor pilot, the Miami CSI's were eventually given their own building prior to the start of the first season. Originally dark and technical the building housed Horatio's office, Megan's office, specialist labs, and a locker room. During the fourth season a government grant meant that slanted glass walls, multiple modern labs, an interrogation room, and a new locker room were all constructed. Horatio's office has not been seen since the lab's reconstruction although a state-of-the-art ballistics suite was added, acting as Calleigh's office. The lab has reinforced windows and shutters to protect against hurricanes and tsunamis. \n\n\nMethods<br>\nThe New York team are equally scientists and detectives and frequently use criminal profiling (as well as evidence and theories) to solve cases.\n\nCrimes<br>\nThe crimes the New York CSI team face (other than the standard murders, attempted murders, kidnappings, and rapes) include organised crime activity involving the Italian Mafia, street-gang violence, and ethnic, cultural, and ability differences.\n\nCrime lab<br>\nDuring the first season the NYPD CSI lab was in an old underground building with rustic brick walls. The lab housed Mac's office, a locker room, the autopsy suite, and specialist forensic laboratories. As of the second season the lab is on the 35th floor of a high-rise building in Manhattan. Equipped with glass walls and state-of-the-art equipment this lab consists of Mac's office, specialist laboratories, an observation walkway, a break-room and kitchen, a locker room, an office belonging to the Assistant Supervisor and Lindsay, and an office belonging to Danny and Hawkes.

The CTOC consists of Ryan's office, Russell's office, a communications bullpen housing the desks of Krumitz, Nelson, and Ramirez, a cyber lab, a glass walkway, and a 'tear-down room'. Due to their nomadic nature the team are often seen interviewing suspects at various FBI field offices and police departments.\n\n— Next Generation Cyber Forensics Division<br>The Next Generation Cyber Forensics Division is a lab-based facility within the Cyber Crime Division used for the processing of evidence in cyber-related cases. \n\nThe opening themes for all four series are remixes of songs performed by The Who.\nCrossovers are possible between \"CSI\" series as well as with other programs within the same creative stable. Between the series the baton is passed to the new \"CSI\" series via a crossover/pilot where cases are overlapped and personnel are shared. Many actors have appeared in two of the series. Four actors have appeared in three: David Caruso, Laurence Fishburne, and Gary Sinise all appeared in \"CSI\", \"CSI: Miami\", and \"CSI: NY\", while Ted Danson appeared as a guest star on \"CSI: NY\" and a series regular on both \"CSI\" and \"CSI: Cyber\", making him the first actor to be a main character in more than one \"CSI\" series. Crossovers have also, on occasion, taken place between a \"CSI\" series and a series outside the franchise.\n\nIn the UK, Channel 5 edited together related episodes to make one whole feature.

They were available in the UK and US.\n\nA range of toys have been developed. These include:\nHowever, they have been the source of some controversy. The Parents Television Council, who have complained about \"CSI\" in general, in 2004 released a statement specifically aimed at the toys. The PTC e-mailed letters to their supporters, telling them the content of the games were entirely inappropriate for children to be exposed to \"because the \"CSI\" franchise often displays graphic images, including close-ups of corpses with gunshot wounds and other bloody injuries.\" The letter went on to say \"The PTC doesn't think the recreation of blood, guts and gore should be under a child's Christmas tree this year,\" PTC concluded. \"This so-called 'toy' is a blatant attempt to market \"CSI\" and its adult-oriented content directly to children.\"\n\nIn urging members to file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, PTC said CBS parent company Viacom needed to hear from parents who are concerned about the \"graphic scenes of blood, violence, and sex\" in their product. They also asked their supporters to contact Target and Toys \"R\" Us.\n\nProducers announced intentions to break the Guinness World Record for largest ever TV simulcast drama on March 4, 2015, with the episode \"\" airing in 150 countries in addition to digital streaming. They succeeded in breaking the record by airing \"CSI: Cyber\"s backdoor pilot in 171 countries.\n\nBecause of the popularity of the \"CSI\" franchise in the United Kingdom, Channel 5 created two documentaries about CSI. The first one called \"The Real CSI\" follows real crime scene investigators as they work on crime scene. The second documentary, \"True CSI\", features true tales of how forensic science has helped solve some of the world's best known crimes. \"True CSI\" had actors re-enacting the crime as well as interviews with people involved in the solving of the crimes themselves. Cases featured included the Sam Sheppard case.\n\nIn early 2007, British channel ITV1 broadcast a special of its flagship documentary \"Tonight with Trevor McDonald\" discussing the ramifications of the \"\"CSI\" effect\", highlighting the effect not only of the franchise but of several other British and American TV police procedurals.\n\nThe popularity of the series has also spawned forensic based reality television/documentary programs, including A&E's \"The First 48\" and truTV's \"North Mission Road.\"\n\nIn April 2012, PBS' \"Frontline\" aired a documentary called \"The Real CSI\" investigating the limitations of the CSI techniques in forensic science.\n\n\nAs well as fictional books based on the franchise there have also been a number of guides published:\n"}

Following a lengthy trial at Southwark Crown Court, he was convicted on a single count of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception. In 2003, he was convicted of an unrelated insurance fraud, and ordered to resign his commission as a major by the Army Board.\n\nIngram is married to Diana Ingram, and has since participated in other television shows, including \"The Weakest Link\", \"Wife Swap\", \"Hell's Kitchen\", and on \"Big Brother's Big Mouth\".\nIn 1986, he trained for the Army at Sandhurst and was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Engineers. He was promoted to the rank of captain in 1990 and major in 1995, and in 1999, he served in Bosnia for six months on NATO peacekeeping duties.\nHe was forced to resign from the Army in August 2003.\n\nSince leaving the Army, Ingram has written two novels: \"The Network\", published on 27 April 2006, and \"Deep Siege\", published on 8 October 2007.\n\nOn 9 and 10 September 2001, Ingram was a contestant on the television game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\". His wife Diana Ingram and her brother Adrian Pollock had previously been contestants on the show, both winning £32,000. The show, presented by Chris Tarrant, was one of the highest-rated in the United Kingdom at its peak in 1999; one edition was watched by 19 million viewers, a third of the British population.\n\nBy the time recording ended on the first day, Ingram had reached £4,000 and used two of his three \"lifelines\". The production team doubted he would proceed much further when recording resumed, but he went on to win the top prize of £1 million. Ingram flipped between answers erratically, appearing to settle on one answer before suddenly moving to another. For example, when asked who recorded the 2000 Craig David album \"Born to Do It\", Ingram said he had \"never heard of\" David and appeared to go for a different option before moving to the correct answer.\n\nThe show's production company Celador suspended the £1 million payout after they suspected Ingram had cheated. Production staff accused Ingram and his wife of defrauding the show by having an accomplice in the audience, lecturer Tecwen Whittock, cough when Ingram read out a correct answer.\n\nTarrant, who drank champagne with the Ingrams in their dressing room, said he was convinced that Ingram was genuine when he signed the £1 million cheque: \"If I thought there was anything wrong, I certainly would not have signed it.\" When asked whether the atmosphere in the dressing room was tense after the show, Tarrant replied: \"No, not at all. They seemed as normal as people who have just won a million pounds would be in the situation.\" However, he said that on his way to the dressing room, \"I had been told there had been quite an unpleasant exchange.\" A member of the crew, Eve Winstanley, testified in court that Ingram seemed \"very unhappy\" for someone who had just won a million pounds.\n\nCelador employees produced and reviewed various compilation tapes before and after contacting the police. Celador and their editing company, Editworks, retained all the tapes during the case and reproduced all tapes for the court.\n\nIn court, Paul Smith of Celador Productions confirmed that his company had previously produced a television programme involving witnesses in the case, for broadcast on ITV after the trial. The program, \"Tonight With Trevor McDonald – Major Fraud\", was broadcast on ITV a month after the trial, and credited with over 17 million viewers. Two weeks later, the day after \"Major Fraud\" aired in the US, the same channel broadcast another programme on the same topic, entitled \"The Final Answer\", which was credited with over 5 million viewers.\n\nFollowing a trial at Southwark Crown Court lasting four weeks (including jury deliberation for three-and-a-half days), which ended soon after a jury member was evicted for discussing the case in public, Charles and Diana Ingram and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of \"procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception\" on 7 April 2003. Both the Ingrams and Whittock were each given prison sentences suspended for two years (the Ingrams were sentenced to 18 months and Whittock was sentenced to 12 months), each fined £15,000, and each ordered to pay £10,000 towards prosecution costs. Within two months of the verdict and sentence, the trial judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs: Charles Ingram £40,000 and Diana Ingram £25,000. Altogether with legal fees, the Ingrams had to pay £115,000.\n\nOn 19 August 2003, the Army Board ordered Ingram to resign his commission as a major, after 17 years of service, but stated that this would not affect his pension entitlements.\n\nOn 19 May 2004, the Court of Appeal denied Ingram leave to appeal against his conviction and upheld his sentence, but agreed to quash his wife's fine and prosecution costs. On 5 October 2004, the House of Lords denied Ingram his leave to appeal against his fine and prosecution costs, and he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. On 20 October 2004, the original trial judge reduced Ingram's defence costs order to £25,000 and Diana Ingram's defence costs order to £5,000.\n\nIn 2006, journalist Jon Ronson, who covered the case at the time for the \"Guardian\", wrote that he believed the Ingrams might be innocent. Ronson had observed that when the word \"cough\" was mentioned during the trial, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. James Plaskett, who had won £250,000 on \"Millionaire\" and had been in the audience three times, argued that this was an example of coughs being caused by unconscious triggers; Tecwen had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Plaskett argued that Tecwen had audibly said \"no\" in response to an incorrect option in the same way that many audience members whisper \"no\" to each other.\n\nA book covering the case, \"Bad Show: The Quiz, The Cough, The Millionaire Major\" by Bob Woffinden and James Plaskett was published in January 2015.\n\nCharles Ingram's fine and court costs, totalling £25,000, were later reduced to £5,000 on appeal.\n\n\"Quiz\", a play written by James Graham that re-examines the events and subsequent conviction of the Ingrams and Whittock, opened at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester, on 3 November 2017, running until 9 December 2017. The play transferred to the West End—playing at the Noël Coward Theatre from 31 March 2018 to 16 June 2018.\n\nIn court, Ingram claimed the video tape was \"unrepresentative of what I heard\", and he continues to assert that it was \"unfairly manipulated\". A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and for the \"benefit of the jury\" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither \"listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing\". The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time after the correct answer had been spoken. Chris Tarrant also denied hearing any coughing in court, claiming he was too busy to notice.\n\nLarry Whitehurst, another contestant who has appeared on the show as a Fastest Finger First contestant on four occasions, was adamant that he had known the answers to Ingram's questions. He told the court that he had been able to detect a pattern of coughing, and that he was entirely convinced that coughing had helped Ingram.\n\nWhittock claims to have suffered a persistent cough for his entire life and insisted that he had a genuine cough caused by a combination of hay fever and a dust allergy, and that it was only coincidence that his throat problem coincided with the right answer. During the trial, however, the jury heard evidence that once Whittock himself earned the right to sit in the hot seat, his throat problems disappeared. Whittock later testified that he drank several glasses of water before he went in front of the cameras. Whittock also insisted that he had not known the answers to three of the questions he allegedly helped with. However, the police found the answer to question number 12, regarding the artist who painted \"The Ambassadors\", in a hand-written general knowledge book at his home.\n\nDavies, the floor manager, said that, as soon as the coughing came to his notice during the recording, he decided to find out who was responsible. \"The loudest coughing was coming from Tecwen in seat number three\", he said. \"He was talking to the person to his left when I was observing him, and then he turned towards the set and the hot seat to cough.\" Whittock remarked during the trial that \"you do not cough into someone's face\".\n\nDuring the trial, Whittock portrayed himself as a \"serial quiz show loser\" because he had been eliminated in round one of \"15 to 1\" and had only won an atlas on his appearance on \"Sale of the Century\".\n\nIn late 2003, the Ingrams were again in court, charged with further fraud offences. On 28 October, Charles Ingram was found guilty at Bournemouth Crown Court of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception, and of a second charge of deception, having attempted to claim on an insurance policy after an alleged burglary at his home. Ingram had failed to tell Direct Line Insurance about claims he had made in the three years before he took out the policy in July 2001. The court was told that Ingram had been a \"habitual claimant\" with Norwich Union after suffering \"unfortunate\" losses of private possessions.\n\nChristopher Parker, prosecuting, said Ingram switched insurers to Zurich in 1997, after Norwich Union reduced a burglary claim from £19,000 to £9,000, and in 2000 switched again to Direct Line. \"He has been ineluctably dishonest,\" Mr Parker said. \"He went to Direct Line and didn't make a disclosure about his claims history because he knew he wouldn't have been insured. It might not have started off as the most monstrous piece of villainy but these things tend to snowball and it all came to a sticky end when he claimed for £30,000.\" Staff at Direct Line were already \"suspicious\" about Ingram's £30,000 burglary claim but decided to investigate only after reading newspaper coverage about his questionable win on the game show.\n\nIngram was given a conditional discharge on the charge of fraudulently claiming £30,000 on insurance. The judge told Ingram he took into account \"the punishment you have brought upon yourself and your dire financial state\", and he rejected an alternative option of a community service order after Ingram told a probation officer he feared other criminals would bully him.\n\n"}

{"id": "14102828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14102828", "title": "Child's Play (franchise)", "text": "Child's Play (franchise)\n\nChild's Play (also called Chucky) is an American horror franchise centered on a series of seven films created by Don Mancini. The films mainly focus on Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif), a notorious serial killer known as the \"Lakeshore Strangler\" whose soul is transferred inside a Good Guy doll following a voodoo ritual in order to avoid the afterlife and possibly avoid going to Hell. The original film, \"Child’s Play\", was released on November9, 1988. The film has spawned six sequels and has gone into other media, such as comic books, a video game, tie-in merchandise, and an upcoming television show. The first, second, and fourth films were box office successes with all of the films earning over $182 million worldwide. Including revenues from sales of videos, DVDs, VOD and merchandise, the franchise has generated over $250 million. It also won a Saturn Award for Best Horror Franchise.\n\nThe film series originally started out as straight horror with the first installment \"Child’s Play\", which appears to have more psychological horror elements, while its successors are straightforward slasher films with elements of dark humor. As the films progressed, they became satirical and campy, until the series briefly became a horror comedy, with 1998's \"Bride of Chucky\" and 2004's \"Seed of Chucky\". In 2012, it was confirmed that a new film would be made under the title \"Curse of Chucky\" and be released direct-to-video. Unlike \"Bride\" and \"Seed\", \"Curse of Chucky\" is a full-fledged horror film much like the original three installments. However, it does maintain the campy humor to a small degree. Since \"Bride of Chucky\", titles have no longer been released under the \"Child's Play\" brand name and now use \"Chucky\" and will continue to do so with future films. The latest installment to the series, titled \"Cult of Chucky\", was released on October3, 2017.\n\nSeveral short films have been made featuring the Chucky character: on the DVD release of \"Seed of Chucky\", a short film entitled \"Chucky's Vacation Slides\", set during the events of the film, was included, and a series of short films inserting Chucky into the events of other horror films entitled \"Chucky Invades\" was released in the run-up to the release of \"Curse of Chucky\". On television, Chucky has appeared in commercials and also on \"Saturday Night Live\", with a separate voice actor voicing the character. Chucky appeared in a pretaped segment during an October 1998 episode of World Championship Wrestling's \"Monday Nitro\" program as a heel, taunting wrestler Rick Steiner who was a face at the time and promoting \"Bride of Chucky\".\n\n\"Child’s Play\" is the first and only in the series to be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists (until \"Seed of Chucky\" which is distributed by Rogue) before the franchise was sold by Universal Pictures. The film is directed by Tom Holland, written by Holland, John Lafia, and Don Mancini, and starring Catherine Hicks, Chris Sarandon, Alex Vincent, and Brad Dourif. The film was released on November 9, 1988. Set in 1988, a serial killer and voodoo practitioner named Charles Lee \"Chucky\" Ray is mortally wounded and transfers his soul via a voodoo ritual into a child-sized \"Good Guy\" doll. The doll is found by a homeless peddler and sold to Karen Barclay, who gives it to her son Andy as a birthday gift. As time goes on Chucky has to get his soul out of the doll before it turns human and the transfer becomes permanent, and thus has to possess the first person he told his secret to - Andy. Desperate to leave his doll body, Chucky terrorizes the Barclays in order to restore his soul.\n\n\"Child’s Play 2\" is the second film in the series and the first film distributed by Universal Pictures. The film is directed by John Lafia, written by Mancini, Vincent and Dourif reprise their roles as Andy Barclay and the voice of Chucky. The film was released on November 9, 1990. The movie takes place in 1990, two years after the events of the first film. While Andy is living in foster care, the doll's manufacturer has taken a positive corporate stance and remade it to prove there is nothing wrong with the Good Guy brand. After a freak electrical malfunction brings Chucky back to life in a new Good Guy doll, he continues to follow Andy in order to transfer his soul from his doll body before it will once again becomes his permanent form.\n\n\"Child's Play 3\", also known as \"Child’s Play 3: Look Who’s Stalking!\", is the third film in the series, and the last film to be titled as \"Child's Play\", before the title change as \"Chucky\". The film is directed by Jack Bender, written by Mancini, and had Dourif reprise once again his role as Chucky, Alex Vincent replaced as Andy Barclay by Justin Whalin as an older version of Andy and a supporting cast of Perrey Reeves and Jeremy Sylvers. The film was released on August 20, 1991. Set in 1998, eight years after the events of the second film, the Good Guy factory has re-opened after the negative publicity, and as Chucky's remains are removed, some blood from his destroyed human-doll body drips into a vat of melted plastic used to re-mould the Good Guy line. Chucky returns in a new body, going on a hunt for the now 16-year-old Andy Barclay, who has left to attend a military academy after the results of the first two films. While attempting to reach Andy, Chucky finds a new boy, Ronald Tyler, who he shares his \"secret\" with. With a new \"Good Guy\" doll body brings the possibility of possessing a new human body, Chucky attempts to restore his soul to human form through Tyler as Andy attempts to stop the killer Good Guy doll once and for all.\n\nThe film picks up a month after the events of \"Child's Play 3\". Unlike the first three films, this film focuses entirely on Chucky and Tiffany. Charles Lee Ray's former girlfriend and his accomplice, Tiffany, acquires Chucky's remains, stitches them together and via a voodoo ritual revives Charles Lee Ray, albeit in a much different form. Chucky kills Tiffany, transferring her soul into a bride doll, and the two maniacs force a young couple to bring them to Ray's grave, where Chucky plans to use a voodoo amulet to finally get a new body. In the end, the Tiffany doll gives birth to a new form of life (Glen/Glenda) as it flies out of a now dead Tiffany and attacks a detective. No one knows whether the detective is dead or alive as the screen cuts to black and closing credits roll.\n\n\"Seed of Chucky\" is the fifth installment, and the first film other than the original \"Child's Play\" not to be distributed by Universal Pictures. Chucky and Tiffany's child Glen finds his parents six years later, in 2004, and brings them back to life, but is horrified by their murders. Chucky and Tiffany force a pregnancy on actress Jennifer Tilly, which is accelerated by voodoo magic. Glen suffers a split personality disorder, having both a male and female soul in his/her body, and dismembers his father. Tiffany uses the ritual to take over Tilly's body and as Tilly bears twins, Glen's dual personality now has a body each of its own. In an epilogue set five years later, in 2009, one of Chucky's severed arms is mailed to the home of his family, where it attacks the now-human Glen.\n\n\"Curse of Chucky\" is the first direct-to-video film in the series. In 2013, Nine years after the events of the fifth film and four years after its epilogue, Chucky is delivered to the family home of Nica and Sarah Pierce, where Chucky terrorizes and kills the family one by one. Chucky is driven by revenge, as Sarah was the one who called the police on him while he was still human, leading to his original death in the first film by detective Mike Norris. Nica survives, but is institutionalized, and blamed for the murders. Chucky is collected by Tiffany, who delivers him to Alice. Chucky successfully transfers his soul into Alice's body which will be explained in Cult of Chucky, as he does the soul ritual the camera moves to reveal Alice's grandmother emerging from the basement, with a plastic bag around her head, slowly dying. Six months later, Chucky is mailed to his next victim, who just so happens to be none other than his longtime original nemesis from the original first three films, Andy Barclay, who points a shotgun at Chucky and shoots him through the head.\n\nIn 2017, Four years after \"Curse of Chucky\", Chucky returns to terrorize Nica at the mental institution where she is admitted. Chucky goes on yet another murderous rampage, killing disbelieved employees & tenants at the institution with various dramatic tricks. When a now vigilante Andy Barclay figures out Chucky's plan, he breaks into the institution in an attempt to disarm his newly created voodoo plot. But in the end, Nica ends up being possessed by Chucky, which causes her to gain the ability to walk and leaves with Tiffany.\n\nIn July 2018, \"Collider\" reported that a modern-day version of \"Child's Play\", a reboot, is in development at MGM without the involvement of Mancini or Kirschner. Lars Klevberg will direct the film, with a script from Tyler Burton Smith (of \"Polaroid\" and \"Quantum Break\" fame, respectively). David Katzenberg and Seth Grahame-Smith will serve as producers. The plot will reportedly feature a group of kids, similar to \"Stranger Things\", and a hi-tech version of the Good Guy Doll. Production will begin in September, later that year.\n\nLater, in September 2018, Gabriel Bateman, Aubrey Plaza and Brian Tyree Henry were cast as Andy Barclay, and Karen Barclay, and Detective Mike Norris, respectively.\n\nIn October 2017, Don Mancini stated that he intends in having Glen and Glenda from \"Seed of Chucky\" return in a future film, and acknowledged that most references to that character had been cut from \"Cult of Chucky\". In February 2018, it was announced that a \"Child's Play\" television series will be a continuation of the film's story arc. Mancini also stated that following the TV show, feature films will continue to be developed in the future.\n\nIn an interview with \"Bloody Disgusting\" Mancini discussed the potential of a \"Child's Play\" film set on a train as well as revealing plans for a crossover film with the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" franchise, tentatively referred to as \"Child’s Play on Elm Street\".<br>\n\nI would like to do Freddy and Chucky, just because I think they would be a fun double act,\" he explains. \"I’m more really interested in the characters. My pitch for Freddy vs. Chucky is Child’s Play on Elm Street. Chucky ends up in some kid’s house on Elm Street, and Chucky and Freddy inevitably meet in the dreamscape. Chucky sleeps. Why not? Chucky sleeps, Chucky dreams. And they have this admiration for each other. But they realize quickly that Elm Street isn’t big enough for the two of them, so in a riff on Dirty Rotten Scoundrels they have a contest: who can kill the most teenagers before the sun comes up? \n\nIn September 2017 in a separate interview with Cinema Blend, Mancini confirmed his intent to make the crossover film, describing it as \"cool and doable\", confirming that the film would be titled \"Child’s Play on Elm Street\" and that he was currently in discussion with New Line Cinema about the film. The foundation for a crossover film was previously laid in \"Bride of Chucky\", in which Freddy Krueger's bladed glove had appeared in the Lockport police evidence depository at the beginning of the film.\n\nIn February 2018, it was announced that a television series titled \"Child's Play: The TV Series\", is in development with involvement from franchise creator Don Mancini, and producer David Kirschner. The show will share continuity with the original film series, and be a continuation of that story. Mancini stated that besides the TV series, feature films will still continue to be developed. By June of the same year, it was confirmed that Brad Dourif would return for the 8-part series to voice Charles Lee \"Chucky\" Ray.\n\nOn the home media DVD and Blu-ray release of \"Seed of Chucky\" in 2005, a short film entitled \"Chucky's Vacation Slides\" was included in the special features. The short, set during the events of \"Seed of Chucky\", follows Chucky, Tiffany, and Glen after having returned from a family vacation. The film implies that the events of \"Seed of Chucky\" take place over the course of 5–10 years. While browsing through their photographs of their vacation on a slide projector, Tiffany notices various corpses in the background of certain photographs, realizing that Chucky has been killing people again. Tiffany leaves, with a distraught and sickened Glen, while Chucky continues to view the photographs. After a delivery man arrives with a pizza, Chucky leads him to his garage and kills him off-screen. Brad Dourif, Jennifer Tilly and Billy Boyd all reprise their roles from the films.\n\nLeading up to the DVD release of \"Curse of Chucky\" in 2013, a series of short film videos were released. The clips showed Chucky interrupting the events of several other horror films. Brad Dourif and Edan Gross reprised their roles as Chucky and the Good Guy Doll, respectively. \n\n\n\nJoe Renzetti composed the first \"Child’s Play\", followed by Graeme Revell, who composed the soundtrack for \"Child’s Play 2\" and \"Bride of Chucky\". John D'Andrea and Cory Lerios wrote the score for \"Child’s Play 3\", while Pino Donaggio composed \"Seed of Chucky\". Joseph LoDuca composed the score for \"Curse of Chucky\" and \"Cult of Chucky\".\n\nThe following crimes have been associated with the \"Child’s Play\" films:\n\nIn December 1992 four people who tortured and killed 16-year-old Suzanne Capper were said to be influenced by one of the \"Child's Play\" movies. During the torturing of the girl, the perpetrators taunted her by playing her a song, (\"Hi, I'm Chucky (Wanna Play?)\" by 150 Volts, featuring samples from the movie \"Child's Play\".\n\nIn 1993, two youths who abducted and murdered a toddler named James Bulger were said to have been influenced by the film \"Child’s Play 3\". The supposed link between the murder and the film was denied by film censor James Ferman.\n\nAccording to a relative of two boys aged 10 and 12 who brutally attacked a nine-year-old and 11-year-old boy in Edlington, South Yorkshire in April 2009, the attackers watched horror movies, including \"Chucky\" films, from the age of about six or seven. Elena Lobacheva, a Russian serial killer arrested in 2015, was reportedly obsessed with the film \"Bride of Chucky\", which she cited as being an inspiration for the murders that she and her gang committed throughout Moscow.\n\nBeginning in 1992, Innovation Publishing released the first comic books based on the films, in the form of a three-issue adaptation of \"Child’s Play 2\". It was later collected in a trade paperback. The success of the adaptation led to a monthly series of new stories starting in 1991. The series, titled \"Child’s Play: The Series\", ended in 1992 after only five issues. This was followed by a three-issue adaptation of \"Child’s Play 3\".\n\nIn 2007, Devil's Due Publishing obtained the license to publish \"Child's Play\" comics and released a one-shot crossover with Hack/Slash titled \"Hack/Slash vs. Chucky\" which takes place after the events of the \"Seed of Chucky\" film. This was followed by a four-issue series called \"Chucky\". A second volume began in early 2009 but ceased publication after only one issue.\n\nSlimstown Studios announced an endless runner video game titled \"Chucky: Slash & Dash\". The game is scheduled to be released on iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices. It is the result of an agreement with Universal Partnerships & Licensing to develop and publish the first officially licensed smartphone and tablet \"Child’s Play\" video game. The gameplay is actually inspired by the second film's climax.\n\nIn the game, Chucky is stuck in a never-ending nightmare in which he's endlessly running through the factory that produces Good Guys dolls. Players control Chucky while sprinting through the factory floor, the catwalks, the warehouse, or even outside, and need to avoid conveyor belts, forklifts, acid pools, barrels and other obstacles. Chucky can also eliminate security guards patrolling the factory using his classic knife or other more outlandish weapons like a cleaver, screwdriver, or hatchet. As they play, gamers collect batteries that can be used to purchase in-game items or power-ups, such as a double battery bonus, a fast start, or extra lives that can extend a run after dying.\n\nThe app was released on November 1, 2013.\n\nSince 1992, Chucky has starred in his own shows at Universal Studios \"Halloween Horror Nights\", entitled, \"Chucky's In-Your-Face Insults\" and \"Chucky's Insult Emporium\".\n\nIn 2009, the climax of \"Child’s Play 3\" received its own maze, entitled \"Chucky's Fun House\". \"Curse of Chucky\" has also received its own scarezone in the 2013 lineup.\n\nIn 2017, Chucky played host to the Titans of Terror Tram which featured iconic horror villains Leatherface, Freddy Krueger, and Jason Voorhees.\n\n"}
{"id": "1564246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1564246", "title": "Circassian beauties", "text": "Circassian beauties\n\nCircassian beauties is a phrase used to refer to an idealized image of the women of the Circassian people of the Northwestern Caucasus. A fairly extensive literary history suggests that Circassian women were thought to be unusually beautiful, spirited, and elegant, and as such were desirable as concubines.\n\nThis reputation dates back to the Late Middle Ages, when the Circassian coast was frequented by traders from Genoa, and the founder of the Medici dynasty, Cosimo de' Medici, had an illegitimate son from a Circassian slave. During the Ottoman Empire and Persian Safavid and Qajar dynasties, Circassian women living as slaves in the Sultan's Imperial Harem and Shah's harems started to build their reputation as extremely beautiful and genteel, which then became a common trope in Western Orientalism.\n\nAs a result of this reputation, in Europe and America Circassians were often characterised as ideals of feminine beauty in poetry and art. Cosmetic products were advertised, from the 18th century on, using the word \"Circassian\" in the title, or claiming that the product was based on substances used by the women of Circassia.\n\nIn consequence, most wives of several Ottoman Sultans were ethnic Circassians converted to Islam, e.g. Valide Sultans (Empress mothers), including Perestü Valide Sultan, Pertevniyal Valide Sultan, Şevkefza Valide Sultan, Tirimüjgan Valide Sultan, Nükhetseza Başhanımefendi, other important Hatuns (Ladies) and Sultans like Şemsiruhsar Hatun and Saçbağlı Sultan, Haseki sultans (chief consorts) such as Mahidevran Haseki Sultan, Hümaşah Haseki Sultan, Hatice Muazzez Haseki Sultan, and Ayşe Haseki Sultan besides numerous Başkadınefendis (most senior consorts), including Bedrifelek I, Bidar II, Kamures I, and Servetseza I as well as Kadınefendis (senior consorts) such as Bezmara VI, Düzdidil III, Hayranıdil II, Meyliservet IV, Mihrengiz II, Neşerek III, Nurefsun II, Reftaridil II, Şayan III, amongst many others, or İkbals (honoured lady consorts), most notable of them being Cevherriz II, Ceylanyar II, Dilfirib I, Nalanıdil III, and Nergis IV in addition to Gözdes (favourite lady consorts), including Dürdane I, Hüsnicenan III, Safderun IV, amongst others. The \"golden age\" of the Circassian beauty may be considered to be between the 1770s, when the Russian Empire seized the Crimean Khanate and cut off their slave trade in Eastern European women, which increased the demand for Circassian women in Near Eastern harems; and the 1860s, when the Russians destroyed Circassia itself.\n\nIn the 1860s the showman P. T. Barnum exhibited women who he claimed were Circassian beauties. They wore a distinctive curly, big hair style, which had no precedent in earlier portrayals of Circassians, but which was soon copied by other female performers in the United States, who became known as \"moss-haired girls\". This hair style was a sort of a exhibit's trademark and was achieved by washing the hair of women in beer, drying it and then teasing it. It is not clear why Barnum chose this hairstyle. It may have been a reference to the Circassian fur hat, rather than the hair.\n\nThere were also several classical Turkish music pieces and poems that praise the beauty of the \"Lepiska Saçlı Çerkes\" (Straight, flaxen-haired Circassian; \"lepiska\" refers to long blonde hair which is soft and straight, as if flatironed).\n\nThe legend of Circassian women in the western world was enhanced in 1734, when, in his \"Letters on the English\", Voltaire alludes to the beauty of Circassian women:\n\nTheir beauty is mentioned in Henry Fielding's \"Tom Jones\" (1749), in which Fielding remarked, \"How contemptible would the brightest Circassian beauty, drest in all the jewels of the Indies, appear to my eyes!\"\n\nSimilar erotic claims about Circassian women appear in Lord Byron's \"Don Juan\" (1818–24), in which the tale of a slave auction is told:\n\nThe legend of Circassian women was also repeated by legal theorist Gustav Hugo, who wrote that \"Even beauty is more likely to be found in a Circassian slave girl than in a beggar girl\", referring to the fact that even a slave has some security and safety, but a \"free\" beggar has none. Hugo's comment was later condemned by Karl Marx in \"The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law\" (1842) on the grounds that it excused slavery. Mark Twain reported in \"The Innocents Abroad\" (1869) that \"Circassian and Georgian girls are still sold in Constantinople by their parents, but not publicly.\"\n\nAmerican travel author and diplomat Bayard Taylor in 1862 claimed that, \"So far as female beauty is concerned, the Circassian women have no superiors. They have preserved in their mountain home the purity of the Grecian models, and still display the perfect physical loveliness, whose type has descended to us in the Venus de' Medici.\"\n\nAn anthropological literary suggests that Circassians were best characterized by what was called \"rosy pale\" or \"translucent white skin\". While most Circassian tribes were famous for abundance of fair or dark blond and red hair combined with greyish-blue or green eyes, many also had the pairing of very dark hair with very light complexions, a typical feature of Peoples of the Caucasus. Many of the Circassian women in the Ottoman harem were described as having \"green eyes and long, dark blond hair, pale skin of translucent white colour, thin waist, slender body structure, and very good-looking hands and feet.\" The fact that Circassian women were traditionally encouraged to wear corsets in order to keep their posture straight might have shaped their wasp waist as a result. In the late 18th century, it was claimed by Western European coutouriers that \"the Circassian Corset is the only one which displays, without indelicacy, the shape of the bosom to the greatest possible advantage; gives a width to the chest which is equally conducive to health and elegance of appearance.\"\n\nIt has also been suggested that a lithe and erect physique were favored for Circassians, and many villages had large numbers of healthy elderly people, many over a hundred years of age.\n\nMaturin Murray Ballou described Circassians as being of the \"fair and rosy-cheeked race,\" and \"with a form of ravishing loveliness, large and lustrous eyes, and every belonging that might go to make up a Venus\".\n\nIn Henry Lindlahr's words in the early 20th century, \"Blue-eyed Caucasian regiments today form the cream of the Sultan's army. Circassian beauties are admired for their abundant and luxuriant yellow hair and blue eyes.\"\n\nIn his book \"A Year Among the Circassians\", John Augustus Longworth describes a Circassian girl of typical Circassian features as the following: \"She had regular and pretty features, blue eyes, and fair complexion; her hair was of a light auburn colour, and hung in a profusion of braided tresses over her shoulders, from a bonnet of scarlet cloth, trimmed and crossed with broad silver lace, not unlike the Albanian skull-cap. She was tall, and well, though slightly, shaped; and held herself, like all Circassians, men or women, very erect.\"\n\nIt is also understood from the memoirs of Princess Emily Ruete, a half-Circassian and half-Omani herself, that Circassian women, who were captured in Constantinople and brought to Africa for the harem of Zanzibari Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, were envied by their rivals who considered Circassians to be of the \"hateful race of blue-eyed cats.\"\n\nRegarding one of her half-sisters who was also from a Circassian mother, Princess Ruete of Zanzibar mentions that, \"The daughter of a Circassian was a dazzling beauty with the complexion of a German blonde. Besides, she possessed a sharp intellect, which made her into a faithful advisor of my father's.\"\n\nThe characteristics of Circassian and Northwest Georgian women were further articulated in 1839 by the author Emma Reeve who, as stated by Joan DelPlato, differentiated \"between 'the blond Circassians' who are 'indolent and graceful, their voices low and sweet' and what she calls the slightly darker-skinned Georgians who are 'more animated' and have more 'intelligence and vivacity than their delicate rivals'.\"\n\nSimilar descriptions of the Circassian women appear in Florence Nightingale's travel journal where Nightingale called Circassians \"the most graceful and the most sensual-looking creatures I ever saw\".\n\nAccording to the feminist Harriet Martineau, Circassians were the only saving virtue of the Egyptian harem where these Circassian mothers produced the finest children and if they were to be excluded from the harem, the upper class in Egypt would be doomed.\n\nIn parts of Europe and North America where blond hair was more common, the pairing of extremely white skin with very dark hair also present among some Circassians was exalted, even in Russia which was at war with the Circassians; Semyon Bronevskii exalted Circassian women for having light skin, dark brown hair, dark eyes and \"the lineaments of the face of the Ancient Greek\". In the United States, the girls disguised as \"Circassians\" exhibited by Phineas T. Barnum were in fact Catholic Irish girls from Lower Manhattan.\n\nCircassian men were also exalted for their beauty, manliness and bravery in Western Europe, in a way Caucasus historian Charles King calls \"homoerotic\". In Scotland, in 1862, Circassian chiefs arrived to advocate their cause against Russia and to persuade Britain to stop the actions of the Russian army at that time, and upon the arrival of two Circassian leaders, Hadji Hayder Hassan and Kustan Ogli Ismael, the \"Dundee Advertiser\" reported that \"the Chiefs are two remarkable looking men. Their imposing bearing, their romantic dress... and their natural dignity of mien, stamp them as very superior... Raven haired, black-bearded, broad-browed, with wide springing eyebrows of sooty black... these bronzed and armed children of the mountains tend to put us out of love with our own specimens of men, and suggests thoughts not complementary to the types of manhood which, in this country, they are surrounded.\"\n\nDuring the 19th century, various Western intellectuals offered pseudoscientific explanations for the light complexion present among Circassians. The doctor of medicine Hugh Williamson, a signatory to the United States Constitution, argued that the reason for the extreme whiteness of the Circassian and coastal Celto-Germanic peoples can be explained by the geographical location of these folks' ancestral homelands which lie in high latitudes ranging from 45° to 55° N near a sea or ocean where Westerlies prevail from the west towards the east.\n\nAccording to Voltaire, the practice of inoculation (early form of vaccination) resulted in the Circassians having skin clean of smallpox scars:\nBy the early nineteenth century, Circassians were associated with theories of racial hierarchy, which elevated the Caucasus region as the source of the purest examples of the \"white race\", which was named the Caucasian race after the area by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach. Blumenbach theorised that the Circassians were the closest to God's original model of humanity, and thus \"the purest and most beautiful whites were the Circassians\". This fuelled the idea of female Circassian beauty.\n\nIn 1873, the decade after the expulsion of Circassians from the Caucasus where only a minority of them live today, it was argued that \"the Caucasian Race receives its name from the Caucasus, the abode of the Circassians who are said to be the handsomest and best-formed nation, not only of this race, but of the whole human family.\" Another anthropologist William Guthrie distinguished the Caucasian race and the \"Circassians who are admired for their beauty\" in particular by their oval form of their head, straight nose, thin lips, vertically-placed teeth, facial angle from 80 to 90 degrees that he calls the most developed one, and their regular features overall, which \"causes them to be considered as the most handsome and agreeable\".\n\nBayard Taylor observed the Circassian women during his trip to the Ottoman Empire and argued that, \"the Circassian face is a pure oval; the forehead is low and fair, an excellent thing in woman, and the skin of an ivory whiteness, except the faint pink of the cheeks and the ripe, roseate stain of the lips.\"\n\nCircassians are depicted in images of harems at this time through these ideologies of racial hierarchy. John Frederick Lewis's \"The Harem\" portrays Circassians as the dominant mistresses of the harem, who look down on other women, as implied in the review of the painting in \"The Art Journal\", which described it as follows,\n\nIt represents the interior of a harem at Cairo, wherein is seated in luxurious ease a young Turk, attired in the excess of Moslem fashion. Near him, and reclining upon cushions, are two Circassian women, also dressed in the extremity of Oriental taste... On the right is seen a tall Nubian eunuch, who removes from the shoulders of an Egyptian slave the shawl by which she had been covered, in order to show her to the master of the harem; this figure with her high shoulders and the characteristics of her features, is a most successful national impersonation. The Circassian women look languidly to the Egyptian with an expression of supreme contempt, which is responded to by a sneer on the face of the Nubian eunuch.\n\nOrientalizing paintings of nudes were also sometimes exhibited as \"Circassians\".\n\nThe Circassians became major news during the Caucasian War, in which Russia conquered the North Caucasus, displacing large numbers of Circassians southwards. In 1856 \"The New York Times\" published a report entitled \"Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women — Infanticide in Turkey\", asserting that a consequence of the Russian conquest of the Caucasus was an excess of beautiful Circassian women on the Constantinople slave market, and that this was causing prices of slaves in general to plummet. The story drew on ideas of racial hierarchy, stating that:\n\nThe temptation to possess a Circassian girl at such low prices is so great in the minds of the Turks that many who cannot afford to keep several slaves have been sending their blacks to market, in order to make room for a newly purchased white girl.\n\nThe article also claimed that children born to the \"inferior\" black concubines were being killed. This story drew widespread attention to the area, as did later conflicts.\n\nAt the same time writers and illustrators were also creating images depicting the authentic costumes and people of the Caucasus. Francis Davis Millet depicted Circassian women during his 1877 coverage of the Russo-Turkish war, specifying local costume and hairstyle.\n\nAn advertisement from 1782 titled \"Bloom of Circassia\" makes clear that it was by then well established \"that the Circassians are the most beautiful Women in the World\", but goes on to reveal that they \"derive not all their Charms from Nature\". They used a concoction supposedly extracted from a vegetable native to Circassia. Knowledge of this \"Liquid Bloom\" had been brought back by a \"well-regarded gentleman\" who had traveled and lived in the region. It \"instantly gives a Rosy Hue to the Cheeks\", a \"lively and animated Bloom of Rural Beauty\" that would not disappear in perspiration or handkerchiefs.\n\nIn 1802 \"the Balm of Mecca\" was also marketed as being used by Circassians: \"This delicate as well as fragrant composition has been long celebrated as the summit of cosmetics by all the Circassian and Georgian women in the seraglio of the Grand Sultan\". It claims that the product was endorsed by Lady Mary Wortley Montague who stated that it was very helpful \"for removing those sebacious impurities so noxious to beauty\". The article continues: \"Any lady must be as great an Infidel as the Grand Sultan himself, who, after receiving such authority can doubt that her skin will become as superlatively smooth, soft, white and delicate, as that of the lovely Fatima, whatever may have been its feel or its appearance before. What fair one but must yield implicit faith, when she has the honour of the Countess De --- fairly pledged, that all sepacious [sic] impurities will be at once removed by this wonder-working nostrum. And above all, who but must long for an article, from the seraglio of the Grand Turk, which produces a near resemblance to the Georgian and Circassian beauties?\"\n\n\"Circassian Lotion\" was sold in 1806 for the skin, at fifty cents the bottle. \"A sovereign remedy for surfeits, scorching from the heat of the sun, freckles, blights from cold and chills of winter, scorbutic, pimples or eruptions of the face and skin, however violent or disfigured, animalcula generated under the cuticle or outer skin, prickley heat, shingles, ring worms, redness of the nose and chin, obstinate cutaneous diseases, and for every impurity or unnatural appearance with which the skin may be affected; to be used as a common wash for clearing and improving the complexion, and in a superior degree to preserve, soften, cleanse and beautify the skin\".\n\n\"Circassian Eye-Water\" was marketed as \"a sovereign remedy for all diseases of the eyes\", and in the 1840s \"Circassian hair dye\" was marketed to create a rich dark lustrous effect.\n\nThe combination of the popular issues of slavery, the Orient, racial ideology, and sexual titillation gave the reports of Circassian women sufficient notoriety at the time that the circus leader P. T. Barnum decided to capitalize on this interest. He displayed a \"Circassian Beauty\" at his American Museum in 1865. Barnum's Circassian beauties were young women with tall, teased hairstyles, rather like the Afro style of the 1970s. Actual Circassian hairstyles bore no resemblance to Barnum's fantasy. Barnum's first \"Circassian\" was marketed under the name \"Zalumma Agra\" and was exhibited at his American Museum in New York from 1864. Barnum had written to John Greenwood, his agent in Europe, asking him to purchase a beautiful Circassian girl to exhibit, or at least to hire a girl who could \"pass for\" one. However, it seems that \"Zalumma Agra\" was probably a local girl hired by the show, as were later \"Circassians\". Barnum also produced a booklet about another of his Circassians, Zoe Meleke, who was portrayed as an ideally beautiful and refined woman who had escaped a life of sexual slavery.\n\nThe portrayal of a white woman as a rescued slave at the time of the American Civil War played on the racial connotations of slavery at the time. It has been argued that the distinctive hairstyle affiliates the side-show Circassian with African identity, and thus,\n\nresonates oddly yet resoundingly with the rest of her identifying significations: her racial purity, her sexual enslavement, her position as colonial subject; her beauty. The Circassian blended elements of white Victorian True Womanhood with traits of the enslaved African American woman in one curiosity.\n\nThe trend spread, with supposedly Circassian women featured in dime museums and travelling medicine shows, sometimes known as \"Moss-haired girls\". They were typically identified by the distinctive hairstyle, which was held in place by the use of beer. They also often performed in pseudo-oriental costume. Many postcards of Circassians also circulated. Though Barnum's original women were portrayed as proud and genteel, later images of Circassians often emphasised erotic poses and revealing costumes. As the original fad faded, the \"Circassians\" started to add to their appeal by performing traditional circus tricks such as sword swallowing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5928", "title": "Clown", "text": "Clown\n\nA clown is a comic performer who employs slapstick or similar types of physical comedy, often in a mime style.\n\nClowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable modern clown character is the \"Auguste\" or \"red clown\" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, exaggerated footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. \n\nModern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the circus clown, which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or \"Varieté\" shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.\n\nMany circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by Joseph Grimaldi (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of Clown in the harlequinade that formed part of British pantomimes, notably at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as \"Joey\", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.\n\nThe comedy that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary—and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition. \n\nThe \"fear of clowns,\" circus clowns in particular as a psychiatric condition has become known by the term coulrophobia.\n\nThe \"\"clown\" character developed out of the zanni \"rustic fool\" characters of the early modern commedia dell'arte, which were themselves directly based on the \"rustic fool\"\" characters of ancient Greek and Roman theatre.\nRustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as \" sklêro-paiktês\" (from \"paizein\" \"to play (like a child)\") or \"deikeliktas\", besides other generic terms for \"rustic\" or \"peasant\". In Roman theater, a term for clown was \"fossor\", literally \"digger; labourer\".\n\nThe English word \"clown\" was first recorded c. 1560 (as \"clowne, cloyne\") in the generic meaning \"rustic, boor, peasant\". \nThe origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with \"clumsy\".\nIt is in this sense that \"Clown\" is used as the name of fool characters in Shakespeare's \"Othello\" and \"The Winter's Tale\".\nThe sense of \"clown\" as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on Elizabethan \"rustic fool\" characters such as Shakespeare's.\n\nThe harlequinade developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that \"Clown\" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for Harlequin's slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.\n\nThe now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by Joseph Grimaldi, who played Clown in Charles Dibdin's 1800 pantomime \"Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World\" at Sadler's Wells Theatre, where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.\n\nThe circus clown developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from Philip Astley's London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian George L. Fox became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.\nTom Belling senior (1843–1900) developed the \"red clown\" or \"Auguste\" (\"Dummer August\") character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated \"white clown\". Belling worked for Circus Renz in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or \"hobo\" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in Ruggero Leoncavallo's 1892 opera \"Pagliacci\" (\"Clowns\").\nBelling's \"Auguste\" character was further popularized by Nicolai Poliakoff's \"Coco\" in the 1920s to 1930s.\n\nThe English word \"clown\" was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, into many other languages, such as French \"clown\", Russian (and other Slavic languages) кло́ун, Greek κλόουν, Danish/Norwegian \"klovn\", Romanian \"clovn\" etc.\n\nItalian retains \"Pagliaccio\", a Commedia dell'arte zanni character, and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French \"Paillasse\", Spanish \"payaso\", Catalan/Galician \"pallasso\", Portuguese \"palhaço\", Greek παλιάτσος, Turkish \"palyaço\", German \"Pajass\" (via French), Yiddish פּאַיאַץ (\"payats\"), Russian пая́ц.\n\nIn the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the tramp or hobo. Examples include Marceline Orbes, who performed at the Hippodrome Theater(1905), Charlie Chaplin's \"The Tramp\" (1914), and Emmett Kelly's \"Weary Willie\" based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by Otto Griebling during the 1930s to 1950s. Red Skelton's Dodo the Clown in \"The Clown\" (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, \"a funny man with a drinking problem\".\n\nIn the United States, Bozo the Clown was an influential \"Auguste\" character since the late 1950s. \"The Bozo Show\" premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. McDonald's derived its mascot clown, Ronald McDonald, from the \"Bozo\" character in the 1960s. Willard Scott, who had played \"Bozo\" during 1959–1962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.\n\nBased on the \"Bozo\" template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (\"Bozo\"-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to \"Clown Care\" or \"hospital clowning\" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. Clowns of America International (established 1984) and World Clown Association (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.\n\nThe shift of the \"Auguste\" or \"red clown\" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a \"Bozo\"-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the evil clown character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.\n\nThere are different types of clowns portrayed around the world. They include\n\nThe classical pairing of the White Clown with Auguste in modern tradition\nhas a precedent in the pairing of Pierrot and Harlequin in the Commedia dell'arte.\nOriginally, Harlequin's role was that of a light-hearted, nimble and astute servant, paired with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.\n\nIn the 18th-century English Harlequinade, Harlequin was now paired with Clown.\nAs developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.\n\nThe \"white clown\", or \"clown blanc\" from the original French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy auguste. They are also distinguished as the \"sad clown\" (blanc) and \"happy clown\" (auguste).\n\nThe Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit — either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.\n\nThe auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.\n\nThe \"contra-auguste\" plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.\n\nThere are two major types of clowns with \"whiteface\" makeup:\nThe classic \"white clown\" is derived from the Pierrot character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque \"Auguste\" types. Francesco Caroli and Glenn \"Frosty\" Little are examples of this type. The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the \"Bozo\" type, known as \"Comedy\" or \"Grotesque Whiteface\". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. \nIn the comedic partnership of Abbott and Costello, Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.\n\nTraditionally, the whiteface clown uses \"clown white\" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible. In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.\n\nWhiteface makeup was originally designed by Joseph Grimaldi in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.\n\nAmerica's first great whiteface clown was stage star George \"G.L.\" Fox. Following English Joseph Grimaldi, Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.\n\nThe character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or hobo. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps Otto Griebling and Emmett Kelly. Red Skelton, Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Sacha Baron Cohen would all fit the definition of a character clown.\n\nThe character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.\n\nThe most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the \"hobo\", \"tramp\" or \"bum\" clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is attitude. According to American circus expert Hovey Burgess, they are :\n\nClowns International claims to be the oldest clown society in the world. It was set up in 1946. Apart from being a membership organisation, Clowns International has set up a museum of clown memorabilia and a register of clown make-up. The latter also has a collection of full eggshells decorated as replicas of the specific clown's head.\n\nThe World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.\n\nClowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims \"to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns\".\n\nIn the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as tightrope, juggling, unicycling, Master of Ceremonies, or ride an animal. Clowns may also \"sit in\" with the orchestra. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.\n\nFrameworks are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act. Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.\n\nShows are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entrées, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.\n\n\n\n\"Clown Stops\" or \"interludes\" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few \"gags\" or several \"bits\". Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called \"reprises\" or \"run-ins\" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of \"business\" usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a tightrope walker the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the \"artiste\" by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.\n\nAmong the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the \"too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car\" stunt; doing just about anything with a rubber chicken, tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or \"clown bikes\". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.\n\nIn anthropology, the term \"clown\" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures. A society in which such \"clowns\" have an important position are termed \"clown societies\", and a \"clown\" character involved in a religious or ritual capacity is known as a \"ritual clown\".\n\nThe most ancient \"clowns\" have been found in the Fifth dynasty of Egypt, around 2400 BC. Unlike court jesters, clowns have traditionally served a socio-religious and psychological role, and traditionally the roles of priest and clown have been held by the same persons.\nPeter Berger writes that \"It seems plausible that folly and fools, like religion and magic, meet some deeply rooted needs in human society\". For this reason, clowning is often considered an important part of training as a physical performance discipline, partly because tricky subject matter can be dealt with, but also because it requires a high level of risk and play in the performer.\n\nIn Native American mythology, the Trickster channels the spirit of the Coyote and becomes a sacred Clown character. A Heyoka is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles. The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse. The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a Winkte.\n\nMany native tribes have a history of clowning.\nThe Canadian Clowning method developed by Richard Pochinko and furthered by his former apprentice, Sue Morrison, combines European and Native American clowning techniques.\n\nIn this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the medicine wheel. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "911884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=911884", "title": "Comedy of manners", "text": "Comedy of manners\n\nThe comedy of manners is a form of comedy that satirizes the manners and affectations of contemporary society and questions societal standards. Social class stereotypes are often represented through stock characters such as the \"miles gloriosus\" (\"boastful soldier\") in ancient Greek comedy or the fop and rake of English Restoration comedy, which is sometimes used as a synonym for \"comedy of manners\". A comedy of manners often sacrifices the plot, which usually centers on some scandal, to witty dialogue and sharp social commentary. Oscar Wilde's play, \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (1895), which satirized the Victorian morality of the time, is one of the best-known plays of this genre.\n\nThe comedy of manners was first developed in the New Comedy period of ancient Greek comedy and is known today primarily from fragments of writings by the Greek playwright Menander. Menander's style, elaborate plots, and stock characters were imitated by the ancient Roman playwrights, such as Plautus and Terence, whose comedies were in turn widely known and reproduced during the Renaissance. Some of the best-known comedies of manners are those by the 17th-century French playwright Molière, who satirized the hypocrisy and pretension of the \"ancien régime\" in plays such as \"L'École des femmes\" ([\"The School for Wives\"], 1662), \"Tartuffe\" ([\"The Imposter\"], 1664), and \"Le Misanthrope\" ([\"The Misanthrope\"], 1666).\n\nThe comedy of manners has been employed by Roman satirists since as early as the first century BC. Horace's Satire 1.9 is a prominent example, in which the persona is unable to express his wish for his companion to leave, but instead subtly implies so through wit.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare's \"Much Ado about Nothing\" might be considered the first comedy of manners In England, but the genre really flourished during the Restoration period. Restoration comedy, which was influenced by Ben Jonson's comedy of humours, made fun of affected wit and acquired follies of the time. The masterpieces of the genre were the plays of William Wycherley (\"The Country Wife\", 1675) and William Congreve (\"The Way of the World\", 1700). In the late 18th century Oliver Goldsmith (\"She Stoops to Conquer\", 1773) and Richard Brinsley Sheridan (\"The Rivals\", 1775; \"The School for Scandal\", 1777) revived the form.\n\nThe tradition of elaborate, artificial plotting and epigrammatic dialogue was carried on by the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde in \"Lady Windermere's Fan\" (1892) and \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (1895). In the 20th century, the comedy of manners reappeared in the plays of the British dramatists Noël Coward (\"Hay Fever\", 1925) and Somerset Maugham and the novels of P. G. Wodehouse, as well as various British sitcoms. The \"Carry On films\" are a direct descendant of the comedy of manners \nstyle.\n\nThe term \"comedy of menace\", which British drama critic Irving Wardle based on the subtitle of \"\" (1958), by David Campton, is a jocular play-on-words derived from the \"comedy of manners\" (\"menace\" being \"manners\" pronounced with a somewhat Judeo-English accent). Pinter's play \"The Homecoming\" has been described as a mid-twentieth-century \"comedy of manners\".\n\nIn \"Boston Marriage\" (1999), David Mamet chronicles a sexual relationship between two women, one of whom has her eye on yet another young woman (who never appears, but who is the target of a seduction scheme). Periodically, the two women make their serving woman the butt of haughty jokes, serving to point up the satire on class. Though displaying the verbal dexterity one associates with both the playwright and the genre, the patina of wit occasionally erupts into shocking crudity.\n\nOther contemporary examples include Kazuo Ishiguro's \"The Remains of the Day\", E. M. Forster's \"A Room with a View\", Barbara Pym's \"Excellent Women\", Douglas Carter Beane's \"As Bees in Honey Drown\", \"The Country Club\", \"The Little Dog Laughed\", \"You Rang, M'Lord?\" by David Croft and Jimmy Perry, and the Jeeves and Wooster series by P. G. Wodehouse. The television program \"Absolutely Fabulous\" is another contemporary example of the comedy of manners.\n\n"}
{"id": "5329562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5329562", "title": "Crusty Demons", "text": "Crusty Demons\n\nThe Crusty Demons are a group of daredevil freestyle motorcyclists from the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. They originated in 1994 with the filming of \"Crusty Demons of Dirt\" by Fleshwound Films. Since then, they have been the subject of about 20 videos, and in 2007 the video game \"Crusty Demons\" was released to the public. Together the members of Crusty Demons have set 11 world records in their careers.\n\nThe origins of the group can be traced to 1994, when filmmakers Jon Freeman and Dana Nicholson had been accumulating footage to showcase a behind the scenes expose of the lifestyle of an American pro motocross rider in action, featuring 145 ft plus jumps, 45 ft high in the air soaring over sand dunes, mountains, houses, buses and anything else secure and steep enough to hold the weight of bike and rider. The end result was Fleshwound Films and the first video \"Crusty Demons of Dirt\".\n\nFollowing the success of the first film, Crusty 2 premiered 18 months later. Sales exceeded expectations and tripled from the first video as the Crusty phenomenon began spreading worldwide. What was somewhat a stagnant sport had received a positive injection of interest and proved its worthiness of being showcased Internationally. People began buying the clothing worn by their heroes (Fleshgear) and thousands around the world were getting bikes and heading for the racetrack, mountains, sand dunes and the sky. With a unique production style the Crusty Demons filmed created a whole new genre of Action Sports Films. With cutting-edge editing by Director of Photography Scotty Avalos, they quickly gained a following and the hardcore fans were born.\n\nWith the release of Crusty 3 in 1997 and the videos and sport rising in popularity, freestyle motocross pioneer Lofty (a.k.a. Brian Jordan) went to Fleshwound Films with the idea of staging a freestyle motocross competition. Four months later the first competition was held in Las Vegas. This new side of the sport was looked down upon by the industry and many people said it would go nowhere, but the excitement amongst the fans indicated otherwise.\n\nFleshwound Films undoubtedly played a crucial part in the evolution of the sport, they are still shooting Crusty Films today and recently released the 10th installment titled \"Crusty X – A Decade of Dirt\". Apart from videos, Fleshwound also made a great success out of Fleshwound Film merchandise, which inspired their creation of the official Crusty clothing brand, Flesh gear (a freestyle ride gear and lifestyle clothing).\n\nEuropean riders:\n\nNate Adams is currently ranked the number one freestyle motocross athlete in the world and Trigger Gumm held the world record for the longest jump on a motorcycle, until it was broken by Australian Robbie Maddison on December 31, 2007. Gumm was a four-time Guinness Book World Record holder for longest distance jump, breaking the record in Australia in May 2005 when he launched his Service Honda 500 cc motorcycle 277.5 feet. He also has the record for height in jumping, going vertical at 80 feet high. Seth Enslow who is also a member of the Crusty Demons set the record for the longest jump on a Harley-Davidson in March 2010 in Australia. Also Jeff Emig was a major rider in the Crusty Demons of Dirt, winning four world champion titles.\n\n\n2007 marked the video game release of \"Crusty Demons\", released on PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game featured Ronnie Faisst, Jeremy \"Twitch\" Stenberg, Seth Enslow, Kenny Bartram, and Dan Pastor as playable characters as well as an array of fictional characters. Players perform typical Crusty Demons style stunts in urban city locations, with the main goals of building points, which are obtained by performing tricks successfully, and inflicting as many injuries as possible to the rider via crashes. Other objectives includes smashing into targets, and winning races. The story revolves around the Crusty Demons, who die in an accident at the start of the game and are brought back to life by 'the Devil'.\n\nThe Crusty Demons have set the following world records:\n\n"}
{"id": "2916480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2916480", "title": "Deuteragonist", "text": "Deuteragonist\n\nIn literature, the deuteragonist or secondary main character (from , \"deuteragōnistḗs\", second actor) is the second most important character, after the protagonist and before the tritagonist. The deuteragonist may switch between supporting and opposing the protagonist, depending on the deuteragonist's own conflict or plot.\n\nGreek drama began with simply one actor, the protagonist, and a chorus of dancers. The playwright Aeschylus introduced the deuteragonist; Aristotle says in his \"Poetics\":\n\nAeschylus' efforts brought the dialogue and interaction between characters to the forefront and set the stage for other playwrights of the era, like Sophocles and Euripides, to produce many iconic plays.\n\nBecause Ancient Greek drama involved only three actors (the protagonist, deuteragonist, and tritagonist) plus the chorus, each actor often played several parts. For instance, in Sophocles' \"Oedipus Rex\", the protagonist would be Oedipus, who is on stage in most acts, the deuteragonist would be Jocasta (Oedipus' mother and wife), as well as the Shepherd and Messenger. This would be because Jocasta is certainly a major role—acting opposite Oedipus many times and occupying a central part of the story—and because the Shepherd and Messenger are onstage when Jocasta is offstage.\n\nIn literature, the deuteragonist often assumes the role of \"sidekick\" to the protagonist. In Mark Twain's \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\", the protagonist is Huck and the deuteragonist, his constant companion, is Jim. In this story the tritagonist would be Tom Sawyer. Conversely, the deuteragonist could also be a particularly visible antagonist, normally whom the actual antagonist hides behind. In some cases, the deuteragonist is a sidekick who is also used as a foil for the protagonist, in order to more greatly enhance the powers or strengths of the main character. Dr. John Watson, for example, in the Sherlock Holmes series by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is an educated and intelligent gentleman of professional standing, and yet his own intelligence is of too rigid a stance to embrace fully the kind of possibilities of which the more maverick Sherlock Holmes is capable.\n"}
{"id": "3817946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3817946", "title": "Dotch Cooking Show", "text": "Dotch Cooking Show\n\nThe (April 17, 1997 – March 17, 2005) was a Japanese cooking show produced by the Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation and known for its use of the highest quality and most expensive food ingredients available from both domestic and international sources. In the show two chefs prepare two competing dishes, each using a special premium ingredient, but the dish that is ultimately served at the end of the show is determined by majority vote of the panelists, and then served only to those who voted for that dish. The show is continued by the from April 14, 2005.\n\nEach of the two hosts, Hiroshi Sekiguchi (関口宏) and Yuji Miyake (三宅裕司), chooses a particular dish for the contest, and oversees the dish's creation by his chef. For most of the show's run, Sekiguchi was in charge of the Red kitchen, and Miyake took the Yellow kitchen. In later episodes, the two dishes were pre-selected, and whichever meal Sekiguchi and Miyake prepared for his side was determined by a special dice throw. The competing dishes were typically from the same category; an example of a typical \"battle\" would be miso ramen versus salt-and-butter ramen. Other battles have included miso-based dishes versus mayonnaise-based dishes, chocolate fondant cake versus fruit tart, and even tacos versus spring rolls.\n\nThe seven guests would be asked to choose which meal they would most like to eat. Unlike Iron Chef, where the judges would get to eat the food prepared by both chefs, only the guests who chose the winning dish were allowed to eat. There were three periods when the guests would vote; the first was when the dishes were announced, the second was after the \"tasting time,\" and the third was after both dishes had been completed. Though Sekiguchi and Miyake would be allowed to taste the dishes in progress and describe what they had eaten (often in dramatic fashion), the guests were allowed only one \"tasting time,\" where they got a sample of each kitchen's special ingredient, usually prepared in a manner similar to how it would be for the finished product. In the later episodes of the show, the tasting time was eliminated for all but one of the guests. The lucky guest, who was randomly chosen, would be allowed the samples as previously described, and would then have to describe what they tasted to the other guests. As a result, they would be the only one asked to choose the dish they wanted during the second voting. This was done to increase the suspense for the TV audience and put the guests on the same level as the audience.\n\nWhile the chefs were preparing their dishes, each side would reveal a special ingredient that they hoped would sway the guests to vote for their respective dishes. The special ingredients could be anything from the focus of the recipe, such as a meat or vegetable, to a sauce or flavoring component. Though most of the special ingredients were found in often remote areas of Japan, some came from outside Japan, such as Mongolia, Korea, and even Scotland. In very rare and unusual instances, the special ingredients were not food items, but rather tools for preparing or serving the dish, such as a granite bowl from Korea, used in the preparation of stone-cooked bibimbap, or a special cast iron press used to make taiyaki. Each kitchen's special assistant would go to where the special ingredient was grown/raised/manufactured/harvested, to both procure the special ingredient and observe how it was produced.\n\nAt the end of the show, the two hosts would declare in unison: \" The word \", which appears in the show's graphics, is a transliteration of the Japanese word meaning \"which one\". The guests would press a button (corresponding to which dish they chose) and the side with the most votes was declared the winner. The winning host would then ask the loser to withdraw (\"tesshū\", 撤收). The losing host and his chef would then take away their losing dish, and the winning guests and host would then dine on their selection. The hungry losers would watch the winners eat. This would often be followed by a scene of the winning host and guests leaving the show set satisfied after their meal, a scene of the losing host and guests griping about not getting to eat as they left the studio, or sometimes both. At the very end of the show, the losing chef would typically be shown eating his dish alone, wondering why he did not win.\n\nSince each side had to prepare food for eight people (seven guests and the winning host, in the event of a complete 7-0 victory (later 9 portions for seven guests, the winning host, and the assistant for the winning kitchen) and typically fewer than that number would actually get to eat, any food left over after the winners had eaten was usually consumed by the show's crew. Since each show usually took hours to film, the hunger expressed by the losing guests at the end was genuine.\n\n[Later episodes of The New Dotch Cooking Show: Keisuke Mori (森圭介, an announcer at Nippon TV) becomes the new assistant]\n\n\nThe assistants reported, newscaster-style, on the obtaining of special ingredients. The chefs were hired from a pool of highly skilled cooks.\n\nThe format of the show is basically the same, except that tasting time has been completely eliminated for the contestants (Sekiguchi and Miyake still get to taste the works in progress). The contestant roster was expanded from 7 to 11 (occasionally 9), with 4 celebrity contestants (Tsuyoshi Kusanagi still appeared as a regular) and 7 (occasionally 5) additional contestants, called \"Hara-Helicopters,\" drawn from a pool. Typically, the Hara-Helicopters are everyday people, though some groups are distinctly categorized, e.g. schoolchildren, \"idols,\" \"young men who have not eaten for 48 hours,\" or restaurateurs. During the preparation of the meals, the celebrity contestants would be allowed to observe each chef's methods up close, and smell/feel (not taste) the various ingredients used, while the Hara-Helicopters would watch the action from their seats overlooking the stage. In some episodes, Kusanagi would bring a plate of one of the special ingredients up to the Hara-Helicopters so they could smell it. The series went on hiatus on September 14, 2006\nand returned on January 4, 2007 for a one-time only TV special.\n\n\n\n"}

It was popular at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nClosely related to opera, the most famous example were the 1775 works \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" and \"Medea\" by Georg Benda. Mozart admired Benda's work and used similar techniques in \"Zaide\" (1780) and \"Thamos, König in Ägypten\" (c. 1773-1780). He considered writing a duodrama himself, to be called \"Semiramis\".

{"id": "53366398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53366398", "title": "Effects of sex in the media", "text": "Effects of sex in the media\n\nIn the past several decades, researchers have spent continuous efforts on exploring how sexual content in the media influence individuals' perceptions of sex, marriage, and rape. Among these sexual content in the media, pornography has been a big business, generating $13 billion just in the U.S. in 2006. Researchers have reached agreement on some effects of sexual content in the media, such as arousal and some attitudinal effects. However, there is still an argument on whether the Catharsis effects resulting from the sexual media content.\n\nScholars analyzed the violent sexual content based on different types of sexual content, which sexual content portray rape, bondage, torture, sadomasochism, hitting, spanking, hair pulling, and genital mutilation, and nonviolent sexual material. Nonviolent sexual material is much harder to categorize. Some nonviolent sexual material is entirely mutually consenting and affectionate, depicting vagina or oral intercourse in a loving, or at least non-coercive, fashion. On the other hand, some nonviolent sexual material is sexually dehumanizing, depicting degradation, domination, subordination or humiliation. Nonviolent sexual material presents the woman with few human attributes besides body parts and sexual appetite.\n\nOne crucial effect of consuming sexual media is sexual arousal, \"the heightened physiological state that energizes sexual behavior. Arousal can be measured in two methods. One method is self-ratings of participants and the other is that physiological measures such as electronic sensors measuring penile tumescence, vaginal lubrication, or temperature (thermography).\n\nSome researchers found that men are more aroused by sexual media than are women, especially in response to sexually violent or dehumanizing materials. Also, sexual violence may only appeal to sex offenders and other violence-prone men and even to \"normal\" men if the victim is portrayed as being aroused by the assault. Slides or verbal descriptions of coercive sex are more appealing to sexually coercive men physiologically than \"normal\" men.\nSince the Internet provides unlimited number of websites that feature any sexual desire that the user wants, it results in sexual arousal because the stimuli are new. Carnes think that the Internet can allow people to see any of their fantasy, which usually do not exist in most people's daily lives. These images can be reactivated during the sexual intercourse.\n\nOne of the major criticism from scholars is that the dehumanization of women in sexual explicit materials. Men rated their own partners as being less physically endowed after seeing beautiful female nudes engaged in sexual activity. It seems that the voluptuous model has become the norm or anchor to which real people are compared. Zillmann and Bryant also found that such effects are not limited to men. Compared with control groups, both men and women who watched weekly pornographic films later reported that they are less satisfied with their partners' affection, appearance, sexual curiosity, and sexual performances. They also sex with less emotional involvement and showed greater acceptance of premarital and extramarital sex. They placed less values on monogamy and marriage. Teenagers who have watched a whole day of talk shows discussing about sexual topics later overestimated the frequency of such behaviors.\n\nDifferent people have different reactions to sexual content in the media. Men are more likely to be aroused by the sexual content than women. Gettleman argued that men are main consumers of sex videos, with an estimated 71 of sex videos consumed by men by themselves. It does not mean that men are more interested in sex videos than women. Women have been found to be more interested in written and directed by women and for women, while men appear to be more interested in seek out sexual media and be aroused by it. Malamuth and Check found that men, not women, were as aroused by a rape scene as by a consenting sex scene but only if the victim was portrayed as enjoying the rape and coming to orgasm. The men were not aroused if the victim was shown to be terrorized.\n\nPersonality can also be an indicator of individuals' different reactions to sexual content. Bushman, Bonacci, van Dijk, and Baumeister found that narcissistic men will be more likely to enjoy the rape scene preceded by affection between the parties than low narcissists did. Borgaert's study considered intelligence is a mediator between personality and arousal attitudes. Men, who have lower intelligence and higher aggressive/antisocial inclinations, are more likely to prefer violent sexual stimuli than men higher in intelligence and lower in aggressive/antisocial tendencies.\n\nBryant and Zillmann concluded that potential behavioral effects of violent sexual media content include: catharsis, disinhibition, imitation, and desensitization.\n\nCatharsis holds that \"vicariously participating in others' fictionalized hostility or aggression enables drama watchers, readers, or listeners to be purged of their anger and hostility and there by become less aggressive.\" This popular idea comes directly from psychodynamic models of personality. The Catharsis effect has been applied to support loosening restrictions on pornography and it has also been reported by sex offenders as a strategy for reducing impulses for committing an offense. However, very few empirical studies support the catharsis effect.\n\nDisinhibition is that after being repetitive exposed to sexual materials may undermine learned social sanctions against using violence that usually inhibit aggressive behaviors. People may become more aggressive after watching, reading or listening to media violence because they may tend to legitimize using violence in real life. A dozen experimental investigations have explored the disinhibition effects and provided support for this hypothesis.\n\nImitation is explained in terms of social learning theory, which argues that \"humans have evolved an advanced capacity for observational learning that enables them to expand their knowledge and skills on the basis of information conveyed by modeling influences\". Social learning explains how observers match the performances of models. Four things must happen before imitation: The first is attentional process, which people must have seen, read, listened to sexual materials. The second is retention process, which people can retain some memories of what they have seen, read and listened to. The third is production process, which the learner must have the capabilities to replicate the action. The fourth is motivational process, which people must have sufficient desire or will to perform what the violent behavior. Only when all of these four conditions were met, people imitate the performances of actors.\n\nThe desensitization effects have been touted by some researchers. The desensitization hypothesis argues that the repeated exposure to sexual violent materials can result in less emotional responsiveness to violence in fiction, news, and reality fare, which could in turn result in an increased acceptance of violent behaviors. However, this notion was touted a lot and limited research evidence available supports disinhibition effects.\n\nHarris and Barlett concluded that a few studies have developed extensive pre-exposure training and/or post-exposure debriefing procedures to lessen the desensitizing effects. Linz found that by offering pertinent educational information about rape myths reduced the effect of desensitization, which means experimental participation can also help reduce the rape myth acceptance. Wilson, Linz, Donnerstein, and Stipp conducted a field experiment, they found that men who are older than 50 had preexisting attitudes reinforced and actually blamed women for rape after seeing the film. In other words, preexisting attitudes and personal experience should be considered when conducting research studies.\n\nAllen, Emmers, Gebhardt, and Giery concluded that experimental studies show positive significant effect between pornography exposure and rape myth acceptance, whereas correlational field studies how a very small effect or nonexistent effect. But the relationship consistently stronger when the sexual materials was violent than it was nonviolent.\n"}

His tendency to create bands with a visual image distinct from the recorded musical performances has led to controversy throughout his career, especially in the case of Milli Vanilli. Farian is also the owner of the record label MCI and several subsidiaries.\n\nFarian started as a trained cook before moving into the music industry. In April 1967, he released \"Will You Ever Be Mine\" under the name \"Frankie Farian\".\n\nIn the early days of his career, he was keen to attain success as a solo artist, but he made little impact on the popular music scene until his song \"Baby Do You Wanna Bump\" (a remake of Prince Buster's song \"Al Capone\" from 1967), released under the pseudonym Boney M., became successful. He also had a minor hit in 1973 with \"Was kann schöner sein\", a German version of \"When You've Gotta Go\" originally by Solomon King, co-written by Lynsey de Paul and Ron Roker. \nShying away from the spotlight, he hired performers to front for public performances. All records were recorded in Offenbach-Bieber, a small town in the center of West Germany. The lead vocals for songs on Boney M. albums in the 1970s were sung by Farian, Marcia Barrett and Liz Mitchell, who quickly became synonymous with the group. Boney M.'s frontman, Bobby Farrell, was only allowed to record vocals in the 1980s (although all four members of the group did sing live for all their concert tours). Bobby Farrell was fired from the group for unreliability in 1981.\n\nFarian also started the supergroup Far Corporation (named after the first syllable of his last name), which featured Steve Lukather, David Paich, Bobby Kimball, Simon Phillips, and Robin McAuley, many of Toto fame. Far Corporation is notable for being the first act to chart with a cover version of Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\", becoming a top 10 hit in the UK, reaching number 8 in October 1985.\n\nIn 1986, Farian produced and mixed the Meat Loaf album \"Blind Before I Stop\". He also sang backing vocals on the first single from the album \"Rock 'n' Roll Mercenaries\", which was credited to Meat Loaf featuring John Parr.\n\nIn 1990, he admitted orchestrating the events which led to the Milli Vanilli scandal, a musical equivalent of ghostwriting. As a producer, he had assembled a group from session musicians, fronting it with visually attractive dancers Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan. The story broke when Farian confirmed to the press that someone else had sung on the records. After these details emerged, Milli Vanilli had their 1990 Grammy Award for Best New Artist withdrawn, and at least 27 different lawsuits were filed in the United States under various U.S. consumer fraud protection laws. Following the Milli Vanilli controversy, Farian went on to develop similar Eurodance groups La Bouche and Le Click.\n\nSome other groups that Farian has been involved with are Eruption (he became a manager in 1977) and No Mercy.\n\nOn 15 August 2006, the musical \"Daddy Cool\" opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London's West End. The line-up included Michelle Collins, Michael Harvey, Javine Hylton, and singer/songwriter Darvina Plante. The £3 million show was produced by Farian and Robert Mackintosh. The story, written by Stephen Plaice with Amani Naphtali, is predominantly based on the songs of Boney M., but also features songs by Milli Vanilli and No Mercy. A second show opened on 23 April 2007 in Berlin, Germany and the show also toured in the Netherlands from August 2011 to February 2012, Spain (Palma de Mallorca) in July 2012, Switzerland from, November 2015 to January 2016 Anniversary tour in Germany 2016.\n\nAlso in 2006, Farian was credited as co-writing a new song, entitled \"Doin' Fine\", with British producers Nathan Thomas and Carl M. Cox. (Other writers involved in this song were, Chris Rudall, Baz Qureshi, Peter Wilson, Chris Richards and George Reyam.) Described as paying tribute to the 'sound' of Boney M., the song was essentially a brand new composition, which featured the string arrangement from Boney M.'s 1976 number one hit, \"Daddy Cool\". The song was recorded by Australian pop singer, Peter Wilson. It was initially released in the UK on 16 April 2007 in its extended format, entitled \"Daddy's Cool 12\" Mix\", charting at number one on the EuroDanceHits EuroNRG Top 40 in May 2007. The original version of \"Doin' Fine\" featured on Peter Wilson's debut album, \"Follow Me\", which was released in the UK on 8 October 2007. The song was also recorded in 2008 by Amanda Lear.\n\nOther acts he collaborated with include Gilla, Eruption, La Mama, Precious Wilson, Gift and Daniel Lopes.\n\nFarian resides in Miami, Florida.\n\n\n"}

Because of the self-published nature of webcomics, the internet has become a successful platform for social commentary, as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) expression.\n\nA 2015 study by David Harper concluded that webcomics were vastly more popular format to female, transgender, and non-binary comic artists than for men. More than 40% of the women, transgender, and non-binary comic artists reported to work primarily in webcomics in this study, while only 15% of men did. Harper suggested that this may be because the self-published nature of webcomics form a lower barrier to entry, while traditional mediums such as comic books are gatekept by cisgender men, though he also suggested that this disparity may just be a difference in interest between the groups.\n\nAccording to a study by Erik Melander in 2005, at least 25% of webcomic creators were female. This percentage was significantly larger than the number of successful women creating print comics at the time, and the number may have been even higher, as a certain percentage of contributors were unknown. In 2015, 63% of the top 30 comic creators on webcomic conglomerate Tapastic were female. In 2016, 42% of the webcomic creators on Line Webtoon were female, as was 50% of its 6 million active daily readers.\n\n\"Girls with Slingshots\" creator Danielle Corsetto stated that webcomics are probably a female dominated field because there is no need to go through an established publisher. Noelle Stevenson, creator of \"Nimona\" and \"Lumberjanes\", noticed that webcomics predominantly feature female protagonists, possibly to \"balance out\" the content of mainstream media. Corsetto noted that she has never encountered sexism during her career, though Stevenson described some negative experiences with Reddit and 4Chan, websites outside of her usual channels.\n\nOliver Sava of \"The A.V. Club\" pointed out in 2016 that there exists a growing community of black women cartoonists creating webcomics.\n\nIn India, where rape of women has been a big issue in the 2010s, Indian webcomics formed a platform for artists to poke fun at patriarchy, feminism, and various other gender-related topics. According to human rights activist and webcomic creator Rachita Taneja, humor aids in communicating complex subjects to large groups of people, and the inclusiveness of webcomics makes it an excellent medium for said communication.\n\nGirlamatic was a subscriber-based webcomic site founded by Joey Manley in 2003. The website's purpose was to syndicate webcomics created primarily by women and marketed primarily to women. Girlamatic included webcomics created by various well-known female webcomic artists, including Shaenon Garrity and Lea Hernandez. The syndicate had won various Lulu awards for being among the \"most women-friendly and reader- friendly work in comics.\" Writing for \"Comixpedia\", Eric Burns voiced his worries that initiatives like Girlamatic section off and divide the webcomic community, making it \"less\" likely for male readers to come across the works of female webcartoonists.\n\nThere exist a large amount of openly gay and lesbian comic creators that self-publish their work on the internet. These include amateur works, as well as more \"mainstream\" works, such as \"Kyle's Bed & Breakfast\". According to Andrew Wheeler from \"Comics Alliance\", webcomics \"provide a platform to so many queer voices that might otherwise go undiscovered,\" and Tash Wolfe of \"The Mary Sue\" has a similar outlook on transgender artists and themes.\n\n"}

{"id": "78135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78135", "title": "Jester", "text": "Jester\n\nA jester, court jester, or fool, was historically an entertainer during the medieval and Renaissance eras who was a member of the household of a nobleman or a monarch employed to entertain him and his guests. A jester was also an itinerant performer who entertained common folk at fairs and markets. Jesters are also modern-day entertainers who resemble their historical counterparts.\n\nJesters in medieval times are often thought to have worn brightly coloured clothes and eccentric hats in a motley pattern and their modern counterparts usually mimic this costume. Jesters entertained with a wide variety of skills: principal among them were song, music, and storytelling, but many also employed acrobatics, juggling, telling jokes, and magic tricks. Much of the entertainment was performed in a comic style and many jesters made contemporary jokes in word or song about people or events well known to their audiences.\n\nThe modern use of the English word \"jester\" did not come into use until the mid-16th century, during Tudor times. This modern term derives from the older form \"gestour\", or \"jestour\", originally from Anglo-Norman (French) meaning \"story-teller\" or \"minstrel\". Other earlier terms included \"fol\", \"disour\", and \"bourder\". These terms described entertainers who differed in their skills and performances but who all shared many similarities in their role as comedic performers for their audiences.\n\nEarly jesters were popular in Ancient Egypt, and entertained Egyptian pharaohs. The ancient Romans had a tradition of professional jesters, called \"balatrones\". Balatrones were paid for their jests, and the tables of the wealthy were generally open to them for the sake of the amusement they afforded. Jesters were popular with the Aztec people in the 14th to 16th centuries.\n\nMany royal courts throughout English royal history employed entertainers and most had professional fools, sometimes called \"licensed fools\". Entertainment included music, storytelling, and physical comedy. It has also been suggested they performed acrobatics and juggling.\n\nHenry VIII of England employed a jester named Will Sommers.\n\nDuring the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I of England, William Shakespeare wrote his plays and performed with his theatre company the Lord Chamberlain's Men (later called the King's Men). Clowns and jesters were featured in Shakespeare's plays, and the company's expert on jesting was Robert Armin, author of the book \"Fooled upon Foole\". In Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\", Feste the jester is described as \"wise enough to play the fool\".\nKing James VI of Scotland employed a jester called Archibald Armstrong. During his lifetime Armstrong was given great honours at court. He was eventually thrown out of the King's employment when he over-reached and insulted too many influential people. Even after his disgrace, books telling of his jests were sold in London streets. He held some influence at court still in the reign of Charles I and estates of land in Ireland. Charles later employed a jester called Jeffrey Hudson who was very popular and loyal. Jeffrey Hudson had the title of \"Royal Dwarf\" because he was short of stature. One of his jests was to be presented hidden in a giant pie from which he would leap out. Hudson fought on the Royalist side in the English Civil War. A third jester associated with Charles I was called Muckle John.\n\nScholar David Carlyon has cast doubt on the \"daring political jester\", calling historical tales \"apocryphal\", and concluding that \"popular culture embraces a sentimental image of the clown; writers reproduce that sentimentality in the jester, and academics in the Trickster\", but it \"falters as analysis\".\n\nJesters could also give bad news to the King that no one else would dare deliver. In 1340, when the French fleet was destroyed at the Battle of Sluys by the English. Phillippe VI's jester told him the English sailors \"don't even have the guts to jump into the water like our brave French\".\n\nAfter the Restoration, Charles II did not reinstate the tradition of the court jester, but he did greatly patronize the theatre and proto-music hall entertainments, especially favouring the work of Thomas Killigrew. Though Killigrew was not officially a jester, Samuel Pepys in his famous diary does call Killigrew \"The King's fool and jester, with the power to mock and revile even the most prominent without penalty\" (12 February 1668). The last British nobles to keep jesters were the Queen Mother's family, the Bowes-Lyons.\n\nIn the 18th century, jesters had died out except in Russia, Spain and Germany. In France and Italy, travelling groups of jesters performed plays featuring stylized characters in a form of theatre called the \"commedia dell'arte\". A version of this passed into British folk tradition in the form of a puppet show, \"Punch and Judy\". In France the tradition of the court jester ended with the French Revolution.\n\nIn 1968, the Canada Council awarded a $3,500 grant to Joachim Foikis of Vancouver \"to revive the ancient and time-honoured tradition of town fool\". In the 21st century, the jester is still seen at medieval-style fairs and pageants.\n\nIn 2015, the town of Conwy in North Wales appointed Russel Erwood (aka Erwyd le Fol) as the official resident jester of the town and its people, a post that had been vacant since 1295.\n\nPoland's most famous court jester was Stańczyk, whose jokes were usually related to political matters, and who later became a historical symbol for Poles.\n\nIn 2004 English Heritage appointed Nigel Roder (\"Kester the Jester\") as the State Jester for England, the first since Muckle John 355 years previously. However, following an objection by the National Guild of Jesters, English Heritage accepted they were not authorised to grant such a title. Roder was succeeded as \"Heritage Jester\" by Pete Cooper (\"Peterkin the Fool\").\n\nIn Germany, Till Eulenspiegel is a folkloric hero dating back to medieval times and ruling each year over Fasching or Carnival time, mocking politicians and public figures of power and authority with political satire like a modern-day court jester. He holds a mirror to make us aware of our times (Zeitgeist), and his sceptre, his \"bauble\" or marotte, is the symbol of his power.\nIn 17th century Spain, little people, often with deformities, were employed as buffoons to entertain the king and his family, especially the children. In Velázquez's painting Las Meninas two dwarfs are included: Mari Bárbola a female dwarf from Germany with hydrocephalus, and from Italy. Mari Bárbola can also be seen in a later portrait of princess Margarita Teresa in mourning by Juan Bautista Martinez del Mazo. There are other paintings by Velázquez that include court dwarves such as Prince Balthasar Charles With a Dwarf.\n\nIn Japan from the 13th to 18th centuries, the \"taikomochi\", a kind of male geisha, attended the feudal lords (\"daimyōs\"). They entertained mostly through dancing and storytelling, and were at times counted on for strategic advice. By the 16th century they fought alongside their lord in battle in addition to their other duties.\n\nTonga was the first royal court to appoint a court jester in the 20th century; Taufa'ahau Tupou IV, the King of Tonga, appointed JD Bogdanoff to that role in 1999. Bogdanoff was later embroiled in a financial scandal.\n\nThe root of the word \"fool\" is from the Latin \"follis\", which means \"bag of wind\" or bellows or that which contains air or breath.\n\nIn Tarot, \"The Fool\" is a card of the Major Arcana. The tarot depiction of the Fool includes a man (or less often, a woman) juggling unconcernedly or otherwise distracted, often with a dog or cat at his heels. The fool is in the act of unknowingly walking off the edge of a cliff, precipice or other high place. (compare: Joker (playing card)).\n\nIn literature, the jester is symbolic of common sense and of honesty, notably in \"King Lear\", where the court jester is a character used for insight and advice on the part of the monarch, taking advantage of his license to mock and speak freely to dispense frank observations and highlight the folly of his monarch. This presents a clashing irony as a greater man could dispense the same advice and find himself being detained in the dungeons or even executed. Only as the lowliest member of the court can the jester be the monarch's most useful adviser.\n\nAuthor Alan Gordon also writes about jesters as advisers to the king, who actually make up a super-secret spy ring that try to keep peace and control the leaders of different countries. The Fool's Guild of these novels is portrayed as a mockery to the church, and they refer to Jesus Christ as \"Their Savior, The First Fool\".\n\nThe Shakespearean fool is a recurring character type in the works of William Shakespeare.\n\nShakespearean fools are usually clever peasants or commoners that use their wits to outdo people of higher social standing. In this sense, they are very similar to the real fools, and jesters of the time, but their characteristics are greatly heightened for theatrical effect. The \"groundlings\" (theatre-goers who were too poor to pay for seats and thus stood on the 'ground' in the front by the stage) that frequented the Globe Theatre were more likely to be drawn to these Shakespearean fools. However they were also favoured by the nobility. Most notably, Queen Elizabeth I was a great admirer of the popular actor who portrayed fools, Richard Tarlton. For Shakespeare himself, however, actor Robert Armin may have proved vital to the cultivation of the fool character in his many plays.\n\nIn a similar vein, a buffoon is someone who provides amusement through inappropriate appearance or behavior.\n\nOriginally the term was used to describe a ridiculous but amusing person. The term is now frequently used in a derogatory sense to describe someone considered foolish, or someone displaying inappropriately vulgar, bumbling or ridiculous behavior that is a source of general amusement.\n\nThe term originates from the old Italian \"buffare\", meaning to puff out one's cheeks that also applies to bouffon.\n\nToday, the jester is portrayed in different formats of medieval reenactment and entertainment, including film, stage performance, and carnival. During the Burgundian and the Rhenish carnival, cabaret performances in local dialect are held. In Brabant this person is called a \"tonpraoter\" or \"sauwelaar\", and is actually in or on a barrel. In Limburg they are named \"buuttereedner\" or \"buutteredner\" and in Zeeland they are called an \"ouwoer\". They all perform a cabaret speech in dialect, during which many current issues are reviewed. Often there are local situations and celebrities from local and regional politics who are mocked, ridiculed and insulted. The \"Tonpraoter\" or \"Buuttereedner\" may be considered successors of the jesters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The second season's opening theme is \"Tomorrow\" by Machico, and the ending theme is by Amamiya, Takahashi, and Kayano. A second OVA was bundled with the twelfth volume of \"KonoSuba\" in July 2017.

In a review of the first novel, Andy Hanley praised the series' comedy reflected in the \"tired genre\" as well as its cast finding them appealing based on their traits. However, Hanley criticized the short length of the first volume. The series won BookWalker's 2016 Grand Prix Award.\n\nLike its light novel counterpart, the anime has received positive reception for its comedy, parody of the \"trapped in a fantasy world\" subgenre, and faithful adaptation of the light novels. Reviewing the first few episodes, Anime News Network (ANN)'s Theron Martin described the second episode as \"the funniest episode of anime I have seen since \"Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun\" aired\", while also praising the series' musical score. The voice acting has also been a subject of praise; Nick Creamer of ANN commended Sora Amamiya and Rie Takahashi's roles as Aqua and Megumin for the energy provided in their performances, while Martin applauded Jun Fukushima for his work in voicing Kazuma, considering his dry tone an additional factor in the show's humor.\n\nIn contrast, a common criticism of the anime was its inconsistent character animation, one that was described as \"low budget\" as characters appeared off-model. Koichi Kikuta responded by stating such design was intentional, hoping to \"bring out the individuality of each character\" rather than the prettier artwork in the light novels; to do this, Kikuta's animation displayed \"their more human sides, like their unflattering traits and their distressed moments.\" Crunchyroll's Kim Morrissy considered the animation to be humorous, especially fitting in a comedic anime. Kotaku writer Richard Eisenbeis explained much of the series' humor derives from the deconstruction of Kazuma's hopes of becoming the hero of a fantasy world, instead realizing he is forced to struggle his way through the world. Comparing Kazuma's problems in a fantasy world to those in real life, Creamer wrote about a sense of relatability between the series' protagonists and the audience, as the party deals with issues like debt and taking questionable jobs because of high pay. On a critical note, Creamer disapproved of Kazuma's negative attitude, which he felt harmed the comedy in the series.\n\n\"KonoSuba\" characters, especially those in Kazuma's party, have gained favorable thoughts in the anime community. Creamer described the group as possessing a \"strange but endearing chemistry,\" as the members are unfriendly with one another, yet are close. Morrissy added the party's \"emotional bond is also evident in the ways they interact with each other. My favorite thing about the anime is that it takes the time to draw these nuances out onscreen and express them with visual flair.\" Megumin in particular has been considered one of the series' most popular characters, winning Sneaker Bunko's official Favorite \"KonoSuba\" Character poll. She was also the sixth-highest vote in \"Newtype\" 2015–16 Awards for Best Female Character (Kazuma was third in the male category) and received the most \"Other\" votes in the Best Girl category in Crunchyroll's Anime Awards 2016. In an interview with internet personality The Anime Man, Natsume Akatsuki described Megumin as giving off \"a pure and elegant atmosphere\" like one of an anime heroine or waifu, hence her popularity among fans.\n\nIn 2016, the anime was voted the tenth-best TV anime in the \"Newtype\" 2015–16 Awards. \"KonoSuba\" also finished runner-up for Best Comedy in the Anime Awards 2016 to \"Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto\".\n\n\n"}

The most common format of a lightning round is in a question-and-answer game, to answer as many questions as possible within a given time limit. The term \"lightning round\" is usually reserved for a single round in a game whose normal gameplay is untimed. Lightning rounds are often used at quiz bowls.\n\nIn television, a lightning round is usually accompanied by an indicator of the time remaining, and is commonly presented with some increase of intensity, such as a change of lighting, or sound effect (such as a ticking clock), or musical cue. The game show \"Password\", while not the first to employ such a round, was the first to formally call it the \"Lightning Round\".\n\nThe term was also famously used in the \"Friends\" episode \"The One With the Embryos\".\n"}

{"id": "61082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61082", "title": "MacGuffin", "text": "MacGuffin\n\nIn fiction, a MacGuffin (sometimes McGuffin) is a plot device in the form of some goal, desired object, or another motivator that the protagonist pursues, often with little or no narrative explanation. The MacGuffin's importance to the plot is not the object itself, but rather its effect on the characters and their motivations.\n\nThe MacGuffin technique is common in films, especially thrillers. Usually, the MacGuffin is revealed in the first act, and thereafter declines in importance. It may reappear at the climax of the story but sometimes is actually forgotten by the end of the story. Multiple MacGuffins are sometimes derisively identified as plot coupons.\n\nThe use of a MacGuffin as a plot device predates the name \"MacGuffin\". The Holy Grail of Arthurian Legend has been cited as an example of an early MacGuffin, as the desired object that serves to advance the plot. The World War I–era actress Pearl White used \"weenie\" to identify whatever object (a roll of film, a rare coin, expensive diamonds, etc.) impelled the heroes, and often the villains as well, to pursue each other through the convoluted plots of \"The Perils of Pauline\" and the other silent film serials in which she starred. In the 1929 detective novel \"The Maltese Falcon\", a small statuette provides both the book's eponymous title and its motive for intrigue.\n\nThe name \"MacGuffin\" was coined by the English screenwriter Angus MacPhail and was popularized by Alfred Hitchcock in the 1930s.\n\nThe director and producer Alfred Hitchcock popularized the term \"MacGuffin\" and the technique with his 1935 film \"The 39 Steps\", an early example of the concept. Hitchcock explained the term \"MacGuffin\" in a 1939 lecture at Columbia University in New York:\n\nIt might be a Scottish name, taken from a story about two men on a train. One man says, 'What's that package up there in the baggage rack?' And the other answers, 'Oh, that's a MacGuffin'. The first one asks, 'What's a MacGuffin?' 'Well,' the other man says, 'it's an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands.' The first man says, 'But there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands,' and the other one answers, 'Well then, that's no MacGuffin!' So you see that a MacGuffin is actually nothing at all.\n\nInterviewed in 1966 by François Truffaut, Hitchcock explained the term \"MacGuffin\" using the same story.\n\nHitchcock also said, \"The MacGuffin is the thing that the spies are after but the audience don't care.\"\n\nHitchcock's term \"MacGuffin\" helped him to assert that his films were in fact not what they appeared to be on the surface. Hitchcock also related this anecdote in a television interview for Richard Schickel's documentary \"The Men Who Made the Movies\", and in an interview with Dick Cavett.\n\nThe screenwriter Angus MacPhail, a friend of Hitchcock's, may have originally coined the term, according to the author Ken Mogg.\n\nOn the commentary soundtrack to the 2004 DVD release of \"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\", writer and director George Lucas describes R2-D2 as \"the main driving force of the movie ... what you say in the movie business is the MacGuffin ... the object of everybody's search\". In TV interviews, Hitchcock defined a MacGuffin as the object around which the plot revolves, but as to what that object \"specifically\" is, he declared, \"The audience don't care\". In contrast, Lucas believes that the MacGuffin should be powerful and that \"the audience should care about it almost as much as the dueling heroes and villains on screen\".\n\nFor the filmmaker and drama writing theorist Yves Lavandier, in the strictly Hitchcockian sense, a MacGuffin is a secret that motivates the villains. \"North by Northwest\"s supposed MacGuffin is nothing that motivates the protagonist; Roger Thornhill's objective is to extricate himself from the predicament that the mistaken identity has created, and what matters to Vandamm and the Central Intelligence Agency is of little importance to Thornhill. A similar lack of motivating power applies to the alleged MacGuffins of \"The Lady Vanishes\", \"The 39 Steps\", and \"Foreign Correspondent\". In a broader sense, says Lavandier, a MacGuffin denotes any justification for the external conflictual premises of a work.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock popularized the use of the MacGuffin technique. Examples from Hitchcock's films include plans for a silent plane engine in \"The 39 Steps\", radioactive uranium ore in \"Notorious\", and a clause from a secret peace treaty in \"Foreign Correspondent\". Many other films have also deployed this technique; for example, the Maltese Falcon in the 1941 film of the same name, the meaning of \"Rosebud\" in \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), the Heart of the Ocean necklace in 1997's \"Titanic\", the letters of transit in \"Casablanca\" (1942 film), and the \"Rabbit's Foot\" in \"\" (2006).\n\nTo emphasize how the nature of the MacGuffin is not important, in the film \"Ronin\" (1998) the MacGuffin is a metallic briefcase whose contents are never revealed. A similar example is the briefcase shown throughout \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994), in which the glowing contents of the briefcase are never revealed, despite being violently coveted by many major characters.\n\nIn discussing the mixed critical reception of \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" (2008), the primary criticism was that the crystal skull in the film was seen as an unsatisfying MacGuffin. The director Steven Spielberg said, \"I sympathize with people who didn't like the MacGuffin because I never liked the MacGuffin.\"\n\nIn both film and literature, the Holy Grail is often used as a MacGuffin. The 1975 cult classic comedic film \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" is structured around a knightly quest for the sacred relic.\n\nExamples in television include various Rambaldi artifacts in \"Alias\", the orb in \"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.\", and Krieger Waves in the \"\" episode \"A Matter of Perspective\". Carl Macek created protoculture as a MacGuffin to unite the storylines of the three separate anime that composed \"Robotech\". The Hellmouth in \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" has been described as a kind of topological MacGuffin: \"a shortcut, in lieu of scientific explanation,\" as Joss Whedon put it.\n\nExamples in literature include the television set in Wu Ming's novel \"54\" and the container in William Gibson's \"Spook Country\".\n\nIn the online game \"The Kingdom of Loathing\", the player's character must eventually complete a long and convoluted quest named \"player name and The Quest for the Holy MacGuffin\". It involves going to several locations while following clues from the character's father's diary and collecting various items.

(franchise)\n\nMonsters, Inc. is a CGI animated film series and Disney media franchise that began with the 2001 film, \"Monsters, Inc.\", produced by Pixar and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. The original film was followed by a prequel film, \"Monsters University\", released in 2013.\n\nThe first film introduces the monster world, where monsters enter the human world at night and scare children in order to generate power. When a little girl accidentally enters the monster world, friends Mike and Sulley must find a way to hide her from the authorities and return her to her own world, and in the process learn that not everything they have been led to believe about humans is true. The film surpassed \"Toy Story 2\" and peaked as the second highest-grossing animated film of all time, behind only 1994's \"The Lion King\" at the time. It was one of the first animated films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature but lost to \"Shrek\".\n\nA prequel to the first film, \"Monsters University\" tells Mike and Sulley's backstory. The future friends meet at college and initially do not get along, but end up on the same team in the university's \"Scare Games\", where they and their team of misfits must beat the odds and win the competition, or be expelled from school. As the team struggles, the two learn to work together, and slowly become best friends.\n\nA television series spin-off of \"Monsters, Inc.\" was confirmed in a Disney press release on November 9, 2017 as part of an exclusive series for Walt Disney Studio's upcoming streaming service Disney+.\n\n\"Charades\" is a two-minute promotional short animated film, featuring characters from \"Monsters Inc.\". The short was theatrically released on November 16, 2001 with \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\". The cast consists of John Goodman and Billy Crystal.\n\nIn the short, Sulley is shown playing a game of charades with Mike, but Mike is unable to guess the phrase \"\"Harry Potter\"\". Afterwords, Mike attempts to charade, but a bored Sulley quickly and correctly guesses \"Star Wars\". A bewildered Mike asks how he does it.\n\n\"Party Central\" is a six-minute short animated film, featuring characters from \"Monsters University\". It premiered on August 9, 2013, at the D23 Expo. The short was set to be released theatrically with \"The Good Dinosaur\" in 2014, before the film was pushed back to 2015. Instead, it was theatrically released on March 21, 2014, with \"Muppets Most Wanted\". The short was written and directed by Kelsey Mann, story supervisor on \"Monsters University\". The cast consists of Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Peter Sohn, Julia Sweeney, Charlie Day, Nathan Fillion, Dave Foley, Sean Hayes, Bobby Moynihan, and Joel Murray.\n\nIn the short, the Oozma Kappa fraternity organizes a party, but no one shows up. To solve the problem, they use door stations to steal visitors from the biggest party going on at another fraternity.\n\nThe film series has grossed a total of $1,306,110,769, making the \"Monsters Inc.\" franchise the Ninth highest-grossing animated film franchise.\n\n\"Monsters, Inc.\" ranked 1 at the box office its opening weekend, grossing $62,577,067 in North America alone. The film had a small drop-off of 27.2% over its second weekend, earning another $45,551,028. In its third weekend, the film experienced a larger decline of 50.1%, placing itself in the second position just after \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\". In its fourth weekend, however, there was an increase of 5.9%. Making $24,055,001 that weekend for a combined total of over $562 million. It is the seventh biggest (in US$) fourth weekend ever for a film.\n\n\"Monsters University\" has earned $268,227,670 in North America, and $475,066,843 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $743,294,513. The film earned $136.9 million on its opening weekend worldwide. For unknown reasons, Disney declined to provide a budget for the film, although BoxOffice.com cites a budget of a total of $270 million. \"Entertainment Weekly\" speculated that it was higher than that of \"Brave\" ($185 million), mostly due to high cost of John Goodman and Billy Crystal reprising their roles. Shockya, a subsidiary website of CraveOnline, estimated the budget to be $200 million, on par with \"Toy Story 3\" and \"Cars 2\". \n\nThis is a list of characters from the 2001 film, \"Monsters, Inc.\" and its 2013 prequel, \"Monsters University\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2234191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2234191", "title": "Narrative paradigm", "text": "Narrative paradigm\n\nNarrative paradigm is a communication theory conceptualized by 20th-century communication scholar Walter Fisher. The paradigm claims that all meaningful communication occurs via storytelling or reporting of events. Humans participate as storytellers and observers of narratives. This theory further claims that stories are more persuasive than arguments. Essentially the narrative paradigm helps us to explain how humans are able to understand complex information through narrative.\n\nThe Narrative Paradigm is a theory that suggests that human beings are natural storytellers and that a good story is more convincing than a good argument. Walter Fisher developed this theory as a solution making cohesive arguments. Fisher conceptualized the paradigm as a way to combat issues in the public sphere. The issue was that human beings were unable to make cohesive traditional arguments. At the time, rational world paradigm was the theory used to satisfy public controversies. He believed that stories have the power to include beginning, middle, and end of an argument and that the rational world paradigm fails to be effective in sensemaking.\n\nFisher uses the term paradigm rather than theory, meaning a paradigm is broader than a theory. Fisher stated, \"There is no genre, including technical communication, that is not an episode in the story of life.\"\n\nFisher believed that humans are not rational and proposed that narrative is the basis of communication. According to this viewpoint, people communicate by telling/observing a persuasive story rather than by producing evidence or constructing a logical argument. The narrative paradigm is purportedly all-encompassing, allowing all communication to be looked at as a narrative even though it may not conform to the traditional literary requirements of a narrative. He states:\nStorytelling is one of the first language skills that children develop. It is universal across cultures and time.\n\nWalter Fisher conceptualized the Narrative Paradigm in direct contrast to the Rational World Paradigm. \"Fisher's interest in narrative developed out of his conclusion that the dominant model for explaining human communication—the rational-world paradigm—was inadequate.\" Rational World Paradigm suggest that an argument is most persuasive when it is logical. This theory is based in the teachings of Plato and Aristotle. \nAccording to Aristotle, some statements are superior to others by virtue of their relationship to true knowledge. This view claims that:\n\nNarrative rationality requires coherence and fidelity, which contribute to judgments about reasons.\n\nNarrative coherence is the degree to which a story makes sense. Coherent stories are internally consistent, with sufficient detail, reliable characters, and free of major surprises. The ability to assess coherence is learned and improves with experience. Individuals assess a story's coherence by comparing it with similar stories. The ultimate test of narrative coherence is whether the characters act in a reliable way. If characters show continuity throughout their thoughts, motives and actions, acceptance increases. However, characters behaving uncharacteristically destroys acceptance.\n\nNarrative fidelity is the degree to which a story fits into the observer's prior understanding. Stories with fidelity may influence their beliefs and values.\n\nFisher set five criteria that affect a story's narrative fidelity:\n\nFisher's narrative paradigm offers an alternative to Aristotelian analysis, which dominates the field of rhetorical thinking. Narratives do not require training or expertise to evaluate. Common sense assesses narrative coherence and fidelity. Busselle and Bilandzic distinguish narrative rationality from realism, writing \"It is remarkable that the power of narrative is not diminished by readers’ or viewers’ knowledge that the story is invented. On the contrary, successful stories—those that engage us most—often are both fictional and unrealistic.\"\n\nAlternatively, Foucault claimed that communications systems are formed through the \"savoir\" and \"pouvoir\" (knowledge and power) of the hierarchies that control access to the discourses. Hence, criteria for assessing the \"reliability\" and \"completeness\" of evidence, and whether the pattern of reasoning is sound are not absolutes but defined over time by those in positions of authority. This is particularly significant when the process of reasoning includes values and policy in addition to empirical data.\n\nThe narrative paradigm instead asserts that any individual can judge a story's merits as a basis for belief and action.\n\nNarration affects every aspect of each individual's life in verbal and nonverbal bids for someone to believe or act in a certain way. Even when a message appears abstract—i.e., the language is literal and not figurative—it is narration. This is because it is embedded in the storyteller's ongoing story and it invites observers to assess its value for their own lives.\n\nNarrative rationality and narrative emotion are complementary within a narrative theory. The former considers how effectively the story conveys its meaning, as well as its implications. The latter considers the emotional reactions of the story's observers. Narrative emotion is an emotion felt for the sake of someone, or something, else.\n\nNarrative theory is an assessment framework within various fields of communication. Those who use narrative theory within their research refer to it as a general way of viewing communication. The narrative paradigm is generally considered an interpretative theory of communication. It is an especially useful theory for teaching qualitative research methods.\n\nFisher’s theory has been considered for domains ranging from organizational communication to family interaction, to racism, and to advertising. McNamara proposed that the narrative paradigm can be used with military storytelling to enhance the perception of the United States armed services. Stutts and Barker, of Virginia Commonwealth University, proposed that the Narrative Paradigm can be used to evaluate if a company's brand will be well received by consumers, by determining if the created narrative has coherence and fidelity. Other researchers proposed using the narrative paradigm to evaluate ethical standards in advertising. Roberts used the narrative paradigm as a way to better understand the use of narrative in folklore. Hobart proposed using narrative theory as a way to interpret urban legends and other kinds of hoaxes.\n\nNarrative paradigm is also applicable when assessing multinational working relationships. Global interactions between groups with different backgrounds have the tendency to hinder group progress and building relationships. Over the past two decades, scholars conceptualize diversity in the workplace using several different theories. As companies continue to diversify, businesses look for communication models to help manage the complex structure of human relationships. Narrative paradigm serves as a communication technique that shows companies how the application of a good story could provide benefits in the workforce. Storytelling is a cross-cultural solution that establishes credibility and trust in relationships between workers.\n\nOne example of a study that used narrative theory more directly was conducted by Smith in 1984. Smith looked at the fidelity and coherence of narratives presented as Republican and Democratic Party platforms in the United States and found that despite obvious differences, each party was able to maintain coherence and fidelity by remaining consistent in both structure and overarching party values.\n\nA study claimed that narrative features can be strategically altered by health communicators to affect the reader's identification. It found that similarities between the reader and the narrative's protagonist, but not the narrator's point of view, has a direct impact on the narrative's persuasiveness.\n\nNarrative processing can create or enhance connections between a brand and an audience. Companies and business use stories or brands that suggest a story to produce brand loyalty. Businesses invest heavily in creating a good story through advertising and public relations. In brand development, many marketers focus on defining a brand persona (typical user) before constructing a narrative for that brand. Character traits such as honesty, curiosity, flexibility and determination become embedded in the persona. Commitment to the associated behavioral implications can help the brand maintain consistency with its narrative.\n\nCritics of the narrative paradigm mainly contend that it is not as universally applicable as Fisher suggests. For example, Rowland asserted that it should be applied strictly to communication that fits classic narrative patterns to avoid undermining its credibility.\n\nOther critiques include issues of conservative bias. Kirkwood stated that Fisher's logic of good reasons focuses only on prevailing issues but does not see all the ways that stories can promote social change. In some ways, both Kirkwood and Fisher agree that this observation is more of an extension to the theory than a critique.\n\nStroud considered \"multivalent\" narratives that include seemingly contradictory values or positions that force a reader to reconstruct their meaning, thereby enabling positive judgments of narrative fidelity and the adoption of new values.\n\nSome forms of communication are not narrative in the way that Fisher maintains. Many science fiction and fantasy novels/movies challenge rather than conform to common values.\n\nThe narrative approach does not provide a more democratic structure compared to the one imposed by the rational world paradigm. Nor does it offer a complete alternative to that paradigm.\nThe narrative paradigm gained attention from poststructuralist education theorists for appealing to notions of truth.\n\nThe narrative paradigm incorporates both the pathos and logos form of rhetoric theory. Rhetoric theory was formulated by Aristotle. He defines rhetoric as: the available means of persuasion. It includes two assumptions.\nAristotle divided public speaking into three parts: the speaker, the subject and the audience. He considered the audience the most important, determining the speech’s end and object. Therefore, audience analysis, which is the process of evaluating an audience and its background is essential.\n\nIn the second assumption, Aristotle’s proof refers to the means of persuasion. And these three proof types are Ethos, Pathos and Logos.\nRhetoric theory can be applied in multiple areas, such as in the social/environmental report, Facebook post, etc.\n\nWhen people experience a story, the comprehension phase is where they form a mental representation of the text. Such a mental representation is called a situation model. Situation models are representations of the state of affairs described in a text rather than of the text itself. Much of the research suggests that observers behave as though they are in the story rather than outside of it. This supports Fisher’s model that narrative components supported by good reasons are related to components in situation models.\n\nSituation models represent relevant aspects of the narrative's environment. Objects that are spatially close to observers are generally more relevant than more distant objects. The same holds for situation models. Observers are similarly slower to recognize words denoting objects distant from a protagonist than those close to the protagonist. When observers have extensive knowledge of the spatial layout of the story setting (e.g., a building), they update their representations according to the location and goals of the protagonist. They have the fastest mental access to the room that the protagonist is close to. For example, they can more readily say whether two objects are in the same room if the room mentioned is close to the protagonist. The interpretation of the meaning of a verb denoting the movement of people or objects in space, such as to approach, depends on their situation models. The interpretation of observers also depends on the size of the landmark and the speed of the figure. Observers behave as if they are actually present in the situation.\n\nIn one study observers recognized goals yet to be accomplished by the protagonist more quickly than goals that had just been accomplished. When Keefe and McDaniel presented subjects with sentences such as \"after standing through a 3-hour debate, the tired speaker walked over to his chair (and sat down)\" and then with probe words (e.g., \"sat\"). Subjects took about the same amount of time to name sat when the clause about the speaker sitting down was omitted and when it was included. Moreover, naming times were significantly faster in both of these conditions than in a control condition, in which it was implied that the speaker remained standing.\n\n"}
{"id": "766904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=766904", "title": "Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest", "text": "Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest\n\nThe Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest is an annual American hot dog competitive eating competition. It is held each year on Independence Day at Nathan's Famous Corporation's original, and best-known restaurant at the corner of Surf and Stillwell Avenues in Coney Island, a neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City.\n\nThe contest has gained public attention in recent years due to the stardom of Takeru Kobayashi and Joey Chestnut. The defending men's champion is Joey Chestnut, who ate 74 hot dogs in the 2018 contest. The defending women's champion is Miki Sudo, who ate 37 hot dogs in the 2018 contest.\n\nMajor League Eating (MLE), formerly known as the International Federation of Competitive Eating (IFOCE), has sanctioned the event since 1997. Today, only entrants currently under contract by MLE can compete in the contest.\n\nThe field of about 20 contestants typically includes the following:\n\n\nThe competitors stand on a raised platform behind a long table with drinks and Nathan's Famous hot dogs in buns. Most contestants have water on hand, but other kinds of drinks can and have been used. Condiments are allowed, but usually are not used. The hot dogs are allowed to cool slightly after grilling to prevent possible mouth burns. The contestant that consumes (and keeps down) the most hot dogs and buns (HDB) in ten minutes is declared the winner. The length of the contest has changed over the years, previously 12 minutes, and in some years, only three and a half minutes; since 2008, 10 minutes.\n\nSpectators watch and cheer the eaters on from close proximity. A designated scorekeeper is paired with each contestant, flipping a number board counting each hot dog consumed. Partially eaten hot dogs count and the granularity of measurement is eighths of a length. Hot dogs still in the mouth at the end of regulation count if they are subsequently swallowed. Yellow penalty cards can be issued for \"messy eating,\" and red penalty cards can be issued for \"reversal of fortune\", which results in disqualification. If there is a tie, the contestants go to a 5-hot-dog eat-off to see who can eat that many more quickly. Further ties will result in a sudden-death eat-off of eating one more hot dog in the fastest time.\n\nAfter the winner is declared, a plate showing the number of hot dogs eaten by the winner is brought out for photo opportunities.\n\nThe winner of the men's competition is given possession of the coveted international \"bejeweled\" mustard-yellow belt. The belt is of \"unknown age and value\" according to IFOCE co-founder George Shea and rests in the country of its owner. In 2011, Sonya Thomas won the inaugural women's competition and its \"bejeweled\" pink belt.\n\nVarious other prizes have been awarded over the years. For example, in 2004 Orbitz donated a travel package to the winner. Starting in 2007, cash prizes have been awarded to the top finishers.\n\nThe Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest has been held at the original location on Coney Island most years since about 1972, usually in conjunction with Independence Day. Nathan's promoter Mortimer Matz claimed that on July 4, 1916, four immigrants held a hot dog eating contest at Nathan's Famous stand on Coney Island to settle an argument about who was the most patriotic. He also made the spurious claim that the contest has been held each year since then except 1941 (\"as a protest to the war in Europe\") and 1971 (as a protest to political unrest in the U.S.). A man by the name of Jim Mullen is said to have won the first contest, although accounts vary. One account describes Jimmy Durante (who was \"not\" an immigrant) as competing in that all-immigrant inaugural contest, which was judged by Eddie Cantor and Sophie Tucker. Another describes the event as beginning \"in 1917, and pitted Mae West's father, Jack, against entertainer Eddie Cantor.\"<ref name=\"Crown/Archetype (p. 222)\"></ref> In 2010, however, promoter Mortimer \"Morty\" Matz admitted to having fabricated the legend of the 1916 start date with a man named Max Rosey in the early 1970s as part of a publicity stunt. The legend grew over the years, to the point where \"The New York Times\" and other publications were known to have repeatedly listed 1916 as the inaugural year, although no evidence of the contest exists. As Coney Island is often linked with recreational activities of the summer season, several early contests were held on other holidays associated with summer besides Independence Day; Memorial Day contests were scheduled for 1972, 1975, and 1978, and a second 1972 event was held on Labor Day.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the competition was dominated by Japanese contestants, particularly Takeru Kobayashi, who won six consecutive contests from 2001-2006. In 2001, Kobayashi transformed the competition and the world of competitive eating by downing 50 hot dogs—smashing the previous record of 25.5. The Japanese eater introduced advanced eating and training techniques that shattered previous competitive eating world records. The rise in popularity of the event coincided with the surge in popularity of the worldwide competitive eating circuit.\n\nOn July 4, 2011, Sonya Thomas became the champion of the first Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest for Women. Previously, women and men had competed against each other, except for one all-female Memorial Day competition held in 1975. Eating 40 hot dogs in 10 minutes, Thomas earned the inaugural Pepto-Bismol-sponsored pink belt and won $10,000.\n\nIn recent years, a considerable amount of pomp and circumstance have surrounded the days leading up to the event, which has become an annual spectacle of competitive entertainment. The event is presented on an extravagant stage complete with colorful live announcers and an overall party atmosphere. The day before the contest is a public weigh-in with the mayor of New York City. Some competitors don flamboyant costumes and/or makeup, while others may promote themselves with eating-related nicknames. On the morning of the event, they have a heralded arrival to Coney Island on the \"bus of champions\" and are called to the stage individually during introductions. In 2013, six-time defending champion Joey Chestnut was escorted to the stage in a sedan chair.\n\nThe competition draws many spectators and worldwide press coverage. In 2007, an estimated 50,000 came out to witness the event. In 2004 a three-story-high \"Hot Dog Eating Wall of Fame\" was erected at the site of the annual contest. The wall lists past winners, and has a digital clock which counts down the minutes until the next contest. Despite substantial damage suffered at Nathan's due to Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, the location was repaired, reopened, and the 2013 event was held as scheduled.\n\nESPN has long enjoyed solid ratings from its broadcast of the Hot Dog Eating Contest on Independence Day, and on July 1, 2014, the network announced it had extended its agreement with Major League Eating and will broadcast the contest through 2024. The event continues to be recognized for its power as a marketing tool.\n\nControversies usually revolve around supposed breaches of rules that are missed by the judges. For example, NY1 television news editor Phil Ellison reviewed taped footage of the 1999 contest and thought that Steve Keiner started eating at the count of one, but the judge, Mike DeVito—himself the champion of the 1990, 1993, and 1994 contests—was stationed directly in front of Keiner and disputed it, saying it was incorrect. Keiner ate 21 1/2 dogs, as shown on the Wall of Fame located at Nathan's flagship store at the corner of Surf and Stillwell avenues in Coney Island. This controversy was created by George Shea, the chief publicist for Nathan's, because it created much more publicity for the contest. Shea assured Keiner at the end of the contest that he would clear the confusion up but never did. Keiner never participated in any advertising or contests set up by Shea because of this.\n\nAnother controversy occurred in 2003 when former NFL player William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry competed as a celebrity contestant. Though he had won a qualifier by eating twelve hot dogs, he ate only four at the contest, stopping after just five minutes. Shea stated that the celebrity contestant experiment will likely not be repeated.\n\nAt the 2007 contest, the results were delayed to review whether defending champion Takeru Kobayashi had vomited (also known as a \"Roman method incident\" or \"reversal of fortune\") in the final seconds of regulation. Such an incident results in the disqualification of the competitor under the rules of the IFOCE. The judges ruled in Kobayashi's favor. A similar incident occurred involving Kobayashi in 2002 in a victory over Eric \"Badlands\" Booker.\n\nTakeru Kobayashi has not competed in the contest since 2009 due to his refusal to sign an exclusive contract with Major League Eating, which is the current sanctioning body of the contest. In 2010, he was arrested by police after attempting to jump on the stage after the contest was over and disrupt the proceedings. On August 5, 2010, all charges against Kobayashi were dismissed by a judge in Brooklyn. Despite his six consecutive victories in their annual event, Nathan's removed Kobayashi's image from their \"Wall of Fame\" in 2011. Kobayashi again refused to compete in 2011, but instead conducted his own hot dog eating exhibition, claiming to have consumed 69 HDB, seven more than Joey Chestnut accomplished in the Nathan's contest. The sports website Deadspin deemed Kobayashi's solo appearance \"an improbably perfect 'up yours' to the Nathan's hot dog eating contest.\"\n\n The 1990 competition ended in a tie.\n\nIn 2003, ESPN aired the contest for the first time on a tape-delayed basis. Starting in 2004, ESPN began airing the contest live. Since 2005, Paul Page has been ESPN's play-by-play announcer for the event, accompanied by color commentator Richard Shea. In 2011, the women's competition was carried live on ESPN3, followed by the men's competition on ESPN. In 2012, ESPN signed an extension to carry the event through 2017. In 2014, ESPN signed an agreement to carry the competition on its networks for 10 years until 2024.\n\nThe Nathan's contest has been featured in these documentaries and TV programs:\n\n\nNews sources typically use puns in head-lines and copy referring to the contest, such as \"'Tsunami' is eating contest's top dog again,\" \"couldn't cut the mustard\" (A.P.), \"Nathan's King ready, with relish\" (Daily News) and \"To be frank, Fridge faces a real hot-dog consumer\" (ESPN).\n\nReporter Gersh Kuntzman of the \"New York Post\" has been covering the event since the early 1990s and has been a judge at the competition since 2000. Darren Rovell, of ESPN, has competed in a qualifier.\n\nEach contestant has his or her own eating method. Takeru Kobayashi pioneered the \"Solomon Method\" at his first competition in 2001. The Solomon method consists of breaking each hot dog in half, eating the two halves at once, and then eating the bun.\n\n\"Dunking\" is the most prominent method used today. Because buns absorb water, many contestants dunk the buns in water and squeeze them to make them easier to swallow, and slide down the throat more efficiently.\n\nOther methods used include the \"Carlene Pop,\" where the competitor jumps up and down while eating, to force the food down to the stomach. \"Buns & Roses\" is a similar trick, but the eater sways from side to side instead. \"Juliet-ing\" is a cheating method in which players simply throw the hot dog buns over their shoulders.\n\nContestants train and prepare for the event in different ways. Some fast, others prefer liquid-only diets before the event. Takeru Kobayashi meditates, drinks water and eats cabbage, then fasts before the event. Several contestants, such as Ed \"Cookie\" Jarvis, aim to be \"hungry, but not too hungry\" and have a light breakfast the morning of the event.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "225178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=225178", "title": "Personality rights", "text": "Personality rights\n\nThe right of publicity, often called personality rights, is the right of an individual to control the commercial use of his or her name, image, likeness, or other unequivocal aspects of one's identity. It is generally considered a property right as opposed to a personal right, and as such, the validity of the right of publicity can survive the death of the individual (to varying degrees depending on the jurisdiction).\n\nPersonality rights are generally considered to consist of two types of rights: the right of publicity, or to keep one's image and likeness from being commercially exploited without permission or contractual compensation, which is similar to the use of a trademark; and the right to privacy, or the right to be left alone and not have one's personality represented publicly without permission. In common law jurisdictions, publicity rights fall into the realm of the tort of passing off. United States jurisprudence has substantially extended this right.\n\nA commonly cited justification for this doctrine, from a policy standpoint, is the notion of natural rights and the idea that every individual should have a right to control how, if at all, his or her \"persona\" is commercialized by third parties. Usually, the motivation to engage in such commercialization is to help propel sales or visibility for a product or service, which usually amounts to some form of commercial speech (which in turn receives the lowest level of judicial scrutiny). If an individual violates this right they will have to go through a lawsuit.\n\nIn contrast with common law jurisdictions, most civil law jurisdictions have specific civil code provisions that protect an individual's image, personal data and other generally private information. Exceptions have been carved out of these general, broad privacy rights when dealing with news and public figures. Thus, while it may violate an ordinary citizen's privacy to speak about their medical records, one is generally allowed to report on more intimate details in the lives of celebrities and politicians.\n\nUnlike most common law jurisdictions the personality rights in civil law are generally inheritable, thus one can make a claim against someone who invades the privacy of a deceased relative if the memory of their character is besmirched by such publication.\n\nPersonality rights have developed out of common law concepts of property, trespass and intentional tort. Thus personality rights are, generally speaking, judge-made law, though there are jurisdictions where some aspects of personality rights are statutory. In some jurisdictions, publicity rights and privacy rights are not clearly distinguished, and the term publicity right is generally used. In a publicity rights case the issue to decide is whether a significant section of the public would be misled into believing (incorrectly) that a commercial arrangement had been concluded between a plaintiff and a defendant under which the plaintiff agreed to the advertising involving the image or reputation of a famous person. The actionable misrepresentation requires a suggestion that the plaintiff has endorsed or licensed the defendant's products, or somehow can exercise control over those products. This is done by way of the tort of passing off.\n\nThe meaning of the law is best illustrated by principal cases on the subject.\n\nIn Australia, false association or endorsement is actionable via the law of passing off, not a separate law of \"right of personality\". The \"Henderson\" case was a decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (both the first instance and appellate jurisdiction). The plaintiffs were ballroom dancers and they sued the defendant in passing off alleging it wrongfully published their photograph on the cover of a gramophone record entitled \"Strictly for Dancing: Vol. 1\". An injunction was granted on the ground that the use suggested the plaintiffs recommended or approved of the defendant's goods, or had some connection with the goods.\n\nHowever, in the 1988 case of \"Honey v Australian Airlines\", Gary Honey, a well known Australian athlete failed in his attempt to get a damages award after Australian Airlines used a photograph of him in action on a poster without his permission. The judge held, in essence, that the poster depicted excellence in general rather than a particular person.\n\nThe provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Saskatchewan have enacted privacy legislation dealing with personality rights, which have the following traits:\n\n\nCanadian common law recognizes a limited right to personality. It was first acknowledged in the 1971 Ontario decision of \"Krouse v. Chrysler Canada Ltd.\", where the Court held that where a person has marketable value in their likeness and it has been used in a manner that suggests an endorsement of a product then there is grounds for an action in appropriation of personality. This right was later expanded upon in \"Athans v. Canadian Adventure Camps\" (1977) where the Court held that the personality right included both image and name.\n\nIn \"Gould Estate v. Stoddart Publishing Co. Ltd.\" (1998), the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded that simply writing about somebody, even for the purpose of generating a profit, does not constitute appropriation of personality.\n\nThe general tort of appropriation of personality is still in development, but it is currently being argued that it will be recognized in all common law provinces, with certain characteristics:\n\n\nIn 1994, the new \"Civil Code of Quebec\" introduced new provisions that enshrine the right to privacy as an attribute of personality:\n\nIn \"Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc\", the Supreme Court of Canada also affirmed that under Quebec's \"Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms\" privacy provisions, a photographer can take photographs in public places but may not publish the picture unless permission has been obtained from the subject, except where the subject appears in an incidental manner, or whose professional success depends on public opinion. The relevant provisions of the \"Charter\" are:\n\nTherefore, the following general characteristics may be drawn:\n\n\nIn Cyprus, people depicted in photographs can oppose their use in advertisements and their publication in magazines, even if it was taken in a public place.\n\nIn Denmark, the Danish Penal Code chapters 26 and 27, provides certain personality rights. The governmental Danish Data Protection Agency, has made a declaration regarding publication on the Internet of pictures taken of persons in a public area:\nA portrait photograph is defined as a photograph, with the purpose of depicting one or more specific person(s). The personality rights however may be contracted for persons who are generally accepted as public persons.\n\nIn France personality rights are protected under article 9 of the French civil code. While publicly known facts and images of public figures are not generally protected, use of someone's image or personal history has been held actionable under French law. The most famous case in recent history is perhaps the publication of the book on François Mitterrand called \"Le Grand Secret\" in which Mitterrand's doctor published a book that not only revealed private facts about Mitterrand's life, but also revealed medical confidences protected by doctor–patient privilege.\n\nIn Germany personality rights are protected under the German civil code, where the concept of an \"absolute person of contemporary history\" allows the depiction of individuals who are part of history but still gives them some protection of their rights of privacy outside the public sphere. A succinct statement of the German law can be found in the following judicial statement from the \"Marlene Dietrich case\":\n\nThe relevant Greek laws include 57 AK and 2472/1997. As regarding photography:\n\nThe relevant Guernsey law was enacted on 3 December 2012 under the name of Image Rights Bailiwick of Guernsey Ordinance 2012 and allows for the registration of a personality right, together with images associated with that personality. Images are widely defined and can be any number of personal attributes, such as likeness, mannerisms, gestures, voice, nickname etc.\n\nPersonalities able to register fall into 5 categories, namely sole, joint, group, legal and fictional character. In addition, humans can be registered up to 100 years after the date of death, making the law very favourable for estate managers and trustees.\n\nIn Hong Kong, as in most other common law jurisdictions, there is no separate \"personality right\", and false association or endorsement is actionable under the law of passing off. The main case on this point relates to Cantopop singer/actor Andy Lau and Hang Seng Bank over the allegedly unauthorized use of Lau's image on credit cards, which has led to the observation that only limited personality rights exist in this jurisdiction.\n\nIn a 1994 case involving the estate of Bob Marley, the Supreme Court of Jamaica acknowledged a property right of personality which survived his death.\n\nWhile personality rights are said to exist to some extent by a Korean attorney, cases filed to enforce such rights against shopping malls have been unsuccessful.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, rights of personality are established by statute.\nAccording to article 99 and 100 of the General Principle of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China, the right of name and the right of image are protected. It is prohibited to use another's image for commercial use without that person's consent.\nIn the new Tort Liabilities Law, the right of privacy is mentioned for the first time in the legislation.\n\nIn South Africa personality rights are protected under the South African law of delict and the Bill of Rights, which also provides for freedom of expression and freedom of association. After much uncertainty concerning the recognition of image rights in South Africa, the Supreme Court of Appeal provided clarity in the landmark case of \"Grütter v Lombard\". In South Africa, a person's right to identity is violated if the attributes of that person is used without permission in a way which cannot be reconciled with the true image of that person. Apart from the unauthorized use of a person's image, this kind of infringement also entails some kind of misrepresentation concerning the individual, such as that the individual approves or endorses a particular product or service or that an attorney is a partner in a firm, while this is not the case. Secondly, the right to identity is violated if the attributes of a person is used without authorization by another person for commercial gain. Apart from the unauthorized use of the individual's image, such use also primarily entails a commercial motive which is exclusively aimed at promoting a service or product or to solicit clients or customers. The mere fact that the user may benefit or profit from any product or service in respect of which the individual's attributes have incidentally been used, is not in itself sufficient. This violation of the right to identity therefore also entails unauthorized use of the individual's attributes with a commercial purpose, whether it is done by means of advertisement or the manufacture and distribution of merchandise covered with the attributes of the individual. Personality rights are not absolute and it goes without saying that the use of a person's attributes must be unlawful before a plaintiff will succeed with any claim. With the use of a person's image, the personality rights, privacy, human dignity and freedom of association of the individual must often be weighed against the user's right to freedom of expression. The use of a person’s image can be justified on the grounds of consent, truth and public interest, fair comment and jest.\n\nAccording to the agency (Spanish) Data Protection for the collection and dissemination on Internet of images of a person without their consent may be a serious breach of the Data Protection Act which would be punishable by a minimum fine of 60,000 euros. According to \"El Mundo\" Data Protection Agency decided to investigate ex officio by the mere distribution of the image of a person on the Internet without their consent.\n\nIn the United States, the right of publicity is a state law-based right, as opposed to federal, and recognition of the right can vary from state to state. The rationale underlying the right of publicity in the United States is rooted in both privacy and economic exploitation. The rights are based in tort law, and the four causes of action are: 1) Intrusion upon physical solitude; 2) public disclosure of private facts; 3) depiction in a false light; and 4) appropriation of name and likeness. Typically, but by no means exclusively, the right of publicity is manifest in advertising or merchandise. In states without a specific right of publicity statute, the right of publicity may still be recognized via common law. The right of publicity has evolved rapidly, with a history of reported cases in the United States and worldwide.\n\nBy the broadest definition, the right of publicity is the right of every individual to control any commercial use of his name, image, likeness, or some other identifying aspect of identity, limited (under U.S. law) by the First Amendment. The right of publicity can be referred to as publicity rights or even personality rights. The term \"right of publicity\" was coined by Judge Jerome Frank in 1953.\n\nThe extent of recognition of this right in the U.S. is largely driven by statute or case law. Because the right of publicity is primarily governed by state (as opposed to federal) law, the degree of recognition of the right of publicity varies significantly from one state to the next. The Lanham Act governs federal protection of personality rights, and the doctrine has much in common with the laws defining federal protection of trademarks. In fact, an individual’s identity could be considered their personal “mark”, the misappropriation of which is sufficient to constitute infringement. In addition, both trademark and publicity rights appear to be designed somewhat to combat infringement for the sake of consumers, granting a cause of action for false descriptions, false representations, and false endorsement claims. Just as there is a cause of action for implying a certain brand sponsors a product when it really does not, there is a cause an action if a celebrity’s identity is used to imply endorsement for a product they are not, in actuality, affiliated with. Courts will typically consider eight factors when weighing a false endorsement claim, in order to determine the likelihood of consumer confusion:\n\n\nThese eight factors have their origins in the case \"Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elects.\", but are similarly used by courts to analyze false endorsement claims by celebrities.\n\nIndiana is believed to have the most far-reaching right of publicity statutes in the world, providing recognition of the right for 100 years after death, and protecting not only the usual \"name, image and likeness,\" but also signature, photograph, gestures, distinctive appearances, and mannerisms. There are other notable characteristics of the Indiana law, though most of the major movement in right of publicity emanates from New York and California, with a significant body of case law which suggest two potentially contradictory positions with respect to recognition of the right of publicity.\n\nSome states recognize the right through statute and some others through common law. California has both statutory and common-law strains of authority protecting slightly different forms of the right. The right of publicity is a property right, rather than a tort, and so the right may be transferable to the person's heirs after their death. The Celebrities Rights Act was passed in California in 1985 and it extended the personality rights for a celebrity to 70 years after their death. Previously, the 1979 \"Lugosi v. Universal Pictures\" decision by the California Supreme Court held that Bela Lugosi's personality rights could not pass to his heirs.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "517874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=517874", "title": "Punch line", "text": "Punch line\n\nA punch line (punch-line or punchline) concludes a joke; it is intended to make people laugh. It is the third and final part of the typical joke structure. It follows the introductory framing of the joke and the narrative which sets up for the punch line.\n\nIn a broader sense, punch line can also refer to the unexpected and funny conclusion of any performance, situation or story.\n\nThe origin of the term is unknown. Even though the comedic formula using the classic \"set-up, premise, punch line\" format was well-established in Vaudeville by the beginning of the 20th century, the actual term \"punch line\" is first documented in the 1920s; the Merriam-Webster dictionary pegs the first use in 1921. Some people argue the term's origin is related to the British weekly magazine \"Punch\".\n\nM-Husler was the first person to come with a punch line in 1986.\n\nA linguistic interpretation of the mechanics of the punch line response is posited by Victor Raskin in his Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor. Humor is evoked when a trigger, contained in the punch line, causes the audience to abruptly shift its understanding of the story from the primary (or more obvious) interpretation to a secondary, opposing interpretation. \"The punch line is the pivot on which the joke text turns as it signals the shift between the [semantic] scripts necessary to interpret [re-interpret] the joke text.\" To produce the humor in the verbal joke, the two interpretations (i.e. scripts) need to be both compatible with the joke text \"and\" opposite or incompatible with each other. Thomas R. Shultz, a psychologist, independently expands Raskin’s linguistic theory to include \"two stages of incongruity: perception and resolution.\" He explains that \"… incongruity alone is insufficient to account for the structure of humour. […] Within this framework, humour appreciation is conceptualized as a biphasic sequence involving first the discovery of incongruity followed by a resolution of the incongruity.\" Resolution generates laughter.\n\nThere are many folk theories of how people deliver punchlines, such as punchlines being louder and of a higher pitch than the speech preceding it, and a dramatic pause before the punchline is delivered. In laboratory settings, however, none of these changes are employed at a statistically significant level in the production of humorous narratives. Rather, the pitch and loudness of the punchline are comparable to those of the ending of any narrative, humorous or not.\n\nIn order to better elucidate the structure and function of the punch line it is useful to look at some joke forms which purposely remove or avoid the punch line in their narrative. Shaggy dog stories are long-winded anti-jokes in which the punch line is deliberately anti-climactic. The humor here lies in fooling the audience into expecting a typical joke with a punch line. Instead they listen and listen to nothing funny, and end up themselves as the butt of the joke.\n\nAnother type of anti-joke is the nonsense joke, defined as having \"a surprising or incongruous punch line\" which provides either no resolution at all, or only a partial, unsatisfactory resolution. One example of this is the no soap radio punch line. Here the anticipated resolution to the joke is absent and the audience becomes the butt of the joke.\n\nA joke contains a single story with a single punch line at the end. In the analysis of longer humorous texts, an expanded model is needed to map the narratological structure. With this in mind, the General Theory of Verbal Humor (GTVH) was expanded to include longer humorous texts together with jokes, using the GTVH narrative structure to categorize them. A new term, \"jab line\", was introduced to designate humor within the body of a text, as opposed to the punch line, which is always placed at the end. The jab line is functionally identical to the punch line except it can be positioned anywhere within the text, not just at the end. \"Jab and punch lines are semantically indistinguishable (…), but they differ at a narratological level.\" Additionally, \"jab lines are humorous elements fully integrated in the narrative in which they appear (i.e. they do not disrupt the flow of the narrative, because they either are indispensable to the development of the 'plot' or of the text, or they are not antagonistic to it)\".\n\nUsing the expanded narrative structure of the GTVH and this new terminology of jab lines, literature and humor researchers now have a single theoretical framework with which they can analyze and map any kind of verbal humor, including novels, short stories, TV sitcoms, plays, movies as well as jokes.\n\nFelicitous jokes are often formatted in a style called AAB, where a joke is made up of a set of three, the first two of which share some common attribute, and the third represents a deviation from that attribute. Under these conditions, the third item in the set— the B— is the punchline.\n\nRozin gives the following example as exemplifying this structure:\n\nAccording to this theory, the punchline is always the deviation, and it does not matter how many instances of A occur for there to be a punchline. However, jokes following the AAB structure are consistently rated as being funnier than their AB or AAAB counterparts.\n\n"}
{"id": "156593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=156593", "title": "Puppetry", "text": "Puppetry\n\nPuppetry is a form of theatre or performance that involves the manipulation of puppets – inanimate objects, often resembling some type of human or animal figure, that are animated or manipulated by a human called a puppeteer. Such a performance is also known as a . The puppeteer uses movements of her hands, arms, or control devices such as rods or strings to move the body, head, limbs, and in some cases the mouth and eyes of the puppet. The puppeteer often speaks in the voice of the character of the puppet, and then synchronizes the movements of the puppet's mouth with this spoken part. The actions, gestures and spoken parts acted out by the puppets are typically used in storytelling.\n\nThere are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made of a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use. They can be extremely complex or very simple in their construction. The simplest puppets are finger puppets, which are tiny puppets that fit onto a single finger, and sock puppets, which are formed from a sock and operated by inserting one's hand inside the sock, with the opening and closing of the hand simulating the movement of the puppet's \"mouth\". A hand puppet is controlled by one hand which occupies the interior of the puppet and moves the puppet around (Punch and Judy puppets are familiar examples of hand puppets). A \"live-hand puppet\" is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers for each puppet. Marionettes are suspended and controlled by a number of strings, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer.\n\nPuppetry is a very ancient form of theatre which was first recorded in the 5th century BC in Ancient Greece. Some forms of puppetry may have originated as long ago as 3000 years BC. Puppetry takes many forms, but they all share the process of animating inanimate performing objects to tell a story. Puppetry occurs in almost all human societies where puppets are used for the purpose of entertainment through performance, as sacred objects in rituals, as symbolic effigies in celebrations such as carnivals, and as a catalyst for social and psychological change in transformative arts.\nPuppetry is a very ancient art form, thought to have originated about 4000 years ago. Puppets have been used since the earliest times to animate and communicate the ideas and needs of human societies. Some historians claim that they pre-date actors in theatre. There is evidence that they were used in Egypt as early as 2000 BCE when string-operated figures of wood were manipulated to perform the action of kneading bread. Wire controlled, articulated puppets made of clay and ivory have also been found in Egyptian tombs. Hieroglyphs also describe \"walking statues\" being used in ancient Egyptian religious dramas. Puppetry was practiced in ancient Greece and the oldest written records of puppetry can be found in the works of Herodotus and Xenophon, dating from the 5th century BCE.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa may have inherited some of the puppet traditions of ancient Egypt. Certainly, secret societies in many African ethnic groups still use puppets (and masks) in ritual dramas as well as in their healing and hunting ceremonies. Today, puppetry continues as a popular form, often within a ceremonial context, and as part of a wide range of folk forms including dance, storytelling, and masked performance. In the 2010s throughout rural Africa, puppetry still performs the function of transmitting cultural values and ideas that in large African cities is increasingly undertaken by formal education, books, cinema, and television.\n\nThere is slight evidence for puppetry in the Indus Valley Civilization. Archaeologists have unearthed one terracotta doll with a detachable head capable of manipulation by a string dating to 2500 BC. Another figure is a terracotta monkey which could be manipulated up and down a stick, achieving minimum animation in both cases. The epic \"Mahabharata\", Tamil literature from the Sangam Era, and various literary works dating from the late centuries BC to the early centuries AD, including Ashokan edicts, describe puppets. Works like the \"Natya Shastra\" and the \"Kamasutra\" elaborate on puppetry in some detail.\n\nThe Javanese \"Wayang\" theater was influenced by Indian traditions. Some scholars trace the origin of puppets to India 4000 years ago, where the main character in Sanskrit plays was known as \"Sutradhara\", \"the holder of strings\". \"Wayang\" is a strong tradition of puppetry native of Indonesia, especially in Java & Bali. In Java, wayang kulit, an elaborate form of shadow puppetry is very popular. Javanese rod puppets have a long history and are used to tell fables from Javanese history. Another popular puppetry form in Indonesia is Wayang golek.\n\nChina has a history of puppetry dating back 3000 years, originally in \"pi-yung xi\", the \"theatre of the lantern shadows\", or, as it is more commonly known today, Chinese shadow theatre. By the Song Dynasty (960–1279 AD), puppets played to all social classes including the courts, yet puppeteers, as in Europe, were considered to be from a lower social stratum.\nIn Taiwan, budaixi puppet shows, somewhat similar to the Japanese Bunraku, occur with puppeteers working in the background or underground. Some very experienced puppeteers can manipulate their puppets to perform various stunts, for example, somersaults in the air.\n\nJapan has many forms of puppetry, including the bunraku. Bunraku developed out of Shinto temple rites and gradually became a highly sophisticated form of puppetry. Chikamatsu Monzaemon, considered by many to be Japan's greatest playwright, gave up writing Kabuki plays and focused exclusively on the puppet-only Bunraku plays. Initially consisting of one puppeteer, by 1730 three puppeteers were used to operate each puppet in full view of the audience. The puppeteers, who dressed all in black, would become invisible when standing against a black background, while the torches illuminated only the carved, painted and costumed wooden puppets.\n\nIn Korea, the tradition of puppetry is thought to have come from China. The oldest historical evidence of puppetry in Korea comes from a letter written in 982 A.D. from Choe Seung-roe to the King. In Korean, the word for puppet is \"Kkoktugakshi\". \"Gagsi\" means a \"bride\" or a \"young woman\", which was the most common form the dolls took. A kkoktugakshi puppet play has eight scenes.\n\nThailand has Hun Krabok, a rod puppet theatre which is the most popular form of puppetry.\n\nVietnam developed the art form of water puppetry, that is unique to that country. The puppets are built out of wood and the shows are performed in a waist high pool. A large rod under the water is used by the puppeteers to support and control the puppets. The appearance is created of the puppets moving over water. The origin of this form of puppetry dates back seven hundred years when the rice fields would flood and the villagers would entertain each other, eventually resulting in puppet show competitions between villages. This led to puppet societies becoming secretive and exclusive.\n\nIndia has a long tradition of puppetry. In the ancient Indian epic \"Mahabharata\" there are references to puppets. The Rajasthani Puppet from India is notable and there are many Indian ventriloquists and puppeteers. The first Indian ventriloquist, Professor Y.K. Padhye, introduced this form of puppetry to India in the 1920s and his son, Ramdas Padhye, subsequently popularised ventriloquism and puppetry. Almost all types of puppets are found in India.\n\n\nIndia has a rich and ancient tradition of string puppets or marionettes. Marionettes having jointed limbs controlled by strings allow far greater flexibility and are, therefore, the most articulate of the puppets. Rajasthan, Orissa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are some of the regions where this form of puppetry has flourished. The traditional marionettes of Rajasthan are known as Kathputli. Carved from a single piece of wood, these puppets are like large dolls that are colourfully dressed. The string puppets of Orissa are known as Kundhei. The string puppets of Karnataka are called Gombeyatta. Puppets from Tamil Nadu, known as Bommalattam combine the techniques of both rod and string puppets.\n\n\nIndia has a variety of types and styles of shadow puppets. Shadow puppets are flat figures cut out of leather, which has been treated to make it translucent. Shadow puppets are pressed against the screen with a strong source of light behind it. The manipulation between the light and the screen make silhouettes or colourful shadows, as the case may be, for the viewers who sit in front of the screen. This tradition of shadow puppets survives in Orissa. Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Tholpavakoothu (or Tolpava Koothu) is a tradition of shadow puppetry that is unique to Kerala, India. The shadow theatre of Karnataka is known as Togalu Gombeyatta. These puppets are mostly small in size. The puppets however differ in size according to their social status, for instance, large size for kings and religious characters and smaller size for common people or servants.\n\nRod puppets are an extension of glove-puppets, but often much larger and supported and manipulated by rods from below. This form of puppetry now is found mostly in West Bengal and Orissa. The traditional rod puppet form of West Bengal is known as Putul Nautch. They are carved from wood and follow the various artistic styles of a particular region. The traditional rod puppet of Bihar is known as Yampuri. \nGlove puppets, are also known as sleeve, hand or palm puppets. The head is made of either papier mache, cloth or wood, with two hands emerging from just below the neck. The rest of the figure consists of a long flowing skirt. These puppets are like limp dolls, but in the hands of an able puppeteer, are capable of producing a wide range of movements. The manipulation technique is simple the movements are controlled by the human hand the first finger inserted in the head and the middle finger and the thumb are the two arms of the puppet. With the help of these three fingers, the glove puppet comes alive.\n\nThe tradition of glove puppets in India is popular in Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal and Kerala. In Uttar Pradesh, glove puppet plays usually present social themes, whereas in Orissa such plays are based on stories of Radha and Krishna. In Orissa, the puppeteer plays on the \"dholak\"with one hand and manipulates the puppet with the other. The delivery of the dialogues, the movement of the puppet and the beat of the dholak are well synchronised and create a dramatic atmosphere. In Kerala, the traditional glove puppet play is called Pavakoothu.\n\nAfghanistan has produced a form of puppetry known as buz-baz. During a performance a puppeteer will simultaneously operate a marionette of a markhor while playing a dambura.\n\nMiddle Eastern puppetry, like its other theatre forms, is influenced by the Islamic culture. Karagoz, the Turkish Shadow Theatre, has widely influenced puppetry in the region and it is thought to have passed from China by way of India. Later, it was taken by the Mongols from the Chinese and passed to the Turkish peoples of Central Asia. The art of Shadow Theater was brought to Anatolia by the Turkish people emigrating from Central Asia. Other scholars claim that shadow theater came to Anatolia in the 16th century from Egypt. The advocates of this view claim that shadow theatre found its way into the Ottoman palaces when Yavuz Sultan Selim conquered Egypt in 1517. He saw shadow theatre performed during a party in his honour and he was said to be so impressed with it that he took the puppeteer back to his palace in Istanbul where his 21-year -old son, later Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent, developed an interest in the plays.\n\nIn other areas, the style of shadow puppetry known as \"khayal al-zill\", a metaphor translated as \"shadows of the imagination\" or \"shadow of fancy\", still survives. This is a shadow play with live music, \"the accompaniment of drums, tambourines and flutes...also...\"special effects\" – smoke, fire, thunder, rattles, squeaks, thumps, and whatever else might elicit a laugh or a shudder from his audience\"\n\nIn Iran, puppets are known to have existed much earlier than 1000 AD, but initially only glove and string puppets were popular . Other genres of puppetry emerged during the Qajar era (18th and 19th centuries) as influences from Turkey spread to the region. \"Kheimeh Shab-Bazi\" is a traditional Persian puppet show which is performed in a small chamber by a musical performer and a storyteller called a \"morshed\" or \"naghal\". These shows often take place alongside storytelling in traditional tea and coffee-houses (\"Ghahve-Khane\"). The dialogue takes place between the morshed and the puppets. A recent example of puppetry in Iran is the touring opera \"Rostam and Sohrab\".\n\nAlthough there are few remaining examples of puppets from ancient Greece, historical literature and archaeological findings shows the existence of puppetry. The Greek word translated as \"puppet\" is \"νευρόσπαστος\" (\"nevrospastos\"), which literally means \"drawn by strings, string-pulling\", from \"νεῦρον\" (\"nevron\"), meaning either \"sinew, tendon, muscle, string\", or \"wire\", and \"σπάω\" (\"spaō\"), meaning \"draw, pull\". Aristotle referred to pulling strings to control heads, hands and eyes, shoulders and legs. Plato's work also contains references to puppetry. The \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" were presented using puppetry. The roots of European puppetry probably extend back to the Greek plays with puppets played to the \"common people\" in the 5th century BC. By the 3rd century BC these plays would appear in the Theatre of Dionysus at the Acropolis.\n\nIn ancient Greece and ancient Rome clay dolls, and a few of ivory, dated from around 500 BC, were found in children's tombs. These dolls had articulated arms and legs, and in some cases an iron rod extending up from the tops of their heads. This rod was used to manipulate the doll from above, as it is done today in Sicilian puppetry. A few of these dolls had strings in place of rods. Some researchers believe these ancient figures were simply toys and not puppets, due to their small size.\n\nItaly is considered by many to be the early home of the marionette due to the influence of Roman puppetry. Xenophon and Plutarch refer to them. The Christian church used marionettes to perform morality plays. It is believed that the word marionette originates from the little figures of the Virgin Mary, hence the word \"marionette\" or \"Mary doll. Comedy was introduced to the plays as time went by, and ultimately led to a church edict banning puppetry. Puppeteers responded by setting up stages outside cathedrals and became even more ribald and slapstick. Out of this grew the Italian comedy called Commedia dell'arte. Puppets were used at times in this form of theatre and sometimes Shakespeare's plays were performed using marionettes instead of actors.\n\nIn Sicily, the sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes from the Frankish romantic poems, such as \"The Song of Roland\". These same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. In Sicilian this is called \"Opera dei pupi\", or \"Opera of the puppets\". The \"Opera dei pupi\" and the Sicilian tradition of cantastorie, the word for storyteller, are rooted in the Provençal troubadour tradition, in Sicily during the reign of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the first half of the 13th century.\n\nThe 18th century was a vital period in the development of all Italian theatre, including the marionette theatre. The rod puppet was mainly of lower-class origin, but the marionette theatre was popular in aristocratic circles, as a celebration of the Age of Enlightenment. The effects, and the artful and complex construction of the puppets, the puppet theatres, and the puppet narratives, were all popular, particularly in Venice. In the 19th century, the marionettes of Pietro Radillo became more complex and instead of just the rod and two strings, Radillo's marionettes were controlled by as many as eight strings, which increased control over the individual body parts of the marionettes.\n\nGuignol is the main character in the French puppet show which has come to bear his name. Although often thought of as children's entertainment, Guignol's sharp wit and linguistic verve have always been appreciated by adults as well, as shown by the motto of a prominent Lyon troupe: \"Guignol amuses children… and witty adults\". Laurent Mourguet, Guignol's creator, fell on hard times during the French Revolution, and in 1797 started to practice dentistry, which in those days was simply the pulling of teeth. To attract patients, he started setting up a puppet show in front of his dentist's chair.\nHis first shows featured Polichinelle, a character borrowed from the Italian commedia dell'arte. By 1804 the success was such that he gave up dentistry altogether and became a professional puppeteer, creating his own scenarios drawing on the concerns of his working-class audience and improvising references to the news of the day. He developed characters closer to the daily lives of his Lyon audience, first Gnafron, a wine-loving cobbler, and in 1808 Guignol. Other characters, including Guignol's wife Madelon and the gendarme Flagéolet soon followed, but these are never much more than foils for the two heroes. Guignol's inevitable victory is always the triumph of good over evil.\n\nThe traditional British \"Punch and Judy\" puppetry traces its roots to the 16th century to the Italian commedia dell'arte. The character of \"Punch\" derives from the character Pulcinella, which was Anglicized to \"Punchinello\". He is a manifestation of the Lord of Misrule and Trickster, figures of deep-rooted mythologies. Punch's wife was originally \"Joan\", but later became \"Judy\". In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the familiar \"Punch and Judy\" puppet show which existed in Britain was performed in an easily transportable booth. The British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild in the early 20th century instigated a resurgence of puppetry. Two of the Guild's founders, H. W. Whanslaw and Waldo Lanchester, both worked to promote and develop puppetry with publications of books and literature, mainly focusing on the art of the marionette. Lanchester had a touring theatre and a permanent venue in Malvern, Worcestershire, regularly taking part in the Malvern Festival and attracting the attention of George Bernard Shaw. One of Shaw's last plays, \"Shakes versus Shav\", was written for and first performed in 1949 by the company.\n\nFrom 1957-1969, Gerry Anderson produced many television series starring marionettes, starting with Roberta Leigh's \"The Adventures of Twizzle\" and ending with \"The Secret Service\". Many of these series (the most famous of which was \"Thunderbirds\") employed a technique called Supermarionation, which automatically synchronized the pre-recorded character dialogue to the puppets' mouth movements. Anderson returned to puppetry in 1983 with \"Terrahawks\" and the unaired pilot \"Space Police\" in 1987.\n\nCurrent British puppetry theatres include the Little Angel Theatre in Islington, London, Puppet Theatre Barge in London, Norwich Puppet Theatre, the Harlequin Puppet Theatre, Rhos-on-Sea, Wales, and the Biggar Puppet Theatre, Biggar, Lanarkshire, Scotland. British puppetry now covers a wide range of styles and approaches. Don Austen, a British puppeteer, worked with Jim Henson's Creature Shop, and also worked on a number of feature films. There are also a number of British theatre companies, including Horse and Bamboo Theatre, and Green Ginger, which integrate puppetry into highly visual productions. From 1984 to 1996, puppetry was used as a vehicle for political satire in the British television series \"Spitting Image\". Puppetry has also been influencing mainstream theatre, and several recent productions combine puppetry with live action, including \"Warhorse\", at the Royal National Theatre and \"Madam Butterfly\" at the English National Opera.\n\nMany regional variants of Pulcinella were developed as the character spread across Europe. In the Netherlands it is \"Jan Klaassen\" (and Judy is \"Katrijn\"); in Denmark \"Mester Jackel\"; in Russia \"Petrushka\"; and in Romania \"Vasilache\". In Russia, the Central Puppet Theatre in Moscow and its branches in every part of the country enhanced the reputation of the puppeteer and puppetry in general.\nThere is a long tradition of puppetry in Germany and Austria. Much of it derives from the 16th century tradition of the Italian commedia dell'arte. The German version of the British character of 'Punch' is called Kasperle of Kaspar while Judy is called Grete. In the 18th century, operas were specifically composed for marionette puppets. Gluck, Haydn, de Falla and Respighi all composed adult operas for marionettes.\n\nIn 1855, Count Franz Pocci founded the Munich Marionette Theatre. A German dramatist, poet, painter and composer, Pocci wrote 40 puppet plays for his theatre. Albrecht Roser has made a considerable impact with his marionettes in Stuttgart. His characters \"Clown Gustaf\" and \"Grandmother\" are well-known. \"Grandmother\", while outwardly charming, is savagely humorous in her observations about all aspects of society and the absurdities of life.\n\nIn Lindau, the Lindau Marionette Opera was founded in 2000 by Bernard Leismueller and Ralf Hechelmann. The company performs a large number of operas as well as a marionette ballet, \"Swan Lake\".\n\nIn Augsburg, the historic Augsburg Marionette Theatre was founded in 1943 by Walter Oehmichen. It continues to this day along with an adjoining puppet museum under the grandsons of the founder, Klaus Marschall and Juergen Marschall.\n\nMuch earlier in nearby Salzburg, Austria, the Salzburg Marionette Theatre was founded in 1913 by Professor Anton Aicher and is world-famous. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre still continues the tradition of presenting full-length opera using marionettes in their own purpose built theatre until recently under the direction of Gretl Aicher. It performs mainly operas such as \"Die Fledermaus\" and \"The Magic Flute\" and a small number of ballets such as \"The Nutcracker\". The Salzburg Marionette Theatre productions are aimed for adults although children are of course welcome.\n\nThere is also a marionette theatre at Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna.\n\nMarionette puppet theatre has had a very long history in entertainment in Prague, and elsewhere in the Czech Republic. It can be traced deep into the early part of the Middle Ages. Marionettes first appeared around the time of the Thirty Years' War. The first noted Czech puppeteer was Jan Jiri Brat, who was born in 1724. He was the son of a local carpenter and created his own puppet theatre. Matej Kopecky was the most famous 19th-century Czech puppeteer, and was responsible for communicating the ideas of national awareness.\n\nIn 1920 and 1926 respectively, Josef Skupa created his most famous puppet characters: comical father Spejbl and his rascal son Hurvínek. In 1930, he set up the first modern professional puppet theatre. An important puppet organisation is the National Marionette Theatre in Prague. Its repertoire mainly features a marionette production of Mozart's opera \"Don Giovanni\". The production has period costumes and 18th-century setting. There are numerous other companies, including Buchty a Loutky (\"Cakes and Puppets\"), founded by Marek Bečka. Puppets have been used extensively in animated films since 1946. Jiří Trnka was an acknowledged leader in this area. Miroslav Trejtnar is a master puppeteer and teacher of traditional Czech marionette-making skills.\n\nThroughout this period, puppetry developed separately from the emerging mainstream of actor theatres, and the 'ragged' puppeteers performed outside of theatre buildings at fairs, markets etc. - continuing to be classified along with bandits and gypsies. In the 19th century, puppetry faced competition from other forms of theatre such as vaudeville and music hall, but it adapted to these challenges, for example: by developing stage acts and participating in the new forms of popular theatre, or reinventing itself in other ways and finding audiences at the newly fashionable seaside resorts.\n\nThe Teotihuacan culture (Central Mexico) of 600 AD made figurines with moveable arms and legs as part of their funerary rites. Native Americans also used ceremonial puppets.\nIn 1519, two puppeteers accompanied Hernando Cortez on his first journey to Mexico. Europeans brought their own puppet traditions with them, but gradually distinctive styles, forms and puppet characters developed in North America.\n\nDuring the Depression, folk puppeteers traveled with carnivals, working with their own scripts and with dioramas and marionettes of their own manufacture.\n\nSome advances in 20th-century puppetry have originated in the United States. Marionette puppetry was combined with television as early as the 1940s, with Howdy Doody of the United States being a notable marionette in this field. Bil Baird worked on revitalising marionette theatre and puppetry in the United States. He and his wife, Cora Eisenberg had their own marionette theatre in New York. Ventriloquist, Edgar Bergen also made a major contribution. In the 1960s Peter Schumann's Bread and Puppet Theater developed the political and artistic possibilities of puppet theatre in a distinctive, powerful and immediately recognizable way. At roughly the same time, Jim Henson was creating a type of soft, foam-rubber and cloth puppet which became known collectively as Muppets. Initially, through the children's television show \"Sesame Street\", and later in \"The Muppet Show\" and on film, these inspired many imitators and are today are recognised almost everywhere. Wayland Flowers also made a major contribution to adult puppetry with his satirical puppet, Madame.\n\nSid and Marty Krofft are two of Americas most well known puppeteers and were mainly known for their live action children's TV series in the 60s and 70s namely HR Puffinstuff and Lidsville\n\nPuppets also have been used in the \"Star Wars\" films, notably with the character of Yoda. His voice and manipulation was provided by Frank Oz.\n\nThe Aboriginal peoples of Australia have a long tradition of oral storytelling which goes back many thousands of years. They used masks and other objects to convey deep and meaningful themes about morality and nature. Masks were carved from wood and heavily decorated with paint and feathers.\n\nIn Australia in the 1960s, Peter Scriven founded the Marionette Theatre of Australia and had beautiful marionette productions such as The Tintookies, Little Fella Bindi, The Explorers and The Water Babies. Bilbar Puppet Theatre, established by Barbara Turnbull and her husband Bill Turnbull (puppeteer) toured Australia extensively under the auspices of the Queensland Arts Council in the 1970s and 1980s. Their puppets are now held at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Brisbane. David Poulton toured marionette shows via the Queensland Arts Council along his 'Strings and Things' with his wife Sally for many years from the late 1970s.\n\nDavid Hamilton, one of the last remaining marionette puppeteers in Australia, tours independently and formerly toured under the auspices of the Queensland Arts Council. Comedian and radio broadcaster Jamie Dunn was famous for his Muppet-style character, Agro (puppet) who featured on several Seven Network television programs throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Formally trained in the United States by puppeteers from the Jim Henson Company, Brett Hansen and his Brisbane based Larrikin Puppets company is one of only a few Muppet-style puppeteers actively performing in Australia. Cabaret Puppet Theatre, based in Brisbane's Redlands area, also tours with productions for children and adults. In Melbourne Handspan Theatre 1977-2002 evolved from humble collective beginnings to evolve a design-rich large theatre format dubbed 'Visual Theatre' and became a hot-house for innovative projects and award-winning multimedia collaborations within Australia and around the world.\nA post-graduate course existed at the Victorian College of the Arts, University of Melbourne in the late 1990s. Australian puppeteer Norman Hetherington was famous for his marionette, Mr. Squiggle who featured on an Australian Broadcasting Commission television program for many years from 1 July 1959. The last episode was on 9 July 1999. In every episode he would create several pictures from \"squiggles\" sent in by children from around the country. Richard Bradshaw OAM is another famous Australian puppeteer. He is a past President of UNIMA Australia, former artistic director of the Marionette Theatre Company of Australia and does shadow puppetry and writing in the field.\n\nRod Hull also made a contribution with his puppet Emu. In the 1960s, Hull presented a children's breakfast television programme in Australia. Snuff Puppets is one of Australia's modern puppet theatre troupes. Based in Melbourne, their work is full of wild black humour, political and sexual satire and a hand made visually aesthetic. Snuff Puppets has performed in over 15 countries, including tours to major festivals in Asia, South America and Europe. There is an annual winter festival of puppets at the City of Melbourne's ArtPlay and at Federation Square in Melbourne.\n\nFrom early in the 19th century, puppetry began to inspire artists from the 'high-art' traditions. In 1810, Heinrich von Kleist wrote an essay 'On the Marionette Theatre', admiring the \"lack of self-consciousness\" of the puppet. Puppetry developed throughout the 20th century in a variety of ways. Supported by the parallel development of cinema, television and other filmed media it now reaches a larger audience than ever. Another development, starting at the beginning of the century, was the belief that puppet theatre, despite its popular and folk roots, could speak to adult audiences with an adult, and experimental voice, and reinvigorate the high art tradition of actors' theatre.\n\nSergei Obraztsov explored the concept of \"kukolnost\" ('puppetness'), despite Joseph Stalin's insistence on realism.\nOther pioneers, including Edward Gordon Craig and Erwin Piscator were influenced by puppetry in their crusade to regalvanise the mainstream. Maeterlinck, Shaw, Lorca and others wrote puppet plays, and artists such as Picasso, Jarry, and Léger began to work in theatre. Craig's concept of the \"übermarionette\"—in which the director treats the actors like objects—has been highly influential on contemporary \"object theatre\" and \"physical theatre\". Tadeusz Kantor frequently substituted actors for puppets, or combined the two, and conducted each performance from the edge of the stage, in some ways similar to a puppeteer.\n\nKantor influenced a new formalist generation of directors such as Richard Foreman and Robert Wilson who were concerned with the 'object' in theatrical terms \"putting it on stage and finding different ways of looking at it\" (Foreman). Innovatory puppeteers such as Tony Sarg, Waldo Lanchester, John Wright, Bil Baird, Joan Baixas, Sergei Obratsov, Philipe Genty, Peter Schumann, Dattatreya Aralikatte, Jim Henson, Dadi Pudumjee, and Julie Taymor have also continued to develop the forms and content of puppetry, so that the phrase 'puppet theatre' is no longer limited to traditional forms of marionettes, glove, or rod puppets. Directors and companies like Peter Schumann of Bread and Puppet Theatre, Bob Frith of Horse and Bamboo Theatre, and Sandy Speiler of In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre have also combined mask and puppet theatre where the performer, puppets and objects are integrated within a largely visual theatre world that minimises the use of spoken language.\n\nThe Jim Henson Foundation, founded by puppeteer and Muppet creator Jim Henson, is a philanthropic, charitable organization created to promote and develop puppetry in the United States. It has bestowed 440 grants to innovative puppet theatre artists. Puppetry troupes in the early 21st-century such as HomeGrown Theatre in Boise, Idaho continue the avant garde satirical tradition for millennials.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1603046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1603046", "title": "Residual (entertainment industry)", "text": "Residual (entertainment industry)\n\nResiduals are royalties that are paid to the actors, film or television directors, and others involved in making TV shows and movies in cases of reruns, syndication, DVD release, or online streaming release. Residuals are calculated and administered by industry trade unions like SAG-AFTRA, the Directors Guild of America, and the Writers Guild of America. The word is typically used in the plural form.\n\nTechnological advances gave rise to residual payments, and their evolution can be traced in terms of those technologies.\n\nResiduals were established in U.S. network radio. Live radio programs with nationwide audiences were generally performed either two or three times to account for different time zones between the east and west coasts of the United States. The performers were paid for each performance. After audio \"transcription disc\" technology became widely available in the late 1930s, it was initially used to make recordings to send to radio stations that were not connected to the live network. As sound quality improved, radio networks began using them for time-delaying west coast broadcasts, eventually eliminating the need for multiple performances. The performers were kept on standby and paid for a second performance in case there were technical problems. This established the precedent for residual payments from recorded performances.\n\nIn the early 1950s, a similar transition occurred in television. Initially, most television broadcasts were either live performances or broadcasts of older films originally produced for theaters. Kinescope recordings were made of live east coast performances so they could be broadcast several hours later on the west coast, which also made it possible to broadcast these shows later as many times as they wanted. In 1952, residual payments were extended to these television reruns, thanks in large part to Ronald Reagan, whose first term as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) ran from 1947 to 1952. In 1953, the WGA negotiated residuals for up to five reruns for made-for-TV shows.\n\nThat said, film actors were still not paid residuals for reruns. As Americans increasingly watched TV at home instead of going out to the movies, movie attendance plummeted by over 65% between 1948 and 1959, studios were grappling with decreased revenues, and actors felt like they were being deprived of significant income that was owed to them. The studios, however, took a hardline stance on residuals for movie actors due to their shrinking revenue as well as the fact that if they paid residuals to actors, they would also have to pay directors and screenwriters as well.\n\nThis stalemate led SAG actors to re-elect Ronald Reagan as SAG President in fall of 1959. Reagan asked SAG for a strike authorization in February and the actors agreed on a work-stop date for March 7, 1960, Hollywood's first-ever industry-wide strike. Starting with Universal Pictures, studios ended up agreeing to film residuals, but only for movies made after 1960s. They would issue a one-time payout of $2.25 million for movies made between 1948 and 1960, and movies made before 1948 would not be eligible for any residuals. (Unrelated to residuals, Reagan also secured health insurance and pensions for SAG actors.) This upset older actors like Mickey Rooney, Glenn Ford and Bob Hope, who blamed Reagan and the SAG board for weak negotiating, but in April 1960 SAG voted to accept the offer and returned to work.\n\nIn 1988, WGA launched its longest strike, lasting 22 weeks, over a disagreement over residuals for TV shows broadcast in foreign countries. The new contract allowed writers two formulas for calculating foreign residuals: the existing formula ($4,400 maximum for a one-hour show) or the new formula (1.2% of the producer's foreign sales). On the other hand, domestic residuals were adjusted to take a sliding scale, which would incentivize producers to syndicate one-hour shows, whose revenue performance was poor, to independent TV stations.\n\nIn 2007, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the industry bargaining group that deals with the trade unions, called for an end to the current residual payment system in response to the rise of online media. Instead, it proposed that residuals be pooled so the studios would recoup their costs paying the actors, directors, and writers based on a profit-based formula, which would solve the problem that residuals remain the same despite decreases in TV profits. Writers in the Writers Guild of America (WGA) decided to negotiate for higher residual payments. The AMPTP adamantly opposed extending residuals to online movie and TV show sales for at least three years, citing the need to \"adapt to the realities of the marketplace, the new demands from our audiences and new technologies\", while a WGA representative countered that they \"already had effective business models\".\n\nIn 2011, SAG-AFTRA, WGA, and DGA negotiations kept residuals for network primetime TV (considered \"among the most lucrative\" residuals) frozen at previous levels.\n\nResiduals are administered by the unions—SAG-AFTRA, the Directors Guild of America (DGA), and the Writers Guild of America (WGA)—for their members, who are paid between one and four months after the air date. According to SAG-AFTRA, it processes around 1.5 million residual checks a year. WGA receives between 100 and 5,000 residual checks a day. The DGA processes \"hundreds of thousands of checks\" a year, and in 2016 it processed $300 million in residuals for its members.\n\nResidual calculation is complex and depends on several variables, including guild membership, initial payment, time spent, type of production (e.g., network TV, DVD, ad-supported streaming, online purchases), and whether it involves a domestic or foreign market. Additionally, residuals change a lot: guilds negotiate new contracts with the AMPTP every three years, and residuals for primetime TV tend to increase every year because they are \"directly or indirectly keyed to salary minimums, which increase several percent per year\".\n\nIn acting, extras are generally not eligible, but stunt performers, puppeteers, singers, and actors with lines or scripted physical interactions with characters (\"supporting actors\" or \"day players\") are eligible. Principal performers generally get larger residuals. In fact, the more prominent the actor, the more generous the residual. Big stars like Tom Cruise, for example, would get a portion of DVD sales in addition to his \"regular\" residuals.\n\nAll \"credited\" writers are eligible for residuals, and the specific credit determines the amount of amount. For example, the \"written by\" credit yields a 100% residual allocation, \"screenplay/teleplay by\" yields a 75%, and \"adaptation by\" yields 10%.\n\nResidual payments can sometimes be very small if the role was small or the movie or show was not successful. For example, actor Jeff Cohen received a residual check for $0.67 after appearing in one episode of \"The Facts of Life\"; he took it to a former bar in Studio City called \"Maeve's Re$iduals\", which used to trade free drinks for any SAG-AFTRA residual checks for less than $1.\n\nBy contrast, Bob Gunton, who played Warden Norton in \"The Shawshank Redemption\", noted that the movie, one of the most-rerun films, generated \"close to six figures\" in residuals for him in 2004, ten years after the movie was released, and even as of 2014, that he continued to receive \"a very substantial income\".\n\nIn 2014, actor Lisa Kudrow of \"Friends\" was ordered to pay $1.6 million to her former manager, who argued that he was owed 5% of Kudrow's residuals earnings from work that he negotiated. Using figures that were publicly disclosed, one analyst estimated Kudrow's residuals to be at least $2.3 million, and likely much higher.\n\n"}
{"id": "143284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143284", "title": "Restoration comedy", "text": "Restoration comedy\n\n\"Restoration comedy\" is English comedy written and performed in the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710. Comedy of manners is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy. After public stage performances had been banned for 18 years by the Puritan regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signalled a renaissance of English drama. Sexually explicit language was encouraged by King Charles II (1660–1685) personally and by the rakish style of his court. Historian George Norman Clark argues:\n\nThe socially diverse audiences included both aristocrats, their servants and hangers-on, and a substantial middle-class segment. These playgoers were attracted to the comedies by up-to-the-minute topical writing, by crowded and bustling plots, by the introduction of the first professional actresses, and by the rise of the first celebrity actors. This period saw the first professional female playwright, Aphra Behn.\n\n Charles II was an active and interested patron of the drama. Soon after his restoration, in 1660, he granted exclusive play-staging rights, so-called Royal patents, to the King's Company and the Duke's Company, led by two middle-aged Caroline playwrights, Thomas Killigrew and William Davenant. The patentees scrambled for performance rights to the previous generation's Jacobean and Caroline plays, which were the first necessity for economic survival before any new plays existed. Their next priority was to build new, splendid patent theatres in Drury Lane and Dorset Gardens, respectively. Striving to outdo each other in magnificence, Killigrew and Davenant ended up with quite similar theatres, both designed by Christopher Wren, both optimally provided for music and dancing, and both fitted with moveable scenery and elaborate machines for thunder, lightning, and waves.\n\nThe dramatists of the Restoration renounced the tradition of satire, as recently embodied by Ben Jonson, and devoted themselves to the comedy of manners, which uncritically accepted the social code of the upper class.\n\nThe audience of the early Restoration period was not exclusively courtly, as has sometimes been supposed, but it was quite small and could barely support two companies. There was no untapped reserve of occasional playgoers. Ten consecutive performances constituted a smash hit. This closed system forced playwrights to be extremely responsive to popular taste. Fashions in the drama would change almost week by week rather than season by season, as each company responded to the offerings of the other, and new plays were urgently sought. The King's Company and the Duke's Company vied with one another for audience favour, for popular actors, and for new plays, and in this hectic climate the new genres of heroic drama, pathetic drama, and Restoration comedy were born and flourished.\n\nBoth the quantity and quality of the drama suffered when in 1682 the more successful Duke's Company absorbed the struggling King's Company, and the amalgamated \"United Company\" was formed. The production of new plays dropped off sharply in the 1680s, affected by both the monopoly and the political situation (see Decline of comedy below). The influence and the incomes of the actors dropped, too. In the late 80s, predatory investors (\"Adventurers\") converged on the United Company, while management was taken over by the lawyer Christopher Rich. Rich attempted to finance a tangle of \"farmed\" shares and sleeping partners by slashing salaries and, dangerously, by abolishing the traditional perks of senior performers, who were stars with the clout to fight back.\n\nThe company owners, wrote the young United Company employee Colley Cibber, \"who had made a monopoly of the stage, and consequently presum'd they might impose what conditions they pleased upon their people, did not consider that they were all this while endeavouring to enslave a set of actors whom the public were inclined to support.\" Performers like the legendary Thomas Betterton, the tragedienne Elizabeth Barry, and the rising young comedian Anne Bracegirdle had the audience on their side and, in the confidence of this, they walked out.\n\nThe actors gained a Royal \"licence to perform\", thus bypassing Rich's ownership of both the original Duke's and King's Company patents from 1660, and formed their own cooperative company. This unique venture was set up with detailed rules for avoiding arbitrary managerial authority, regulating the ten actors' shares, the conditions of salaried employees, and the sickness and retirement benefits of both categories. The cooperative had the good luck to open in 1695 with the première of William Congreve's famous \"Love For Love\" and the skill to make it a huge box-office success.\n\nLondon again had two competing companies. Their dash to attract audiences briefly revitalised Restoration drama, but also set it on a fatal downhill slope to the lowest common denominator of public taste. Rich's company notoriously offered Bartholomew Fair-type attractions – high kickers, jugglers, ropedancers, performing animals – while the co-operating actors, even as they appealed to snobbery by setting themselves up as the only legitimate theatre company in London, were not above retaliating with \"prologues recited by boys of five, and epilogues declaimed by ladies on horseback\".\n\nRestoration comedy was strongly influenced by the introduction of the first professional actresses. Before the closing of the theatres, all female roles had been taken by boy players, and the predominantly male audiences of the 1660s and 1670s were curious, censorious, and delighted at the novelty of seeing real women engage in risqué repartee and take part in physical seduction scenes. Samuel Pepys refers many times in his famous diary to visiting the playhouse to watch or re-watch the performance of particular actresses, and to how much he enjoys these experiences.\n\nDaringly suggestive comedy scenes involving women became especially common, although of course Restoration actresses were, just like male actors, expected to do justice to all kinds and moods of plays. (Their role in the development of Restoration tragedy is also important, compare She-tragedy.)\n\nA new speciality introduced almost as early as the actresses was the breeches role, which called for an actress to appear in male clothes (breeches being tight-fitting knee-length pants, the standard male garment of the time), for instance to play a witty heroine who disguises herself as a boy to hide, or to engage in escapades disallowed to girls. A quarter of the plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700 contained breeches roles. Playing these cross-dressing roles, women behaved with the freedom society allowed to men, and some feminist critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, regard them as subversive of conventional gender roles and empowering for female members of the audience. Elizabeth Howe has objected that the male disguise, when studied in relation to playtexts, prologues, and epilogues, comes out as \"little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object\" to male patrons, by showing off her body, normally hidden by a skirt, outlined by the male outfit.\n\nSuccessful Restoration actresses included Charles II's mistress Nell Gwyn, the tragedienne Elizabeth Barry who was famous for her ability to \"move the passions\" and make whole audiences cry, the 1690s comedian Anne Bracegirdle, and Susanna Mountfort (a.k.a. Susanna Verbruggen), who had many breeches roles written especially for her in the 1680s and 90s. Letters and memoirs of the period show that both men and women in the audience greatly relished Mountfort's swaggering, roistering impersonations of young women wearing breeches and thereby enjoying the social and sexual freedom of the male Restoration rake.\n\nDuring the Restoration period, both male and female actors on the London stage became for the first time public personalities and celebrities. Documents of the period show audiences being attracted to performances by the talents of particular actors as much as by particular plays, and more than by authors (who seem to have been the least important draw, no performance being advertised by author until 1699). Although the playhouses were built for large audiences—the second Drury Lane theatre from 1674 held 2000 patrons – they were of compact design, and an actor's charisma could be intimately projected from the thrust stage.\n\nWith two companies competing for their services from 1660 to 1682, star actors were able to negotiate star deals, comprising company shares and benefit nights as well as salaries. This advantageous situation changed when the two companies were amalgamated in 1682, but the way the actors rebelled and took command of a new company in 1695 is in itself an illustration of how far their status and power had developed since 1660.\n\nThe greatest fixed stars among Restoration actors were Elizabeth Barry (\"Famous Mrs Barry\" who \"forc 'd Tears from the Eyes of her Auditory\") and Thomas Betterton, both of them active in organising the actors' revolt in 1695 and both original patent-holders in the resulting actors' cooperative.\n\nBetterton played every great male part there was from 1660 into the 18th century. After watching \"Hamlet\" in 1661, Samuel Pepys reports in his diary that the young beginner Betterton \"did the prince's part beyond imagination.\" Betterton's expressive performances seem to have attracted playgoers as magnetically as did the novelty of seeing women on the stage. He was soon established as the leading man of the Duke's Company, and played Dorimant, the seminal irresistible Restoration rake, at the première of George Etherege's \"Man of Mode\" (1676). Betterton's position remained unassailable through the 1680s, both as the leading man of the United Company and as its stage manager and \"de facto\" day-to-day leader. He remained loyal to Rich longer than many of his co-workers, but eventually it was he who headed the actors' walkout in 1695, and who became the acting manager of the new company.\n\nVariety and dizzying fashion changes are typical of Restoration comedy. Even though the \"Restoration drama\" unit taught to college students is likely to be telescoped in a way that makes the plays all sound contemporary, scholars now have a strong sense of the rapid evolution of English drama over these forty years and of its social and political causes. The influence of theatre company competition and playhouse economics is also acknowledged.\nRestoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of aristocratic comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of Aphra Behn in the 1680s is to be noted. In the mid-1690s a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are extremely different from each other. An attempt is made below to illustrate the generational taste shift by describing \"The Country Wife\" (1675) and \"The Provoked Wife\" (1697) in some detail. These two plays differ from each other in some typical ways, just as a Hollywood movie of the 1950s differs from one of the 1970s. The plays are not, however, offered as being \"typical\" of their decades. Indeed, there exist no typical comedies of the 1670s or the 1690s; even within these two short peak-times, comedy types kept mutating and multiplying.\n\nThe drama of the 1660s and 1670s was vitalised by the competition between the two patent companies created at the Restoration, as well as by the personal interest of Charles II, and the comic playwrights rose to the demand for new plays. They stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English Jacobean and Caroline plays, and even from Greek and Roman classical comedies, and combined the looted plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized \"variety\" within as well as between plays. Early Restoration audiences had little enthusiasm for structurally simple, well-shaped comedies such as those of Molière; they demanded bustling, crowded multi-plot action and fast pace. Even a splash of high heroic drama might be thrown in to enrich the comedy mix, as in George Etherege's \"Love in a Tub\" (1664), which has one heroic verse \"conflict between love and friendship\" plot, one urbane wit comedy plot, and one burlesque pantsing plot. (\"See illustration, top right\".) Such incongruities contributed to Restoration comedy being held in low esteem in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, but today the early Restoration total theatre experience is again valued on the stage, as well as by postmodern academic critics.\n\nThe unsentimental or \"hard\" comedies of John Dryden, William Wycherley, and George Etherege reflected the atmosphere at Court, and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic macho lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The Earl of Rochester, real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's \"The Man of Mode\" (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous Restoration rake (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). Wycherley's \"The Plain Dealer\" (1676), a variation on the theme of Molière's \"Le Misanthrope\", was highly regarded for its uncompromising satire and earned Wycherley the appellation \"Plain Dealer\" Wycherley or \"Manly\" Wycherley, after the play's main character Manly. The single play that does most to support the charge of obscenity levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's \"The Country Wife\" (1675). \n\n\"The Country Wife\" has three interlinked but distinct plots, which each project sharply different moods:\n\n1. Horner's impotence trick provides the main plot and the play's organising principle. The upper-class town rake Horner mounts a campaign for seducing as many respectable ladies as possible, first spreading a false rumour of his own impotence, to be allowed where no complete man may go. The trick is a great success and Horner has sex with many married ladies of virtuous reputation, whose husbands are happy to leave him alone with them. In one famously outrageous scene, the \"China scene\", sexual intercourse is assumed to take place repeatedly just off stage, where Horner and his mistresses carry on a sustained double entendre dialogue purportedly about Horner's china collection. \"The Country Wife\" is driven by a succession of near-discoveries of the truth about Horner's sexual prowess (and thus the truth about the respectable ladies), from which he extricates himself by quick thinking and good luck. Horner never becomes a reformed character, but keeps his secret to the end and is assumed to go on merrily reaping the fruits of his planted misinformation, past the last act and beyond.\n\n2. The married life of Pinchwife and Margery is based on Molière's \"School for Wives\". Pinchwife is a middle-aged man who has married an ignorant young country girl in the hope that she will not know to cuckold him. However, Horner teaches her, and Margery cuts a swathe through the sophistications of London marriage without even noticing them. She is enthusiastic about the virile handsomeness of town gallants, rakes, and especially theatre actors (such self-referential stage jokes were nourished by the new higher status of actors), and keeps Pinchwife in a state of continual horror with her plain-spokenness and her interest in sex. A running joke is the way Pinchwife's pathological jealousy always leads him into supplying Margery with the very type of information he wishes her not to have.\n\n3. The courtship of Harcourt and Alithea is a comparatively uplifting love story in which the witty Harcourt wins the hand of Pinchwife's sister Alithea from the hands of the Upper-class town snob Sparkish, to whom she was engaged until discovering he loved her only for her money.\n\nWhen the two companies were amalgamated in 1682 and the London stage became a monopoly, both the number and the variety of new plays being written dropped sharply. There was a swing away from comedy to serious political drama, reflecting preoccupations and divisions following on the Popish Plot (1678) and the Exclusion Crisis (1682). The few comedies produced also tended to be political in focus, the Whig dramatist Thomas Shadwell sparring with the Tories John Dryden and Aphra Behn. Behn's unique achievement as an early professional woman writer has been the subject of much recent study.\n\nDuring the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the \"softer\" comedies of William Congreve and John Vanbrugh reflected mutating cultural perceptions and great social change. The playwrights of the 1690s set out to appeal to more socially mixed audiences with a strong middle-class element, and to female spectators, for instance by moving the war between the sexes from the arena of intrigue into that of marriage. The focus in comedy is less on young lovers outwitting the older generation, more on marital relations after the wedding bells. Thomas Southerne's dark \"The Wives' Excuse\" (1691) is not yet very \"soft\": it shows a woman miserably married to the fop Friendall, everybody's friend, whose follies and indiscretions undermine her social worth, since her honour is bound up in his. Mrs Friendall is pursued by a would-be lover, a matter-of-fact rake devoid of all the qualities that made Etherege's Dorimant charming, and she is kept from action and choice by the unattractiveness of all her options. All the humour of this \"comedy\" is in the subsidiary love-chase and fornication plots, none in the main plot.\n\nIn Congreve's \"Love for Love\" (1695) and \"The Way of the World\" (1700), the \"wit duels\" between lovers typical of 1670s comedy are underplayed. The give-and-take set pieces of couples still testing their attraction for each other have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the famous \"Proviso\" scene in \"The Way of the World\" (1700). Vanbrugh's \"The Provoked Wife\" (1697) follows in the footsteps of Southerne's \"Wives' Excuse\", with a lighter touch and more humanly recognisable characters.\n\n\"The Provoked Wife\" is something of a Restoration problem play in its attention to the subordinate legal position of married women and the complexities of \"divorce\" and separation, issues that had been highlighted in the mid-1690s by some notorious cases before the House of Lords (see Stone).\n\nSir John Brute in \"The Provoked Wife\" is tired of matrimony. He comes home drunk every night and is continually rude and insulting to his wife. She is meanwhile being tempted to embark upon an affair with the witty and faithful Constant. Divorce is not an option for either of the Brutes at this time, but forms of legal separation have recently come into existence, and would entail a separate maintenance to the wife. Such an arrangement would not allow remarriage. Still, muses Lady Brute, in one of many discussions with her niece Bellinda, \"These are good times. A woman may have a gallant and a separate maintenance too.\"\n\nBellinda is at the same time being grumpily courted by Constant's friend Heartfree, who is surprised and dismayed to find himself in love with her. The bad example of the Brutes is a constant warning to Heartfree to not marry.\n\n\"The Provoked Wife\" is a talk play, with the focus less on love scenes and more on discussions between female friends (Lady Brute and Bellinda) and male friends (Constant and Heartfree). These exchanges are full of jokes, but are also thoughtful and have a dimension of melancholy and frustration.\n\nAfter a forged-letter complication, the play ends with marriage between Heartfree and Bellinda and stalemate between the Brutes. Constant continues to pay court to Lady Brute, and she continues to shilly-shally.\n\nThe tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out at the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did. Interconnected causes for this shift in taste were demographic change, the Glorious Revolution of 1688, William's and Mary's dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the Society for the Reformation of Manners (founded in 1692). When Jeremy Collier attacked Congreve and Vanbrugh in his \"Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage\" in 1698, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place. At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of \"The Way of the World\", Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by the drama of obvious sentiment and exemplary morality.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, the sexual frankness of Restoration comedy ensured that theatre producers cannibalised it or adapted it with a heavy hand, rather than actually performed it. Today, Restoration comedy is again appreciated on the stage. The classics, Wycherley's \"The Country Wife\" and \"The Plain-Dealer\", Etherege's \"The Man of Mode\", and Congreve's \"Love For Love\" and \"The Way of the World\" have competition not only from Vanbrugh's \"The Relapse\" and \"The Provoked Wife\", but from such dark, unfunny comedies as Thomas Southerne's \"The Wives Excuse\". Aphra Behn, once considered unstageable, has had a major renaissance, with \"The Rover\" now a repertory favourite.\n\nDistaste for sexual impropriety long kept Restoration comedy not only off the stage but also locked in a critical poison cupboard. Victorian critics like William Hazlitt, although valuing the linguistic energy and \"strength\" of the canonical writers Etherege, Wycherley, and Congreve, always found it necessary to temper aesthetic praise with heavy moral condemnation. Aphra Behn received the condemnation without the praise, since outspoken sex comedy was considered particularly offensive coming from a woman author. At the turn of the 20th century, an embattled minority of academic Restoration comedy enthusiasts began to appear, for example the important editor Montague Summers, whose work ensured that the plays of Aphra Behn remained in print.\n\n\"Critics remain astonishingly defensive about the masterpieces of this period\", wrote Robert D. Hume as late as 1976. It is only over the last few decades that that statement has become untrue, as Restoration comedy has been acknowledged a rewarding subject for high theory analysis and Wycherley's \"The Country Wife\", long branded the most obscene play in the English language, has become something of an academic favourite. \"Minor\" comic writers are getting a fair share of attention, especially the post-Aphra Behn generation of women playwrights which appeared just around the turn of the 18th century: Delarivier Manley, Mary Pix, Catharine Trotter, and Susannah Centlivre. A broad study of the majority of never-reprinted Restoration comedies has been made possible by Internet access (by subscription only) to the first editions at the British Library.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section lists a selection of seminal critical studies.\n\n\n"}

In a retention of vision vanish, the spectator sees a coin placed on a palm and as the fingers are closed around the coin it is secretly removed, but because the retina still retains a fleeting image of the coin for a fraction of a second, the spectator will be convinced that the coin was placed in the hand, when in fact it wasn't.\n"}
{"id": "181885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181885", "title": "Ribaldry", "text": "Ribaldry\n\nRibaldry, or blue comedy, is humorous entertainment that ranges from bordering on indelicacy to gross indecency. It is also referred to as \"bawdiness\", \"gaminess\" or \"bawdy\".\n\nSex is presented in ribald material more for the purpose of poking fun at the foibles and weaknesses that manifest themselves in human sexuality, rather than to present sexual stimulation either excitingly or artistically. Also, ribaldry may use sex as a metaphor to illustrate some non-sexual concern, in which case ribaldry may verge on the territory of satire.\n\nLike any humour, ribaldry may be read as conventional or subversive. Ribaldry typically depends on a shared background of sexual conventions and values, and its comedy generally depends on seeing those conventions broken.\n\nThe ritual taboo-breaking that is a usual counterpart of ribaldry underlies its controversial nature and explains why ribaldry is sometimes a subject of censorship. Ribaldry, whose usual aim is \"not\" \"merely\" to be sexually stimulating, often does address larger concerns than mere sexual appetite. However, being presented in the form of comedy, these larger concerns may be overlooked by censors.\n\nRibaldry differs from black comedy (or gallows humor) in that black comedy deals with topics which would normally considered painful or frightening whereas ribaldry deals with topics that would only be considered offensive.\n\nRibaldry is present to some degree in every culture and has likely been around for all of human history. Works like \"Lysistrata\" by Aristophanes, \"Menaechmi\" by Plautus, \"Cena Trimalchionis\" by Petronius, and \"The Golden Ass\" of Apuleius are ribald classics from ancient Greece and Rome. Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Miller's Tale\" from his \"Canterbury Tales\" and \"The Crabfish\", one of the oldest English traditional ballads, are classic examples. The Frenchman François Rabelais showed himself to be a master of ribaldry (technically called grotesque body) in his \"Gargantua\" and other works. \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\" by Laurence Sterne and \"The Lady's Dressing Room\" by Jonathan Swift are also in this genre; as is Mark Twain's long-suppressed \"1601\".\n\nAnother example of ribaldry is \"De Brevitate Vitae\", a song which in many European-influenced universities is both a student beer-drinking song and an anthem sung by official university choirs at public graduation ceremonies. The private and public versions of the song contain vastly different words. More recent works like \"Candy\", \"Barbarella\", \"L'Infermiera\", the comedic works of Russ Meyer, \"Little Annie Fanny\" and John Barth's \"The Sot-Weed Factor\" are probably better classified as ribaldry than as either pornography or erotica.\n\nA bawdy song is a humorous song that emphasises sexual themes and is often rich with innuendo. Historically these songs tend to be confined to groups of young males, either as students or in an environment where alcohol is flowing freely. An early collection was \"Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy\", edited by Thomas D'Urfey and published between 1698 and 1720. Selected songs from \"Wit and Mirth\" have been recorded by the City Waites and other singers. Sailor's songs tend to be quite frank about the exploitative nature of the relationship between men and women. There are many examples of folk songs in which a man encounters a woman in the countryside. This is followed by a short conversation, and then sexual intercourse, e.g. \"The Game of All Fours\". Neither side demonstrates any shame or regret. If the woman becomes pregnant, the man will not be there anyway. Rugby songs are often bawdy. Examples of bawdy folk songs are: \"Seventeen Come Sunday\" and \"The Ballad of Eskimo Nell\". Robert Burns compiled \"The Merry Muses of Caledonia\" (the title is not Burns's), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century. In modern times Hash House Harriers have taken on the role of tradition-bearers for this kind of song. \"The Unexpurgated Folk Songs of Men\" (Arhoolie 4006) is a gramophone record containing a collection of American bawdy songs recorded in 1959.\n\nBlue comedy is comedy that is off-color, risqué, indecent or profane, largely about sex. It often contains profanity or sexual imagery that may shock and offend some audience members.\n\n\"Working blue\" refers to the act of using curse words and discussing things that people do not discuss in \"polite society\". A \"blue comedian\" or \"blue comic\" is a comedian who usually performs risqué routines layered with curse words. \n\nThere is a common belief that comedian Max Miller (1894–1963) coined the phrase, after his stage act which involved telling jokes from either a white book or a blue book, chosen by audience preference (the blue book contained ribald jokes). This is not so, as the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" contains earlier references to the use of blue to mean ribald: 1890 \"Sporting Times\" 25 Jan. 1/1 \"\"Shifter wondered whether the damsel knew any novel blue stories.\" and 1900 \"Bulletin\" (Sydney) 20 Oct. 12/4 \"Let someone propose to celebrate Chaucer by publicly reading some of his bluest productions unexpurgated. The reader would probably be locked up.\"\"\n\nPrivate events at show business clubs such as the Bob Saget Club and The Masquers often showed this blue side of otherwise cleancut Bob Saget; a recording survives of one Masquers roast from the 1950s with Jack Benny, George Jessel, George Burns, and Art Linkletter all using highly risqué material and obscenities. Many comedians who are normally family-friendly might choose to work blue when off-camera or in an adult-oriented environment; Bob Saget exemplifies this dichotomy. Bill Cosby's 1969 record album records both his family-friendly evening standup comedy show, and his blue midnight show, which included a joke about impregnating his wife \"right through the old midnight trampoline\" (her diaphragm) and other sexual references.\n\nSome comedians build their careers on blue comedy. Among the best known of these are Redd Foxx, Lawanda Page, and the team of Leroy and Skillet, all of whom later performed on the family-friendly television show Sanford and Son. Page, Leroy, and Skillet specialized in a particular African American form of blue spoken word recitation called signifying or toasting. Dave Attell has also been described by his peers as one of the greatest modern-day blue comics. \n\nOn talk radio in the United States, many commentators use blue comedy in their political programs. Examples include Neal Boortz, Eric Von Haessler, Phil Hendrie and Steve Morrison.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "809210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=809210", "title": "Roller derby", "text": "Roller derby\n\nRoller derby is a contact sport played by two teams of five members roller skating counter-clockwise around a track. Roller derby is played by approximately 1,250 amateur leagues worldwide, mostly inside the United States.\n\nGame play consists of a series of short match-ups (jams) in which both teams designate a jammer (who wears a star on the helmet). The jammer scores points by lapping members of the opposing team. The teams attempt to hinder the opposing jammer while assisting their own jammer—in effect, playing both offense and defense simultaneously.\n\nWhile the sport has its origins in the banked-track roller-skating marathons of the 1930s, Leo Seltzer and Damon Runyon are credited with evolving the sport to its competitive form. Professional roller derby quickly became popular; in 1940, more than 5 million spectators watched in about 50 American cities. In the ensuing decades, however, it predominantly became a form of sports entertainment, where theatrical elements overshadowed athleticism. Gratuitous showmanship largely ended with the sport's grassroots revival in the first decade of the 21st century. Although roller derby retains some sports entertainment qualities such as player pseudonyms and colorful uniforms, it has abandoned scripted bouts with predetermined winners.\n\nModern roller derby is an international sport, mostly played by amateurs. Most teams are all-female teams, but there is a growing number of male, unisex, and junior roller derby teams. It was under consideration as a roller sport for the 2020 Summer Olympics. FIRS, recognized by the International Olympic Committee as the official international governing body of roller sports, released its first set of Roller Derby Rules for the World Roller Games that took place September 2017 in Nanjing, China. Most modern leagues (and their back-office volunteers) share a strong \"do-it-yourself\" ethic that combines athleticism with the styles of punk and camp. , the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA) had 423 full member leagues and 46 apprentice leagues.\n\nContemporary roller derby has a basic set of rules, with variations reflecting the interests of a governing body's member leagues. The summary below is based on the rules of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA). In March 2010, Derby News Network claimed that more than 98% of roller derby competitions were conducted under WFTDA rules. For example, members of the United Kingdom Roller Derby Association are required to play by WFTDA rules, while members of the former Canadian Women's Roller Derby Association were encouraged to join the WFTDA.\n\nRoller derby is played in two periods of 30 minutes. Two teams of up to 15 players each field up to five members for episodes called \"jams.\" Jams last two minutes unless called off prematurely. Each team designates a scoring player (the \"jammer\"); the other four members are \"blockers.\" One blocker can be designated as a \"pivot\"—a blocker who is allowed to become a jammer in the course of play. The next jam may involve different players of the 15 roster players, and different selections for jammer and pivot.\n\nDuring each jam, players skate counterclockwise on a circuit track. Points are scored only by a team's jammer. After breaking through the pack and skating one lap to begin another \"trip\" through the pack, the jammer scores one point for passing any member of the opposing team. The rules describe an \"earned\" pass; notably, the jammer must be in-bounds and upright. The jammer's first earned pass scores a point for passing that opponent and a point for each opponent not on the track (for instance, serving a penalty, or when the opposition did not field five players for the jam). If the jammer passes the entire pack and the opposing jammer too, it is a five-point scoring trip, commonly called a \"grand slam.\"\n\nEach team's blockers use body contact, changing positions, and other tactics to help their jammer score while hindering the opposing team's jammer.\n\nPlay begins by blockers lining up on the track anywhere between the \"jammer line\" and the \"pivot line\" 30 feet in front. The jammers start behind the jammer line. Jams begin on a single short whistle blast, upon which both jammers and blockers may begin engaging immediately.\nThe pack is the largest single group of blockers containing members of both teams skating in proximity, arranged such that each player is within 10 feet of the next. Blockers must maintain the pack, but can skate freely within 20 feet behind and ahead of it, an area known as the \"engagement zone.\"\n\nThe first jammer to break through the pack earns the status of \"lead jammer.\" A designated referee blows the whistle twice, and skates near, and points at, the lead jammer. Once earned, lead jammer status cannot be transferred to other skaters, but certain actions (notably, being sent to the penalty box) can cause it to be lost. The lead jammer can stop the jam at any time by repeatedly placing both hands on their hips. If the jam is not stopped early, it ends after two minutes. If time remains in the period, teams then have 30 seconds to get on the track and line up for the next jam. If the period expires, it does not halt a jam that is underway.\n\nA skater may block an opponent to impede their movement or to force them out of bounds. The blocker must be upright, skating counterclockwise, in bounds, and within the engagement zone. Blocking with hands, elbows, head, and feet is prohibited, as is contact above the shoulders or below mid-thigh, and blocking from behind.\n\nReferees penalize rules violations. A player receiving a penalty is removed from play to sit in a penalty box for 30 seconds of jam time. If the jam ends during this interval, the player remains in the penalty box during the subsequent jam until the interval ends. The penalized player's team plays short-handed, as in ice hockey.\n\nHowever, the \"power jam\", derived from hockey's \"power play\", does not cover any short-handed situation but only the case where the jammer is penalized. In this case, that team cannot score. While the lead jammer is penalized, no one can prematurely end the jam.\n\nIt would be pointless to play if neither team could score; thus, a jammer is released from the penalty box early if the opponents' jammer enters the box. The second jammer's penalty is then only as long as the amount of time the first jammer spent in the box. A player \"fouls out\" of the game on the seventh penalty, and is required to return to the locker room.\n\nPlayers skate on four-wheeled (\"quad\") roller skates, and are required to wear protective equipment, including a helmet, wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads, and mouth guards. All current sets of roller derby rules explicitly forbid inline skates for players. (USARS requires quad skates for all skaters. WFTDA and MRDA permit inline skates for referees, but virtually all referees wear quad skates.) Individual teams may mandate additional gear, such as padded knee length pants, similar to what aggressive skateboarders wear, and biologically specific gear such as a hard-case sports bra for female players and protective cups for males.\n\nOffense and defense are played simultaneously, a volatile aspect that complicates strategy and tactics. For example, blockers may create a large hole for their jammer to pass through and score, but this same maneuver might also allow the opposing team's jammer to score.\n\nStrategies (high-level plans toward achieving the game's goal, which is to outscore the opposition) include the following:\n\nTactics (deliberate conceptual tasks in support of the strategy) may include the following:\n\n\nWFTDA bouts are officiated by three to seven skating referees and many non-skating officials (NSOs). Referees skate on the inside of the track; in flat-track derby, some also skate on the outside of the track. They call penalties, award points, and ensure safe game play. Referees must wear skates and typically wear white and black stripes. NSOs take up a range of positions inside and outside the track, start and time the jams, record and display scores and penalties communicated by referees, record the number of each skater on track for a given jam, and time and record skaters in the penalty box. Volunteer leagues adapt when fewer than the optimal number of officials are present.\n\n The growing popularity of roller skating in the United States led to the formation of organized multi-day endurance races for cash prizes, as early as the mid-1880s. Speed and endurance races continued to be held on both flat and banked tracks in the century's first three decades and spectators enjoyed the spills and falls of the skaters. The term \"derby\" was used to refer to such races by 1922.\n\nThe endurance races began to transform into the contemporary form of the sport in the mid-1930s, when promoter Leo Seltzer created the Transcontinental Roller Derby, a month-long simulation of a road race between two-person teams of professional skaters. The spectacle became a popular touring exhibition. In the late 1930s, sportswriter Damon Runyon persuaded Seltzer to change the Roller Derby rules to increase skater contact. By 1939, after experimenting with different team and scoring arrangements, Seltzer's created a touring company of four pairs of teams (always billed as the local \"home\" team versus either New York or Chicago), with two five-person teams on the track at once, scoring points when its members lapped opponents.\n\nOn November 29, 1948, before television viewership was widespread, \"Roller Derby\" debuted on New York television. The broadcasts increased spectator turnout for live matches. For the 1949–1950 season, Seltzer formed the National Roller Derby League (NRDL), comprising six teams. NRDL season playoffs sold out Madison Square Garden for a week. During the late 1950s and 1960s, the sport was broadcast on several networks, but attendance declined. Jerry Seltzer (Leo's son), the \"Roller Derby\" \"commissioner\", hoped to use television to expand the live spectator base. He adapted the sport for television by developing scripted story lines and rules designed to improve television appeal, but derby's popularity declined.\n\n1989 saw the debut of \"RollerGames,\" an even more theatrical variant of roller derby for national audiences. It used a figure-8 track and rules adapted for this track. Bill Griffiths, Sr. served as commissioner while his son, Bill Griffiths, Jr., managed the L.A. T-Birds, who (according to the storyline) were seeking revenge on the Violators (led by Skull) for cheating in the Commissioner's Cup. The other teams included the Maniacs (led by Guru Drew), Bad Attitude (led by Ms. Georgia Hase), the Rockers (led by DJ Terringo and consisting of skaters who were also professional rock and roll musicians), and Hot Flash (led by Juan Valdez Lopez). It ran one season, because some of its syndicators went bankrupt.\n\nIn 1999, TNN (now Spike TV) debuted \"RollerJam,\" which used the classic rules and banked oval track, but allowed inline skates (although some skaters wore traditional quad skates). Jerry Seltzer was commissioner for this version.\n\nRoller derby began its modern revival in Austin, Texas in the early 2000s as an all-female, woman-organized amateur sport. By August 2006, there were over 135 similar leagues. Leagues outside the U.S. also began forming in 2006, and international competition soon followed. There are over 2,000 amateur leagues worldwide in countries including Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, Brazil, New Zealand, Germany, Belgium, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Israel, Singapore, Dubai, and Egypt. In many international leagues, gear and equipment must be imported. Roller derby's contemporary resurgence has been regarded as an aspect of globalization which demonstrates \"the speed with which pop culture is now transported by highly mobile expatriates and social media, while also highlighting the changing role of women in many societies.\"\n\nMany roller derby leagues are amateur, self-organized and all-female and were formed in a do-it-yourself spirit by relatively new enthusiasts. In many leagues (especially in the U.S.), a punk aesthetic and/or third-wave feminist ethic is prominent. Members of fledgling leagues often practice and strategize together, regardless of team affiliation, between bouts. Most compete on flat tracks, though several leagues skate on banked tracks, with more in the planning stages.\n\nEach league typically features local teams in public bouts that are popular with a diverse fan base. Some venues host audiences ranging up to 7,000. Successful local leagues have formed traveling teams comprising the league's best players to compete with comparable teams from other cities and regions. In February 2012, the International Olympic Committee considered roller derby, among eight sports, for inclusion in the 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nIn 2009, the feature film \"Whip It\" was based on roller derby and introduced viewers to its rules and culture. The WFTDA encouraged leagues to coordinate with promotions during the film's release to increase awareness of the leagues. Corporate advertising has used roller derby themes in television commercials for insurance, a breakfast cereal, and an over-the-counter analgesic.\n\nMost players in roller leagues skate under pseudonyms, also called \"derby names\" or \"skater names.\" These typically use word play with satirical, mock-violent or sexual puns, alliteration, and allusions to pop culture. Referees use derby names as well, often shown on the backs of their striped uniforms. Some players claim their names represent alter egos that they adopt while skating.\n\nWhether a team should skate under real names or derby names is sometimes debated. Some derby names are obscene, and this attracts controversy among other skaters.\n\nCopying of derby names has attracted legal and sociological analysis as an example of indigenous development of property rights. New players are encouraged to check derby names against an international roster to ensure they are not already in use.\n\nThe names of roller derby events are also sardonic and convoluted—for example, Night of the Rolling Dead (Night of the Living Dead), Knocktoberfest (Oktoberfest), Spanksgiving (Thanksgiving), Seasons Beatings (Seasons Greetings), Grandma Got Run Over By a Rollergirl (Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer), Cinco de May-hem (Cinco de Mayo), and War of the Wheels (War of the Worlds).\n\nRoller derby is a contact sport, and injuries can occur. Superficial injuries include torn eyelashes and \"fishnet burn\", a stippled effect of falling while wearing fishnet hose. However, torn ligaments, broken bones, and concussions also occur.\n\nSome leagues prominently display their injuries, to embellish the image of violence or machismo. However, some skaters say the sport is reasonably safe if skaters take precautions. The rules require appropriate medical professionals on-site at every bout, even if not required by laws or arena regulations. The WFTDA offers insurance for leagues in the United States with legal liability and accident coverage, but it recommends that skaters also carry their own primary medical insurance.\n\nAlthough the early 2000s revival of roller derby was initially all-female, some leagues later introduced all-male teams and unisex games; there were over 140 junior roller derby programs in the United States, and many more around the world.\n\nRoller derby bouts are now streamed online, and there is archived video of past bouts and tournaments. The WFTDA offers live streaming video of its tournaments at codice_1. Derby News Network (codice_2) offered live streaming video and archived video including events outside the WFTDA.\n\nFiveOnFive magazine covers roller derby and diverse aspects such as business, training, junior roller derby, and nutrition.\n\nThe largest governing body for the sport is the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA), with 397 full member leagues and 48 apprentice leagues. WFTDA membership is a major goal of aspiring leagues. Other associations support either coed or men-only derby; the largest organization supporting male roller derby is the Men's Roller Derby Association (MRDA). Within the United States, the Junior Roller Derby Association governs play by those under 18. It modifies the WFTDA rules for minors, such as prohibiting hitting and accelerating into a block. Some U.S. leagues decline affiliation with a national organization because they prefer local governance.\n\nUSA Roller Sports (USARS) is recognized by the International Roller Sports Federation (FIRS) and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) as the National Governing Body of competitive roller sports in the United States, including speed, figure, hockey, roller derby and slalom. WFTDA and USARS maintain a reciprocity agreement for insurance purposes.\n\nOutside the United States, many roller derby leagues enjoy support from their national skate federations, such as Skate Australia, the British Roller Sports Federation, and Roller Sports Canada. In Europe, roller derby was recognized as a sport in Paris in 2010 by the Federation Internationale de Roller Sports (FIRS), which reports directly to the International Olympic Committee. As of 2017, FIRS has been accepted as the international rule set by the International Olympic Committee. Teams competed under the FIRS rules at The World Roller Games 2017 in Nanjing, China. The former Canadian Women's Roller Derby Association worked with the American federation.\n\nSince 2006, the WFTDA has sponsored an annual championship. In 2008, it took the current \"Big 5\" format: four regional playoffs and a final championship tournament. The WFTDA also recognizes eligible tournaments hosted by member leagues. Internationally, the first Roller Derby World Cup took place in Toronto, Canada, in December 2011. The second World Cup took place in Dallas, Texas, in December 2014.\nSince 2012, USARS has held an annual Roller Derby National Championship. In 2017, FIRS and the USOC recognized USARS to participate in the Nanjing games.\n\nZaina Arafat asserts in \"Virginia Quarterly Review\" that roller derby defies heteronormativity and patriarchal standards. In Egypt, Arafat says, there are expectations that a woman will not show visible scars, will have an unblemished body for her husband, and will refrain from activities that may damage her body. She says roller derby in Egypt is subversive, as it acts as an indirect political statement.\n\nCarly Giesler states that skaters enact sexualities that create or reclaim an identity, and their role parodies \"hegemonic scripts of sexuality\" through the use of costumes, derby names and personas. Roller derby acts as a unique stage for female athletes, letting them rebut constraints society places on women and female athletes. Giesler argues that female sports objectifies them for the male gaze, but roller derby turns this on its head by disregarding gender roles and norms.\n\n\n"}

Some notable philosophers and commentators have criticised excessive seriousness, while others have praised it. Seriousness is often contrasted with comedy, as in the seriocomedy. In the theory of humor, one must have a sense of humor and a sense of seriousness to distinguish what is supposed to be taken literally or not, or of being important or not. Otherwise, it may also be contrasted with a sense of play. How children learn a sense of seriousness to form values and differentiate between the serious and that which is not is studied in developmental psychology and educational psychology. There is a distinction between the degree of seriousness of various crimes in sentencing under the law, and also in law enforcement. There is a positive correlation with the degree of seriousness of a crime and viewer ratings of news coverage. What is or is not considered serious varies widely with different cultures.\n\nSometimes fields studying degrees of seriousness overlap, such as developmental psychology studies of development of the sense of degrees of seriousness as it relates to transgressions, which has overlap with criminology and the seriousness of crimes. \nSource:Alchilagyo.com\n\nSome use \"seriousness\" as a term of praise for scholarship or in literary review. 19th century poet, cultural critic, and literary critic, Matthew Arnold said that the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were \"high truth\" and \"high seriousness\".\n\nMany have expressed an attitude of disdain toward taking things too seriously, as opposed to viewing things with an attitude of humor. Poet, playwright, and philosopher Joseph Addison said that being serious is dull, \"we are growing serious, and let me tell you, that's the next step to being dull.\" Political satirist P.J. O'Rourke said that \"Seriousness is stupidity sent to college.\" Epigramist, poet, and playwright Oscar Wilde said that \"life is too important to be taken seriously.\" In a play on words, novelist Samuel Butler indicated that the \"central serious conviction in life\" is that nothing should be taken with too much seriousness, \"the one serious conviction that a man should have is that nothing is to be taken too seriously.\"\n\nIn some ascetic or puritan religious sects, an attitude of seriousness is always to be taken, and solemnity, sobriety, and puritanism with its hostility to social pleasures and indulgences are the only acceptable attitudes. Perry Miller, \"the master of American intellectual history\", wrote of excessive seriousness of the Puritans, \"simple humanity cries at last for some relief from the interminable high seriousness of the Puritan code.\"\n\nExistentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called the \"spirit of seriousness’’ the belief that there is an objective and independent goodness in things for people to discover, and that this belief leads to bad faith. He argued that people forget that values are not absolute, but are contingent and subjectively determined. In Sartre’s words, \"the spirit of seriousness has two characteristics: it considers values as transcendent ‘'givens’’, independent of human subjectivity, and it transfers the quality of ‘desirable’ from the ontological structure of things to their simple material constitution.\"\n\nSeriousness is sometimes contrasted with the comical in humor. In the performing arts and literature, the seriocomedy is a genre which blends seriousness with the comical, drama with comedy.\n\nIn the theory of humor, one must have a sense of humor and a sense of seriousness to distinguish what is supposed to be taken literally or not. An even more keen sense is needed when humor is used to make a serious point. Psychologists have studied how humor is intended to be taken as having seriousness, as when court jesters used humor to convey serious information. Conversely, when humor is not intended to be taken seriously, bad taste in humor may cross a line after which it is taken seriously, though not intended.\n\nIn Developmental psychology and educational psychology, seriousness is studied as it relates to how children develop an ability to distinguish levels of seriousness as it relates to transgressions and expenditure of time; for example, a child must learn to distinguish between levels of seriousness in admonitions such as between \"don't fidget\" and \"don't forget to look both ways when crossing the street\", which have the same linguistic and normative structure, but different levels of seriousness.\n\nThe degree of seriousness of crimes is an important factor relating to crime. One standard for measurement is the degree to which a crime affects others or society. A felony is generally considered to be a crime of \"high seriousness\", while a misdemeanor is not.\n\nIn criminal law the degree of seriousness is considered when meting out punishment to fit the crime, and in considering to what extent overcrowded prison facilities will be used. Seriousness of a crime is a major factor in considerations of the allocation of scarce law enforcement funds.\n\nThe meaning and measurement of seriousness is a major concern in public policy considerations. A quantitative scoring system called the \"seriousness score\" has been developed for use in allocating law enforcement resources and sentencing.\n\nAs to England and Wales, see section 143 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.\n\nDegrees of seriousness are used in medicine to make decisions about care. Seriousness is related to the effects of delaying or not having medical care. In an emergency hospital, the triage nurse must evaluate levels of seriousness of medical emergencies and rank them to determine order of care. Seriousness of illness is used to make decisions as to whether to perform invasive procedures such as surgery.\n\nThere is a positive correlation between the degree of seriousness of a crime and viewer ratings of news coverage.\n\nWhat is considered serious varies widely across cultures and is studied in sociology, cultural anthropology, and criminology; being of the wrong religious faith may be considered a serious crime in some cultures; smoking marijuana may be a serious crime in some cultures and not others; homosexuality a serious crime in some cultures; and prostitution is a serious crime in some cultures. Perception of seriousness is measured in assessing varying cultural perceptions on health risks.\n"}

They are intended to attract new audiences to museums and galleries. They have become the largest programme organised in the United Kingdom for the 'Museums at Night Festival'.\n\nThe programme started as a one-night event with 14 cultural venues taking part including Discovery Museum, Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art and the Laing Art Gallery. All the venues stayed open late and put on free events and exhibitions, which aimed to entice a new, younger audience through their doors. From the outset many different agencies came together to open their doors and this has continued. In mid-May 2013, more than 50 attractions feature in what an arts site for the region describes as \"The North East’s legendary culture crawl, The Late Shows\". An Arts Council of England case study demonstrates its impact. That report gives headline information thus \"In 2009, 54 events held over two nights across the 29 venues taking part attracted 15,116 visitors. This involved nine commissions, 126 artists and four education sessions. The total audience, including print, broadcast and online was 701,800. The Late Shows 2010 has built on that success with over 19,500 people heading to NewcastleGateshead's museums and galleries after-hours. We supported The Late Shows with £25,000 of National Lottery funding from our Grants for the arts scheme. Support from other partner organisations included £39.974 from Culture 10, £8,703 from North East Regional Museums Hub and £17,990 of support in kind from the participating venues\".

{"id": "50856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50856", "title": "Trivial Pursuit", "text": "Trivial Pursuit\n\nTrivial Pursuit is a board game from Canada in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions.\n\nDozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as \"Star Wars\", \"Saturday Night Live\", and \"The Lord of the Rings\" movies).\n\nThe game was created in December 1979 in Montreal in Quebec, by Canadian Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal's \"The Gazette\", and Scott Abbott, a sports editor for \"The Canadian Press\". After finding pieces of their \"Scrabble\" game missing, they decided to create their own game. With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1981.\n\nIn North America, the game's popularity peaked in 1984, a year in which over 20 million games were sold. The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (now part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million. , nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the \"Games Hall of Fame\" by \"Games\" magazine. An online version of \"Trivial Pursuit\" was launched in September 2003.\n\nThe object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of \"Trivial Pursuit\", these are Geography (blue), Entertainment (pink), History (yellow), Arts & Literature (originally brown, later purple), Science & Nature (green), and Sports & Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die.\n\nPlaying pieces used in \"Trivial Pursuit\" are round and divided into six sections, similar to a cheese triangle. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese, can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress.\n\nDuring the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal \"hub\" space. At the end of each spoke is a \"category headquarters\" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, his turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say \"roll again,\" giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a \"wild\" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his choice. Questions must be answered without any outside assistance. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board.\n\nOnce a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his playing piece, he must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn.\n\nOver the years, numerous editions of \"Trivial Pursuit\" have been produced, usually specializing in various fields. The original version is known as the \"Genus\" edition (or \"Genus I\"). Several other general knowledge editions (such as \"Genus II\") have followed. Some include, Junior Edition (1985), All-Star Sports, Baby Boomers, 1980s, All About the 80s, and 1990s.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Trivial Pursuit\" players complained that the 2006 version of the game was \"dumbed down\" in comparison to previous editions, with easier questions and more focus on celebrities and show business.\n\nIn October 1984, Fred L. Worth, author of \"The Trivia Encyclopedia\", \"Super Trivia\", and \"Super Trivia II\", filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of \"Trivial Pursuit\". He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even to the point of reproducing typographical errors and deliberately placed misinformation. One of the questions in \"Trivial Pursuit\" was \"What was Columbo's first name?\" with the answer \"Philip\". That information had been fabricated to catch anyone who might try to violate his copyright.\n\nThe inventors of \"Trivial Pursuit\" acknowledged that Worth's books were among their sources, but argued that this was not improper and that facts are not protected by copyright. The district court judge agreed, ruling in favor of the \"Trivial Pursuit\" inventors. The decision was appealed, and in September 1987 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the ruling. Worth asked the Supreme Court of the United States to review the case, but the Court declined, denying certiorari in March 1988.\n\nIn 1994, David Wall of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, launched a lawsuit against the game's creators. He claimed that in the fall of 1979, he and a friend were hitchhiking near Sydney, Nova Scotia, when they were picked up by Chris Haney. Wall claimed that he told Haney about his idea for the game in detail, including the shape of the markers.\n\nWall's mother testified she found drawings of his that looked like plans for a \"Trivial Pursuit\"-like game, but the drawings had since been destroyed. Wall's friend, who was allegedly hitchhiking with him that day, never testified. Haney said he never met Wall.\n\nOver the years, there was much legal wrangling, notably around whether the suit should be decided by a judge or jury. On June 25, 2007, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court ruled against Wall.\n\nA version of \"Trivial Pursuit\", hosted by Wink Martindale, aired on The Family Channel in the United States from 1993 to 1995 (Jay Wolpert had attempted a pilot in 1987, but it was not picked up). A syndicated version entitled \"\" aired from 2008 to 2009 and hosted by Christopher Knight. In September 2004, Roger Lodge hosted a sports trivia game show on ESPN entitled \"ESPN Trivial Pursuit\", which aired five episodes.\n\nBBC Television produced a \"Trivial Pursuit\" game show based on the game in the UK hosted by Rory McGrath. Another British version (with rules/format similar to the Wink Martindale version, and also using the same theme tune as the Wink Martindale version) was hosted on The Family Channel (now Challenge) by Tony Slattery. Birgit Lechtermann hosted a version for VOX in Germany from 1993 to 1994.\n\nIn 1988, a made-for-television movie entitled \"Breaking all the Rules: The Creation of Trivial Pursuit\" aired. Treated largely as a comedy, the movie featured the music of Jimmy Buffett and portrayed the creators of the game as three beer-loving Canadians.\n\nIn Spain, a version of the show called \"Trivial Pursuit: Spain Plays\" premiered in September 2008 on Antena 3.\n\nIn 1984, Bally Sente released a \"Trivial Pursuit\" arcade game. Like the board game, several variants were also released.\n\nBritish software company Domark released a home computer version (billed as \"Trivial Pursuit: The Computer Game\") for multiple formats during the 1980s. This version included pictorial and musical questions but was otherwise mostly faithful to the mechanics of the original board game.\n\nLater, Domark released another version called \"Trivial Pursuit: A New Beginning\", also across multiple formats. This version featured a plot about the dying Earth and significantly altered gameplay mechanics.\n\nHasbro Interactive released a \"Millennium Edition\" in 1999 with three different modes, and different categories:\n\nThere are also three different ways to answer the questions:\n\nThis game featured a total of seven voice-overs, one host, and one for each of the six categories: People & Places (blue wedge), Arts & Entertainment (pink wedge), History (yellow wedge), Science & Nature (brown wedge), Sports & Leisure (green wedge), and Wild Card (orange wedge).\n\nIn 2003, Bolenka Games released an online game of \"Trivial Pursuit\" on the now-defunct website Uproar.comwhere it features five editions such as: \"Genius\", \"Silver Screen\", \"Music\", \"1980s\" and \"TV\".\n\nTrivial Pursuit was released for a number of home video systems, including Sega CD, Wii, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4. The board game was also adapted into a mobile game called \"Trivia Crack\".\n\n"}

It could help bridge the digital divide by bringing the benefits of the information revolution to the billions of underserved people by providing information and services through a voice driven channel over an ordinary phone call. Information on this web could be community created as well as leveraged from World Wide Web. It is essentially a voice driven eco-system parallel and complementary to that of the existing Web. Though primarily meant for the under-served in population in emerging economies, it has several applications for the developed world as well.\n\nWWTW can be accessible to more number of people in the world as it enables an ordinary phone subscriber to join the digital information revolution. This enables a significantly larger fraction of the human population to benefit from existing and envisioned services than what was made possible by WWW. Specifically, it removes accessibility barriers that manifest themselves in terms of illiteracy, unaffordability and lack of relevant information. Further, it provides the means to create and sustain an ecosystem of local (and global) services, information and communities relevant to these underprivileged users.\n\nWWTW is a network of interconnected VoiceSites (analogous to web sites) that are voice driven applications \"created by\" users themselves and \"hosted\" in the telecom network. VoiceSites can be interconnected using 'VoiLinks' (analogous to hyperlinks) which are links between two voice applications within the web. VoiLinks can span across different enterprises enabling cross-organizational workflows driven by a voice interface over an ordinary phone.\n\nKey enabler technologies include:\n\n1. VoiGen - VoiceSite Creator\n\n2. VoiHost - VoiceSite Hosting Engine\n\n3. HSTP - Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol\n\n4. WWTW Browser - World Wide Telecom Web Browser\n\nWorld Wide Telecom Web was conceived by Arun Kumar at IBM India Research Lab during late 2004 and was later joined by fellow researcher Nitendra Rajput in mid-2005. Originally, WWTW was primarily viewed as a novel application of speech technology and VoiceXML standard even though use of VoiceSites for under-privileged was one of the listed benefits. During the course of a year, they refined the vision and built a couple of primitive prototypes of VoiceSite generator application christened VoiGen, with the help of fellow researcher Dipanjan Chakraborty and colleague Sandeep Jindal & Rajiv Goyal. In late 2006, inspired by Prof. C.K. Prahalad and led by Ponani Gopalakrishnan (then the director of IBM India Research Lab), Arun and Nitendra along with Dipanjan and Amit Anil Nanavati got funded for an Exploratory Research project to develop technologies for people towards the Base of the Pyramid. Here, WWTW shot into prominence and got recognized as the most compelling ecosystem for illiterate, low earning population of developing countries such as India. The team reported the work done so far in a Research Report. Soon after Sheetal K. Agarwal joined the team. Together this team designed and built the initial technological building blocks of Telecom Web details of which can be found in publications available at World Wide Telecom Web Publications.\nThis included creation of technology for enabling voice driven workflows spanning across organizational boundaries. Arun proposed the use of out-of-band-signaling mechanism, followed in telecom networks to achieve this. The resulting Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol (HSTP) got designed and created by the team as an HTTP equivalent protocol that enables voice hyperlinks in VoiceSites. The team designed and built the first prototype of this protocol in mid-2007 and reported it in Hypertext Conference in September 2007. The first successful field trial of VoiceSites as a powerful platform for underprivileged population came in the form of Voikiosk system conceived primarily by Nitendra. It is a village portal providing locally relevant content in local language and is available over an ordinary telephone call.\n\n\n\n"}
