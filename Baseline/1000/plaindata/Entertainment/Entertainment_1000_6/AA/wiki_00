It began at 7:00 PM (IST) on 3 October 2010 ending at 10:00 PM (IST) displaying India's varied culture in a plethora of cultural showcases. Wizcraft was given the contract to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2010 Commonwealth Games.\n\nThe following were the guests that attended the opening ceremony of the 2010 Commonwealth Games:\nCharles, Prince of Wales (representing Elizabeth II as Head of the Commonwealth) and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall attended the ceremony.\n\nA total of three heads of state from outside India attended the opening ceremony; two from Commonwealth nations and one from a non-Commonwealth nation. The three head of states are Mohamed Nasheed, President of the Maldives, Marcus Stephen, President of Nauru and a multiple Commonwealth gold medallist, and Albert II, Prince of Monaco, a former Olympian, whose country Monaco is not a member of the Commonwealth. Sir Anand Satyanand, the Governor General of New Zealand (the first of Indian descent), attended the ceremony as well.\n\nAlongside the Commonwealth president, attendees included International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge. He was quoted as saying \"I think India has set a good foundation stone for the Olympics bid and a successful Commonwealth Games can help India mount a serious bid for the Olympics.\"\n\nThe opening ceremony featured aspects of India's heritage and culture in seven segments. It featured an aerostat costing U$8 million, measuring 40×80x12 meters and manufactured in Oswestry, England. The original plan was to have drummers on the aerostat, but the plan was cancelled. The ceremony started with the Indian national anthem which was played live at the stadium. The roof of the stadium turned into orange colour and the ground was lit up with three colours of the Indian flag - orange in the center, white in the middle and green near the boundary. \n\nThe countdown for the opening of commonwealth games started as the drums were being played, and fireworks exploded from the roof of the stadium. The aerostat slowly raised from the ground to the center space of the roof while a traditional Rajasthani hymn was being played by the musicians. Various Drummers from Kerala, Manipur, Karnataka, Orissa, Punjab and Meghalaya played a symphony that aimed to be \"uniquely Indian in character, yet global in appeal\". Seven year old tabla player Keshav from Puducherry played the tabla instrument in front of the audience live and he was given a big applause from the audience.\n\nHariharan led this segment, which created an amalgamation of Hindustani classical, Carnatic and folk music. The song was composed by A. R. Rahman, who also composed the official theme song of the games, and was performed by various artists along with Hariharan. Children from various Delhi schools participated in a simultaneous performance forming hands of an Indian woman in a pose of Namaste - a popular Indian salutation. Later, they separated and rearranged themselves in another formation representing the Indian flag colors of saffron, white and green while another group of children entered the stadium and covered the flag formations with a large white cloth. In a widely appreciated act, the children then made a mehndi - a traditional Indian art - on this large white piece of cloth in under 30 seconds on the spot.\n\nPt. Birju Maharaj (Kathak), Guru Rajkumar Singhajit Singh-Charu Sija Mathur (Manipuri), Dr. Saroja Vaidyanathan (Bharatnatyam), Dr. Sonal Mansingh (Odissi), Bharati Shivaji (Mohiniattam) and Raja Reddy-Radha Reddy (Kuchipudi) choreographed 480 dancers bringing alive India's \"Guru-Shishya Parampara\" or the master-protege tradition on stage through classical dance recitals which also depicted four different seasons of India. The aerostat (the largest ever helium balloon built for such an event) formed the leaves of the Bodhi tree, while large strips elevated from the ground, made of silk and bamboo fibre form the tree trunk.\n\nThis segment will give a glimpse of the lives of the masses in India, as seen through a train window. Art director Omung Kumar created a 600-ft train of bamboo sticks for this. It portrayed a common man's life and every thing in it, such as the bangle shops, politicians campaigning, Bollywood, the cycle shop etc.\n\nAcademy and Grammy award winner A.R. Rahman ended the programme with his rendition of \"Jiyo Utho Bado Jeeto\", the theme song of the Delhi games, and \"Jai Ho\".\n\nAustralia entered first as the host of the last games, and India entered last as the host. Excluding these two nations, the flag bearers entered by alphabetical order of their nations; Anguilla was the first (after Australia) and Zambia was the last (before India). Each flag bearer was preceded by a woman in traditional Indian dress, each reflecting a different part of the country, carrying a placard with the country's name.\n\n\nIn the opening ceremony the head of organizing committee faced embarrassment, when he was booed by the spectators at the start of his welcome speech to 60,000 spectators in the opening ceremony. The atmosphere otherwise for the teams and officials was fine, especially when they offered warm applause to the neighbouring Pakistan squad, with whom it has tense relationships. Sri Lanka also got a loud applause. The head finished his speech in five minutes and then handed over to Michael Fennell, the Chief of the Commonwealth Games Federation.\n\nBoxer Vijender Singh carried the Queen's Baton into the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, at the Opening Ceremony. The baton was then passed to boxer Mary Kom, 5-time world champion. It was then passed to Samresh Jung, who was named best competitor of the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia . It was then passed to Sushil Kumar, world champion wrestler, who finally handed the Queen's Baton to The Prince of Wales.\n\n"}
{"id": "417849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=417849", "title": "Action game", "text": "Action game\n\nThe action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges, including hand–eye coordination and reaction-time. The genre includes a large variety of sub-genres, such as fighting games, beat 'em ups, shooter games and platform games which are widely considered the most important action games, though multiplayer online battle arena and some real-time strategy games are also considered to be action games.\n\nIn an action game, the player typically controls a character often in the form of a protagonist or avatar. This player character must navigate a level, collecting objects, avoiding obstacles, and battling enemies with their natural skills as well as weapons and other tools at their disposal. At the end of a level or group of levels, the player must often defeat a boss enemy that is more challenging and often a major antagonist in the game's story. Enemy attacks and obstacles deplete the player character's health and lives, and the player receives a Game over when they run out of lives. Alternatively, the player gets to the end of the game by finishing a sequence of levels and seeing the credits. But some action games, such as early arcade games, are unbeatable and have an indefinite number of levels; with the player's only goal being to get as far as they can to maximize their score.\n\nThe action genre includes any game where the player overcomes challenges by physical means such as precise aim and quick response times. Action games can sometimes incorporate other challenges such as races, puzzles, or collecting objects, but they are not central to the genre. Players may also encounter tactical and exploration challenges, but these games first-and-foremost require high reaction speed and good hand–eye coordination. The player is often under time pressure, and there is not enough time for complex strategic planning. In general, faster action games are more challenging. Action games may sometimes involve puzzle solving, but they are usually quite simple because the player is under immense time pressure.\n\nPlayers advance through an action game by completing a series of levels. Levels are often grouped by theme, with similar graphics and enemies called a world. Each level involves a variety of challenges, whether dancing in a dance game or shooting things in a shooter, which the player must overcome to win the game. Older games force players to restart a level after dying, although action games evolved to offer saved games and checkpoints to allow the player to restart partway through a level. Increasingly, though, some games allow for 'resurrection' or 'cloning' and the opportunity to regain lost items upon death for a certain sum of ingame currency, typically increasing exponentially the more times the player dies. The obstacles and enemies in a level do not usually vary between play sessions, allowing players to learn by trial and error. However, levels sometimes add an element of randomness, such as an enemy that randomly appears or that takes an unpredictable path.\n\nLevels in an action game may be linear or nonlinear, and sometimes include shortcuts. For levels that require exploration, the player may need to search for a level exit that is hidden or guarded by enemies. Such levels can also contain secrets—hidden or hard-to-reach objects or places that contain something valuable. The prize can be a bonus (see below) or a non-standard exit that allows a player to access a hidden level, or jump ahead several levels. Action games sometimes offer a teleporter that will cause the player's avatar to re-appear elsewhere in the same level. Levels often make use of locked doors that can only be opened with a specific key found elsewhere in the level.\n\nAction games sometimes make use of time restrictions to increase the challenge. However, game levels typically do not react to time passing, and day/night cycles are rare. When the timer expires, the player typically loses a life, although some games generate a difficult enemy or challenge. If the level is completed with time remaining, this usually adds to the player's score.\n\nIn most action games, the player controls a single avatar as the protagonist. The avatar has the ability to navigate and maneuver, and often collects or manipulates objects. They have a range of defenses and attacks, such as shooting or punching. Many action games make use of a powerful attack that destroys all enemies within a limited range, but this attack is rare.\n\nPlayers may find a power-up within the game world that grants temporary or permanent improvements to their abilities. For example, the avatar may gain an increase in speed, more powerful attacks, or a temporary shield from attacks. Some action games even allow players to spend upgrade points on the power ups of their choice.\n\nIn action games that involve navigating a space, players will encounter obstacles, traps, and enemies. Enemies typically follow fixed patterns and attack the player, although newer action games may make use of more complex artificial intelligence to pursue the player. Enemies sometimes appears in groups or waves, with enemies increasing in strength and number until the end of the level. Enemies may also appear out of thin air. This can involve an invisible spawn point, or a visible generator which can be destroyed by the player. These points may generate enemies indefinitely, or only up to a certain number. At the end of a level or group of themed levels, players often encounter a boss. This boss enemy will often resemble a larger or more difficult version of a regular enemy. A boss may require a special weapon or attack method, such as striking when the boss opens their mouth or attacking particular part of the Boss.\n\nIn many action games, the avatar has a certain number of hit-markers or health, which are depleted by enemy attacks and other hazards. Sometimes health can be replenished by collecting an in-game object. When the player runs out of health, the player dies. The player's avatar is often given a small number of chances to retry after death, typically referred to as lives. Upon beginning a new life, the player resumes the game either from the same location they died, a checkpoint, or the start of the level. Upon starting a new life, the avatar is typically invincible for a few seconds to allow the player to re-orient themselves. Players may earn extra lives by reaching a certain score or by finding an in-game object. Arcade games still limit the number of player lives, while home video games have shifted increasingly to unlimited lives.\n\nAction games take place in either 2D or 3D from a variety of perspectives. 2D action games typically use a side view or top-down view. The screen frequently scrolls as the player explores the level, although many games scroll through the level automatically to push the player forward. In 3D action games, the perspective is usually tied to the avatar from a first-person or third-person perspective. However, some 3D games offer a context-sensitive perspective that is controlled by an artificial intelligence camera. Most of what the player needs to know is contained within a single screen, although action games frequently make use of a heads-up display that display important information such as health or ammunition. Action games sometimes make use of maps which can be accessed during lulls in action, or a mini-map that is always visible.\n\nAction games tend to set simple goals, and reaching them is obvious. A common goal is to defeat the end-of-game boss. This is often presented in the form of a structured story, with a happy ending upon winning the game. In some games, the goal changes as the player reveals more of the story.\n\nMany action games keep track of the player's score. Points are awarded for completing certain challenges, or defeating certain enemies. Skillful play is often rewarded with point multipliers, such as in \"Pac-Man\" where each ghost that the avatar eats will generate twice as many points as the last. Sometimes action games will offer bonus objects that increase the player's score. There is no penalty for failing to collect them, although these bonus objects may unlock hidden levels or special events. In many action games, achieving a high score is the only goal, and levels increase in difficulty until the player loses. Arcade games are more likely to be unbeatable, as they make their money by forcing the player to lose the game. On the other hand, games sold at home are more likely to have discrete victory conditions, since a publisher wants the player to purchase another game when they are done.\n\nAction games have several major subgenres. However, there are many action games without any clear subgenre, such as \"Frogger\", as well as other types of genres like Adventure or Strategy that have action elements.\n\nAction-adventure games mix elements of both action and adventure genres, examples include The Legend of Zelda, Assassin's Creed and Grand Theft Auto series.\n\nBeat 'em ups are games that involve fighting through a side-scrolling stage of multiple adversaries, using martial arts or other close-range fighting techniques.\n\nFighting games feature combat between pairs of fighters, usually using martial arts moves. Actions are limited to various attacks and defenses, and matches end when a fighter's health is reduced to zero. They often make use of special moves and combos. There are both 2D and 3D fighting games, but most 3D fighting games largely take place in a 2D plane and occasionally include side-stepping. They are distinct from sports games such as boxing and wrestling games which attempt to model movements and techniques more realistically.\n\nMaze games such as \"Pac-Man\" involve navigating a maze to avoid or chase adversaries.\n\nPlatform games involve jumping between platforms of different heights, while battling enemies and avoiding obstacles. Physics are often unrealistic, and game levels are often vertically exaggerated. They exist in both 2D and 3D forms.\n\nRhythm action games challenge the player's sense of rhythm, and award points for accurately pressing certain buttons in sync with a musical beat. This is a relatively new subgenre of action game. Rhythm games are sometimes classified as a type of music game.\n\nShooter games allow the player to take action at a distance using a ranged weapon, challenging them to aim with accuracy. Although shooting is usually a form of violence, non-violent shooters exist as well, such as Splatoon. This subgenre includes first-person shooters and third-person shooters, as well as a plethora of other shoot 'em up games taking place from a top-down or side-view perspective.\n\nSurvival games start the player off with minimal resources, in a hostile, open-world environment, and require them to collect resources, craft tools, weapons, and shelter, in order to survive as long as possible. Many are set in procedurally-generated environments, and are open-ended with no set goals. They may overlap with the survival horror genre, in which the player must survive within a supernatural setting, such as a zombie apocalypse. A specific subgenre of survival game is battle royale.\n\nStudies have shown that people can improve their eyesight by playing action video games. Tests by scientists at the University of Rochester on college students showed that over a period of a month, performance in eye examinations improved by about 20% in those playing \"Unreal Tournament\" compared to those playing \"Tetris\". Most arcade games are action games, because they can be difficult for unskilled players, and thus make more money quickly.\n\nResearchers from \"Helsinki School of Economics\" have shown that people playing a \"first-person shooter\" might secretly enjoy that their character gets killed in the game, although their expressions might show the contrary. The game used in the study was \"\".\n\nA major turning point for action games came with the 1978 release of the shoot 'em up game \"Space Invaders\", which marked the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games. As a result of \"Space Invaders\"' mainstream success, the industry came to be dominated by action games, which have remained the most dominant genre in video arcades and on game consoles through to the present day. Along with \"Space Invaders\", \"Asteroids\" from 1979 and \"Pac-Man\" from 1980 have also become iconic examples from the action genre. \"\", released in arcades in 1982, also became a classic in the shooter subgenre.\n\nIn much the same way \"Space Invaders\" set the template for the shooter game subgenre, \"Donkey Kong\" did the same for the platform game subgenre when it released in 1981. 1984 saw the emergence of martial arts themed games, with \"Karate Champ\" establishing the one-on-one fighting game subgenre, and \"Kung-Fu Master\" laying the foundations for the side-scrolling beat 'em up subgenre.\n"}
{"id": "14061862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14061862", "title": "Adventure education", "text": "Adventure education\n\nAdventure education is the promotion of learning through adventure centered experiences.\n\nAdventure centered experiences can include a wide variety of activities, due to the different ways people experience adventure. Outdoor sports, challenge courses, races, and even indoor activities can be used in adventure education. Adventure education is related to adventure programming, adventure therapy, and outdoor education. It is an active process rather than a passive process of learning that requires active engagement from the learners as well as the instructors. Often adventure education is linked to an incorporation of all five senses within the experiences which can heighten the opportunities for learning and retaining information. The learning experiences within adventure education programs are structured for a potential increase in human performance and capacity. Sometimes the adventure lies more in the journey than the destination. The venture lies in the struggle, not in the prize.\n\nMerriam-Webster defines adventure as \"an undertaking usually involving danger and unknown risks\". Danger is defined as \"exposure or liability to injury, pain, harm, or loss.\" Danger involves two factors which are perils – the origins of injury or the causes of loss, and hazards – the conditions that emphasize the chance of injury or loss. Risk is defined as \"potential loss or injury\". Risk can be described as \"real risk\" or \"perceived risk\" such as bungee jumping; it seems as though there is a high level of risk, but with proper equipment it can be relatively safe. Danger, then is the exposure, or magnitude, of the harm a person may encounter; risk is the probability of that harm. These two variables are filtered through a person's perceptions, which may or may not be accurate.\n\nConsequently, adventure is created through a person's perception of the magnitude of the potential risk, and the probability of loss. An activity with relatively low magnitude but high probability of harm (such as adventure racing or slacklining) may be just as much of an adventure as an activity with relatively high magnitude and low probability of harm (such as sport rock climbing, skydiving, or riding a roller coaster).\n\nAdventure education has many positive outcomes. A meta-analysis of adventure education studies identified forty major outcomes, grouped into the following six categories: leadership, self-concept, academic, personality, interpersonal, and adventuresomeness. Adventure education often employs practical skills that will benefit an individual in areas beyond the activities in an adventure program. There are three theories of transfer in adventure education in which the participant may apply what they learned into future experiences. The first of these theories is \"specific transfer\" – the learner applies the habits and skills learned during an experience to a new and similar experience (e.g. when an individual learns how to belay during a rock climbing experience and then applies that knowledge to rappelling). The second theory is \"nonspecific transfer\" – the learner establishes some common principles acquired through previous experiences and applies them in a new learning situation (e.g. when an individual develops trust through a trust building activity). The third theory is \"metaphoric transfer\" – the learner applies similar underlying principles to other areas and situations (e.g. when individuals utilize teamwork during an activity such as canoeing and later applies it to the workplace or other group experiences).\n\nThere are six categories of program characteristics that contribute to achieving the program outcomes described above. These are the physical environment, activities, processing, the group, instructors, and the participant.\n\nUnfamiliar environments contribute a great deal to program outcomes experienced by adventure education participants. Being in a new environment allows participants to gain new perspectives on familiar environments and gives them the freedom to experiment. An unfamiliar environment also creates some level of anxiety for the participant, as well as creating the perception of risk. Overcoming the challenges presented by unfamiliar environments through the mastery of specific tasks results in positive benefits to the individual, such as increased self-esteem. Positive outcomes are offered by several types of environments, including wilderness, non-wilderness (e.g. ropes-course), or a traditional classroom. However, wilderness is often considered as providing additional benefits to participants, thus being the optimal environmental setting for adventure education programs.\n\nRather than activities themselves, it is the qualities of activities that are responsible for achieving program outcomes. The combination of challenge, mastery, and success in activities is what led to participant growth. Challenges should be holistic in order to maximize positive outcomes. Programs should include mental, emotional, and physical challenges, and encourage concurrent mastery in all three domains. Challenges should also increase incrementally, so as not to overwhelm participants early on in the program but allow them to grow and develop throughout. Activities should be well organized and matched to suit the particular needs and requirements of the participants. The GRABBS model (Goals, Readiness, Affect, Behavior, Body, and Stage of Development) is a good method for matching activities and participants. Success in the activities must be achievable. However, some failure may also be good for participant development. Program participants can learn from their failures to achieve success. Goal-setting is critical to achieving program outcomes, at both the individual and group levels. It is also important to allow participants to have personal choice related to activities. The \"challenge-by-choice\" philosophy of adventure programming allows the participant to have some autonomy related to the activities s/he participates in.\n\nWhile the qualities of activities are most important in achieving program outcomes, there are also specific activities that are well-suited to adventure programming. These include activities related to trust and empathy (e.g. trust falls), communication, decision-making and problem solving, social responsibility, and personal responsibility.\n\nProcessing is defined as \"the sorting and ordering of information\" that enables program participants to internalize meaning gained from an adventure education experience Three models have been identified by which participants process meaning. In the \"Mountains Speak for Themselves\" model, participants are responsible for reflecting on their experiences on their own, without facilitation from the instructor. In the \"Outward Bound Plus\" model, the instructor serves as a counselor, facilitator, and discussion leader. In the metaphoric model, activities are consciously framed so that they become experiential metaphors that can be applied to challenges in participants' daily lives.\n\nSeveral characteristics of the group also contribute to achieving program outcomes. In terms of the size of the group, small groups of seven to fifteen individuals are usually more conducive to achieving desired outcomes. Reciprocity within the group is also important. This refers to group members learning to cooperate with one another and capitalize on the strengths of each individual. Autonomy of individuals and personal relationships are other aspects of the group that contribute to achievement.\n\nCertain aspects of program instructors such as biographical characteristics, personality, and interpersonal interactions can have a large influence on participants' achievement of desired program outcomes. Instructors may be required to have a Bachelors Degree in Outdoor Leadership to instruct at most Universities and community colleges. Instructors may also be required to hold certain certifications in Wilderness First Responder , American Mountain Guides Single Pitch Instructor and American Canoe Association Whitewater Instructor Certification, among many others.\n\nThe age, gender, background, and expectations of program participants have also been shown to be related to the achievement of program outcomes. Depending on the program a student is in, the program may require the student to be autonomous during expeditionary courses. Student autonomy can be beneficial to students by enhancing personal growth, an increase in self-reliance, and enhancing the overall group experience. However, student autonomy is considered to be controversial in regards to outdoor adventure educational programs, due to risk management concerns. Yet, it is recommended that the instructors of these types of programs must fully understand the risks of student autonomy prior to implementing them as part of an adventure education program.\n\nAdventure education programming can be implemented in several contexts, including therapy for youth at risk, survivors of sexual assault, families in distress, persons with medical conditions, and Veteran assimilation back to civilian life \n\nMany vocational institutes offer training and courses in adventure education. There exists also universities offering degree programs in adventure and outdoor education: \n\nFinland: Humak University of Applied Sciences is offering a 210 ECTS bachelor's degree programme in Adventure and Outdoor Education (Community Educator, Bachelor of Humanities).\n\nNew Zealand: Auckland University of Technology is offering a bachelor's degree in Sport and Recreation - Outdoor Education.\n\nUnited Kingdom: University of Chichester has been running its adventure education degree since 2000.\n\nUSA: Plymouth State University in Plymouth, New Hampshire offers a Bachelors of Science in Adventure Education.\n\nUSA: Oregon State University in Corvallis and Bend, Oregon offers a Bachelor of Science in Tourism Recreation and Adventure Leadership. \n\n"}
{"id": "12753408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12753408", "title": "Adventure park", "text": "Adventure park\n\nAn adventure park is a place which can contain a wide variety of elements, such as rope climbing exercises, obstacle courses and zip-lines. They are usually intended for recreation.\n\n\"Recreational-oriented\" adventure parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors. They do not follow a specific educational concept, but see the individual, physical and mental challenge as a predominantly recreational activity. Neither climbing techniques nor special/specific physical fitness experience are necessary. Typical slogans are: \"Have Fun, Test your Courage, Overcome your Own Fears, Be Outside, Be in the Nature, Do some Physical Activities, etc.\"\n\nIt is unclear where and when the first ropes course was created. A ropes course was built in 1875 in France and functioned mainly as a physical challenge activity for the participants. During the Second World War, ropes courses were used as obstacle courses for improving the physical fitness of the British military.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, ropes courses became a central component of outdoor seminars in the United States.\n\nIn recent years, specifically recreation-oriented Adventure Parks were developed. The market has boomed especially in Europe & Asian countries.\n\nAs already mentioned, a ropes course is often a challenging outdoor personal development and team-building activity with a relatively low number of participants. Some parks offer both - a recreational section and a team building section.\n\nA canopy tour is a specific type of ziplining where a person is harnessed to a steel cable and propelled by gravity from platform to platform high up in the trees of a thick forest canopy. Although these date back far into history for civil and even scientific uses, they are now used for recreation and have created a new activity for the tourism industry.\n\nThe category Adventure Parks can be broken down into a huge variety of specific types. They differ according to the following main criteria:\n\nForest Adventure Parks are very popular. They take advantage of the beauty of a forest, of the trees (no investment in poles) and offer an outdoor activity surrounded by nature. They offer not only an adventure “at height” in a forest, but also the benefit for customers of experiencing the spectacular natural beauty of trees, hills, cliffs and/or rivers. In forest parks, there is a particular focus on tree-friendly installation. In most cases, the platforms are held to the trees through the principle of friction. When the exercise elements are mounted, the trees are protected by coats of wood or rubber to prevent rubbing from the ropes.\n\nDepending on how they are used and where they are located, parks on poles are an excellent alternative. They offer complete freedom in terms of park design and location but, at the same time, require higher investment (in the poles). The heat of the summer can be a challenge. A mix of poles/trees at the edge of a forest has the potential to work well.\nIndoor parks have the great advantage of being an “all year round” operation but with the corresponding weakness of that strength at times when fine weather encourages outdoor activities. These trails are often built on a modular metallic structure. New parks on wood poles have shown that an indoor park can also provide a good experience.\n\nAdventure Parks can be found in a multitude of places/locations. Examples of trends:\n\nLarge Adventure Parks usually have several trails of increasing difficulty levels and can reach up to 10 trails. With 10 to 20 acrobatic elements per trail, the park can easily reach up to 200 elements (it is usually between 40 and 200 elements).\n\nThe majority of trails are for everyone from the age of 7 years old (sometimes 10). The difficulty level starts at a low level or “green trail” and progresses to a very challenging level or “black trail”. Specific trails for kids from 4 years are very popular with families and provide a boost to the business (up to 20-30% more clients). Sometimes there are specific trails for the disabled.\n\nMost kids love Adventure Parks. In a park they can act independently, try and fail and try again, and overcome their own fears without any risk (a continuous belay system is strongly recommended). Thanks the variety of levels, each time they can push their own boundaries and reach their own challenges. This is a perfect outdoor activity (with individual, physical and mental challenges) to learn through play.\n\nThe acrobatic elements are artificial obstacles (exercises) made from ropes, nets and wood in various forms, and which are installed at different heights in trees. The clever arrangement of such obstacles encourages many basic forms of movement such as climbing, hand over hand, balancing, holding, slipping and sliding. A good mix of elements and zip-lines increases the diversity and interest of parks – People love zip-lines.\n\nThere are two approaches to how to structure a park: (1) the so-called French approach where you move from one trail to the next one, like setting out on a trip and coming back to the start or (2) more the Swiss approach with one common starting point (often a platform) where the visitors can choose anytime which trail they want to go. The latter approach has the great advantage to be self-distributing and therefore allowing higher throughput by peak.\nThere are 2 schools concerning the height of the lifeline:\n\nConcerning the safety, traditionally a self-safety system is used where participants take responsibility for themselves. Before starting, the participants receive special training in how to use the safety equipment and then run the various trails independently. The emergence of new technologies has drastically increased the level of safety and opened new business opportunities.\n\nThe safety equipment for each participant basically consists of a harness, a lanyard and a belay system (another option would simply be a net under the trails – relatively expensive and with limited application). Sometimes helmets are also used.\n\nThere are distinctions between the following main four belay systems:\n\nThe traditional self-belay system basically consists of two carabiners operated by the participants. The participants successively unlock/lock the connection of the carabiners on each platform (zone of risk). Mishandling and removal of both carabiners at the same time will cause complete unlocking. This situation could mean a life-threatening risk and there have been instances of serious accidents and even terminal injuries.\n\nThe permanent belay systems significantly reduce the risk of accident. The two carabiners have a \"communicating system” which avoids simultaneous opening of the carabiners and the complete unlocking from the cable. A permanent system with integrated rollers can even be found.\n\nThe continuous belay systems on rail offer a high level of safety but has limited application – it is mainly on poles with a heavy structure, for relatively short elements and it is expensive (and more common in the USA than in Europe).\n\nWith a continuous belay system on cable, visitors are continuously connected to the lifeline (cable) from the start to the finish without any possibility of becoming unlocked - which provides the highest safety level. At the start of the trail, the visitors simply connect the lifeline into the belay device (hook or trolley) and they can run the whole trail – in term of safety, no specific further action is required. \nFor the continuous belay system with integrated trolley, the belay device simply rolls along the whole lifeline and greatly eases the passage on zip-lines (no handling required). This last technology is the only system allowing the lifeline to be “out of reach” which has numerous advantages (higher throughput, more impressive elements, more convenience, lower risk of injury)\n\nRecreational-oriented Adventure Parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors: In Europe 10,000 to 60,000 or even more participants per season are common (usually April to October) and often with a high variation pattern (high attendance on weekends and during vacations).\n\nThe key challenges are manifold: attractive value proposition, pool of potential clients, safety level & risk management, needs of training & supervision and flexible operation.\n\nIn order to ensure a profitable and sustainable operation, meeting the last three challenges is essential.

{"id": "3556316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3556316", "title": "Apples and oranges", "text": "Apples and oranges\n\nA comparison of apples and oranges occurs when two items or groups of items are compared that cannot be practically compared.\n\nThe idiom, \"comparing apples and oranges\", refers to the apparent differences between items which are popularly thought to be incomparable or incommensurable, such as apples and oranges. The idiom may also be used to indicate that a false analogy has been made between two items, such as where an \"apple\" is faulted for not being a good \"orange\".\n\nThe idiom is not unique to English. In Quebec French, it may take the form \"comparer des pommes avec des oranges\" (to compare apples and oranges), while in European French the idiom says \"comparer des pommes et des poires\" (to compare apples and pears). In Latin American Spanish, it is usually \"comparar papas y boniatos\" (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or commonly for all varieties of Spanish \"comparar peras con manzanas\" (comparing pears and apples). In some other languages the term for 'orange' derives from 'apple', suggesting not only that a direct comparison between the two is possible, but that it is implicitly present in their names. Fruit other than apples and oranges can also be compared; for example, apples and pears are compared in Danish, Dutch, German, Spanish, Swedish, Croatian, Czech, Romanian, Hungarian, Italian, Slovene, Luxembourgish, Serbian, and Turkish. In fact, in the Spanish-speaking world, a common idiom is \"sumar peras con manzanas\", that is, \"to add pears and apples\"; the same thing applies in Italian (\"sommare le mele con le pere\") and Romanian (\"a aduna merele cu perele\"). In Portuguese, the expression is \"comparar laranjas com bananas\" (compare orange to banana). In Czech, the idiom \"míchat jablka s hruškami\" literally means 'to mix apples and pears'.\n\nSome languages use completely different items, such as the Serbian \"Поредити бабе и жабе\" (comparing grandmothers and toads), or the Romanian \"baba şi mitraliera\" (the grandmother and the machine gun); \"vaca şi izmenele\" (the cow and the longjohns); or \"țiganul şi carioca\" (the gypsy and the marker), or the Welsh \"mor wahanol â mêl a menyn\" (as different as honey and butter), while some languages compare dissimilar properties of dissimilar items. For example, an equivalent Danish idiom, \"Hvad er højest, Rundetårn eller et tordenskrald?\" means \"What is highest, the Round Tower or a thunderclap?\", referring to the size of the former and the sound of the latter. In Russian, the phrase \"сравнивать тёплое с мягким\" (to compare warm and soft) is used. In Argentina, a common question is \"¿En qué se parecen el amor y el ojo del hacha?\" (What do love and the eye of an axe have in common?) and emphasizes dissimilarity between two subjects; in Colombia, a similar (though more rude) version is common: \"confundir la mierda con la pomada\" (to confuse shit with ointment). In Polish, the expression \"co ma piernik do wiatraka?\" is used, meaning \"What has (is) gingerbread to a windmill?\". In Chinese, a phrase that has the similar meaning is 风马牛不相及 (fēng mǎ niú bù xiāng jí), literally meaning \"horses and cattles won't mate with each other\", and later used to describe things that are totally unrelated and incomparable.\n\nA number of more exaggerated comparisons are sometimes made, in cases in which the speaker believes the two objects being compared are radically different. For example, \"oranges with orangutans\", \"apples with dishwashers\", and so on. In English, different fruits, such as pears, plums, or lemons are sometimes substituted for oranges in this context.\n\nSometimes the two words sound similar, for example, Romanian \"merele cu perele\" (apples and pears) and the Hungarian \"szezont a fazonnal\" (the season with the fashion).\n\nAt least two tongue-in-cheek scientific studies have been conducted on the subject, each of which concluded that apples can be compared with oranges fairly easily and on a low budget and the two fruits are quite similar.\n\nThe first study, conducted by Scott A. Sandford of the NASA Ames Research Center, used infrared spectroscopy to analyze both apples and oranges. The study, which was published in the satirical science magazine \"Annals of Improbable Research\", concluded: \"[...] the comparing apples and oranges defense should no longer be considered valid. This is a somewhat startling revelation. It can be anticipated to have a dramatic effect on the strategies used in arguments and discussions in the future.\"\n\nA second study, written by Stamford Hospital's surgeon-in-chief James Barone and published in the \"British Medical Journal,\" noted that the phrase \"apples and oranges\" was appearing with increasing frequency in the medical literature, with some notable articles comparing \"Desflurane and propofol\" and \"Salmeterol and ipratropium\" with \"apples and oranges\". The study also found that both apples and oranges were sweet, similar in size, weight, and shape, that both are grown in orchards, and both may be eaten, juiced, and so on. The only significant differences found were in terms of seeds (the study used seedless oranges), the involvement of Johnny Appleseed, and color.\n\nThe \"Annals of Improbable Research\" subsequently noted that the \"earlier investigation was done with more depth, more rigour, and, most importantly, more expensive equipment\" than the \"British Medical Journal\" study.\n\nOn April Fools' Day 2014, \"The Economist\" compared worldwide production of apples and oranges from 1983 to 2013, however noted them to be \"unrelated variables\".\n\nWhile references to comparing apples and oranges are often a rhetorical device, references to adding apples and oranges are made in the case of teaching students the proper uses of units. Here, the admonition not to \"add apples and oranges\" refers to the requirement that two quantities with different units may not be combined by addition, although they may always be combined in ratio form by multiplication, so that multiplying ratios of apples and oranges is allowed. Similarly, the concept of this distinction is often used metaphorically in elementary algebra.\n\nThe admonition is really more of a mnemonic, since in general counts of objects have no intrinsic unit and, for example, a number count of apples may be dimensionless or have dimension \"fruit\"; in either of these two cases, apples and oranges may indeed be added.\n\n"}
{"id": "3329308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3329308", "title": "Applied Drama", "text": "Applied Drama\n\nApplied Drama, also known as Applied Theatre, Interactive Theatre or Applied Drama and Theatre (ADT) is an umbrella term for the use of drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context. It is often done in non-theatrical spaces, with participants who do not consider themselves to be artists.\n\nThere are several forms and practices considered to be under the umbrella of Applied Drama. In all these fields approaches and methods of Applied Improvisation are used. \n\nApplied Drama is a term that has been contested, gaining popularity towards the end of the 20th century to describe drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.\n\nJames Thompson states that \"Applied theatre is a participatory theatre created by people who would not usually make theatre. It is, I would hope, a practice by, with and for the excluded and marginalised.\" \n\nJudith Ackyroyd confirms the inclusion of both of these elements in ADT: \"I have identified two features which I believe to be central to our understanding of applied theatre; an intention to generate change (of awareness, attitude, behaviour, etc), and the participation of the audience.\"\n\nApplied drama can be either scripted or unscripted. Some practitioners focus primarily on improvisation, whereas others introduce a range of artistic practices, such as developing scripted plays, devised performances, or indigenous forms of cultural performance, sometimes combined with new forms of digital communication.\n\nPlayback Theatre involves audience or group members telling stories from their lives and viewing them as enacted by actors improvising. It can also be used in conjunction with Narrative Therapy.\n\nDrama in healthcare is drama created in medical contexts, often with the intention of rehabilitation.\n\nThis form of Applied Drama focuses on using theatre to educate, engage, and stimulate healing in medical professionals, patients, and the general public. Theatre and drama in healthcare are tilted towards conscientizing the populace about their health and improving their health and longevity irrespective of status or social stratification. This form of drama is often used to educate people on important health issues such as healthy eating, grief and loss, exercise, and sexual assault prevention. Examples include using actors to role-play health ailments in order to train healthcare professionals, performing plays focused on primary prevention, and facilitating drama workshops for patients.\n\nDrama therapy is the use of Applied Drama techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote mental health.\n\nDrama therapy is rooted in a clinical practice, facilitated by licensed clinicians, that stimulates language, cognitive development and builds resilience.\n\nTheatre for Development uses Applied Drama techniques to facilitate development in less developed countries.\n\nDrama in Education can allow students to develop an understanding of themselves and others. Kathleen Galllagher has argued that 'What is clear is that there is no correct pedagogical model on offer for drama education. [...] In theatre pedagogy, we not only endow experience with meaning, but we are - as players - invited to make manifest our own subjectivities in the world evoked through character and play, a world laden with metaphor and nuance, a world where relationship to other and self-spectatorship are in dynamic and unrelenting interaction.'\n\nTheatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in the mid-1960s. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cite TIE as \"one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice.\" TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.\n\nPractitioner Lynn Hoare defines TIE as a combination of \"theatrical elements with interactive moments in which audience participants (in or out of role) work with actor-teachers towards an educational or social goal, using the tools of theatre in service of this goal.\"\n\nScholar Helen Nicholson notes that this work \"involves professional theatre-makers working with young people in all kinds of educational settings and learning environments, including schools, hospitals, theaters, museums and heritage sites.\"\n\nTIE seeks to educate young people in issues that are relevant to both them and their communities, for example: bullying, dating violence, environmental preservation, and peer conflict resolution. \"TIE companies have always been among the most socially conscious of theatre groups, consistently choosing to examine issues they believe to be of direct relevance to the lives of the children with whom they work.\"\n\n\"Theatre for Dialogue\" (TFD) is a more recent term describing a model that was created specifically for the University of Texas at Austin campus community which pulls methods and theory from a variety of applied theatre practices such as TO and TIE. In her thesis, Spring Snyder explains that \"Theatre For Dialogue performances explore the intersection between theatre and education as a way to investigate, reflect, provoke dialogue and serve as a rehearsal for reality without asking participants to share their own personal experiences. Although some of the Theatre For Dialogue’s roots originate from an adapted form of Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed’s forum structure, it is Theatre in Education (TIE) that more closely aligns with TFD.\"\n\nIn prison theatre, practitioners engage offenders in correctional facilities, jails, prisons, and detention centers in exploring drama work often with the objective of education or rehabilitation.\n\nExamples include Wabash Valley Correctional Facility’s \"Shakespeare in Shackles\" where maximum security prisoners learn about and perform Shakespeare. The University of Texas’ Center for Women and Gender Studies’ Performing Justice Project works with incarcerated female youth to learn about gender and racial justice while devising a play based on the youth’s unique experiences.\n\nThe Theatre of the Oppressed (TO) describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal first developed in the 1960s, initially in Brazil and later in Europe. Boal's techniques aim to use theatre as means of promoting social and political change through allowing the audience to take an active role in the creation of the show. Theatre of the Oppressed can include aspects of Forum Theatre, Invisible Theatre, Legislative Theatre and Image Theatre.\n\nMuseum theatre aims to use theatrical techniques to add emotion and value to the museum experience. It is typically more common in cultural institutions like heritage sites, history museums, and science and industry museums. As with the other forms of applied drama, it can involve a variety of theatrical techniques.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1227744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1227744", "title": "Bourgeois tragedy", "text": "Bourgeois tragedy\n\nBourgeois tragedy (German: \"Bürgerliches Trauerspiel\") is a form of tragedy that developed in 18th-century Europe. It is a fruit of the enlightenment and the emergence of the bourgeois class and its ideals. It is characterized by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens.\n\nThere are a few examples of tragic plays with middle-class protagonists from 17th century England (see domestic tragedy), but only in the 18th century did the general attitude change. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play: George Lillo's \"The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell\", which was first performed in 1731. In France, the first \"tragédie bourgeoise\" was \"Sylvie\" by Paul Landois, which came out in 1741. Years later came two plays by Denis Diderot: \"Le fils naturel\" was first staged in 1757 and \"Le père de famille\" in the following year; while these plays were not strictly tragedies, they treat bourgeois lives in a serious manner atypical of contemporary comedy and provided models for more genuinely tragic works.\n\nWhile ordinary people had always been the subject of comedies, classical and neo-classical theorists asserted that tragic heroes should always be men of noble rank. Aristotle articulates this idea in \"ars poetica\" (\"The Poetics\") and it figures prominently in later ancient writings on drama and poetics. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century critics, including the influential German Martin Opitz, perpetuated the theory that only members of the higher classes were capable of suffering harm serious enough to deserve dramatic reenactment. This rule was followed throughout Europe for centuries: usually, princes and members of the nobility, such as Andreas Gryphius' Carolus Stuardus (i.e. King Charles I of England), Jean Racine's Phèdre (the wife of Theseus, a mythical king of Athens) or William Shakespeare's King Lear, serve as tragic protagonists.\n\nIn Germany, where the new genre was called \"Bürgerliches Trauerspiel\", it was especially successful. Usually, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's play \"Miss Sara Sampson\", which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest \"Bürgerliches Trauerspiel\" in Germany. However, Christian Leberecht Martini's drama \"Rhynsolt und Sapphira\" is slightly older. Lessing's \"Emilia Galotti\" of 1771 is a classic example of the German Bürgerliches Trauerspiel. Lessing also offered a thorough theoretic justification for his disregard of the old rules in his \"Hamburgische Dramaturgie\". Other important examples of German Bürgerliche Trauerspiele are \"Die Soldaten\" by Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz (1776) and Friedrich Schiller's \"Kabale und Liebe\" (1784). \n\nBourgeois tragedies tend to propagate the values of the bourgeois class to which their heroes belong. Their ideal is the virtuous citizen, who is excluded from state affairs and whose intentions are focused on his private life and the life of his family. Values like virtue, humanity, individuality and true feelings are cherished in bourgeois tragedies.\n"}

Cats' behaviors when playing are similar to hunting behaviors. These activities allow kittens and younger cats to grow and acquire cognitive and motor skills, and to socialize with other cats. Cat play behavior can be either solitary (with toys or other objects) or social (with animals and people). They can play with a multitude of toys ranging from strings, to small furry toys resembling what would be prey (e.g. mice), to plastic bags.\n\nObject play for animals (in this case, cats) is the use of inanimate objects by the animal to express play behaviour. In the case of pet domestic cats, humans normally provide them with purchased, human-made toys such as toy mice. When it comes to non-domestic, wild cats, they may use several objects in the wilderness as their toys including sticks, leaves, rocks, feathers, etc. Actions that cats may carry out as this play behaviour include throwing the toy object, chasing, biting, capturing, etc. as they might do with a real source of prey. Engaging in object play helps young cats to practice these skills that they need as they grow into adults.\n\nPlay in cats is a behaviour that is brought about during growth from the kitten stage onward. Some important aspects of this play behaviour for the development of kittens in to adult cats include motor development, social behaviour and cognitive development. There are different types of play that develop at different stages during the development and growth of a kitten. The first play behaviours observed in kittens include things like approaching, pawing and holding onto each other. Following this stage in their development, kittens begin to show an interest in inanimate objects and prey behaviour. This is the development of their nonsocial behaviour in which they become more independent and begin to practice predatory/hunting behaviour. Play behaviour in kittens is also important in providing them with physical exercise as they are growing, as well as providing a means of interacting with other members of their litter to keep strong social bonds among them. Social play is important between litter-mates since this is the main source of play for kittens in early life with little alternative to other means of play. Kittens are limited in room for exploring for other means of play, so engaging in this social play behaviour is important until they have access to other play objects such as toys. \n\nSince cats are meat-eating predators, nearly all cat games are predatory games.\n\nPrey are fearful of predators. Predators often encounter prey that attempt to escape predation. Prey that move towards the cat with confidence may be exhibiting an aggressive defensive posture. Cats often play with toys that behave more like fearful prey trying to escape than toys that mimic more confrontational prey.\n\nSuccess rate is important in play. A cat that catches its prey every time soon gets bored, and a cat that never gets it just loses interest. The ideal hunting success rate is around 1 in 3 to 1 in 6. Capturing prey at this rate generally maximises a cat's interest in the game.\n\nPlay is about predatory behaviour, and a highly excited cat can cause minor injuries in the excitement of the moment. With most cats, it is wise to keep playthings at least 20 cm (8\") away from fingers or eyes and avoid encouraging a cat to eat inedible toys. If playing with a human's bare hands, a cat will generally resist using its claws or biting too hard, but a cat that becomes extremely excited may accidentally inflict injuries to its human playmate in the form of light scratches or small puncture wounds from biting too hard. Cats' claws and mouths can contain bacteria that can lead to infection, so it is wise to clean and treat any wounds with an antiseptic solution and seek professional medical services if there is reason to believe that the wound has become infected.\n\nCatching and eating are two closely related but separate activities. Domestic cats often store caught food for eating later. Eating happens when the game is over, so incorporating food into hunting games tends to end the interest in play. Hidden treats helps engage cat's senses such as sense of smell and can be a form of play which enables them to utilize their searching skills. This idea of treats linked with play helps cats form the association that treats signify happy behaviour.\n\nThere are several different motor patterns associated with the play behaviour of cats and they have different roles in the social context. Pouncing is one of these motor patterns in which it is used to initiate play through physical contact. Chasing and horizontal leaping is an example of a motor pattern that may be used by a cat to end play. The movement of a cat's tail during play and the varying rates at which the cat may move its tail can even be a useful indicator of its level of playfulness. There are patterns of belly-up and stand-up actions that are engaged in by kittens in which seem to show that they prefer to engage in physical contact play in terms of their social role among other kittens.\n\nHunger has been shown to give an increase in intensity in the play behaviour of cats, and a decrease in fear which they show towards larger-sized toys. This effect that hunger has on play behaviour may be attributed to how experienced of a hunter the cat is. It is not expected that a cat who has a higher level of hunting experience would show this increased intensity of their play behaviour when hungry. Instead, they are more likely to show more predatory behaviour. In the case of cats with a lower level of hunting experience, they show this increased play behaviour since they are not able to engage in actual predatory activities and instead show predatory behaviours towards toys when hungry as an experienced hunter would show towards actual prey when hungry.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "911884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=911884", "title": "Comedy of manners", "text": "Comedy of manners\n\nThe comedy of manners is a form of comedy that satirizes the manners and affectations of contemporary society and questions societal standards. Social class stereotypes are often represented through stock characters such as the \"miles gloriosus\" (\"boastful soldier\") in ancient Greek comedy or the fop and rake of English Restoration comedy, which is sometimes used as a synonym for \"comedy of manners\". A comedy of manners often sacrifices the plot, which usually centers on some scandal, to witty dialogue and sharp social commentary. Oscar Wilde's play, \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (1895), which satirized the Victorian morality of the time, is one of the best-known plays of this genre.\n\nThe comedy of manners was first developed in the New Comedy period of ancient Greek comedy and is known today primarily from fragments of writings by the Greek playwright Menander. Menander's style, elaborate plots, and stock characters were imitated by the ancient Roman playwrights, such as Plautus and Terence, whose comedies were in turn widely known and reproduced during the Renaissance. Some of the best-known comedies of manners are those by the 17th-century French playwright Molière, who satirized the hypocrisy and pretension of the \"ancien régime\" in plays such as \"L'École des femmes\" ([\"The School for Wives\"], 1662), \"Tartuffe\" ([\"The Imposter\"], 1664), and \"Le Misanthrope\" ([\"The Misanthrope\"], 1666).\n\nThe comedy of manners has been employed by Roman satirists since as early as the first century BC. Horace's Satire 1.9 is a prominent example, in which the persona is unable to express his wish for his companion to leave, but instead subtly implies so through wit.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare's \"Much Ado about Nothing\" might be considered the first comedy of manners In England, but the genre really flourished during the Restoration period. Restoration comedy, which was influenced by Ben Jonson's comedy of humours, made fun of affected wit and acquired follies of the time. The masterpieces of the genre were the plays of William Wycherley (\"The Country Wife\", 1675) and William Congreve (\"The Way of the World\", 1700). In the late 18th century Oliver Goldsmith (\"She Stoops to Conquer\", 1773) and Richard Brinsley Sheridan (\"The Rivals\", 1775; \"The School for Scandal\", 1777) revived the form.\n\nThe tradition of elaborate, artificial plotting and epigrammatic dialogue was carried on by the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde in \"Lady Windermere's Fan\" (1892) and \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (1895). In the 20th century, the comedy of manners reappeared in the plays of the British dramatists Noël Coward (\"Hay Fever\", 1925) and Somerset Maugham and the novels of P. G. Wodehouse, as well as various British sitcoms. The \"Carry On films\" are a direct descendant of the comedy of manners \nstyle.\n\nThe term \"comedy of menace\", which British drama critic Irving Wardle based on the subtitle of \"\" (1958), by David Campton, is a jocular play-on-words derived from the \"comedy of manners\" (\"menace\" being \"manners\" pronounced with a somewhat Judeo-English accent). Pinter's play \"The Homecoming\" has been described as a mid-twentieth-century \"comedy of manners\".\n\nIn \"Boston Marriage\" (1999), David Mamet chronicles a sexual relationship between two women, one of whom has her eye on yet another young woman (who never appears, but who is the target of a seduction scheme). Periodically, the two women make their serving woman the butt of haughty jokes, serving to point up the satire on class. Though displaying the verbal dexterity one associates with both the playwright and the genre, the patina of wit occasionally erupts into shocking crudity.\n\nOther contemporary examples include Kazuo Ishiguro's \"The Remains of the Day\", E. M. Forster's \"A Room with a View\", Barbara Pym's \"Excellent Women\", Douglas Carter Beane's \"As Bees in Honey Drown\", \"The Country Club\", \"The Little Dog Laughed\", \"You Rang, M'Lord?\" by David Croft and Jimmy Perry, and the Jeeves and Wooster series by P. G. Wodehouse. The television program \"Absolutely Fabulous\" is another contemporary example of the comedy of manners.\n\n"}
{"id": "6231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6231", "title": "Comic book", "text": "Comic book\n\nA comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan, comic books were first popularized in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \"Famous Funnies\", was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \"comic book\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.\n\nThe largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at (), with annual sales of 1.9billion manga books/magazines in Japan (equivalent to 15issues per person). The comic book market in the United States and Canada was valued at in 2016. , the largest comic book publisher in the United States is manga distributor Viz Media, followed by DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Another major comic book market is France, where Franco-Belgian comics and Japanese manga each represent 40% of the market, followed by American comics at 10% market share.\n\nComic books are reliant on their organization and appearance. Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a tail element. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring.\n\nComics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of \"The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck\" in 1842 in hardcover, making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with historians generally citing Dell Publishing's 36-page \"Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics\" as the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it \"the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing\". The introduction of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's Superman in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry and ushered the Golden Age of Comics. The Golden Age originated the archetype of the superhero.According to historian Michael A. Amundson, appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.\n\nHistorians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The Golden Age of Comic Books began in the 1930s; which is generally considered the beginning of the comic book that we know today. The Silver Age of comic books is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the Flash in \"Showcase\" #4 (Oct. 1956). The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time Marvel Comics revolutionized the medium with such naturalistic superheroes as Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four and Lee and Steve Ditko's Spider-Man. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the Bronze Age of Comic Books, is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s. The Modern Age of Comic Books runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.\n\nA notable event in the history of the American comic book came with psychiatrist Fredric Wertham's criticisms of the medium in his book \"Seduction of the Innocent\" (1954), which prompted the American Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency to investigate comic books. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the U.S. comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America. The CMAA instilled the Comics Code Authority in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA. The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as underground comix. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth counterculture and drug culture of the time. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure \"Tijuana bibles\". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as head shops and record stores, as well as by mail order.\n\nFrank Stack's \"The Adventures of Jesus\", published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon, has been credited as the first underground comic; while R. Crumb and the crew of cartoonists who worked on \"Zap Comix\" popularized the form.\n\nThe rise of comic book specialty stores in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for \"independent\" or \"alternative comics\" in the U.S. The first such comics included the anthology series \"Star Reach\", published by comic book writer Mike Friedrich from 1974 to 1979, and Harvey Pekar's \"American Splendor\", which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini adapted into a 2003 film. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre, but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably \"RAW\") represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of fine art.\n\nDuring the 1970s the \"small press\" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers - such as Pacific, Eclipse, First, , and Fantagraphics - had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color-superhero, detective, and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of Latin American magical realism.\n\nA number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"minicomics\" form, an extremely informal version of self-publishing, arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s, despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.\n\nSmall publishers regularly releasing titles include Avatar Comics, Hyperwerks, Raytoons, and Terminal Press, buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital print-on-demand.\n\nIn 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\". Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the medieval woodcut tradition by Belgian Frans Masereel, American Lynd Ward and others, including Stan Lee.\nIn 1950, St. John Publications produced the digest-sized, adult-oriented \"picture novel\" \"It Rhymes with Lust\", a 128-page digest by pseudonymous writer \"Drake Waller\" (Arnold Drake and Leslie Waller), penciler Matt Baker and inker Ray Osrin, touted as \"an original full-length novel\" on its cover. In 1971, writer-artist Gil Kane and collaborators devised the paperback \"comics novel\" \"Blackmark\". Will Eisner popularized the term \"graphic novel\" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work \"A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories\" in 1978.\n\nIn 2017, the comic book market size for North America was just over $1 billion with digital sales being flat, book stores having a 1 percent decline, and comic book stores having a 10 percent decline over 2016.\n\nThe 1970s saw the advent of specialty comic book stores. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of comic book conventions, they are now embraced by many adults.\n\nComic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title. Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title. For example, Spider-Man's first appearance was in \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15. New characters were often introduced this way, and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the number 1 issue of a character's own title.\n\nSome rare comic books include copies of the unreleased \"Motion Picture Funnies Weekly\" #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The \"Pay Copy\" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 Heritage auction.\n\nThe most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over $1 million USD , including two examples of Action Comics #1, the first appearance of Superman, both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and Detective Comics #27, the first appearance of Batman, via public auction.\n\nUpdating the above price obtained for \"Action Comics\" #1, the first appearance of Superman, the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2 million, for a 9.0 copy. \n\nMisprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with extremely low distribution also generally have scarcity value. The rarest modern comic books include the original press run of \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" #5, which DC executive Paul Levitz recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage Victorian era advertisement for \"Marvel Douche\", which the publisher considered offensive; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been CGC graded. (See Recalled comics for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)\n\nIn 2000, a company named Comics Guaranty (CGC) began to \"slab\" comics, encasing them in a thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. , there are two companies that provide third party grading of comic book condition. Because condition is so important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as GoCollect and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.\n\nThe original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published. These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.\n\nWhen the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art. The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-man are considered priceless.\n\nThe first comic books in Japan appeared during the 18th century in the form of woodblock-printed booklets containing short stories drawn from folk tales, legends, and historical accounts, told in a simple visual-verbal idiom. Known as , , and , these were written primarily for less literate readers. However, with the publication in 1775 of Koikawa Harumachi's comic book , an evolved form of comic book originated, which required greater literacy and cultural sophistication. This was known as the . Published in thousands of copies, the \"kibyōshi\" may have been the earliest fully realized comic book for adults in world literary history. Approximately 2,000 titles remain extant.\n\nModern comic books in Japan developed from a mixture of these earlier comic books and of woodblock prints with Western styles of drawing. They took their current form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term \"manga\" means \"random (or whimsical) pictures\", and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as Santō Kyōden's picturebook (1798) and Aikawa Minwa's \"Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women\" (1798). During the Meiji period, the term \"Akahon\" was also common.\n\nWestern artists were brought over to teach their students such concepts as line, form, and color; these were things which had not been regarded as conceptually important in \"ukiyo-e\", as the idea behind the picture was of paramount importance. Manga at this time was referred to as \"Ponchi-e\" (Punch-picture) and, like its British counterpart \"Punch\" magazine, mainly depicted humor and political satire in short one- or four-picture format.\n\nDr. Osamu Tezuka (1928–1989) further developed this form. Seeing an animated war propaganda film titled inspired Tezuka to become a comic artist. He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's eyes, nose, and mouth are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka's work generated new interest in the \"ukiyo-e\" tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.\n\nThough a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become television shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.\n\nManga magazines—also known as \"anthologies\"—often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain one-shot comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series may continue for many years if they are successful, with stories often collected and reprinted in book-sized volumes called , the equivalent of the American trade paperbacks. These volumes use higher-quality paper and are useful to readers who want to be brought up to date with a series, or to readers who find the cost of the weekly or monthly publications to be prohibitive. Deluxe versions are printed as commemorative or collectible editions.\n\n, fan-made Japanese comics, operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American \"underground comics\" market; the largest dōjinshi fair, Comiket, attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.\n\nKorean manhwa have quickly gained popularity outside Korea in recent times as a result of the Korean Wave. The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunt the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.\n\nWebtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More manhwaga have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.\n\n \nFrance and Belgium have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called \"BDs\" (an abbreviation of \"bande dessinées\") in French and \"strips\" in Dutch. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone \"Franco-Belgian\" comics, but have their own distinct style.\n\nThe name \"bande dessinée\" derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as \"the drawn strip\"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word \"bande\" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms \"comics\" and \"funnies\", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as \"le neuvième art\" (literally, \"the ninth art\") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.\n\nIn France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.\n\nAlthough \"Ally Sloper's Half Holiday\" (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile. \"The Guardian\" refers to Ally Sloper as “one of the world’s first iconic cartoon characters”, and “as famous in Victorian Britain as Dennis the Menace would be a century later.” British comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated penny dreadfuls of the Victorian era (featuring Sweeney Todd, Dick Turpin and \"Varney the Vampire\"). First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls were “Britain’s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.”\nThe two most popular British comic books, \"The Beano\" and \"The Dandy\", were first published by DC Thomson in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million. Explaining the enormous popularity of comics in British popular culture during this period, Anita O'Brien, director curator at London's Cartoon Museum, states: “When comics like the Beano and Dandy were invented back in the 1930s - and through really to the 1950s and 60s - these comics were almost the only entertainment available to children.\" The “world’s naughtiest schoolboy”, \"Dennis the Menace\" was created in the 1950s, which saw sales for \"The Beano\" soar. He features in the cover of \"The Beano\", with the BBC referring to him as the “definitive naughty boy of the comic world.” \n\nIn 1954, \"Tiger\" comics introduced \"Roy of the Rovers\", the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of Roy Race and the team he played for, Melchester Rovers. The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark. Other comic books such as \"Eagle\", \"Valiant\", \"Warrior\", \"Viz\" and \"2000 AD\" also flourished. Some comics, such as \"Judge Dredd\" and other \"2000 AD\" titles, have been published in a tabloid form. Underground comics and \"small press\" titles have also appeared in the UK, notably \"Oz\" and \"Escape Magazine\".\n\nThe content of \"Action\", another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the House of Commons. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's Captain Marvel, and other characters such as Sheena, Mandrake the Magician, and the Phantom. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe & Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although \"The Adventures of Tintin\" and \"Asterix\" serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.\n\nIn the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the \"British Invasion\" in comic book history. These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media. These elements would pave the way for mature and \"darker and edgier\" comic books and jump start the Modern Age of Comics. Writers included Alan Moore, famous for his \"V for Vendetta\", \"From Hell\", \"Watchmen\", \"Marvelman\", and \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\"; Neil Gaiman with \"The Sandman\" mythos and \"Books of Magic\"; Warren Ellis, creator of \"Transmetropolitan\" and \"Planetary\"; and others such as Mark Millar, creator of \"Wanted\" and \"Kick-Ass\". The comic book series \"Hellblazer\", which is largely set in Britain and starring the magician John Constantine, paved the way for British writers such as Jamie Delano.\n\nAt Christmas time, publishers repackage and commission material for comic annuals, printed and bound as hardcover A4-size books; \"Rupert\" supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. DC Thomson also repackages \"The Broons\" and \"Oor Wullie\" strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.\n\nOn 19 March 2012, the British postal service, the Royal Mail, released a set of stamps depicting British comic-book characters and series. The collection featured \"The Beano\", \"The Dandy\", \"Eagle\", \"The Topper\", \"Roy of the Rovers\", \"Bunty\", \"Buster\", \"Valiant\", \"Twinkle\" and \"2000 AD\".\n\nIn Italy, comics (known in Italian as \"fumetti\") made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like Hugo Pratt and Guido Crepax exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as \"Diabolik\" or the \"Bonelli\" line—namely \"Tex Willer\" or \"Dylan Dog\"—remain best-sellers.\n\nMainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white digest size format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's \"Corto Maltese\".\n\nItalian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and Argentina. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of Walt Disney comic stories outside the U.S. Donald Duck's superhero alter ego, Paperinik, known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.\n\n\"Čtyřlístek\" (in English translated as Lucky Four or Four-Leaf Clover) is one of the most well-known comics for children published in the Czech Republic.\n\nDistribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The smartphone and the tablet have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.\n\nOn November 13, 2007, Marvel Comics launched Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited, a subscription service allowing readers to read many comics from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of \"Avenging Spider-Man\" #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.\n\nWith the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is comiXology. Some platforms, such as Graphicly, have shut down.\n\nMany libraries have extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This is a convenient way for many in the public to become familiar with the medium.\n\nThe largest comic book ever published was on the 5th of August 2018 in São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. It is named \"Turma da Mônica — O Maior Gibi do Mundo!\" by Panini Comics Brasil and Mauricio de Sousa Editora, and it measures at 69.9 cm by 99.8 cm (2 ft 3.51 in by 3 ft 3.29 in).\n\nThe Japanese manga author Eiichiro Oda has made comic book history by attaining a Guinness World Record title for having the \"Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\". His widely popular comic titled One Piece was first serialised in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine (Shueisha) in Japan, back in December 1997. In the space of less than two decades, the series has accumulated an incredibly loyal following and has gone on to sell an incredible 320,866,000 units, with a substantial 77 volumes of the comic book released over that period.\n\n\n\n"}

It often takes the form of short stories or background information found in rulebooks and game supplements, but can take any form. In highly developed, popular settings which have evolved beyond gaming, fluff may include anything from gaming supplements such as sourcebooks to novels or even movies.\n\nBy contrast, in the same context the term blurb is typically used for brief explanatory texts (for individual gaming pieces etc.).

{"id": "1071653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1071653", "title": "Genre studies", "text": "Genre studies\n\nGenre studies is an academic subject which studies genre theory as a branch of general critical theory in several different fields, including the literary or artistic, linguistic, or rhetorical.\n\nLiterary genre studies is a structuralist approach to the study of genre and genre theory in literary theory, film theory, and other cultural theories. The study of a genre in this way examines the structural elements that combine in the telling of a story and finds patterns in collections of stories. When these elements (or semiotic codes) begin to carry inherent information, a genre emerges.\n\nLinguistic genre studies is best described by two schools of literary genre, the Systemic Functional Linguistics or \"SFL\", scholars of this school believe that language structure is an integral part of a text's social context and function. SFL scholars often conduct research that focuses on genres usefulness in pedagogy.\n\nEnglish for Specific Purposes or \"ESP\" is another school of genre studies that examines the pedagogical implications of genre. ESP scholars focus on how genre can help non-native English speakers on how to use the language and its conventions through the application of genre analysis, the identification of discourse elements such as register, formation of conceptual and genre structures, modes of thought and action that exist in the specific discourse community, etc for bringing changes in epideictic schemata.\n\nAnother one is Rhetorical Genre Studies or \"RGS\" studies genre as social action. RGS emerged from Carolyn R. Miller's article \"Genre as Social Action\".\n\nSystemic functional linguistics scholars believe that language is organized within cultures based on cultural ideologies. The \"systemic\" of SFL refers to the system as a whole, in which linguistic choices are made. SFL is based largely on the work of Michael Halliday, who believed that individuals make linguistic choices based on the ideologies of the systems that those individuals inhabit. For Halliday, there is a \"network of meanings\" within a culture, that constitutes the \"social semiotic\" of that culture. This \"social semiotic\" is encoded and maintained by the discourse system of the culture. For Halliday, contexts in which texts are produced recur, in what he calls \"situation types.\" People raised within a specific culture become accustomed to the \"situation types\" that occur within that culture, and are more easily able to maneuver through the \"situation types\" within that culture than people who were not brought up within it.\n\nHalliday's approach to cultural context in the formation of recurrent \"situation types\" influenced other scholars, such as J.R. Martin. Martin led the SFL pedagogical approach, which emphasized the role of context in text formation. Martin and his associates believed that process-based approaches to education ignored the cultural boundaries of texts, and privileged middle- and upper- class students at the expense of students from lower-class backgrounds. According to Martin and other SFL scholars, an explicit focus on genre in literature would help literacy teaching. Focusing on genre reveals the contexts that influences texts, and teaches those contexts to students, so that they can create texts that are culturally informed.\n\nThrough their genre work in schools, Martin and his associates developed a definition of genre as a \"staged, goal-oriented, social process.\" In the Martinian genre model, genres are staged because they accomplish tasks that require multiple steps; they are goal-oriented because their users are motivated to see the completion of the stages to the end; and they are social because users address their texts to specific audiences.\n\nEnglish for Specific Purposes scholarship has been around since the 1960s, but ESP scholars did not begin using genre as a pedagogical approach until the 1980s, when John Swales published \"Genre Analysis: English in Academic and Research Settings\", in which Swales laid out the methodological approach that brought together ESP and genre analysis. Swales identified two characteristics of ESP genre analysis: its focus on academic research in English and its use of genre analysis for applied ends. ESP focuses on specific genres within spheres of activity, such as the medical profession, but it also focuses on the broader concept of communicative purposes within fields of study.\n\nEnglish for Specific Purposes shares some characteristics with SFL studies. Both believe that linguistic features are connected to social context and function, and both aim to help disadvantaged students grasp the system in which texts are created so that they can create similar texts, by teaching them the relationship between language and social function. Both try to accomplish their goals by teaching specific genres to underprivileged users.\n\nHowever, there are also some important differences between ESP and SFL. Whereas SFL scholars focus on teaching basic genre structures to primary and secondary school students, ESP scholars are focused on teaching Professional and Academic disciplinary genres to University- and graduate-level students. ESP students tend to be more bound to discursive genre subjects, within very particular contexts. ESP focuses on micro-level genres and contexts, whereas SFL focuses on macro-level contexts.\n\nRhetorical Genre Studies (a term coined by Aviva Freedman) scholars examine genre as typified social action, as ways of acting based on recurrent social situations. This founding principle for RGS was taken from Carolyn R. Miller's essay \"Genre as Social Action,\" which was published in 1984. In her article, Miller examines Frank Lloyd Bitzer's notion of exigence as a reaction to social situations, and Kenneth Burke's notion of \"motive\" as human action. Using Bitzer, particularly, Miller believes it is possible to examine exigence as \"an external cause of discourse.\" Ultimately, she is able to view situations as social constructions. Genres are typified ways of responding to recurring social constructions.\n\nRGS scholarship has evolved beyond Miller's founding definition of genre. Carol Berkenkotter and Thomas Huckin begin with the notion that genre is knowledge foundation, and argue that genres embody communities' knowledge and ways of acting. For Berkenkotter and Huckin, genre becomes a way of navigating social activity. As such, it is dynamic, because the conditions of social activity are always in flux. Recurrence, they claim, involves variation. Berkenkotter and Huckin redefine genre as social cognition.\n\nThe notion of \"uptake\" is also integral to RGS scholars' understanding of genre. Anne Freadman uses uptake to describe the ways in which genres interact with each other in her articles \"Uptake\" and \"Anyone for Tennis?\". She uses the game of tennis to explain the ways genres interact. Tennis players, she says, do not exchange tennis balls, they exchange shots. Each shot only has meaning within the game, its rules, and the context of the game being play. Shots are meaningful because they take place in a game. The game is meaningful because it takes place within \"ceremonials.\" Thus, the final at Wimbledon provides a different context than a game between friends. Genres are the games that take place within ceremonials, and shots are utterances, or verbal exchanges. We cannot really understand a text without understanding the ceremonial in which it occurs. \"Uptake\" is the illocutionary response elicited by particular situations.\n\nAmy Devitt's research has further complicated the RGS landscape. In \"Writing Genres\", Devitt distinguishes between the \"context of genres,\" \"genre repertoires,\" \"genre systems,\" and \"genre sets.\" The \"context of genres\" is the overall set of genres available in a culture. A \"genre repertoire\" refers to the set of genres that a specific group uses to achieve its purposes. \"Genre systems\" are the sets of genres that function within an activity system. Finally, \"genre sets\" are more loosely defined sets of genres that function within an activity system, but only define a limited range of actions within that system. For instance, if we were to take a courtroom as an activity system, a genre set could be defined as only those genres used by the judge. Studying the \"context of genres,\" \"genre repertoires,\" \"genre systems,\" and \"genre sets\" enables researchers to study the relationships and power structures of activity systems.\n\nConventions are usual indicators such as phrases, themes, quotations, or explanations that readers expect to find in a certain genre. They could be considered \"stereotypes\" of that genre. For example, Science fiction is expected to be set in the future, and have futuristic events, technological advances, and futuristic ideas. Realism is expected to contain a story about people who could pass as real, struggling through real-life situations and/or real world events, etc.\n\nCritic Paul Alpers explains that literary conventions are like meeting places where past and present writers \"come together\" to determine the form a convention should take in a particular literary instance (work). In practical terms, this coming together is a matter of the present writer consulting the work of predecessors, but Alpers wants to connote the sense of active negotiation and accommodation that takes place between the writer and the genre he or she is working in (a genre defined by other people). According to Alpers, a misconception persists in modern criticism that literary convention is an \"arbitrary and inflexible practice, established by widespread usage and imposed from without.\" Convention in this sense is the \"antithesis of the personal and individual\"; it is \"felt to constrain the [writer].\" Alpers reconceptualizes literary convention as something \"constitutive and enabling.\" For him, generic conventions are \"not fixed procedures imposed by impersonal tradition;\" rather, they are the living \"usages of other [writers],\" \"the shared practice of those who come together.\" Thinking of generic conventions as a practice shared by many users, allows later writers to exercise the same degree of control over convention as those who predated them. Far from constraining writers, convention provides flexibility to preserve certain aspects of a genre and transform others. Convention in this sense enables \"individual expression, because the [writer] is seen as responsive to, even when challenging, his predecessors and fellows.\"\n\nGenre theorist David Fishelov also deals with generic conventions—he calls them \"generic rules\"—in elaborating his explanatory metaphor of \"literary genres as social institutions\" in the book \"Metaphors of Genre: The Role of Analogies in Genre Theory\". Fishelov, like Alpers, sees generic conventions as an inescapably \"vital part of the literary communicative situation,\" linking present and past writers to each other, as well as to readers. Established conventions are \"a challenge, or a horizon, against which the writer and his reader have to define themselves.\" The writer may respond to this challenge by \"stretch[ing] the generic rules.\"\n\nFishelov draws his metaphor of genre as social institution from a passage in René Welleck and Austin Warren's \"Theory of Literature\":\n\nThis formulation ascribes agency to actors within social institutions. In the same way institutions like churches, universities, and states organize social actors to accomplish collective social purposes, literary genres organize relationships between writers and readers to accomplish communicative purposes, which change over time. Genres are not static, but rather, like social institutions, persist through the constant renovation of their conventions by individuals. Fishelov is particularly helpful in theorizing the role of the reader in alternately constraining and motivating generic change:\n\nReader expectations operate as both a constraint on the writer and a \"latent demand for innovation.\" The writer \"is expected to manipulate the existing conventions and to carry them (at least) one step further…. From the writer's perspective, the generic convention is a model to follow but also a challenge to overcome.\" Fishelov explains that writers choose or are compelled to manipulate prevailing conventions for a variety of aesthetic and thematic reasons.\n\nGenre theory or genre studies got underway with the Greeks. The Greeks felt that the type of person an author was would be directly responsible for the type of poetry they wrote. The Greeks also believed that certain metrical forms were suited only to certain genres. Aristotle said, \nWe have, then, a natural instinct for representation and for tune and rhythm—and starting with these instincts men very gradually developed them until they produced poetry out of their improvisations. Poetry then split into two kinds according to the poet's nature. For the more serious poets represented the noble deeds of noble men, while those of a less exalted nature represented the actions of inferior men, at first writing satire just as the others wrote hymns and eulogies. This is all based on Plato's mimetic principle. Exalted people will, in imitation of exaltation, write about exalted people doing exalted things, and vice versa with the \"lower\" types (Farrell, 383). Genre was not a black-and-white issue even for Aristotle, who recognized that though the \"Iliad\" is an epic it can be considered a tragedy as well, both because of its tone as well as the nobility of its characters. However, most of the Greek critics were less acutely aware—if aware at all—of the inconsistencies in this system. For these critics, there was no room for ambiguity in their literary taxonomy because these categories were thought to have innate qualities that could not be disregarded.\n\nThe Romans carried on the Greek tradition of literary criticism. The Roman critics were quite happy to continue on in the assumption that there were essential differences between the types of poetry and drama. There is much evidence in their works that Roman writers themselves saw through these ideas and understood genres and how they function on a more advanced level. However, it was the critics who left their mark on Roman literary criticism, and they were not innovators.\n\nAfter the fall of Rome, when the scholastic system took over literary criticism, genre theory was still based on the essential nature of genres. This is most likely because of Christianity's affinity for Platonic concepts. This state of affairs persisted until the 18th century.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, the theory of genre based on classical thought began to unravel beneath the intellectual chafing of the Enlightenment. The introduction of the printing press brought texts to a larger audience. Then pamphlets and broadsides began to diffuse information even farther, and a greater number of less privileged members of society became literate and began to express their views. Suddenly authors of both \"high\" and \"low\" culture were now competing for the same audience. This worked to destabilize the classical notions of genre, while still drawing attention to genre because new genres like the novel were being generated (Prince, 455).\n\nLocke, in \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1690), had reduced data to its smallest part: the simple idea derived from sense. However, as the science of cognition became more precise it was shown that even this simple idea derived from sense was itself divisible. This new information prompted David Hartley to write in his \"Observation on Man\" (1749), How far the Number of Orders may go is impossible to say. I see no Contradiction in supposing it infinite, and a great Difficulty in stopping at any particular Size. (Prince, 456). \n\nThe possibility of an infinite number of types alarmed theologians of the time because their assumption was that rigorously applied empiricism would uncover the underlying divine nature of creation, and now it appeared that rigorously applied empiricism would only uncover an ever-growing number of types and subsequent sub-types.\n\nIn order to re-establish the divine in categorization, the new taxonomical system of aesthetics arose. This system offered first beauty, and then the sublime as the taxonomical device. The problem with Aesthetics was that it assumed the divine and thus the sublime must underlie all these categories, and thus, the ugly would become beautiful at some point. The paradox is glaring.\n\nEver since the late 18th century literary critics have been trying to find a theory of genre that would be more commensurate with the realities of individual texts within genres. The evolution of genre took many twists and turns through the 19th and 20th centuries. It was heavily influenced by the deconstructionist thought and the concept of relativity. In 1980, the instability engendered by these two new modes of thought came to a head in a paper written by Jacques Derrida titled, \"The Law of Genre.\" In the article Derrida first articulates the idea that individual texts participate in rather than belong to certain genres. He does this by demonstrating that the \"mark of genre\" is not itself a member of a genre or type. Thus, the very characteristic that signifies genre defies classification. However, at the end of this essay, Derrida hints at what might be a more fruitful direction for genre theory. \"There, that is the whole of it, it is only what 'I,' so that say, here kneeling at the edge of literature, can see. In sum, the law. The law summoning: what 'I' can sight and what 'I' can say that I sight in this site of a recitation where I/we is.\" By which Derrida means that not only is taxonomy a subjective sport, but due to this very fact, \"the place and time the taxonomical act takes place\" deserves further study.\n\nThen, in 1986, Ralph Cohen published a paper in response to Derrida's thoughts titled \"History and Genre.\" In this article Cohen argued that \ngenre concepts in theory and in practice arise, change, and decline for historical reasons. And since each genre is composed of texts that accrue, the grouping is a process, not a determinate category. Genres are open categories. Each member alters the genre by adding, contradicting, or changing constituents, especially those of members most closely related to it. The process by which genres are established always involves the human need for distinction and interrelation. Since the purposes of critics who establish genres vary, it is self-evident that the same texts can belong to different groupings of genres and serve different generic purposes. (Cohen, 204)\n\n\"Genre Evolution in RGS\"\n\nRGS scholars largely agree that while genres are indeed dynamic and constantly evolving entities, they are difficult to change. Amy Devitt describes this bind, as she considers a genre to be \"both the product and the process that creates it\" (580). To Devitt, genres not only respond to recurrent situations, but they construct them as well. This phenomenon makes theorizing genre evolution challenging. Carolyn R. Miller even cautions against describing genre change as \"evolution,\" as evolution implies progress. Still, many RGS scholars have theorized how genres change. Jo Ann Yates and Wanda Orlikowski offer that \"one person cannot single-handedly effect the change of an institutionalized structure; other relevant participants must adopt and reinforce the attempted change for it to be implemented and sustained in practice\" (108). Yates and Orlikowski then describe how genres evolve: they claim that genres change when a kairotic moment presents itself, and the rhetor, instead of choosing to employ the \"genre most appropriately enacted\" tries a new method of which the audience accepts as new way of responding to the recurrent situation (119). See kairos. Natasha Artemeva has made similar observations based on an eight-year ethnographic survey that followed engineering students from academia and into the workplace environment. Artemeva observed two of her subjects impact the evolution of workplace genres when a kairotic moment presented itself (164). Yet these former student's success in changing the workplace genre also depended on three individually acquired skills: 1) \"cultural capital\", 2) \"domain content expertise\", and 3) \"agency in the rhetor's ability\" to not only see when a kairotic moment presented itself, but \"to also seize the opportunity\" (167). Thomas Helscher is not as optimistic; he writes, the \"rhetorical constitution of [a] discourse community operates as a counterweight to the process of community growth and change\" (30) and argues that the \"transformation of the fundamental generic conventions by which communities constitutes themselves...is paradigmatic of the process of social transformation\" (32).\n\nThe definition of genre from dictionary.com is \"a class or category of artistic endeavor having a particular form, context, technique, or the like.\" Although it seems that genre should be easy to define, the finer points of textual categorization are not yet established.\n\nGenres, according to Daniel Chandler, create order to simplify the mass of available information. Creating categories promotes organization instead of chaos. Jane Feuer has divided ways to categorize genres into three different groups. The first is aesthetic. By using this method one can organize according to certain sets of characteristics, and so the overall work of the artist is not disparaged by generalization. The second classification method is ritual. Ritual uses its own culture to help classify. If one performs a ritual associated with a system of ritual, one can be said to be practicing as a member of that system. The common taxonomic method is ideological. This occurs most often in the marketing of texts, music, and movies. The effectiveness of this type of categorization can be measured by how well the public accepts these categories as valid.\n\nAmy J. Devitt focuses on the rhetorical approach to genre. Scholars generally recognize the restrictions placed on works that have been classified as a certain genre. However, viewing genre as a rhetorical device gives the author and the reader more freedom and \"allows for choices.\" Genres are not free-standing entities, but are actually intimately connected and interactive amongst themselves. Rhetorical theory of genre recognizes that genres are generated by authors, readers, publishers, and the entire array of social forces that act upon a work at every stage of its production.\n\nThis recognition does not make the taxonomy of texts easy. Chandler points out that very few works have all the characteristics of the genre in which they participate. Also, due to the interrelatedness of genres, none of them is clearly defined at the edges, but rather fade into one another. Genre works to promote organization, but there is no absolute way to classify works, and thus genre is still problematic and its theory still evolving.\n\nMoreover, the metagenre as a concept has been an important point to study. According to Giltrow, metagenre is \"situated language about situated language\". Metagenres such as institutional guidelines can be \"ruling out certain kinds of expression, endorsing others\", constraining and enabling. The concept of metagenre also provides a valuable way to understand the dynamics of institutional interrelations between genres. In the mental health discourse, for example, has been demonstrated the metageneric function of the American Psychiatric Association's (DSM) for standardizing and mediating the localized epistemological communicative practices of psychiatrists.\n\nGenre began as an absolute classification system in ancient Greece. Poetry, prose and performance had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story. Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best. This classical system worked well as long as the arts were largely directed by nobility and rich patrons. A common understanding of meaning was handy in knowing what the employer expected, and the crowds understood it.\n\nDuring the Enlightenment period in 18th century Europe, this system of patronage began to change. A merchant middle class began to emerge with money to spend and time to spend it. Artists could venture away from classical genres and try new ways to attract paying patrons. \"Comedy\" could now mean Greek metered comedy, or physical camp, or some other type of experience. Artists were also free to use their mediums to express the human condition in a way that was not possible under single patronage, or at least not profitable. Art could be used to reflect and comment on the lives of ordinary people. Genre became a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictable art. Because art is often a response to a social state, in that people write/paint/sing/dance about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings. In fact, as far back as ancient Greece, new art forms were emerging that called for the evolution of genre, for example the \"tragicomedy.\"\n\nUnfortunately, genre does have its limitations. Our world has grown so much that it is difficult to absolutely classify something. Information overlaps, and a single book can encompass elements of several genres. For example, a book might be classified as fiction, mystery, science fiction and African American literature all at once.\nGenre suffers from the same ills of any classification system. Humans are pattern-seeking beings; we like to create order out of the chaos of the universe. However, when we forget that our order is imposed, often arbitrarily, over a universe of unique experiences, the merit of the individual gets lost. If a system of classification, like genre, is then used to assign value judgments, we allow our preconceptions about the whole to influence our opinion of the individual. Genre is useful as long as we remember that it is a helpful tool, to be reassessed and scrutinized, and to weigh works on their unique merit as well as their place within the genre.\n\nA simple example of the inherent meaning in an art form is that of a western movie where two men face each other on a dusty and empty road; one wears a black hat, the other white. Independent of any external meaning, there is no way to tell what the situation might mean, but due to the long development of the \"western\" genre, it is clear to the informed audience that they are watching a gunfight showdown between a bad guy and a good guy.\n\nIt has been suggested that genres resonate with people because of the familiarity, the shorthand communication, as well as the tendency of genres to shift with public mores and to reflect the zeitgeist. While the genre of storytelling has been relegated as lesser form of art because of the heavily borrowed nature of the conventions, admiration has grown. Proponents argue that the genius of an effective genre piece is in the variation, recombination, and evolution of the codes.\n\nGenre studies have perhaps gained the most recognition in film theory, where the study of genre directly contrasts with auteur theory, which privileges the director's role in crafting a movie.\n\nThere is something more about genre theory, and to that effect it is necessary to propose Kristen H. Perry's definition. Written (textual) genres are social constructions that represent specific purposes for reading and writing within different social activities, created by social groups who need them to perform certain things. They change over time, reflecting essential shifts in social function performed by that text. Genres also represent constellations of textual attributes: some attributes are necessary and other attributes are optional.\n\nAnother definition which shows the different aspects of genre theory is Miller who defines genres as \"typified rhetorical actions\" that respond to recurring situations and become instantiated in groups' behaviors. Genre evolves as \"a form of social knowledge—a mutual construing of objects, events, interests and purposes that not only links them but makes them what they are: an objectified social need\". This view sees genres not as static forms but, rather, as \"forms of ways of being ... frames for social action ... environments for learning ... locations within which meaning is constructed\" (Bazerman), suggesting that different communities use different means of communication to accomplish their objectives.\n\nTo try to show the importance of the context in genre an example is used about a particular part of the genre theory—speech genres; but it is important to stress that context is really important in all situations. Context plays an important role in shaping genres (Holquist, 1986). Genre theory does not conceptualize context as simply the space outside of text or the container surrounding texts, but as dynamic environments that simultaneously structure and are structured by the communicative practices of social agents. Speech genres are recognizable patterns of language-in-context (Bakhtin, 1986): speech genres include both oral and written forms of language.\n\nResearchers have also shown that the rhetorical moves people must make within accepted genres to communicate successfully in particular contexts operate to reinforce communities' identities and to legitimate particular communication practices. Thus, the genres that communities enact help structure their members' ways of creating, interpreting, and using knowledge (Myers; Winsor, Ordering, Writing; Bazerman, Shaping, Constructing; Berkenkotter and Huckin; Smart).\nGenres are very important in our every day life and we do not realize how much we use them, how much they affect us, how much they determine the way we act and understand the others.\n\nIn 1968, Lloyd Bitzer claimed that discourse is determined by rhetorical situations in his article titled, \"The Rhetorical Situation\". A rhetorical situation refers to the fact that every situation has the potential for a rhetorical response. He looks to understand the nature behind the context that determines discourse. Bitzer states, \"it is the situation which calls discourse into existence\". Thus, the situation controls what type of rhetorical response takes place. Each situation has an appropriate response in which the rhetor can either act upon or not act upon. He expresses the imperative nature of the situation in creating discourse, because discourse only comes into being as a response to a particular situation. Discourse varies depending upon the meaning-context that is created due to the situation, and because of this, it is \"embedded in the situation\".\n\nAccording to Bitzer, rhetorical situations come into existence, at which point, they can either mature and go away, or mature and continue to exist. Bitzer describes rhetorical situations as containing three components: exigence, audience, and constraints. He highlights six characteristics needed from a rhetorical situation that are necessary to creating discourse. A situation calls a rhetor to create discourse, it invites a response to fit the situation, the response meets the necessary requirements of the situation, the exigence which creates the discourse is located in reality, rhetorical situations exhibit simple or complex structures, rhetorical situations after coming into creation either decline or persist. Bitzer's main argument is the concept that rhetoric is used to \"effect valuable changes in real\" (Bitzer 14).\n\nIn 1984, Carolyn R. Miller examined genre in terms of rhetorical situations. She claimed that \"situations are social constructs that are the result, not of 'perception,' but of 'definition'\". In other words, we essentially define our situations. Miller seems to build from Bitzer's argument regarding what makes something rhetorical, which is the ability of change to occur. Opposite of Bitzer's predestined and limited view of the creation of genres, Miller believes genres are created through social constructs. She agreed with Bitzer that past responses can indicate what is an appropriate response to the current situation, but Miller holds that, rhetorically, genre should be \"centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish\". Since her view focuses on action, it cannot ignore that humans depend on the \"context of the situation\" as well as \"motives\" that drive them to this action. Essentially, \"we create recurrence,\" or similar responses, through our \"construal\" of types. Miller defines \"types\" as \"recognition of relevant similarities\". Types come about only after we have attempted to interpret the situation by way of social context, which causes us to stick to \"tradition\". Miller does not want to deem recurrence as a constraint, but rather she views it as insight into the \"human condition\". The way to bring about a new \"type\", is to allow for past routines to evolve into new routines, thereby maintaining a cycle that is always open for change. Either way, Miller's view is in accordance with the fact that as humans, we are creatures of habit that tightly hold on to a certain \"stock of knowledge\". However, change is considered innovation, and by creating new \"types\" we can still keep \"tradition\" and innovation at the same time.\n\nThe concept of genre is not limited to classifications and lists. People interact within genres daily. Genre is determined based \"on the action it is used to accomplish\" by the individuals using that particular genre. The distance between the text or action of genre and its users does not have to be vast. People respond to exigencies provided by genre every day. Exigence is \"a set of particular social patterns and expectations that provides a socially objectified motive for addressing\" the recurring situation of a particular genre. Seeing genre as a social action provides the \"keys to understanding how to participate in the actions of a community\". Carolyn R. Miller argues that, \"a rhetorical sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse, but on the action it is used to accomplish\".\n\nThe idea that rhetorical situations define genre means that participants in genre make decisions based on commonalities and repeat those instances. Genre is not only about the form of but also the mere repetitiveness of similarities. The classroom setting exemplifies this. When students wish to speak, they raise their hands to signify that desire. Raising a hand is the correct response to speaking in turn in that particular social setting. A person at lunch with a group of friends would not raise their hand to speak because the social situation is different. Miller concludes that social actions are the response to \"understanding how to participate in the actions of a community\".\n\nCarolyn R. Miller builds on arguments made by other scholars while also contradicting Bitzer's argument by giving her readers five features to understand genre. She believes that if something is rhetorical, then there will be action. Not only will there be action, but this action will also be repeated. The repetition of action creates a regularized form of discourse. Miller would add that the result has more to do with the action accomplished by the situation. Miller recognizes that a person chooses to take a certain social action within a defined set of rules - rules set in place by that user. Lastly, a situation cannot dictate a response. Miller ends her article with the thought that genres are partly rhetorical education through her statement, \"as a recurrent, significant action, a genre embodies an aspect of cultural rationality\". Here, Miller unknowingly encapsulates a future ideology about genre: that genres are created by culture.\nAccording to Mnotho Dlamini genre is basically a deep information in a particular context.\n\nBitzer's definition of exigence as \"an imperfection marked by urgency... something waiting to be done\" ties in with Miller's idea of social action as the next step after an exigency is realized. Miller also points towards the theory that genres recur, based on Jamieson's observation that antecedent genres finding their way into new genres. More importantly, Miller takes on the bigger picture of a rhetorical situation in which all of these steps happen. \"Situations are social constructs that are the result, not of 'perception,' but of definition\". From this, it is understood that social constructs define situations and, therefore, exigence is also socially situated.\n\nGenre, also, understood in terms of social contexts provides greater meaning to each recurring situation; it essentially allows for differentiation, though past genres have a role in present and new genres. Through this differentiation, genre is allowed to continue evolving, just as social contexts continue to change with time. Bawarshi describes the way in which this happens as \"communicants and their social environments are constantly in the process of reproducing one another\" (Bawarshi 69). Rhetoric essentially works the same way, as seen in the example of writing Bawarshi provides, \"writing is not a social act simply because it takes place in some social context; it is social because it is at work in shaping the very context within which it functions\". Therefore, through social constructs, one can shape rhetorical works, and in turn, the works can shape the social context: \"we create our contexts as we create our texts\".\n\nWritten in 1975, Kathleen Hall Jamieson's \"Antecedent Genre as Rhetorical Constraint\" declares that discourse is determined by the Rhetorical Situation, as well as antecedent genres. Antecedent genres are genres of the past that are used as a basis to shape and form current rhetorical responses. When placed in an unprecedented situation, a rhetor can draw on antecedent genres of similar situations in order to guide their response. However, caution should be taken when drawing on antecedent genres because sometimes antecedent genres are capable of imposing powerful constraints. The intent of antecedent genres are to guide the rhetor toward a response consistent with situational demands, and if the situational demands are not the same as when the antecedent genre was created, the response to the situation might be inappropriate.\n\nThrough three examples of discourse, the papal encyclical, the early State of the Union Address, and congressional replies, she demonstrates how traces of antecedent genres can be found within each. These examples clarify how a rhetor will tend to draw from past experiences that are similar to the present situation in order to guide them how to act or respond when they are placed in an unprecedented situation. Jamieson explains, by use of these three examples, that choices of antecedent genre may not always be appropriate to the present situation. She discusses how antecedent genres place powerful constraints on the rhetor and may cause them to become \"bound by the manacles of the antecedent genre\". These \"manacles,\" she says, may range in level of difficultly to escape. Jamieson urges one to be careful when drawing on the past to respond to the present, because of the consequences that may follow ones choice of antecedent genre. She reiterates the intended outcome through her statement of \"choice of an appropriate antecedent genre guides the rhetor toward a response consonant with situational demands\".\n\nPeople often recognize genre based on the characteristics that the situation offers. Amy Devitt states this when she says, \"A genre is named because of its formal markers\" (Devitt 10). However she also says, \"the formal markers can be defined because a genre has been named\" (Devitt 10). When we label something as a certain genre, we also flag these same characteristics as contributing to what we already believe the genre to be. These two quotes show how reciprocity functions within genre. Devitt displays the reciprocal nature of genre and situation according to the individual by using an example of a grocery store list. A question posed by this example is, is something a grocery list because it lists groceries or is it a grocery list because one person says it is a grocery list and we thus recognize all the items on the list as groceries? Though each possible answer to this raised question contradict one another, they are both correct. Similarly, individuals recognize the characteristics of the recurring rhetorical situations in the same way as they see them as affirmation of what they already know about the preexisting genre. The rhetorical attributes of the genre act as both objects which define and are defined by genre. In other words, genre and rhetorical situations are reciprocals of one another. Devitt focused on activity system of genre and that the participants' situation, contexts and text are all mutually created \"no one aspect fully determines the other.\" (Devitt)\n\nThe phrase \"tyranny of genre\" comes from genre theorist Richard Coe, who wrote that \"the 'tyranny of genre' is normally taken to signify how generic structures constrain individual creativity\" (Coe 188). If genre functions as a taxonomic classification system, it could constrain individual creativity, since \"the presence of many of the conventional features of a genre will allow a strong genre identification; the presence of fewer features, or the presence of features of other genres, will result in a weak or ambiguous genre identification\" (Schauber 403).\n\nGenres can act as constraints on readers as well. Literary historian Hans Robert Jauss describes genres as creating a \"horizon of expectation\" under which readers will interpret texts based on how much they correspond to the features of the genre they recognize from works they have previously read. The classification-system concept results in a polarization of responses to texts that do not fit neatly into a genre or exhibit features of multiple genres: \"The status of genres as discursive institutions does create constraints that may make a text that combines or mixes genres appear to be a cultural monstrosity. Such a text may be attacked or even made a scapegoat by some as well as be defended by others\" (LaCapra 220).\n\nUnder the more modern understanding of the concept of genre as \"social action\" à la Miller, a more situational approach to genre is enabled. This situational approach frees genre from the classification system, genre's \"tyranny of genre\". Relying on the importance of the rhetorical situation in the concept of genre results in an exponential expansion of genre study, which benefits literary analysis. One literature professor writes, \"The use of the contemporary, revised genre idea [as social action] is a breath of fresh air, and it has opened important doors in language and literature pedagogy\" (Bleich 130). Instead of a codified classification as the pragmatic application of genre, the new genre idea insists that \"human agents not only have the creative capacities to reproduce past action, such as action embedded in genres, but also can respond to changes in their environment, and in turn change that environment, to produce under-determined and possibly unprecedented action, such as by modifying genres\" (Killoran 72).\n\nNever is there total stabilization in a recognized genre, nor are there instances that indicate a complete lack of homogenization. However, because of the relative similarities between the terms \"stabilization\" and \"homogenization\", the amount of stabilization or homogenization a certain genre maintains is based on opinion. Necessary discourse is, obviously, always needed and is thus considered perfectly stabilized. In rhetorical situation or antecedent genres, that which is unprecedented mostly leads to stable and predictable responses. Outside the natural setting of a given form of discourse, one may respond inappropriately due to an unrecognized alternate. The unrecognized alternate is created by the lack of homogenization or differing expectations in the presented rhetorical situation.\n\nFixity is uncontrolled by a given situation and is deliberately utilized by the affected before the rhetorical situation occurs. Fixity almost always directly effects stabilization, and has little to no bearing on homogenization. The choice of discourse will provide a certain value of fixity, depending on the specific choice. If a situation calls for more mediated responses, the fixity of the situation is more prevalent, and therefore is attributed with a stable demand of expectations. Stability nor fixity can be directly affected by the subject at hand. The only option is affecting homogenization which in turn, can positively or negatively affect stability. Directly choosing a fixed arena within genre inversely alters the homogenization of said chooser constituting as a new genre accompanied with modified genre subsets and a newly desired urgency. The same ideological theory can be applied to how one serves different purposes, creating either separate genres or modernized micro-genres. (Fairclough)\n\nActivity theory is not grounded in any one area of field of research, but instead draws from several disciplines including psychology, behaviorism, and socio-cultural studies. Although activity theory originated in the social sciences, it is currently applied most frequently to social-scientific, organizational, and writing studies. Modeled as a triangle, activity theory considers how multiple factors (subject, object, mediating artifacts, rules, and division of labor) existing in an activity system (environment) interact to achieve an outcome. Central to activity theory is the concept of mediation. Human activities are driven by a need to achieve a certain outcome or goal. Typically this activity is mediated by artifacts which include tools, language, signs, and cultural norms. In \"Textual Objects\" Cheryl Geisler explains that texts are traditionally identified as meditational means to complete a task, though she offers that texts might also be identified as the motive in discourse communities in which text is valued as the outcome as opposed to the means of an outcome. Geisler notes that texts produced for meditational means are typically more private/personalized, whereas texts identified as objects are often written with a public motive. She does not argue, however, that texts should exist exclusively as one or the other, but rather she suggests that texts can function as both.\n\nFor some genre theorists, such as Clay Spinuzzi, genres are tools-in-use, and as such can be seen as mediating objects within the world. This view of genre as a tool-in-use is exemplified in the school of genre theory that studies genres' relationships to activity systems. In his article \"Textual Grounding: How People Turn Texts into Tools,\" Jason Swarts asserts that users utilize texts as tools when they recognize the text's specific value in a rhetorical situation or environment. User's then \"ground\" texts, altering the texts structure for personal use, to make them usable under very specific conditions. The user takes the text from a \"formalized representation of information\" to a personal tool. Swarts argues that the meaning of a text is established by uptake of the users, though this varies depending on the user and the user's goal. Similarly, in \"Tracing Genres Through Organizations: A Sociocultural Approach to Information Design\", Clay Spinuzzi asserts that the use of certain tools in certain situations can help users to act purposefully in that activity. Within this tradition of genre studies, \"Genres are not discrete artifacts, but traditions of producing, using, and interpreting artifacts, traditions that make their way into the artifact as a form-shaping ideology.\" The study of genres as mediating artifacts within activity systems is closely related to Activity Theory, in which the interactions of different spheres of activity are examined. Activity theory, according to David Russell, \"traces cognition and behavior, including writing, to social interaction.\" Activity theorists examine the ways that the work done in one sphere of activity could potentially change the work done in another. For example, Russell examines how people use writing to mediate their activities, and how changes in one activity can lead to changes in another activity. Russell points out that \"the activity system of cell biology research is not confined to universities. It also extends into boundary activity systems of drug companies, government medical research facilities, and so on.\" Subtle changes in the use of writing in one activity can effect changes in the use of writing in related systems. If the government sets down new pharmaceutical documentation laws, then the teaching of how to document the distribution of pharmaceuticals will change, not just in pharmacies, but also in hospitals and nursing classrooms. Activity systems are always in flux, because subtle changes in one level of the system result in subtle changes in other levels of the system. Activity systems are still relatively stable, despite their constant flux. The changes within them are often subtle, and large scale changes usually occur over long periods of time.\n\nGenre ecology describes the dense connections between genres within the activities that they mediate. Multiple genres mediate a single activity; no genre exists in isolation. In \"The Ecology of Genre\" Anis Bawarshi argues that genres are \"rhetorical ecosystems\" in which participants actively enact and, consequently, reenact social practices, relations, and identities. Participants use genre to interpret and perform social motives which sustain rhetorical ecosystems that produce social contexts, practices, and identities. For Spinuzzi, and other genre theorists studying the social aspects of genre (like Carolyn R. Miller, Amy Devitt, and Kathleen Jamieson, among others), genre is more than a category or artifact; genre is a way of interacting with the world. In the study of genre ecologies, genre is seen as a way people can accomplish activities. Like activity systems, genre ecologies are not entirely stable, because activities change, causing the genres mediating them to change, as well. Take, for example the digitization of the workplace. Before computers, the workspace was largely mediated by genres such as the paper memo,or the company newsletter. After digitization, paper memos and paper newsletters began to disappear. Memos and newsletters did not disappear; instead, their distribution method changed. Now, memos and newsletters are disseminated electronically in emails. The genres of the memo and newsletter still exists, but they have changed, slightly, to reflect the changes in the activity system that they mediate.\n\nMikhail Bakhtin's theorization of complex, secondary speech genres as composites of simple, primary speech genres in the analysis of the interaction between the multiple competing voices and registers in literary works. Bakhtin defines complex, secondary speech genres as \"novels, dramas, all kinds of scientific research, major genres of commentary, and so forth [that] arise in more complex and comparatively highly developed and organized cultural communication\" (62). While Bakhtin focuses on the historical emergence of the novel in much of his work, in his essay \"The Problem of Speech Genres,\" he makes clear that his theory can be applied to all literary genres, including \"profoundly individual lyrical work[s]\" (61) such as the pastoral elegy. Complex, secondary speech genres are formed by \"absorb[ing] and digest[ing] various primary (simple) genres that have taken form in unmediated speech communion\" (62). Primary speech genres are \"short rejoinders of daily dialogue,\" \"everyday narration,\" \"brief standard military command\" (60), \"verbal signals in industry\" (63), \"letters, diaries, minutes, and so forth\" (98), notable for their referentiality to and function within the pragmatic communicative contexts of \"extraverbal reality (situation)\" (83). When primary speech genres are absorbed by secondary ones, they are \"altered and assume a special character,\" losing \"their immediate relation to actual reality and to the real utterances of others\" (62). This process of absorption and digestion of primary speech genres by secondary ones leads to a \"more or less distinct dialogization of secondary genres, the weakening of their monological composition\" (66). While Bakhtinian dialogization may weaken the monological composition of secondary speech genres, it does not preclude a dominant theme, ideology, or cultural meaning from arising out of interplay of the \"various transformed primary genres\" (98) that make up a secondary work (although, Bakhtin admits, this dominant ideology is difficult to isolate in complex works, and is, to a certain extent, left open to the interpretation of individual readers). Bakhtin explains that primary genres undergo a more or less thorough process of contestation and resolution within the secondary work they constitute and \"enter into actual reality only via the [work] as a whole, that is, as a literary-artistic event and not as everyday life\" (62). \"As a rule, these secondary genres of complex cultural communication play out various forms of primary speech communication\" (Bakhtin 98). Even as a work permits and enacts dialogization between characters, conventional forms, and semantic content, it resolves or \"finalizes\" that content into a \"wholeness\" of utterance, which is intelligible to readers, and therefore \"guarantee[s] the possibility of response (or of responsive understanding)\" (76). Through the finalization of disparate conventional and thematic strands, a work achieves the fullness of what Bakhtin calls its \"specific authorial intent,\" Milton's \"speech plan\" or \"speech will\" for his work, and readies itself for responsive understanding (reception, interpretation) on the part of readers (77). Despite its internal dialogization, the work delivers itself to readers as a semantically exhaustive whole, and in this way uses its internal drama to respond ideologically to its genre: \"other works connected with it in the overall processes of speech communication in [its] particular cultural sphere\" (75). These include \"works of predecessors on whom the author relies,\" \"other works of the same school,\" and \"works of opposing schools with which the author is contending\" (75). In this way the work forms a crucial \"link the chain of speech communion\" of its genre (76).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50709", "title": "Gundam", "text": "Gundam\n\n, also known as the , is a science fiction media franchise created by Sunrise that features giant robots (mecha) with the name \"Gundam\" (after the original titular mecha). The franchise began on April 7, 1979 with \"Mobile Suit Gundam\", a TV series that defined the \"real robot\" mecha anime genre by featuring giant robots called mobile suits in a militaristic setting. The popularity of the series and its merchandise spawned a franchise that includes television series, OVAs, films, manga, novels and video games, as well as a whole industry of model robots known as Gunpla (plastic Gundam model).\n\nGunpla make up 90 percent of the Japanese character plastic-model market. Academics in Japan have viewed the series as inspiration; in 2008, the virtual Gundam Academy was planned as the first academic institution based on an animated TV series.\n\nThe \"Gundam\" franchise had grossed over in retail sales by 2000. By 2014, annual revenue of the \"Gundam\" franchise reached ¥80 billion per year, ¥18.4 billion of which was retail sales of toys and hobby items. As of June 2018, \"Gundam\" is the 15th highest-grossing media franchise of all time, estimated to have generated more than in total revenue.\n\n\"Mobile Suit Gundam\" was developed by animator Yoshiyuki Tomino and a changing group of Sunrise creators with the collective pseudonym of Hajime Yatate. The series was originally entitled \"Freedom Fighter Gunboy\" (or \"Gunboy\") for the robot's gun, with boys the primary target demographic. Early production had a number of references to freedom: the White Base was originally \"Freedom's Fortress\", the Core Fighter was the \"Freedom Wing\" and the Gunperry was the \"Freedom Cruiser\". The Yatate team combined the English word \"gun\" with the last syllable of the word \"freedom\" to form the portmanteau \"Gundom\". Tomino changed it to \"Gundam\", suggesting a unit wielding a gun powerful enough to hold back enemies like a hydroelectric dam holding back water. In keeping with the concept, Gundam are depicted as prototypes or limited-production, with higher capabilities than mass-produced units.\n\nMost Gundam are large, bipedal, humanoid vehicles controlled from a cockpit by a human pilot. The cockpit is located in the torso, while the head serves as a camera to transmit images back to the cockpit.\n\n\"Mobile Suit Gundam\" reportedly pioneered the real robot subgenre of mecha anime. Unlike its super robot cousins, \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" attempted realism in its robot design and weaponry by running out of energy and ammunition or malfunctioning. Its technology is derived from actual science (such as Lagrange points and the O'Neill cylinder in space) or feasible technology requiring only a few fictional elements to function (such as Minovsky Physics).\n\nMost of the \"Gundam\" animation (including the earliest series) is set in what is known as the Universal Century (UC) calendar era, with later series set in alternate calendars or timelines. Although many new Gundam stories are told in their parallel universe with independent timelines (giving them greater creative freedom), the original UC storyline continues to be popular. It established the series, setting the standard for hard science fiction in anime; the original \"Gundam\" marked the maturing of the giant-robot genre. Nostalgia for the oldest \"Gundam\" shows (and its status as a pop-culture icon in Japan) is a factor in its continuing success.\n\n\"SD Gundam\", a spinoff of \"Gundam\" which began during the mid-1980s, emphasizes comedy and adventure. \"Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G\" and \"Gundam Build Fighters\" feature contemporary settings and use Gunpla as plot elements.\n\nExcept for \"Mobile Suit Gundam 00\" (which follows the current calendar era), all mainstream Gundam series are set in a fictional era which begins after a drastic event or chain of events. The scenario commonly changes as the story progresses between Earth, space, space colonies and in some cases the Moon and terraformed planets.\n\nManga adaptations of the \"Gundam\" series have been published in English in North America by a number of companies, such as Viz Media, Del Rey Manga and Tokyopop, and in Singapore by Chuang Yi.\n\n\"Gundam\" has spawned over 80 video games for arcade, computer and console platforms, some with characters not found in other \"Gundam\" media. Some of the games, in turn inspired spinoff novels and manga. Most \"Gundam\" video games, except \"\", were released only in Japan.\n\nHundreds of Gundam models, primarily made of plastic but sometimes with resin and metal detail parts, have been released. They range in quality from children's toy kits to hobbyist and museum-grade models, and most are in 1:35, 1:48, 1:60, 1:100 or 1:144 scale. Promotional 1:6 or 1:12 scale models are supplied to retailers and are not commercially available. For \"Gundam\" 30th anniversary, a full-size RX-78-2 Gundam model was constructed and displayed at Gundam Front Tokyo, in the Odaiba district; it was taken down on 5 March 2017. A new statue of the Unicorn Gundam was erected at the same location, now renamed The Gundam Base Tokyo.\n\nBandai, \"Gundam\" primary licensee, produces a variety of products. Other companies produce unofficial merchandise, such as toys, models and T-shirts. Products include Mobile Suit In Action (MSiA) action figures and Gundam model kits in several scales and design complexities. Each series generally has its own set of products, MSiA and model lines such as Master Grade and High Grade Universal Century may extend across series. The most popular action-figure line has been the Gundam Fix series, which includes the mecha in the animated series, manga and novels and accessories to create an updated version. In addition to Master Grade and High Grade Gundams, Bandai released a 30th-anniversary series of Gundam models in 2010. The Real Grade (RG) Gundam series combined the Master Grade's detailed inner structure with additional colour separation, making the 1:144-scale series complex in design and compact in size. After the introduction of the RG Gundam series, Bandai released the Metal Build series in March 2011 (beginning with the 00 Gundam).\n\nBandai maintains several websites to promote \"Gundam\" projects; Gundam Perfect Web is the official Japanese site. Its English-language counterpart is the US-maintained Gundam Official. In 2005, the website hosted the Gundam Official User Forum. The forum was based on the existing fan forum, Gundam Watch, using many of its staff. When the project was retired, Gundam Watch was reborn and became Gundam Evolution.\n\nA number of series-specific websites have been created, often available for a limited time (usually to promote a DVD release). Common content includes character and mecha listings, lists of related merchandise and pay-for-download content. Special pages are frequent, often presenting downloadable wallpaper or a small game. The \"Superior Defender Gundam Force\" website has a game in which players take the role of villain Commander Sazabi, attempting to blast his subordinate with weapons.\n\nSince 1980, \"Gundam\" has appeared in the following countries and regions:\n\n\"Gundam\" is a Japanese cultural icon; it is a ¥50-billion-annual business of Bandai Namco, reaching ¥54.5 billion annual revenue by 2006, and annual revenue by 2014. Stamps were issued, an Agriculture Ministry employee was reprimanded for contributing to the Japanese Wikipedia Gundam-related pages, and the Japan Self-Defense Forces code-named its developing advance personal-combat system Gundam.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "255589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=255589", "title": "Harlem Globetrotters", "text": "Harlem Globetrotters\n\nThe Harlem Globetrotters are an exhibition basketball team. They combine athleticism, theater, and comedy in their style of play. Over the years they have played more than 26,000 exhibition games in 123 countries and territories. The team's signature song is Brother Bones' whistled version of \"Sweet Georgia Brown\". Their mascot is an anthropomorphized globe named Globie. The team plays over 450 live events worldwide each year. The team is currently owned by Herschend Family Entertainment. The executive offices for the team are located in suburban Atlanta.\n\nThe Globetrotters originated on the south side of Chicago, Illinois, in the 1920s, where all the original players were raised. The Globetrotters began as the Savoy Big Five, one of the premier attractions of the Savoy Ballroom opened in January 1928, a basketball team of African-American players that played exhibitions before dances. In 1928, several players left the team in a dispute. That autumn, several of the players, led by Tommy Brookins, formed a team called the \"Globe Trotters\" and toured Southern Illinois that spring. Abe Saperstein became involved with the team as its manager and promoter. By 1929, Saperstein was touring Illinois and Iowa with his basketball team called the \"New York Harlem Globe Trotters\". Saperstein selected Harlem, New York, New York, as their home city since Harlem was considered the center of African-American culture at the time and an out-of-town team name would give the team more of a mystique. In fact, the Globetrotters did not play in Harlem until 1968, four decades after the team's formation.\nThe Globetrotters were perennial participants in the World Professional Basketball Tournament, winning it in 1940. In a heavily attended matchup a few years later, the 1948 Globetrotters–Lakers game, the Globetrotters made headlines when they beat one of the best white basketball teams in the country, the Minneapolis Lakers (now the Los Angeles Lakers). Once one of the most famous teams in the country, the Globetrotters were eventually eclipsed by the rise of the National Basketball Association, particularly when NBA teams began fielding African-American players in the 1950s. In 1950, Harlem Globetrotter Chuck Cooper became the first black player to be drafted in the NBA by Boston and teammate Nat \"Sweetwater\" Clifton became the first African-American player to sign an NBA contract when the New York Knicks purchased his contract from the Globetrotters.\n\nThe Globetrotters gradually worked comic routines into their act—a direction the team has credited to Reece \"Goose\" Tatum, who joined in 1941—and eventually became known more for entertainment than sports. The Globetrotters' acts often feature incredible coordination and skillful handling of one or more basketballs, such as passing or juggling balls between players, balancing or spinning balls on their fingertips, and making unusually difficult shots.\n\nIn 1952, the Globetrotters invited Louis \"Red\" Klotz to create a team to accompany them on their tours. This team, the Washington Generals (who also played under various other names), became the Globetrotters' primary opponents. The Generals are effectively stooges for the Globetrotters, with the Globetrotters handily defeating them in thousands of games.\nIn 1959, the Globetrotters played nine games in Moscow after Saperstein received an invitation from Vasily Gricorevich, the director of Lenin Central Stadium. The team, which included Wilt Chamberlain, was welcomed enthusiastically by spectators and authorities; they met Premier Nikita Khrushchev and collectively received the Athletic Order of Lenin medal.\n\nHowever, according to one report, spectators were initially confused: \"A Soviet audience of 14,000 sat almost silently, as if in awe, through the first half of the game. It warmed up slightly in the second half when it realized the Trotters are more show than competition.\" The Globetrotters brought their own opponent—not the Washington Generals, but the San Francisco Chinese Basketeers. A review in Pravda stated, \"This is not basketball; it is too full of tricks\" but praised the Globetrotters' skills and suggested that \"they have some techniques to show us.\"\nThe American press—particularly Drew Pearson—made note of the fact that the Globetrotters were paid (per game) the equivalent of $4,000, which could be spent only in Moscow. The games were used as evidence that U.S.–Soviet relations were improving, that Moscow was backing off its criticism of race relations inside America, and that the USSR was becoming more capitalist (Pearson suggested that the games were held because Lenin Stadium needed money).\n\nMany famous basketball players have played for the Globetrotters. Greats such as \"Wee\" Willie Gardner, Connie \"The Hawk\" Hawkins, Wilt \"The Stilt\" Chamberlain, and Nat \"Sweetwater\" Clifton later went on to join the NBA. The Globetrotters signed their first female player, Olympic gold medalist Lynette Woodard, in 1985. The Globetrotters have featured thirteen female players in their history. Baseball Hall of Famers Ernie Banks, Bob Gibson, and Ferguson Jenkins also played for the team at one time or another. \nBecause the majority of the team players have historically been African American, and as a result of the buffoonery involved in many of the Globetrotters' skits, they drew some criticism during the Civil Rights era. The players were accused by some civil-rights advocates of \"Tomming for Abe\", a reference to Uncle Tom and Jewish owner Abe Saperstein. However, prominent civil rights activist Jesse Jackson (who would later be named an Honorary Globetrotter) came to their defense by stating,\n\"I think they've been a positive influence... They did not show blacks as stupid. On the contrary, they were shown as superior.\"\nIn 1995, Orlando Antigua became the first Hispanic player on the team. He was the first non-black player on the Globetrotters' roster since Bob Karstens played with the squad in 1942–43.\n\nWhile parts of a modern exhibition game are pre-planned, the games themselves are not fixed. While their opponents do not interfere with the Globetrotters’ hijinks while on defense, they play a serious game when in possession of the ball and about 20 to 30 percent of a game is \"real\". This once led to an infamous defeat at the hands of the Washington Generals, to the distress of a watching crowd.\n\nThe Globetrotters won the World Professional Basketball Tournament once, in 1940, beating the Chicago Bruins with a score of 31–29.\n\n \n\nStarting in 2007, the Globetrotters have conducted an annual \"draft\" a few days before the NBA draft, in which they select players they feel fit the mold of a Globetrotter. Being drafted by the Globetrotters does not guarantee a spot on the team, although several drafted players have gone on to become Globetrotters: Anthony \"Ant\" Atkinson (2007), Brent Petway (2007), William \"Bull\" Bullard (2008), Tay \"Firefly\" Fisher (2008), Charlie Coley III (2009), Paul \"Tiny\" Sturgess (2011), Jacob \"Hops\" Tucker (2011), Darnell \"Spider\" Wilks (2011), Bryan \"B-Nice\" Narcisse (2012), Tyrone Davis (2013), Corey \"Thunder\" Law (2013), Tyler \"Iceman\" Inman (2014) Devan \"Beast\" Douglas (2016) and AJ \"Money\" Merriweather.\n\nOther notable draft picks by the Globetrotters include: Sun Mingming (2007), Patrick Ewing, Jr. (2008), Sonny Weems (2008), Taylor Griffin (2009), Tim Howard (2009), Mark Titus (2010), Lionel Messi (2011), Andrew Goudelock (2011), Usain Bolt (2012), Mariano Rivera (2013), Brittney Griner (2013), Johnny Manziel (2014), Landon Donovan (2014), Mo'ne Davis (2015), Dude Perfect (2015), Neymar (2016), Missy Franklin (2016), Jordan Spieth (2016), Craig Sager (2016), Gal Gadot (2017), Aaron Judge (2017), Tim Tebow (2017) Paul Pogba (2018), and Joseph Kilgore (2018).\n\nThe Globetrotters have honored seven players by retiring their numbers:\n\nNote:<br>\na. The first non-Globetrotter to have a number retired by the team was Red Klotz, the founder, owner and two-handed-set-shot artist for the Washington Generals, the long-time Harlem Globetrotters' foils. He wore #3 as a player with the Generals, as well as during his standout collegiate and high school career in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Harlem Globetrotters have been featured in several of their own films and television series:\n\nTen people have been officially named as honorary members of the team:\n\n\nIn addition Bill Cosby (1972) and Magic Johnson (2003) were each signed to honorary $1-a-year lifetime contracts with the Globetrotters. When Cosby's nominal association with the team was the subject of criticism following sexual assault allegations, the Globetrotters stated that they had had no association with him for decades.\n\n"}

Maar (1921–1992), known as \"The Sultan of Balloons\", was one of the pioneers in balloon twisting. He appeared for over a decade on episodes of the long running Bozo's Circus. While the origins of balloon twisting is impossible to prove, Emmy Award winning producer/director Joseph Maar has provided evidence that his father, Henry, may be the founder of balloon twisting. Larry Moss calls Joseph Maar's evidence \"compelling\" but warns that if Joseph Maar is correct then the history of balloon twisting would have to be rewritten. For example, the 1975 book by \"Jolly the Clown\" Petri credits \"Herman Bonnert from Pennsylvania at a magician's convention in 1939\" as being the first balloontwister.\n\nJoseph Maar is the three time Emmy Award Winning Coordinating Director formerly with ESPN who worked on several shows including \"Sports Center\", \"Sports Century\", \"Pardon the Interruption\", \"Around the Horn\" and many other shows. He is also a client of some of the largest ballooning stores in the country. His story of his father has been picked up by several sources as the story of the origins of Balloon Twisting.\n\nAccording to Joseph Maar, his father had pleurisy as a child and spent several years at a TB Sanitorium in Milwaukee. To develop his lungs, the facility had Henry blow up balloons. In the 1930s Henry became a vaudeville magician. While preparing for a show in 1938 or 1939, Joseph writes, \"he came back to the car to get the rest of his magic tricks only to find the vehicle had been broken into and everything was gone.\" With his magic tricks stolen, Maar went on stage and performed a show consisting primarily of balloon twisting. \"Afterward, the agents went nuts and told him to forget the magic and to start doing the balloons. That <nowiki>[Henry Maar's agents said]</nowiki>'everyone's doing regular magic tricks but no one is doing the balloon tricks.'\"\n\nHenry spent the next ten years performing under the stage name of \"Johnny Ford\" and entertaining GI's with the USO. After World War II an agent offered Maar twice his rate to wear a clown suit while performing his act. Joseph Maar states \"that was the advent of a clown doing balloons.\" From the late 50s to mid-70s, Joseph and a 1968 article from the Waukegan Sun-Times cites that his father was a regular on \"Bozo's Circus\" and other children's shows. Two of these episodes reside with BalloonHQ and in IMDb he is listed in the credits of the March 16, 1977 episode of \"Bozo's Circus.\"\n\nJoseph Maar also credits his father with inventing 'face painting.' According to Joseph, his father would sometimes have trouble with his makeup during long summertime events. To cover his own need to touch up his clown make up, he would invite kids up on stage where Henry Maar would \"make them up\" like a clown.\n\nWhile Joseph Maar's story has been accepted as \"compelling,\" it is not viewed as conclusive. Other twisters have been credited with being the originator of balloon twisting. They include:\n\n"}
{"id": "10419395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10419395", "title": "Magician's assistant", "text": "Magician's assistant\n\nA magician's assistant is a performer in a magic act who is not billed as the magician or principal name in the act. The role of an assistant can include holding the props that are used by a magician, shifting props onto and off the stage, and serving as a living prop in illusions that involve manipulation of the human body. Other aspects of the role can include dancing or acting as visual ornamentation, sometimes for simple aesthetic purposes and sometimes to misdirect audience attention. The figure of the glamorous female assistant has become a stereotype or icon in art, popular media and fiction.\n\nAlthough magician's assistants appear to play a supporting role and receive a lesser billing than the magician who appears to be the source of illusions, the assistant is often the one making the mechanics of the illusions work. In the words of Joanie Spina, who worked for 11 years as principal assistant, choreographer and artistic consultant to illusionist David Copperfield:\n\n...I did find fault with the term \"assistant\" because it sounds like someone rolling props on and off stage when many of us were highly trained actors and dancers.\n\nAssistants have been part of magic shows for most of the recorded history of magic as a performance art. Despite their often crucial role in magic acts they, and the work they do, have suffered from negative public perceptions. The assistant's role has often been stereotyped as consisting of menial tasks and having the primary purpose of adding a visually aesthetic element to an act. This is associated with the perception that assistants are usually female and often dressed in revealing costumes. Although there have been plenty of instances of male assistants throughout the history of magic, the glamorous female stereotype has made a particular impact because female assistants were a prominent feature of illusion shows during the 20th century, when magic began to reach huge new audiences, first through the burgeoning of live vaudeville and variety shows and then through television. The glamorous female assistant has become an iconic image that continues in modern media and literature.\n\nA notable feature of the glamorous female assistant iconography is the frequency with which assistants play the role of \"victim\" in illusions where they are tied up, apparently cut with blades, penetrated with spikes or swords or otherwise tortured or imperilled. Examples include \"Aztec Lady\", \"Devil's Torture Chamber\", \"Mismade Girl\", \"Radium Girl\", \"Zig Zag Girl\", and, perhaps most famous of all, \"Sawing a woman in half\". Noted illusion designer and historian Jim Steinmeyer has identified the advent of the sawing illusion as a turning point in magic history and a moment which, more than any other, marks the origin of the cliche of the female assistant as victim. It is generally agreed that a \"sawing\" type illusion was first performed publicly by P. T. Selbit in January 1921. His presentations of what he titled \"Sawing through a woman\" made an enormous impact and greatly affected public expectations of stage magic for decades afterwards. Steinmeyer has explained:\n\nBefore Selbit's illusion, it was not a cliche that pretty ladies were teased and tortured by magicians. Since the days of Robert-Houdin, both men and women were used as the subjects for magic illusions. Victorian gowns often made it unrealistic for a lady to take part in an illusion or be pressed into a tight space.\n\nChanges in fashion and great social upheavals during the first decades of the 20th century made Selbit's choice of \"victim\" both practical and popular. Steinmeyer notes: \"During the 1900s, as a shapely leg became not only acceptable on the stage but admired, it was fashionable to perform magic with a cast of attractive ladies\".\n\nThat was only part of the story, however. The trauma of war had helped to desensitize the public to violence and the emancipation of women had changed attitudes to them. Audiences were also tiring of the gentler forms of magic represented by the likes of John Nevil Maskelyne. It took something more shocking, such as the horrific productions of the Grand Guignol theatre, to cause a sensation in this age. Steinmeyer concludes that: \"...beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment\".\n\nIn contrast to the publicity given to Selbit, the names of the assistants who made this influential act work have received almost no publicity. There were two premieres of the illusion. Selbit first presented it to an audience in December 1920; however, on that occasion the spectators were a small group of invited theatrical agents and promoters who Selbit hoped would book the act. The public premiere then occurred on 17 January 1921 at the Finsbury Park Empire music hall after Selbit was hired by the Moss Empire group. According to Steinmeyer, the assistant at the 1920 preview was Jan Glenrose, Selbit's main assistant at that time. The public performances featured principal assistant Betty Barker.\n\nMany of these illusions, together with others that involve appearances, disappearances or escapes, involve assistants being shut in boxes of one sort or another. This has led to the nickname \"box jumper\" which, although it could be applied to a male assistant, is usually inferred to be a female assistant. One reason that has been given for the predominance of women in this role is that the illusions sometimes require an assistant that can fit into cramped spaces and women have an advantage in that they tend to be smaller and more limber than men.\n\nFeminist critics have taken the above aspects of illusions and performances as evidence to support claims that magic is misogynistic, but this view has been contested by some magicians and assistants. However, a few prominent assistants have stated that they deserve better recognition for their efforts and achievements (see \"Documentaries\" below).\n\nSome modern magic acts have preserved the glamorous elements of the female assistant iconography while attempting to give full recognition to female performers by billing women as equal partners in acts. A notable example was the husband and wife act The Pendragons, for which Charlotte Pendragon wore very revealing costumes and did traditional \"box jumping\" roles yet received equal billing with her husband. She was also honored in her own right as a top professional magician. Another example, although with more modest and conservative costuming, is Kristen Johnson, who receives equal billing with her husband Kevin Ridgeway when they perform together as a magic act and often stars in her own right as an escape artist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4925070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4925070", "title": "Minsky's Burlesque", "text": "Minsky's Burlesque\n\nMinsky's Burlesque refers to the brand of American burlesque presented by four sons of Louis and Ethel Minsky: Abraham 'Abe' Bennett Minsky (1880–1949), Michael William 'Billy' Minsky (1887–1932), Herbert Kay Minsky (1891-1959), and Morton Minsky (1902–1987). They started in 1912 and ended in 1937 in New York City. Although the shows were declared obscene and outlawed, they were rather tame by modern standards.\n\nThe eldest brother, Abe, launched the business in 1908 with a Lower East Side nickelodeon showing racy films. His own father shut him down and bought the National Winter Garden on Houston Street, which had a theater inconveniently located on the sixth floor. He gave the theater to Abe and his brothers Billy and Herbert. At first they tried showing respectable films but could not compete with the large theater chains. The Minskys tried to bolster their shows by bringing in vaudeville performers but could not afford good acts.\n\nThen they considered burlesque. Burlesque acts were cheaper, and circuits (called \"wheels\") supplied a new show every week, complete with cast, costumes, and scenery. There was the Columbia Wheel, the American Wheel, and the Mutual Wheel. Burlesque during this period was \"clean\"; a fourth wheel, the Independent, actually went bankrupt in 1916 after refusing to clean up its act. The Minskys briefly considered signing with a wheel but decided to stage their own shows because it was cheaper and Billy longed to be the next Florenz Ziegfeld.\n\nBut Minsky's clientele of poor immigrants had not been taught to appreciate clean burlesque, and the Minskys were not about to teach them. Plus, their audience needed a compelling reason to trek up to a sixth-floor theater. Billy realized that success in burlesque depended on how the women were featured. Abe, who had been to Paris and the Folies Bergère and Moulin Rouge, suggested importing one of their trademarks: a runway to bring the women out into the audience. The theater was reconfigured, and the Minskys were the first to feature a runway in the United States. Billy had the sign out front changed to \"Burlesque As You Like It – Not a Family Show,\" and the Minskys were on their way.\n\nThe Minskys were raided for the first time in 1917 when Mae Dix absent-mindedly began removing her costume before she reached the wings. When the crowd cheered, Dix returned to the stage to continue removing her clothing to wild applause. Billy ordered the \"accident\" repeated every night. This began an endless cycle: to keep their license, the Minskys had to keep their shows clean, but to keep drawing customers they had to be risqué. Whenever they went too far, they were raided.\n\nMorton joined the company in 1924, after graduating from New York University, and worked at the Little Apollo Theater on 125th Street. There was a raid during the very first show. For the next four years, the theater showed a weekly profit of $20,000 after payola.\n\nBilly's attempt, however, to present classy burlesque at the Park Theater on Columbus Circle failed miserably.\n\nAnother famous raid occurred in April, 1925, and inspired the book and film \"The Night They Raided Minsky's\". By this time it was permissible for women in shows staged by Ziegfeld, George White, and Earl Carroll – as well as burlesque – to appear topless as long as they did not move (a similar rule in London burlesque was famously demonstrated in the film Mrs. Henderson Presents). In a show at the National Winter Garden, Mademoiselle Fifi (née Mary Dawson from Pennsylvania) stripped to the waist and then moved. Occasionally a raid was triggered by the comedy material, but filthy comics did not last long, because they were a liability to the management.\n\nBusiness boomed during Prohibition and the National Winter Garden's notoriety grew. Regular patrons included John Dos Passos, Robert Benchley, George Jean Nathan, Condé Nast, and Hart Crane (see Crane's poem \"National Winter Garden\" in \"The Bridge)\".\n\nBilly realized that while burlesque could not be classy it could be presented in classy surroundings. In 1931 he proposed bringing the Minsky brand to Broadway, amid the respectable shows. The brothers leased the Republic Theater on 42nd Street and staged their first show on February 12. The Republic became Minsky's flagship theater and the capital of burlesque in the United States. (The theater is now called the New Victory and, ironically, specializes in children's entertainment.) Other burlesque shows were inspired to open on 42nd Street at the nearby Eltinge and Apollo Theaters.\n\nThe Great Depression ushered in the greatest era for burlesque, and Minsky burlesque in particular. Few could afford to attend expensive Broadway shows, yet people craved entertainment. Furthermore, there now seemed to be an unlimited supply of unemployed pretty women who considered the steady work offered by burlesque. By the time they finished expanding, the various Minskys controlled over a dozen theaters – six in New York and others in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Albany, and Pittsburgh. They even formed their own \"wheel.\"\n\nMinsky's featured comics Phil Silvers, Joey Faye, Rags Ragland, Zero Mostel, Jules Munshin, Jimmy Savo, Eddie Collins, Pinky Lee, Morey Amsterdam, Red Buttons, Benny Rubin, Irving Benson, Red Skelton, and Abbott and Costello, as well as headlining stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. Others included Danny Kaye, Jack Albertson and Robert Alda, as well as strippers Lili St. Cyr, Georgia Sothern, Ann Corio, Margie Hart, Mara Gaye and Sherry Britton. These women, who began stripping in their teens, made between $700 and $2,000 a week.\n\nWith burlesque thriving in New York (there were now 14 burlesque theaters, including Minsky's rivals), competition was fierce. Each year, various license commissioners issued restrictions to keep burlesque from pushing the limits. But convictions were rare, so theater managers saw no need to tone down their shows.The Minskys emphasized that a good strip-tease dance must know exactly the right psychological moment to remove each garment. 'It is not just a matter of going on the stage and taking off clothes - it needs finesse.'\n\nIn 1935, irate citizens' groups began calling for action against burlesque. Fiorello H. LaGuardia deemed them a \"corrupting moral influence.\" The city's license commissioner, Paul Moss, tried to revoke Minsky's license but the State Court of Appeals ruled that he did not have grounds without a criminal conviction. Finally, in April, 1937, a stripper at Abe Minsky's New Gotham Theater in Harlem was spotted working without a G-string. The ensuing raid led to the demise not only of Minsky burlesque but of all burlesque in New York. The conviction allowed Moss to revoke Abe's license and refuse to renew all of the other burlesque licenses in New York.\n\nAfter several appeals, the Minskys and their rivals were allowed to reopen only if they adhered to new rules that forbade strippers. The owners went along, hoping to stay in business until the November election when reformist mayor Fiorello La Guardia might be voted out. But business under the new code was so bad that many New York burlesque theaters closed their doors for good. By the time La Guardia was re-elected, the word \"burlesque\" had been banned and, soon after, the Minsky name itself, since the two were synonymous. With that final blow, burlesque and the Minskys were finished in New York.\n\nOf all the Minskys, only Harold, Abe's adopted son, remained active in burlesque. Harold started at age nineteen at the height of the Great Depression, learning the business by working in all facets from the box office to theater management. \"At nineteen, Harold took over the business from his father. Every summer, his parents went to Europe for vacation and the theatres would close due to the heat in New York City. Theatres\nweren’t air-conditioned. The performers begged Harold to keep his doors open; the girls were broke, and they desperately needed the money from the performances. So Harold stayed open and, though a ticket cost a dime, 'He made over\na million dollars,' claimed his wife Dardy Minsky.” By his early twenties, Harold had already produced shows. Harold was the first one to do nudity in a nice way.\n\nHarold would become responsible for discovering and grooming dozens of the most famous names throughout the 1930s into the '50s. Harold claimed to have targeted future headliner fourteen-year-old Sherry Britton from an audition. Harold also employed and nurtured first-rate comic talents such as Phil Silvers.\n\nIn 1956, Harold brought the Minsky name to a Las Vegas revue at the Dunes, where it could exist without apology. Harold, Dardy and their two children moved there while he put on a show at the Dunes. He kept a chorus line, top-rate comedians, a snazzy band, and, of course, the star strippers. He did smashing business; for the first time making burlesque accessible to an upper-middle-class crowd. That revue ran for six years; subsequently, he moved Minsky productions into other landmark casinos such as the Silver Slipper, the Thunderbird, and The Aladdin. \n\nHarold resided in Las Vegas until his death in 1977.\n\nNotes\n"}

Motive, in itself, is not an element of any given crime; however, the legal system typically allows motive to be proven in order to make plausible the accused's reasons for committing a crime, at least when those motives may be obscure or hard to identify with. However, a motive is not required to reach a verdict. Motives are also used in other aspects of a specific case, for instance, when police are initially investigating.\n\nThe law technically distinguishes between motive and intent. \"Intent\" in criminal law is synonymous with \"Mens rea\", which means the mental state shows liability which is enforced by law as an element of a crime. \"Motive\" describes instead the reasons in the accused's background and station in life that are supposed to have induced the crime. Motives are often broken down into three categories; biological, social and personal.\n\nThere are two objections to motive when considering punishment. The first is volitional objection, which is the argument that the person cannot manage his or her own motives and therefore cannot be punished for them. The second objection is neutrality objection. This is based on the idea that our society has contrasting political opinions and therefore a government’s preference should be limited.\n\nThere are four different ways a defendants motive can be pertinent to his or her criminal liability. Motive can be fully inculpatory or exculpatory or only partially inculpatory or exculpatory. When one has acted with a specific motive, lawful behavior becomes illegal, and this is when motive is fully inculpatory. If illegal activity with a particular motive does not hold a defendant responsible then that motive is fully exculpatory. When a motive supplies inadequate defense to a crime, the motive is partially exculpatory. When a motive says the kind of infraction for which the defendant is responsible, the motive is partially inculpatory.\n\n"}

Men were later admitted to the organization, and have been an important and enriching addition.\n\nThe National Career Awards Competition, organized by the NSAL is held each year in one of the following categories: visual arts, dance, drama, literature, music or musical theater. Participants in the National Career Awards Competition compete at the local chapter level for a series of monetary awards. First-place winners of the Local Chapter Competitions are sent to the NSAL National Competition, which is held each spring during the Society’s annual meeting. Participants in the National Competition compete for a first place award of $15,000, and a series of other awards that can total another $10,000 or more.\n\nThe competitions are designed to offer exposure for young artists who want to be heard and seen by professional critics, managers, producers, teachers, the media, and patrons of the arts.\n\nDuring its history, the competitions organized by the NSAL have benefitted Oscar-winning actress and dancer Shirley MacLaine and international opera star Jessye Norman among others. In 1998, non-citizens were permitted full membership privileges, thereby extending a more inviting, inclusive image to the organization.\n\nAll competitions are adjudicated by nationally recognized men and women in the arts. A master class is conducted by judges for the National Career Awards Competitions. Opportunities for one-on-one sessions and individual critiques are also encouraged.\n\nBegun by a group of civic-minded women who wanted to encourage young talent in the arts, the National Society of Arts and Letters determined from its inception that the best way to accomplish that goal was to sponsor competitions and offer scholarships in the categories of art, music and literature.\n\nOn October 21, 1944, they met at the home of the future first National President, Mollie Davis Nicholson, to found a group that specified it was non-partisan, non-political and non-profit-making. The Chevy Chase, Maryland Chapter was organized that year and became the Washington, D.C. Chapter on March 31, 1945, with Dorothy Nicholson Bates Stabell as its first president and founder.\n\nA second chapter, the Chicago Chapter, was started by Francesca Falk Miller Nielsen, also in October 1944. In 1945, both chapters awarded scholarships: one in piano, three in voice (Washington) and one in pipe organ (Chicago).\n\nOn June 30, 1945, the first national conference of the National Society of Arts and Letters was held in Chicago. By this time, eight chapters had been formed: Washington, D.C., Chicago, Florida, Colorado, North Dakota, California, Texas and Kentucky. The bylaws provided membership to women qualified in the arts who were U.S. citizens. Artist member Emma W. Slack designed the insignia. Young artists were to be encouraged by receipt of donor gifts, chapter prizes, scholarships and exhibitions of their work or talent arranged by a chapter.\n\nBy 1946 four more chapters had started: Arkansas, Indiana, Ohio and New Jersey. A convention was held in Washington, D.C., between April 15–16 of that year, at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. American First Lady Bess Truman, initiated the festivities with a reception at the White House.\n\nAs growth continued, Francesca Falk Miller Nielsen, the second National President, introduced and edited the newsletter. It was planned to issue it three times a year. A Certificate of Incorporation, was issued July 29, 1949 and tax-exempt status, was recorded November 7, 1949. By 1949 both dance and drama categories had been added to the competitions. By 1951, 25 chapters had been started.\n\nIn October 1994 members gathered together for a gala celebration of the Societies' 50th anniversary. The Central Illinois Chapter hosted the 60th Anniversary celebration in 2005 with performances by former contestants from 1959-2002. There was also a video featuring Dorothy Nicholson Stabell, daughter of one of the founders.\n\nToday there are 20 NSAL Chapters in 17 states.\n\nPart of the National competitions are the master classes conducted by judges in each art category. One-on-one sessions are also offered and encouraging critiques of each contestant are provided by the judges.\n\nThe National Society of Arts and Letters classifies the arts into six different categories: Art, Dance, Drama, Literature, Music and Musical Theatre; various sub-categories exist within each category. The annual National Competitions rotate among these six categories with the particular sub-category selected by the membership.\n\nMaster classes have been conducted in all the arts categories beginning in 2000. They have been conducted for NSAL by their judges and guest teachers including:\n\nSince the first national competition in 1951, NSAL has presented more than 4,000 awards to young artists. Chapter competitions are usually held in various artistic categories including the one special category specified for the National Competition for that year; only the first-place winners from the chapter competitions in this category advance to the National Competition.\n\nEarly on in the history of NSAL, the Nicholson/Nielsen Trust Fund was established to provide permanent support for awards to be given annually to ranking finalists in the National Career Award Competition. The principal of the Fund remains intact while the income is used to provide awards each year in one of the six rotating art categories which NSAL highlights in its National Competition.\n\nIndividuals and corporations may also endow a named award by contributing to the Fund. Current awards available from tax-exempt gifts to this Fund totaling $10,000 or more include:\n\nNSAL First Place Award of $10,000 or more is in memory of Mollie Davis Nicholson and Francesca Falk Miller Nielson, founders of the Society. The Estelle Campbell Award is presented to the second-place winner. The Mary Peery Fife Memorial Award is given in the category of Dance. The Catherine A. M. Cavanaugh Award is given in the Literature Category. Other awards include the Dorothy and Bruce Strong Award and the Mollie Davis Nicholson Award\n\nA second important activity of NSAL is the annual Winston Scholarship Program for visual artists and vocalists. Each year, scholarships totaling $18,000 - $20,000 are awarded to artists in these fields who are sixteen to twenty-two years of age. Supported by an endowment from Shirley Rabb Winston, these scholarships are used for special study in the recipient’s field.\n\nNotable recipients of NSAL awards have included Malcolm Frager (pianist), Shirley MacLaine (actor), Jessye Norman (opera singer; winner of a NSAL contest), Menahem Pressler (Gold Medal of Merit from the National Society of Arts and Letters), George Balanchine (1980 Gold Medal of Merit recipient\n"}

{"id": "3278506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3278506", "title": "Nickelodeon Guts", "text": "Nickelodeon Guts\n\nNickelodeon Guts (stylized as Nickelodeon GUTS) is an American television \"action sports\" competition series hosted by actor/writer Mike O'Malley and officiated by British actress Moira \"Mo\" Quirk. The series originally ran from 1992 to 1996 on Nickelodeon.\n\nEach episode features three young athletes competing against each other in four \"extreme\" versions of athletic events culminating in a fifth and final round which set the three competitors on a race up an artificial \"mountain\" called the Aggro Crag, Mega Crag, or Super Aggro Crag. \"Nickelodeon GUTS\" reruns were shown on Nickelodeon from January 15, 1996 until January 31, 1999 before moving to Nickelodeon GAS from March 1, 1999 until the station ceased broadcasting on December 31, 2007 (April 23, 2009 on Dish Network). It has occasionally been seen in reruns on TeenNick since January 1, 2008; since 2011 those reruns would be found on the channel's \"NickSplat\" block on an occasional basis.\n\nSeason 1 began taping on August 12, 1992.\n\nIn 2008, Nickelodeon produced two seasons of a revival of the program, \"My Family's Got GUTS\".\n\nThe series was filmed at Sound Stage 21 at Universal Studios Florida on a set dubbed the \"Extreme Arena\". This arena consists of a turf playing field, a pool, an obstacle course, and the Aggro Crag.\n\nOn each half-hour episode, three children or teenagers (blue, red and purple) compete against each other in four events that are based on \"extreme\" versions of skills in popular sports, such as basketball, baseball, football, and soccer. While most of these events include the use of an elastic harness, others make use of a wave pool, and sometimes a racing track is used. During the show's run, more creative and ambitious events were developed, even including a fabricated ski slope.\n\nThe competitors are awarded points based on their comparative performance in each event. First place in each event is worth 300 points. Second place receives 200 points, and third place earns 100 points.\n\nThe contestants are introduced in the breaks between events in a segment dubbed \"Spill Your GUTS\". The segment was done as an interview with one of the hosts in the first two seasons (O'Malley in season 1 and Quirk in season 2), and was subsequently a pre-recorded segment. In seasons 3 and 4, the contestants introduced themselves. In season 5, during Global Guts, a flag of the player's country would be shown, followed by the contestant introducing him/herself. Then, the location where the contestant is from would be shown on a map, followed by him/her giving more information about what he/she does.\n\nThere are several different types of events, ranging from field sports to the pool. Many aerial events made use of elastic harnesses.\n\nThe fifth and final event of each episode pits the three contestants in a race to climb a fabricated mountain called the Aggro Crag (season 1–2), and later called the Mega Crag (season 3), and the Super Aggro Crag (Global GUTS). Each contestant had a separate (but identical) side of the mountain to climb, and was not permitted to cross into their opponents' paths or disrupt their progress.\n\nThe object of the Crag was for all three contestants to race to the peak of the Crag, while hitting a series of buttons (referred to as \"actuators\") along the way to the peak. If a contestant misses any of the actuators along the way, a spotter at the top (often referred to as the \"crag troll\") prevents that player from completing the climb until he/she returns and activates whatever targets they missed. The first contestant to successfully activate all of their actuators, including the final one at the peak, earns 725 points. The second and third-place contestants earn 550 and 375 points, respectively.\n\nThe climb is made more difficult by strobe lights \"lightning\", foam rock \"avalanches\", flying \"snow\" in the form of glitter and confetti, and \"nuclear flying crystals\" that are each triggered either at random or when the players step on specific switchbacks on the crag.\n\nA number of violations/errors on the Crag could result in a player automatically receiving third place points. These include:\n\nThe increased point structure in the final event allows contestants overcome a deficit of as much as 300 points to win, despite earlier mistakes. The point structure for the Crag eliminates the possibility of a tie except in the unlikely event that two players who are already tied are each disqualified during the Crag and therefore both receive third-place points. While dual-disqualifications did occur during the show's run, it never resulted in a tie.\n\nThe sound design for the action on the Aggro Crag was created by Nickelodeon Senior Sound Designer Mark Schultz, who converted the voltages supplied by the infrared actuator \"eyes\" to triggers read by a MIDI-based sampler.\n\nThe total height of the Aggro Crag was . For the Mega Crag, as well as the Super Aggro Crag on \"Global GUTS\", the total height was tall.\n\nThe player with the most points after all five events wins the game and receives a gold \"GUTS\" medal, as well as a faux glowing piece of the Aggro Crag. When the show changed to \"Global GUTS\", the medals were redesigned to reflect the show's new logo. With all seasons of the show, second place receives a silver medal and third receives a bronze medal. The highest possible score for a player is 1,925 points, and was attained several times throughout the show's run. Three contestants who achieved this score in 1992 were invited back to compete in a one-hour \"GUTS All-Star Special\" in 1993.\n\nOn July 25, 1993, at the start of the show's second season, Nickelodeon aired a one-hour special known as \"Nickelodeon GUTS All-Stars\", where three former players from the previous season who made a perfect score of 1,925 points compete for a college scholarship and a special GUTS All-Star trophy. The one-hour special featured seven events plus the Aggro Crag. This special also debuted five new events, which were later seen throughout the second season. The new events were: Rebound, Tornado Run, Hang Ten, Fumble and Mad Max. The special also included an extended version of Basic Training. The three perfect-scoring players from the first season were: Mike \"Superman\" Schmidt, Jana \"The Warrior\" Waring, and Kelli \"The Maniac\" Marchewka. In the award ceremony, each player received a silver Nickelodeon GUTS All-Stars plate along with their college scholarship. Third place received a $1,000 college scholarship, second place received a $1,500 college scholarship and the winner received a $2,500 college scholarship. Jana \"The Warrior\" Waring, dressed in red, won the Nickelodeon GUTS All-Stars trophy at the end of the show. In 1994, Sony Wonder released a VHS based on the \"All-Star Special\", which featured special guest commentaries by Super Bowl Champion Lawrence Taylor.\n\nFor the show's final season, Nickelodeon produced an international spinoff, Global Guts, featuring contestants from various countries, including the United States of America, Mexico, United Kingdom, Israel, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (simply referred to as \"CIS\" on air, this included only Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine). Although the countries had multiple contestants, no country was ever represented twice in a single episode except for the Special Olympic special where it had 2 U.S. players. Each country had its own team of broadcasters; O'Malley retained this role for the US broadcast. The format remained identical to the original version, but the Mega Crag was upgraded to the \"Super Aggro Crag\". In the \"Spill Your GUTS\" segments, for players from non-English-speaking countries, an interpreter was used.\n\nTaping of \"Global GUTS\" took place from July 12 to August 15, 1995, and episodes began airing September 5, 1995, as part of Nick in the Afternoon.\n\nMedal presentations were also accompanied by the raising of flags and the playing of the national anthem of the winning country, and a victory lap by the contestants, draped in the flags of their home countries. A medal count was also tabulated at the beginning of each episode, similar to the Olympics.\n\nIn addition to airing the program on Nickelodeon in the United States, these broadcasters have seen in represented countries as follows:\n\nAs a precursor to \"Global GUTS\", season 3 of \"Nickelodeon GUTS\" featured six contestants from the United Kingdom, competing in six separate shows. Of the six, four contestants ended up winning the gold medal. The six UK contestants were as follows:\n\nIn 1992, Backstreet Boy A.J. McLean appeared on \"Nickelodeon GUTS\", competing against Amanda \"The Accelerator\" Bulger and Jamie \"The Jackal\" Mendelsohn, and finished with the silver medal. He was in blue and referred to on the show as AJ \"Mean\" McLean. He had one event win during his appearance, that being a win in the Slam Dunk event.\n\nIn 1993, Hollywood stuntwoman Anna Mercedes Morris competed on the show under the name Anna \"Roadrunner\" Morris. She was dressed in red, competing against \"Lawless\" Lauren Shealy and Paul \"Running Man\" Battson, and she finished with the gold medal, despite injuring her knee in the Basic Training event.\n\nIn 1993, actor Mike Vogel competed on \"Nickelodeon GUTS\" with Christy \"Blast\" Gast and Cam \"The Ice Man\" Burke, and finished with the silver medal. He tied with the other players for first place on Over the Top and also won the Aggro Crag event, coming from third place to take second overall. He was known as Mike \"Flea\" Vogel and was dressed in blue.\n\nIn 1994, actress Ashley Drane competed on \"Nickelodeon GUTS\" with Nicole \"The Bomber\" Bozard and UK resident Leanne \"Panther\" Kelley, and finished with the silver medal. She was known as Ashley \"The Face\" Drane and was dressed in blue. Exactly 10 years later, Ashley made a 2nd Nickelodeon appearance, this time on \"Drake & Josh\" playing Drake's girlfriend Susan in the episode \"Believe Me Brother\". Mike \"The Dominator\" Drane, a \"Nickelodeon GUTS\" player from season 1, is also her brother.\n\nIn 1994, D. C. United defender Bobby Boswell appeared on \"Nickelodeon GUTS\", competing against Robin \"The Lizard\" Rexroat and Jennifer \"The Jaguar\" Barnes, and finished with the silver medal. He was known on the show as Bobby \"Lightning\" Boswell and won the soccer event \"Shoot Out\", just a hint of what was to come for his career. Boswell, who was dressed in purple, also won the Mega Crag event in that very same show.\n\nThe only guest during the 1992 season:\n\nThe only guest during the 1993 season:\n\nThe following were guests during the 1994 season:\n\n\nThe guests in the 1994 season would, before each event, give a list of three \"Smart Moves\" (suggestions) that they felt that the players should follow.\n\nThe only guest during the 1995 season (Global GUTS):\n\n\nAll of the episodes of \"Nickelodeon GUTS\" exist, and have aired on Nickelodeon until 1999, the now defunct Nick GaS from 1999 to 2007. \"Nickelodeon GUTS\" was also on the list of programs to be included on \"The '90s Are All That\" (TeenNick's 1990s block) upon its launch in July 2011, but the program did not make its debut until August 2013.\n\nAs of October 2015, the show airs in reruns occasionally on the TeenNick block \"The Splat.\"\n\nA revival of the show, \"My Family's Got Guts\", debuted on September 15, 2008, filmed at Universal Studios Florida as was the original (but due to it already being occupied, not on the same sound stage as the original). This version is hosted by Ben Lyons, along with Australian celebrity Asha Kuerten as the referee. Unlike the original, it follows a bracket tournament format featuring 2 families competing as teams per episode, with points earned being used instead to provide a head start during the Aggro Crag rather than deciding the winner.\n\nIn November 1994 Nickelodeon released a video game based on the \"Nickelodeon GUTS\" game show for the Super NES. One or two players may compete in many of the events that debuted in the TV show, including the Aggro Crag. The game is based on the actual footage of the show and contains filmed contestants. \"Nintendo Power\" praised the game's graphics, but criticized the poor control.\n\nIn the episode of \"Sanjay and Craig\" \"G.U.T.S. Busters\", the boys competed in the game show itself. Mike O'Malley and Moira \"Mo\" Quirk also guest starred in the episode as themselves.\n"}

{"id": "20782736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20782736", "title": "Opsis", "text": "Opsis\n\nOpsis () is the Greek word for spectacle in the theatre and performance. Its first use has been traced back to Aristotle's \"Poetics.\" It is now taken up by theatre critics, historians, and theorists to describe the mise en scène of a performance or theatrical event.\n\nOpsis comes from the ancient Greek for \"appearance, sight, view.\" The English word optic is derived from this word.\n\nAristotle's use of the term opsis, as Marvin Carlson points out, is the \"final element of tragedy,\" but the term \"receive[d] no further consideration\". Aristotle discusses opsis in book 6 of the poetics, but only goes as far as to suggest that \"spectacle has, indeed, an emotional attraction of its own, but, of all the parts, it is the least artistic, and connected least with the art of poetry. For the power of Tragedy, we may be sure, is felt even apart from representation and actors. Besides, the production of spectacular effects depends more on the art of the stage machinist than on that of the poet\".\n\nIn \"Theories of the Theatre\" by Marvin Carlson, the word opsis is replaced with the English equivalent \"spectacle,\" but gives opsis/spectacle as much focus as Aristotle does in the Poetics; however, in \"Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis\" Opsis is listed in the \"terms\" section, and defined as:\nthat which is visible, offered to the [gaze], hence its connections with the notions of \"spectacle\" and \"performance\". In Aristotle's \"Poetics, spectacle\" is one of the six constituent parts of tragedy, but ranks below others considered to be more essential ... The place in theatre history assigned subsequently to the opsis, to what we would now call the [mise-en-scene], determined the mode of transmission and the overall meaning of the performance. \"Opsis\" is a spectific feature of the performing arts.\n\nJ. Michael Walton, in \"The Greek Sense of Theatre: Tragedy Reviewed\", challenges the traditional assumptions about Ancient Greek theatre. He states that “the visual aspect of the Greek theatre has for so long taken second place to the spoken word...it is still the common belief that what was said in the Greek tragedies was more important than what was seen.” Walton's thesis suggests that Ancient theatre lacks evidence of original productions, but that the written text, in comparison, is more accessible, and as a result, has caused Ancient theatre critics to relegate spectacle/mise-en-sene/opsis to less important aspects of theatre than the spoken word.\n\nRonald W. Vince, suggests that while it may \nseem logical simply to recognize \"opsis\" as stage spectacle or the \"mise-en-scene\" and so include it — if anywhere — in the vocabulary of performance theory. But there is implied even in Aristotle's use of the term a possible interpretation which would link \"opsis\" with the art of writing plays as well as with the art of staging them.\n"}
{"id": "3365514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3365514", "title": "Oral interpretation", "text": "Oral interpretation\n\nOral Interpretation is a dramatic art, also commonly called \"interpretive reading\" and \"dramatic reading\", though these terms are more conservative and restrictive. In certain applications, oral interpretation is also a theatre art – as in reader's theatre, in which a work of literature is performed with manuscripts in hand or, more traditionally, using stools and music stands; and especially chamber theatre, which dispenses with manuscripts and uses what may be described as essentialist costuming and stage lighting, and suggestive scenery.\n\nThe term is succinctly defined by Paul Campbell (\"The Speaking and Speakers of Literature\"; Dickinson, 1967) as the \"oralization of literature\"; or more eloquently, if less intelligibly, by Charlotte Lee and Timothy Gura (\"Oral Interpretation\"; Houghton-Mifflin, 1997) as \"the art of communicating to an audience a work of literary art in its intellectual, emotional, and aesthetic entirety\". Historically essential to Charlotte Lee's definition of oral interpretation is the fact the performer is \"reading from a manuscript\". This perspective, once the majority view, has long since become the minority opinion on the question; so that whether one is or is not reading from a manuscript, the art retains the same name.\n\nVoice and movement technique is \"opsis\" (\"spectacle\") while oral interpretation is, conceptually, \"melopoiia\" (\"music technique\").\n\nBecause oral interpretation is an essential dramatic element in all performance art (even dance, in which the oral element is most typically a silent element), all actors, singers, storytellers, etc., are \"interpreters\" – but not all interpreters are necessarily actors, or singers, or storytellers, and so on. When, for example, the writer David Sedaris reads one of his stories on stage, or when Leonard Cohen performs one of his lyric poems, they are both engaged in the art of oral interpretation. But Sedaris is no actor, and even Cohen himself would say that \"he\" is no singer.\n\nIn the United States, there is a historic and purely academic argument as to whether oral interpretation and drama/theatre performance are different names for the same thing or whether they are completely different art forms. This argument is almost exclusively found at colleges and universities whose theatre programs evolved in departments historically or currently called \"English and Speech\", \"Speech and Dramatic Arts\" or \"Communication and Theatre Arts\". The argument is rarely heard in theatre programs that did not evolve out of English and/or Speech Communication departments, such as those associated with schools/colleges of music.\n\nIn high schools across the United States, Oral Interpretation is a very highly valued competition event, particularly in the mid-western states, such as Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota. Students select a work of literature, make a cutting of the literature to fit a time limit of 10 minutes, and perform it in several rounds at tournaments across their state. The piece must be from a published, worthwhile piece of literature, with the exception of Readers Theatre. The categories of said event are as follows:\n"}

The program was slated to premiere on Fox on January 13, 2010, at 9:15 PM Eastern following \"American Idol\" with a special 45-minute episode, with further episodes being 60 minutes. However, the show was postponed on request by its creator and eventually canceled before any episodes aired due to two separate issues related to the show's integrity.\n\nAccording to Fox, child prodigies would answer trivia questions to win money for their families; their parents would be able to appeal to experts for help.\n\nThe show's producers were (in alphabetical order): Noah Bonnett, Mark Burnett, Lauren Franson, Ron Muccianti, Dave Schapiro, Tod Schellinger, John Stevens, Jenny Tyson and Chris Wagner. Music was produced by David Vanacore. The film editors were Robert M. Malachowski Jr. and Hudson Smith. The casting department was Jennifer Cron and Joshua Robinson.\n\nOn January 7, 2010, one week before its scheduled premiere, the show's creator, Mark Burnett, announced that he'd asked Fox to postpone it due to concerns about its integrity. Burnett said that issues with how information was relayed to contestants were serious enough that he felt compelled to reshoot the episodes. Fox supported Burnett's decision, and added that all contestants would keep their winnings.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported that some contestants may have known what questions were going to be asked (though not the answers) rather than just the topics to be covered. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that Burnett's main concern was that contestants somehow got more information than they should have prior to taping.\n\nBecause of the abrupt pulling of the series, \"American Idol\" aired for 90 minutes that night, with a repeat showing of the \"Once Upon a Time in Springfield\" episode of \"The Simpsons\" following at 9:30 PM.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported that a member of the production team gave a prospective contestant and his parents specific answers to at least four questions. If the show were found to be deliberately rigged, it would mark the first known instance of such a deception in America since the quiz show scandals of the late 1950s. Rigging a game show is a felony under the Communications Act of 1934 (), which was added to the law in 1960 in the wake of the scandals. The Federal Communications Commission has opened an inquiry.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "149281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=149281", "title": "Performance art", "text": "Performance art\n\nPerformance art is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally interdisciplinary. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated, spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.\n\nPerformance art is an essentially contested concept: any single definition of it implies the recognition of rival uses. As concepts like \"democracy\" or \"art\", it implies productive disagreement with itself.\n\nThe meaning of the term in the narrower sense is related to postmodernist traditions in Western culture. From about the mid-1960s into the 1970s, often derived from concepts of visual art, with respect to Antonin Artaud, Dada, the Situationists, Fluxus, installation art and conceptual art, performance art tended to be defined as an antithesis to theatre, challenging orthodox art forms and cultural norms. The ideal had been an ephemeral and authentic experience for performer and audience in an event that could not be repeated, captured or purchased. The widely discussed difference, how concepts of visual arts and concepts of performing arts are utilized, can determine the meanings of a performance art presentation.\n\nPerformance art is a term usually reserved to refer to a conceptual art which conveys a content-based meaning in a more drama-related sense, rather than being simple performance for its own sake for entertainment purposes. It largely refers to a performance presented to an audience, but which does not seek to present a conventional theatrical play or a formal linear narrative, or which alternately does not seek to depict a set of fictitious characters in formal scripted interactions. It therefore can include action or spoken word as a communication between the artist and audience, or even ignore expectations of an audience, rather than following a script written beforehand.\n\nSome kinds of performance art nevertheless can be close to performing arts. Such performance may utilize a script or create a fictitious dramatic setting, but still constitute performance art in that it does not seek to follow the usual dramatic norm of creating a fictitious setting with a linear script which follows conventional real-world dynamics; rather, it would intentionally seek to satirize or to transcend the usual real-world dynamics which are used in conventional theatrical plays.\n\nPerformance artists often challenge the audience to think in new and unconventional ways, break conventions of traditional arts, and break down conventional ideas about \"what art is\". As long as the performer does not become a player who repeats a role, performance art can include satirical elements; utilize robots and machines as performers, as in pieces of the Survival Research Laboratories; involve ritualised elements (e.g. Shaun Caton); or borrow elements of any performing arts such as dance, music, and circus.\n\nSome artists, e.g. the Viennese Actionists and neo-Dadaists, prefer to use the terms \"live art\", \"action art\", \"actions\", \"intervention\" (see art intervention) or \"manoeuvre\" to describe their performing activities. As genres of performance art appear body art, fluxus-performance, happening, action poetry, and intermedia.\n\nPerformance art activity is not confined to European or American art traditions; notable practitioners can be found in Asia and Latin America. Performance artists and theorists point to different traditions and histories, ranging from tribal to sporting and ritual or religious events. In an episode of \"In Our Time\" broadcast on Thu, 20 Oct 2005, 21:30 on BBC Radio 4, Angie Hobbs, Lecturer in Philosophy, University of Warwick; Miriam Griffin, Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford; and John Moles, Professor of Latin, University of Newcastle discussed with Melvyn Bragg the idea that Antisthenes and Diogenes in ancient Greece practiced a form of performance art and that they acquired the epithet of cynic which means \"dog\" due to Diogenes behaving repeatedly like a dog in his performances.\n\nWestern cultural theorists often trace performance art activity back to the beginning of the 20th century, to the Russian constructivists, Futurists and Dada. Dada provided a significant progenitor with the unconventional performances of poetry, often at the Cabaret Voltaire, by the likes of Richard Huelsenbeck and Tristan Tzara. Russian Futurist artists could be identified as precursors of performance, such as David Burliuk, who painted his face for his actions (1910–20) and Alexander Rodchenko and his wife Varvara Stepanova.\n\nAccording to the art critic Harold Rosenberg in the 1940s and 1950s Action Painting gave artists the freedom to perform—the canvas as \"an arena in which to act\", thereby rendering the paintings as traces of the artist's performance in his/her studio. Abstract expressionism and Action painting preceded the Fluxus movement, Happenings and the emergence of Performance Art.\n\nPerformance art was anticipated, if not explicitly formulated, by Japan's Gutai group of the 1950s, especially in such works as Atsuko Tanaka's \"Electric Dress\" (1956).\n\nYves Klein had been a precursor of performance art with the conceptual pieces of \"Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle\" (\"Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility\") 1959–62, \"Anthropométries\" (1960), and works like the photomontage, Saut dans le vide (Leap into the Void). In the late 1960s Earth artists as diverse as Robert Smithson, Dennis Oppenheim, Michael Heizer and Carl Andre created environmental pieces that predict the performance art of the 1970s. Works of conceptual artists in the early 1980s, like Sol LeWitt, who converted mural-style drawing into an act of performance by others, were influenced by Yves Klein and the Earth artists as well.\n\nIn the 1960s a variety of new works, concepts and the increasing number of artists led to new kinds of performance art. Prototypic for the artform later explicitly labeled \"performance art\", were works of artists like Yoko Ono with her \"Wall piece for orchestra\" (1962), Carolee Schneemann with pieces like \"Meat Joy\" (1964) and \"Interior Scroll\" (1975); Wolf Vostell with his Happening \"YOU\" (1964 in New York); Joseph Beuys with \"How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare\" (1965); Yayoi Kusama, with actions such as a naked flag-burning on the Brooklyn Bridge (1968) and Allan Kaprow in his many \"Happenings\".\n\nKaprow had coined the term Happening describing a new artform, at the beginning of the 1960s. A \"Happening\" allows the artist to experiment with body motion, recorded sounds, written and spoken texts, and even smells. One of Kaprow's earliest was \"Happenings in the New York Scene,\" written in 1961 as the form was developing. Notably in the Happenings of Allan Kaprow, the audience members become performers. While the audiences in Happenings had been welcomed as the performers, it is only sometimes and often unwittingly that they become an active part in a Performance. Other artists who created Happenings besides Kaprow include Jim Dine, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Whitman, and Wolf Vostell: \"Theater is in the Street\" (Paris in 1958).\n\nHermann Nitsch in 1962 presented his \"Theatre of Orgies and Mysteries\" (Orgien- und Mysterien Theater), a precursor to performance art, close to the performing arts.\n\nAndy Warhol during the early 1960s beginning to create films and video, in the mid-60s sponsored the Velvet Underground and staged events and performances in New York, like the Exploding Plastic Inevitable (1966) that featured live Rock music, exploding lights, and film.\n\nIndirectly influential for art-world performance, particularly in the United States, were new forms of theatre, embodied by the San Francisco Mime Troupe and the Living Theatre and showcased in Off-Off Broadway theaters in SoHO and at La MaMa in New York City. The Living Theatre chiefly toured in Europe between 1963 and 1968, and in the U.S. in 1968. A work of this period, \"Paradise Now\" was notorious for its audience participation and a scene in which actors recited a list of social taboos that included nudity, while disrobing.\n\nThe work of performance artists after 1968 often showed influences of the cultural and political events of that year. Barbara T. Smith with \"Ritual Meal\" (1969) was at the forefront of the feminist body-, and performance art of the 1970s; among others including: Carolee Schneemann, and Joan Jonas. Schneemann and Jonas along with Yoko Ono, Joseph Beuys, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, Allan Kaprow, Vito Acconci, Chris Burden and Dennis Oppenheim pioneered the relationship between \"Body art\" and performance art.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, artists whose work already before tended to be a performance art, as well as new artists, began to present performance art in a stricter form.\n\nNew artists with radical performances were Chris Burden, with the 1971 performance piece \"Shoot\", in which he was shot in his left arm by an assistant from a distance of about five meters, and Vito Acconci in the same year with \"Seedbed\".\n\nThe book \"Expanded Cinema\", by Gene Youngblood, marked a shift in the use of media by performance artists. The first book considering video art as an art form, mentions Jud Yalkut as a pioneering video artist. Since 1965 he had collaborated in dozens of intermedia performances throughout the United States, also with Nam June Paik, who beginning of the 1960s already had been a fluxus performer on the way to become a media artist. As to the art of Paik, Youngblood refers to works of Carolee Schneemann and Robert Whitman from the 1960s, which had been pioneering for performance art, becoming an independent artform at the beginning of the 1970s.\n\nThe British-based pair Gilbert and George, already in 1970, had documented actions of themselves on video, and created their \"living sculpture\" performance, being painted in gold and singing \"Underneath The Arches\" for extended periods. Joan Jonas began to include video in her experimental performances in 1972.\n\nIn 1973, Laurie Anderson performed \"Duets on Ice\", on the streets of New York City. Marina Abramović, in the performance \"Rhythm 10\", conceptually included the violation of her body. Thirty years later, the theme of violation, shame, and sexual exploitation would be re-imagined in the contemporary performance works of artists such as Clifford Owens, Gillian Walsh, Pat Oleszko and Rebecca Patek, among others.\n\nSince 1973, the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman's Building in Los Angeles had a formative impact on the wave of performances with feminist background.\n\nCarolee Schneemann work in 1963, \"Eye Body\", already had been a prototype of performance art. Schneemann in 1975 drew on with innovative solo performances, like \"Interior Scroll\", showing the female body as an artistic medium.\n\nIn the mid seventies, behind the iron curtain, in the Eastern European capitals: Budapest, Kraków, Belgrade, Zagreb, Novi Sad and other cities, the performing art was flourishing. Against the political and social control, emerged Orshi Drozdik performance series, titled \"Individual Mythology\" 1975/77 and the \"NudeModel\" 1976/77. Critical of the patriarchal discourse of art and the equally patriarchal state forced \"emancipation program\", pioneering feminist point of view on both, made her forerunner in the 70s political and artistic environment.\n\nIn 1976, HA Schult filled St. Mark's Square in Venice with old newspapers in an overnight action he called \"Venezia vive.\" In his 1977 performance, \"Crash\", the same artist let a Cessna crash into the garbage dump on Staten Island, New York.\n\nPerformance art, because of its relative transience, by the 1970s, had a fairly robust presence in the avant-garde of Eastern Bloc countries, especially Poland and Yugoslavia.\n\nUntil the 1980s, performance art had been demystifying virtuosity. Now it began to embrace technical brilliance. In reference to \"Presence and Resistance\" by Philip Auslander, dance critic Sally Banes writes \"... by the end of the 1980s, performance art had become so widely known that it no longer needed to be defined; mass culture, especially television, had come to supply both structure and subject matter for much performance art; and several performance artists, including Laurie Anderson, Spalding Gray, Eric Bogosian, Willem Dafoe, and Ann Magnuson, had indeed become crossover artists in mainstream entertainment.\"\n\nDespite the fact that many performances are held within the circle of a small art-world group, RoseLee Goldberg notes in \"Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present\" that \"performance has been a way of appealing directly to a large public, as well as shocking audiences into reassessing their own notions of art and its relation to culture. Conversely, public interest in the medium, especially in the 1980s, stems from an apparent desire of that public to gain access to the art world, to be a spectator of its ritual and its distinct community, and to be surprised by the unexpected, always unorthodox presentations that the artists devise.\"\n\nAmong the performance art most discussed in the art-world of this decade were a performance by Linda Montano and Tehching Hsieh between July 1983 and July 1984, \"Art/Life: One Year Performance\" (Rope Piece), and Karen Finley's \"I'm an Ass Man\" 1987.\n\nUntil the decline of the European eastern block during the late 1980s, performance art had actively been rejected by most communist governments. With the exception of Poland and Yugoslavia, performance art was more or less banned in countries where any independent public event was feared. In the GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Latvia it happened in apartments, at seemingly spontaneous gatherings in artist studios, in church-controlled settings, or covered as another activity, like a photo-shooting. Isolated of the western conceptual context, in different settings it could be like a playful protest or like a bitter comment, using subversive metaphors to express dissent with the political situation.\n\nPrior to 1982, Hedwig Gorski designated the term performance poetry, to distinguish her text-based vocal performances from performance art, especially the work of performance artists, such as Laurie Anderson, who worked with music at that time. Performance poets relied more on the rhetorical and philosophical expression in their poetics than performance artists, who arose from the visual art genres of painting and sculpture.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1994, the Dutch visual artist PINK de Thierry created what she came to call meta-performances: a conceptual mix of intervention art in public space, performance art—interacting with an audience, installation art—utilizing large structures to perform in or with, and media art—photography and film to register and exhibit.\n\nWhile the Soviet bloc disintegrated, formerly repressed activities of performance artists like György Galántai in Hungary, or the Collective Action Group in Russia, became better known. Young artists from all over the former Eastern bloc, including Russia, turned to performance. Performance art at about the same time appeared in Cuba, the Caribbean and China. Chinese performance artists like Zhang Huan had been performing underground since the late 1980s. In the early 1990s Chinese performance art already was acclaimed in the international art scene.\n\n\"In these contexts performance art became a critical new voice with a social force similar to that found in Western Europe, the United States and South America in the 1960s and early 1970s. It should be emphasized that the eruption of performance art in the 1990s in Eastern Europe, China, South Africa, Cuba, and elsewhere should never be considered either secondary to or imitative of the West.\"\n\nSince 1996, HA Schult has installed one thousand life sized \"Trash People\" made from garbage as \"silent witnesses to a consumer age that has created an ecological imbalance worldwide\". They travelled to Moscow's Red Square (1999), the Pyramids of Giza (2002) and the Great Wall of China (2001).\n\nIn the western world in the 1990s, even sophisticated performance art became part of the cultural mainstream: performance art as a complete artform gained admittance into art museums and became a museal topic.\n\nIn the second half of the decade, computer-aided forms of performance art began to take place.\n\nSince January 2003, Tate Modern in London has had a curated programme of live art and performance and in 2012 The Tanks at Tate Modern were opened: the first dedicated spaces for performance, film, and installation in a major modern and contemporary art museum.\n\nFrom March 14 to May 31, 2010, the Museum of Modern Art held a major retrospective and performance recreation of Marina Abramović's work, the biggest exhibition of performance art in MoMA's history. During the run of the exhibition, Abramović performed \"The Artist is Present\", a 736-hour and 30-minute static, silent piece, in which she sat immobile in the museum's atrium, while spectators were invited to take turns sitting opposite her. A support group for the \"sitters\", \"Sitting with Marina\", was established on Facebook. The performance attracted celebrities such as Björk and James Franco and received coverage on the internet. During Marina's performance, other artists performed for her.\n\n\n"}

A person who performs a practical joke is called a \"practical joker\". Other terms for practical jokes include gag, jape, or shenanigan.\n\nPractical jokes differ from confidence tricks or hoaxes in that the victim finds out, or is let in on the joke, rather than being talked into handing over money or other valuables. Practical jokes are generally lighthearted and without lasting impact; they aim to make the victim feel humbled or foolish, but not victimized or humiliated. Thus most practical jokes are affectionate gestures of humour and designed to encourage laughter. However, practical jokes performed with cruelty can constitute bullying, whose intent is to harass or exclude rather than reinforce social bonds through ritual humbling.\n\nSome countries in Western culture traditionally emphasize the carrying out of practical jokes on April Fools' Day.\n\nA practical joke is \"practical\" because it consists of someone doing something physical, in contrast to a verbal or written joke. For example, the joker who is setting up and conducting the practical joke might hang a bucket of water above a doorway and rig the bucket using pulleys so when the door opens the bucket dumps the water. The joker would then wait for the victim to walk through the doorway and be drenched by the bucket of water. Objects can also be used in practical jokes, like fake vomit, chewing gum bugs, exploding cigars, stink bombs, costumes and whoopee cushions.\n\nPractical jokes often occur inside offices, usually to surprise co-workers. Covering the computer accessories with Jell-O, wrapping the desk with Christmas paper or aluminium foil or filling it with balloons are just some examples of office pranks. Practical jokes are also common occurrences during sleepovers, whereby teens will play pranks on their friends as they come into the home, enter a room or even as they sleep.\n\nAmerican humorist H. Allen Smith wrote a 320-page book in 1953 called \"The Compleat Practical Joker\" () that contains numerous examples of practical jokes. The book became a best seller not only in the United States but also in Japan. Moira Marsh has written an entire volume about practical jokes. One of her findings is that in the USA they are more often done by males than females.\n\nA practical joke recalled as his favorite by the playwright Charles MacArthur, concerns the American painter and bohemian character Waldo Peirce. While living in Paris in the 1920s, Peirce \"made a gift of a very big turtle to the woman who was the concierge of his building\". The woman doted on the turtle and lavished care on it. A few days later Peirce substituted a somewhat larger turtle for the original one. This continued for some time, with larger and larger turtles being surreptitiously introduced into the woman's apartment. The concierge was beside herself with happiness and displayed her miraculous turtle to the entire neighborhood. Peirce then began to sneak in and replace the turtle with smaller and smaller ones, to her bewildered distress. This was the storyline behind \"Esio Trot\", by Roald Dahl.\n\nModern and successful pranks often take advantage of the modernization of tools and techniques. In Canada, engineering students have a reputation for annual pranks; at the University of British Columbia these usually involve leaving a Volkswagen Beetle in an unexpected location (such as suspended from the Golden Gate Bridge and the Lions Gate Bridge). A similar prank was undertaken by engineering students at Cambridge University, England, where an Austin 7 car was put on top of the Senate House building. Pranks can also adapt to the political context of the era. Students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are particularly known for their \"hacks\".\n\nNot unlike the Stone Louse of Germany, in the American West the jackalope has become an institutionalized practical joke perennially perpetrated by ruralites (as a class) on tourists, most of whom have never heard of the decades-old myth.\n\nThe 2003 TV movie \"Windy City Heat\", consists of an elaborate practical joke on the film's star, Perry Caravallo, who is led to believe that he is starring in a faux action film, \"Windy City Heat\", where the filming which is ostensibly for the film's DVD extras actually documents the long chain of pranks and jokes performed at Caravallo's expense.\n"}

In the 1930s, such studios might release one prestige picture per year. The films' screenwriters drew material from historical events, well-known literary classics, or popular novels or plays.\n\nIn many cases, Hollywood film studios have enlisted British actors and directors for the production of prestige films. One producer of prestige pictures within the United Kingdom's own film industry was Alexander Korda (1893–1956).\n\n"}
{"id": "4644634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4644634", "title": "Rhetorical modes", "text": "Rhetorical modes\n\nRhetorical modes (also known as modes of discourse) describe the variety, conventions, and purposes of the major kinds of language-based communication, particularly writing and speaking. Four of the most common rhetorical modes and their purpose are narration, description, exposition, and argumentation. The first codification of these rhetorical modes was by Samuel P. Newman in \"A Practical System of Rhetoric\" in 1827. \n\nThe purpose of narration is to tell a story or narrate an event or series of events. This writing mode frequently uses the tools of descriptive writing. Narration is an especially useful tool for sequencing or putting details and information into some kind of logical order, usually chronological. Working with narration helps us see clear sequences separate from all other mental functions. Examples include:\n\nThe purpose of description is to re-create, invent, or visually present a person, place, event, or action so that the reader can picture that which is being described. Descriptive writing can be found in the other rhetorical modes. Examples include:\n\nExpository writing is a type of writing where the purpose is to explain, inform, or even describe. It is considered to be one of the four most common rhetorical modes.\n\nThe purpose of expository writing is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. In narrative contexts (such as history and fiction), exposition provides background information to teach or entertain. In other nonfiction contexts (such as technical communication), the purpose is to teach and inform. Examples include:\n\nThe purpose of argumentation (also called \"persuasive writing\") is to prove the validity of an idea, or point of view, by presenting sound reasoning, discussion, and argument to thoroughly convince the reader. Persuasive writing/Persuasion is a type of argumentation with the additional aim to urge the reader to take some form of action. Examples include:\n\nAnother form of persuasive rhetoric is satirical rhetoric, or using humor in order to make a point about some aspect of life or society. Perhaps the most famous example is Jonathan Swift's \"A Modest Proposal\".\n\nEach fiction-writing mode has its own purposes and conventions. Agent and author Evan Marshall identifies five fiction-writing modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background. Author and writing-instructor Jessica Page Morrell lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition. Author Peter Selgin refers to \"methods\", including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description.\n\n\n\n"}

It is widely used on diverse occasions. \n\nSeating plans have a wide range of purposes. At formal dinners, they are usually used to avoid chaos and confusion upon entrance and to follow the etiquette. In this case, it is customary to arrange the host and hostess at the opposite sides of the table, and alternate male and female guests throughout. Place cards can be used to direct guests. State dinners have their own protocol and arrangements are made so that the most distinguished guests can have the possibility to engage in conversation. Plans are also made for airplanes, where the objective is to differentiate passengers between the various travel classes and ensure everybody has a place. Similarly, theatres or cinemas may allow spectators to choose their seats beforehand. A seating plan is of crucial importance for musical ensembles or orchestras, where every type of instrument is allocated a specific section.\n\n"}
{"id": "2370017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2370017", "title": "Self-working magic", "text": "Self-working magic\n\nSelf-working magic is magic that works simply from following a procedure that is known to the audience. It requires no secret set-up, trickery, sleight-of-hand, or other hidden objects or moves. Some self-working magic allows the audience to have a secret that they do not reveal to the magician until the end. The audience can be told every step, and can even repeat the trick. It can be done alone, since the \"magician\" may be just as surprised as anybody. All the magician has to do is follow a certain procedure, and everything will be good. Optical illusions and some other science demonstrations could fall into this category. The wonder comes from unexpectedness of a natural phenomenon. Basically, self-working magic relies on some expectation or lack of knowledge in the audience about what produces the outcome. Usually, self-working card tricks revolve around some mathematical principle, such as in the trick \"Magical 13\", where the spectator is asked to cut the deck 13 times, then split the deck into 13 piles. Upon revealing each pile, it is found that each pile contains only cards of the same value (i.e., one pile has all four fours, the other pile has all four twos, etc.). This is based on the principle that beforehand, the deck is set up with all the suits in order. No matter how many times you cut the deck, the same cards will always be 13 cards away from each other.\n\nSelf-working magic tricks can be baffling in a special way. The patter can take different forms that make them more entertaining. One variation of patter is to say that you are hiding nothing, and explaining every step of the trick. Some audience members may still think it is a trick. Another variation, possibly with some tricks, is to say, \"I will not be doing the magic, here: you will\". Another way of doing it is to make a story that explains—gives a reason to—each step, so that no step is hidden, and the audience can even DO the steps, but the audience members are baffled, anyway.\n\nStory: Make a story of cutting the deck 7 times. 7 drunken sailors decide to play a high-stakes poker game with a new deck of cards. (Use a new deck that is ordered correctly for this game, all cards in order in every suit, not backwards order as some decks have, or have the audience put the cards in order to simulate a new deck). Then say, none of them are in a state of mind to shuffle, so they decide to cut the deck 7 times, one time each. The dealer deals but forgets his own 2nd and 4th cards, so he ends up with 3 cards. He asks for 2 more, but the other sailors refuse, arguing, but none of them want to start the round over. They finally agree to let him get 5 new cards. They make their bets, and each sailor bets high, giving up everything he owns. The dealer bets last, and accepts all the bets. Everybody is all in. Finally, they reveal their cards, the dealer revealing last. Every drunken sailor has a full house. But the dealer rarely loses the hand, having usually a straight flush, and sometimes a royal straight flush. Every step of the trick has been told directly to the audience, but they are still amazed.\n\nNo magic, here. Say, \"No magic, here. You will tell me which cards you picked.\" Ask the audience to pick 3 cards, not show them to you, and write them down. Make a pile of 10 cards, a pile of 15, another pile of 15, and a pile of 9, in order (no Jokers in the deck). Ask the audience to place the first card face down on the first deck. Then, take any number of cards from the 2nd deck and place them on the 1st. Put the 2nd card on top of the 2nd deck, and put any number of cards from the 3rd deck onto the 2nd deck. Put the 3rd card on top of the 3rd deck. Now, you put the 4th pile on the 3rd, both on the 2nd, and all 3 on the 1st. You have one deck. Take 4 cards from the top and put them on the bottom. You can tell the audience every step you are doing. Now, you can get 0 points to 3 points. I will go thru the deck, and you grab your cards if you see them. If you grab all 3 by the end, you get 3 points, if you grab 1, you get one point, and so on.\n\nNow, put the 1st card face up, the 2nd face down. They will find no cards. Say that is OK, we will keep going. Pick up the face-down deck and keep going. Do it again, and again. They will never see their card. Stop when only 3 cards are left. And say, gee—only 3 cards left. Turn them over, and there are their 3 cards. It works every single time. Sometimes, you can arrange it so that they do not know that they had to memorize the cards after writing them down. They may pick the wrong cards. Show them that they picked the wrong cards by looking at their paper. They will think the trick is over. Then, reveal the correct 3 cards.\n\n1. Steps of math operations that use some secret knowledge of the audience like their birthday, and then reveal that secret knowledge in an unexpected way at the end. For example, think of any secret 3-digit number, multiply it by one specific number, and then another, and it always comes out a 6-digit number with the original 3\n-digit number repeated twice.\n\n2. Another one asks the audience to think of words that start with certain letters, and then words linked to the last letters of those words, asking the audience to reveal only their last choices, but somehow almost always ends with the words \"Grey elephant in Denmark\" even though the audience thought up their own words throughout the steps.\n\n3. Another one ends up with the audience getting all the same number, but it is the WRONG number! Like an optical illusion, people are susceptible to adding up this particular sequence the wrong way almost every time.\n"}

With the NerveGear, a helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds. Both the game and the NerveGear were created by Akihiko Kayaba.\n\nOn November 6, 10,000 players log into the \"SAO\"s mainframe cyberspace for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out. Kayaba appears and tells the players that they must beat all 100 floors of Aincrad, a steel castle which is the setting of \"SAO\", if they wish to be free. Those who suffer in-game deaths or forcibly remove the NerveGear out-of-game will suffer real-life deaths.\n\nOne of the players, named Kazuto \"Kirito\" Kirigaya, is one of 1,000 testers in the game's previous closed beta. With the advantage of previous VR gaming experience and a drive to protect other beta testers from discrimination, he isolates himself from the greater groups and plays the game alone, bearing the mantle of \"beater\", a portmanteau of \"beta tester\" and \"cheater\". As the players progress through the game Kirito eventually befriends a young girl named Asuna Yuuki, forming a relationship with and later marrying her in-game. After the duo discover the identity of Kayaba's secret ID, who was playing as the leader of the guild Asuna joined in, they confront and destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game.\n\nIn the real world, Kazuto discovers that 300 \"SAO\" players, including Asuna, remain trapped in their NerveGear. As he goes to the hospital to see Asuna, he meets Shouzou Yuuki, Asuna's father, who is asked by an associate of his, Nobuyuki Sugou, to make a decision, which Sugou later reveals to be his marriage with Asuna, angering Kazuto. Several months later, he is informed by Agil, another \"SAO\" survivor, that a figure similar to Asuna was spotted on \"The World Tree\" in another VRMMORPG cyberspace called \"Alfheim Online\" (\"ALO\"). Assisted in-game by his cousin Suguha \"Leafa\" Kirigaya and Yui, a navigation pixie (originally an AI from \"SAO\"), he quickly learns that the trapped players in \"ALO\" are part of a plan conceived by Sugou to perform illegal experiments on their minds. The goal is to create the perfect mind-control for financial gain and to subjugate Asuna, whom he intends to marry in the real world, to assume control of her family's corporation. Kirito eventually stops the experiment and rescues the remaining 300 \"SAO\" players, foiling Sugou's plans. Before leaving \"ALO\" to see Asuna, Kayaba, who has uploaded his mind to the Internet using an experimental and destructively high-power version of NerveGear at the cost of his life, entrusts Kirito with The Seed – a package program designed to create virtual worlds. Kazuto eventually reunites with Asuna in the real world and The Seed is released onto the Internet, reviving Aincrad as other VRMMORPGs begin to thrive.\n\nSoon after, at the prompting of a government official investigating strange occurrences in VR, Kazuto takes on a job to investigate a series of murders involving another VRMMORPG called \"Gun Gale Online\" (\"GGO\"), the AmuSphere (the successor of the NerveGear), and a player called Death Gun. Aided by a female player named Shino \"Sinon\" Asada, he participates in a gunfight tournament called the Bullet of Bullets (BoB) and discovers the truth behind the murders, which originated with a player who participated in a player-killing guild in \"SAO\". Through his and Sinon's efforts, two suspects are captured, though the third suspect, Johnny Black, escapes.\n\nKazuto is later recruited to assist in testing an experimental FullDive machine, Soul Translator (STL), which has an interface that is far more realistic and complex than the previous machine he had played to help develop an artificial intelligence for the Ministry of Defense (MOD) named A.L.I.C.E. He tests the STL by entering a virtual reality cyberspace created with The Seed package, named UnderWorld (UW). In the UW, the flow of time proceeds a thousand times faster than in the real world, and Kirito's memories of what happens inside are restricted. However, Black injures Kazuto with suxamethonium chloride. The MOD recovers Kazuto and places him back into the STL to preserve his mind while attempts are made to save him. Meanwhile, it is revealed that UnderWorld was created as part of an experiment to create artificial intelligence that could be used for military purposes.\n\nReki Kawahara wrote the first volume in 2002 as a competition entry for ASCII Media Works' , but refrained from submitting it as he had exceeded the page limit; he instead published it as a web novel under the pseudonym Fumio Kunori. Over time, he added three further episodes and several short stories. In 2008, he participated in the competition again by writing \"Accel World\", this time winning the Grand Prize. Aside from \"Accel World\", he was requested to get his earlier work, \"Sword Art Online\", published by ASCII Media Works. He agreed and withdrew his web novel versions.\n\nFor the character protagonist Kirito, Kawahara was asked if Kirito's personality and character were based on his own; he answered that he usually does not put aspects of himself into his characters, and jokingly remarked: \"but if I had to say there was a point of similarity between Kirito and myself, it is the fact that neither of us are good at forming parties. We [both] tend to play solo in these games a lot.\" He also noted that the female characters in the story were not based on anyone he knew in the real world, stating: \"I don't usually make a character, setting, or anything before I start writing. As I write the story, the girls become what they are now. So, somehow, I don’t know exactly, but somehow, my subliminal idea or some hidden emotion creates the characters to be strong and capable.\" He added that he wrote the series to demonstrate that he views online gaming not as a social ill or escape from real life, but rather decided to show games in a more positive light in his light novels. He noted that \"the character of Asuna I might have created a little too perfectly for \"Sword Art Online\"\".\n\nAfter Kawahara's request for \"Sword Art Online\" to be published was approved, he started working with illustrator abec on the light novel series. The first volume was published in print on April 10, 2009, and 20 volumes have been published as of September 8, 2017.

Kawahara plans on writing \"one more big arc\" called \"Sword Art Online: Unital Ring\" that will go \"back to the real world.\" The Unital Ring story arc will begin in volume 21, which is scheduled to be released in Japan on December 7, 2018.\n\nKawahara also writes the \"Sword Art Online: Progressive\" series, which covers Kirito's adventures on the first few floors of Aincrad.

Eisenbeis particularly noted how the romance between Kirito and Asuna is explored bringing \"definition to exactly what love is like in a virtual world.\" However, at the time of this preliminary review, he had only watched the first 12 episodes of the series. He has since gone on to review the second half of the series, lauding its excellent use of plot twists and praising its well written and believable villain. However, he felt that some of the initial positive aspects of the series were lost in the second half, such as the focus on psychological repercussions and social interactions that could be realistically seen in an online game. Criticism was also levied on the aspect of turning Asuna into a damsel in distress, stating that a female lead as strong as her was \"reduced to nothing but the quest item the male lead is hunting for.\" Eisenbeis closes his review of the series by stating in regards to the two halves, \"Both, however, are enjoyable for what they are.\"\n\nRebecca Silverman of Anime News Network has criticized the series as having pacing problems, logical gaps, and \"sloppy writing\".

{"id": "1032668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1032668", "title": "The California Raisins", "text": "The California Raisins\n\nThe California Raisins were a fictional rhythm and blues animated musical group as well as advertising and merchandising characters composed of anthropomorphized raisins. Lead vocals were sung by musician Buddy Miles. The California Raisins concept experienced high popularity in the mid-to-late 1980s principally through claymation TV commercials and animated specials, winning an Emmy Award and one nomination.\n\nThe concept was originally created for a 1986 Sun-Maid commercial on behalf of the California Raisin Advisory Board when one of the writers, Seth Werner (at the time with the advertising firm Foote, Cone & Belding SF, and now with big) came up with an idea for the new raisin commercial, saying, \"We have tried everything but dancing raisins singing 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine'\" (the 1968 song popularized by Marvin Gaye). To their surprise, the commercial became wildly popular, paving the way for several future commercials and opportunities through other media. The commercials were produced by Vinton Studios using their claymation technique, with character designs by Michael Brunsfeld. The following year, the Raisins appeared in the Emmy Award-winning \"A Claymation Christmas Celebration\", singing the Christmas carol \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\".\n\nThe California Raisins released four studio albums on Priority Records between 1987 and 1988, and their signature song, \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine,\" landed on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. However, the Raisins would continue to make their strongest impression through animated endeavors, and the characters proved popular enough that they were used to endorse Post's Raisin Bran cereal.\n\nOn November 4, 1988, CBS aired a primetime special entitled \"Meet the Raisins!\". The musical mockumentary was again created by Vinton Studios and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. It also provided the band members more personality and individual names: A.C., Beebop (drums), Stretch (bass), and Red (guitar/piano). A Saturday morning cartoon series, \"The California Raisin Show\", debuted the following year but lasted merely 13 episodes. While cel animated by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson, it maintained Will Vinton's creative direction. A sequel to the original CBS special aired in 1990 under the title \"The Raisins: Sold Out!: The California Raisins II\". This special saw the Raisins hiring a new manager with the goal of making a comeback.\n\nMany of the items created for the campaign have become part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution. Merchandise sales included toys and Raisins images on nearly every conceivable medium: lunch boxes, notebooks, clothing, posters, bedsheets, and even a Halloween costume just to name a few. A California Raisins Fan Club began in 1987 which included a Grapevine Gazette Newsletter and various memorabilia. Blackthorne Publishing also released a 6-issue comic book series entitled \"The California Raisins 3-D\" which included 3D glasses; these would later be re-released in the \"Ultimate Collection\" trade paperback.\n\nSeveral California Raisins music albums were also released, featuring classic Motown and rock standards. These albums were included in the Smithsonian collection and were illustrated and art-directed by Helane Freeman, who later became famous for her work on \"Hannah Montana\" and \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\", among other Disney programs.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable piece of California Raisins merchandise, however, came in the form of small, non-poseable California Raisins figures. The Hardee's restaurant chain offered these as part of a promotion for their Cinnamon 'N' Raisin biscuits. Different collections were produced in 1987, 1988, 1991, and finally in 2001 (the latter adding Carls Jr. due to their late '90s acquisition of Hardee's) for their new stylization. This latest incarnation can still be seen on the California Raisin Marketing Board website.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Capcom produced a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System titled \"\", in which the player controlled a California Raisin through five side-scrolling levels battling various evil fruit and vegetable characters that have stolen the Raisins' music. The game was completed and several video game critics reviewed it, but it was never released on the open market.\n\nAlthough popular with the public, the California Raisin campaign eventually failed because its production cost the raisin growers almost twice their earnings. CALRAB, the organization who made the campaign, was also closed on July 31, 1994 due to disagreements with raisin producers over the fairness of required payments to the organization.\n\nOn March 28, 1997 \"Entertainment Weekly\" published \"The 50 Best Commercials of All Time\" as its cover story. The article ranked The California Raisins' premiere advertisement, \"Lunchbox,\" at #15 with comments by ad agency executive Claude Jacques and described the Raisins as \"The coolest wrinkled musicians this side of the Stones.\"\n\nThe vast amount of California Raisins merchandise has made for a substantial collectors' market. It even led to an unauthorized collectibles guide published in 1998, cataloging the many items based on the clay characters.\n\nIn 2002, the Food Network program \"Unwrapped\" featured a segment on The California Raisins featuring interviews with Will Vinton, David Altschul, and Mark Gustafson of Vinton Studios. Concept illustrations of the Raisins were also featured as interviewees discussed the characters' creation.\n\nIn \"The Simpsons\" episode \"'Tis the Fifteenth Season\", The California Raisins were spoofed as \"The California Prunes\", on a special entitled \"Christmas with the California Prunes\". Lisa dismisses it as \"offensive to both Christians \"and\" prunes.\"\n\nAn article published by AnimateClay.com in the late 2000s details the whereabouts of the original claymation sculptures used by Vinton Studios. The figures were kept in a box for several years and headed for the trash before being obtained by Webster Colcord, a former employee of Vinton. Several photos were taken providing a close look at the Raisins' internal armatures and detailing their extremely poor condition, including the absence of the A.C. puppet's head.\n\nAs of the 2010s, packages of Sun-Maid Natural California Raisins still modestly feature an updated California Raisin character. This figure is also included on CalRaisins.org.\n\nIn 2010, claymation versions of the California Raisins were featured in the special Christmas episode of \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\", '\"A Very Sunny Christmas.\"\n\nIn 2014, the California Raisins made a cameo appearance in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial \"The '80s Called\".\n\nIn 2017, an episode of \"The Simpsons\" called \"The Cad and the Hat\" included a couch gag segment featuring the California Raisins being killed by Homer.\n\nIn 2018, an episode of \"The Americans\" called \"Rififi\" feature a cereal box featuring the California Raisins on the back.\n\nIn 2015, it was announced that a live-action/CGI reboot of the California Raisins would be produced, with president of The Actors Hall of Fame Foundation, Rusty Citron, as one of the people behind the project.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33729175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33729175", "title": "The Mercury Wonder Show", "text": "The Mercury Wonder Show\n\nThe Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men was a 1943 magic-and-variety stage show by the Mercury Theatre, produced by Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten as a morale-boosting entertainment for US soldiers in World War II. Directed by Welles, the show starred Welles (\"Orson the Magnificent\"), Cotten (\"Jo-Jo the Great\"), Agnes Moorehead (\"Calliope Aggie\") and Rita Hayworth, whose part was later filled by Marlene Dietrich. Jean Gabin also worked on the show backstage, as a propman. The show ran to 150 minutes.\n\nIn early 1943, the two concurrent radio series (\"Ceiling Unlimited\", \"Hello Americans\") that Orson Welles created for CBS to support the war effort had ended. Filming also had wrapped on \"Jane Eyre\" and that fee, in addition to the income from his regular guest-star roles in radio, made it possible for Welles to fulfill a lifelong dream. He approached the War Assistance League of Southern California and proposed a show that evolved into a big-top spectacle, part circus and part magic show. He offered his services as magician and director, and invested some $40,000 of his own money in an extravaganza he called \"The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men\". Members of the U.S. armed forces were admitted free of charge, while the general public had to pay. The show entertained more than 1,000 service members each night, and proceeds went to the War Assistance League, a charity for military service personnel.\n\n\"It was just like a circus — I would have adored it if I'd been a member of the audience, I know that,\" Welles later told filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich.\n\nThe development of the show coincided with the resolution of Welles's draft status in May 1943, when he was finally declared 4-F — unfit for military service — for a variety of medical reasons. \"I felt guilty about the war,\" Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming. \"I was guilt-ridden about my civilian status.\" He had been publicly hounded about his patriotism since \"Citizen Kane\", when the Hearst press began persistent inquiries about why Welles had not been drafted.\n\nWelles's fascination with illusion dated back to childhood; Harry Houdini gave him his first lessons in magic. His 1941 debut at the California State Fair (assisted by Dolores del Río) was a hit and, as \"The Ace\", he continued practicing his performance skills at vaudeville theaters and army camps. By 1943 Welles had developed a two-hour magic show.\n\nThe show's name was a nod to Howard Thurston's \"The Wonder Show of the Universe\". Welles adapted at least five of Thurston's illusions for his own show, and adopted his use of showgirls as stage extras.\n\nFor \"The Mercury Wonder Show\", Welles selected Rita Hayworth, one of the most popular women in motion pictures, as his chief assistant. In April 1943 he began teaching illusions to Hayworth, who was then living with him. The couple practiced the Houdini Substitution Trunk routine in the 125-seat private theater of Bill Larsen, a successful Los Angeles attorney and magician who operated Thayer's Studio of Magic.\n\nOther cast included co-producer Joseph Cotten and, in his stage debut as comedy assistant, Welles's chauffeur, George (Shorty) Chirello. Welles hired Keye Luke — an accomplished visual artist as well as an actor — to design culturally authentic scenery and graphics, in contrast to the fake-Oriental visuals typically seen in Western magic shows.\n\nThe show was rehearsed for 17 weeks. Welles leased the Playtime Theatre (later the Las Palmas Theatre), a 350-seat house in Hollywood. Welles initially planned a moderate-sized magic show, open only to service members, that would run six weeks at the theatre and then tour army camps. Welles and the cast rehearsed from 7 p.m. until 2 or 3 a.m.; back home, Welles would spend the rest of the night improving the magic act and working out new bits of business. He tested 18 different openings before he was satisfied.\n\nPreviews began in June. As the show came together Welles began calling it \"the biggest magic show on earth\", and the cast and crew grew to 31 people. Welles bought or commissioned $26,000 worth of props and put $14,000 into the tent, scenery, costumes and rental of circus equipment. He also rented an entire menagerie, from a canary to a lion. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer donated the venue, a lot near the Hollywood Canteen on Cahuenga Boulevard.\n\n\"The Mercury Wonder Show\" ran August 3–September 9, 1943, in an 80-by-120-foot tent located at 9000 Cahuenga Boulevard, in the heart of Hollywood. The brand-new, two-pole Big Top offered 1,100 bleacher seats — all of them free — to service members. In the center were 400 folding chairs for the public, with tickets priced at $1.65 to $5.50 for adults and 55 cents for children. For opening night only, the public seats were $5.50 and $11. Charity-minded Hollywood celebrities could pay $30 (the equivalent of $ today) for one of the 25 to 30 seats in the sucker section; it cost $50 or $100 for one of the two super-sucker seats nailed down directly behind the massive tent poles. Welles recalled subjecting this highest-paying public — \"usually Sam Goldwyn or Jack Warner or somebody like that\" — to humiliations that included having eggs broken over their heads. \"And they had to pretend it was all good fun, because our boys in khaki were there, you know. We really gave it to them.\"\n\nAfter performing in the official premiere August 3, Rita Hayworth was thereafter forbidden to appear in \"The Mercury Wonder Show\" by Columbia boss Harry Cohn. When her lawyer confirmed that Hayworth could indeed be sued for breach of contract — filming was then under way for \"Cover Girl\" — Welles persuaded her not to jeopardize her entire career by going on anyway, as she vowed to do. He phoned his friend Marlene Dietrich and asked her to fill in. \"Come teach me the tricks and I do it,\" Dietrich replied. \"She was the good soldier of all time,\" Welles said.\n\nAt intermission September 7, 1943, KMPC radio interviewed audience and cast members of \"The Mercury Wonder Show\" — including Welles and Hayworth, who were married earlier that day. Welles remarked that \"The Mercury Wonder Show\" had been performed for approximately 48,000 members of the U.S. armed forces.\n\nLooking back on the experience 30 years later, Welles said the show was primarily made \"for fun\", but that \"it's one of our great works\" and that the Mercury Theatre were \"as proud of that as anything we ever did.\"\n\nA reduced version toured army bases around the U.S. Several episodes of the 1944 CBS Radio show \"The Orson Welles Almanac\" that were performed live before audiences of servicemen were also called the Mercury Wonder Show.\n\nWelles wrote, directed and performed in a plug for \"The Mercury Wonder Show\" that ran in \"Look\" magazine November 16, 1943. In \"The Trunk Murder\", the magician solves the double murder of Joseph Cotten and showgirl assistant Eleanor Counts. George (Shorty) Chirello, Death Valley Mack, Merry Hamilton and Tommy Hanlon Jr. appear in the five-photo crime puzzle. \"Don't be embarrassed if you can't work it,\" readers are advised, \"since [Welles] admits he has never yet solved a LOOK \"Photocrime\".\"\n\nA portion of the stage show was filmed and included in the 1944 variety film, \"Follow the Boys\". The film segment was directed by Welles, uncredited.\n\nWelles and Dietrich agreed to appear in the film while \"The Mercury Wonder Show\" was still running. The seven-minute segment was shot on the Universal lot in late September 1943. Welles traded his robe and fez for white tie and tails, and brought along a crew from the show — Shorty Chirello, Tommy Hanlon, Professor Bill and his Circus Symphony, Death Valley Mack, two female assistants and eight chorus girls. Welles performed a few illusions; his own appearance on stage and the comic version of the sawing-a-woman-in-half illusion featuring Dietrich were achieved with trick photography. Welles received $30,000 for his part in the film. The segment was to be shot in four or five days, but Welles stretched filming to 16 days to give additional pay to his crew.\n\nA framed copy of the playbill for \"The Mercury Wonder Show\" was sold at auction October 31, 2002, for $1,610. In an auction April 26, 2014, the advertising herald was sold for $1,062.50; the item was among those found in boxes and trunks of Welles's personal possessions by his daughter Beatrice Welles.\n\nA scrapbook kept by George (Shorty) Chirello was offered as part of the \"TCM Presents … There's No Place Like Hollywood\" auction November 24, 2014, at Bonhams in New York. Chirello worked for Welles from about 1942 to 1952; his scrapbook begins in August 1943 with clippings about \"The Mercury Wonder Show\", and includes a copy of the playbill. Chirello managed props for the show, and acted as Welles's comedy assistant on stage and in the film \"Follow the Boys\". The scrapbook and a directors chair inscribed \"Orson Welles\" were sold as a single lot and brought $13,750 at auction.\n\n"}

{"id": "1572108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1572108", "title": "The Red Balloon", "text": "The Red Balloon\n\nThe Red Balloon () is a 1956 French fantasy comedy-drama featurette written, produced, and directed by Albert Lamorisse. The thirty-five-minute short, which follows the adventures of a young boy who one day finds a sentient, mute, red balloon, was filmed in the Ménilmontant neighbourhood of Paris.\n\nLamorisse used his children as actors in the film. His son, Pascal, plays himself in the main role, and his daughter, Sabine, portrays a little girl.\n\nThe film won numerous awards, including an Oscar for Lamorisse for writing the Best Original Screenplay in 1956 and the Palme d'Or for short films at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. It also became popular with children and educators. It is the only short film to win the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and to receive a nomination for anything besides Best Live Action Short Film.\n\nThe film follows Pascal (Pascal Lamorisse), a young boy who, on his way to school one morning, discovers a large helium-filled red balloon. As he plays with it, he realizes it has a mind and will of its own. It begins to follow him wherever he goes, never straying far from him, and at times floating outside his bedroom window, as his mother will not allow it in their apartment.\n\nThe balloon follows Pascal through the streets of Paris, and they draw a lot of attention and envy from other children as they wander the streets. At one point the balloon enters his classroom, causing an uproar from his classmates. The noise alerts the principal, who locks Pascal up in his office. Later, after being set free, Pascal and the balloon encounter a little girl (Sabine Lamorisse) with a blue balloon that also seems to have a mind of its own, just like the red one.\nOne Sunday, the balloon is told to stay home while Pascal and his mother go to church. However, it follows them through the open window and into the church, and they are led out by a scolding beadle.\n\nIn their wanderings around the neighborhood, Pascal and the balloon encounter a gang of older boys, who are envious of the balloon and attempt to steal it while Pascal is inside a bakery; however, he manages to retrieve it. Following a chase through narrow alleyways, the boys finally catch the balloon, throw stones at it, and bring it down with sling shots before one of the boys finish it off by stomping on it.\n\nThe film ends as all the other balloons in Paris come to Pascal's aid and take him on a cluster balloon ride over the city.\n\nAs the film was filmed in Paris after World War II, its mise-en-scene is quite dark and grey and therefore gives a depressing quality to the setting and mood. In contrast, the balloon's bright colour acts as a symbol of hope and light within the film. The cluster balloon ride in the closing scene could also be said to represent a religious or spiritual analogy. For example, when the balloon is destroyed, its \"spirit\" lives on as it is transferred to all the other balloons in the city, which is said to be a metaphor for Christ. Themes of self-realisation and loneliness are also present in the film.\nThe theme of innocence is persistent and is one of the main focuses of the film. Through a child’s gaze, a cynical world is transformed into an almost magical one, highlighting the power of the innocence and imagination of children.\n\nIn addition, authors such as Myles P. Breen have identified the film as having thematic/stylistic qualities that are reflective of the poetic medium. This perspective is rationalised by Breen through quoting film theorist Christian Metz, who states, “in a poem there is no story line, and nothing intrudes between the author and the reader”. The film, therefore, is categorised by Breen as being a filmic poem, partially due to its loose, non-narrative structure.\n\nThe film serves as a color record of the Belleville area of Paris, which had fallen into decay by the 1960s, prompting the Parisian government to demolish it as a slum-clearance effort. Part of the site was built up with housing projects; the remainder was left as wasteland for 20 years. Some of what is seen in the film no longer exists: one of the bakeries, the famous shaped staircase situated just beyond the equally famous café \"Au Repos de la Montagne\", the steep steps of the passage Julien Lacroix where Pascal finds the balloon, and the empty lot where all the battles take place. Instead stands the Parc de Belleville. Only the church still stands.\n\nAlbert Lamorrise was a former auditor at the Institut des hautes études cinématographiques (IDHEC), and the crew that he used for the making of the film was entirely composed of IDHEC graduates.\n\nThe film premiered and opened nationwide in France on 19 October 1956; it was released in the United Kingdom on 23 December 1956 (as the supporting film to the 1956 Royal Performance Film \"The Battle of the River Plate\", which ensured it a wide distribution) and in the United States on 11 March 1957.\n\nIt has been featured in many festivals over the years, including the Wisconsin International Children's Film Festival; the Los Angeles Outfest Gay and Lesbian Film Festival; the Wisconsin Film Festival; and others.\n\nThe film, in its American television premiere, was introduced by then-actor Ronald Reagan as an episode of the CBS anthology series \"General Electric Theater\" on 2 April 1961.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, the film was popular in elementary classrooms throughout the United States and Canada. A four-minute clip is on the rotating list of programming on Classic Arts Showcase.\n\nSince its first release in 1956, the film has generally received overwhelmingly favorable reviews from critics. The film critic for \"the New York Times\", Bosley Crowther, hailed the simple tale and praised director Lamorisse, writing that \"Yet with the sensitive cooperation of his own beguiling son and with the gray-blue atmosphere of an old Paris quarter as the background for the shiny balloon, he has got here a tender, humorous drama of the ingenuousness of a child and, indeed, a poignant symbolization of dreams and the cruelty of those who puncture them.\"\n\nWhen the film was re-released in the United States in late 2006 by Janus Films, \"Entertainment Weekly\" magazine film critic Owen Gleiberman praised its direction and simple story line that reminded him of his youth, and wrote, \"More than any other children's film, \"The Red Balloon\" turns me into a kid again whenever I see it...[to] see \"The Red Balloon\" is to laugh, and cry, at the impossible joy of being a child again.\"\n\nFilm critic Brian Gibson wrote, \"So far, this seems a post-Occupation France happy to forget the blood and death of Hitler's war a decade earlier. But soon people’s occasional, playful efforts to grab the floating, carefree balloon become grasping and destructive. In a gorgeous sequence, light streaming down alleys as children's shoes clack and clatter on the cobblestones, the balloon bouncing between the walls, Pascal is hunted down for his floating pet. Its ballooning sense of hope and freedom is deflated by a fierce, squabbling mass. Then, fortunately, it floats off, with the breeze of magic-realism, into a feeling of escape and peace, \"The Red Balloon\" taking hold of Pascal, lifting him out of this rigid, petty, earthbound life.\"\n\nIn a review in \"The Washington Post,\" critic Philip Kennicott had a cynical view: \"[The film takes] place in a world of lies. Innocent lies? Not necessarily. \"The Red Balloon\" may be the most seamless fusion of capitalism and Christianity ever put on film. A young boy invests in a red balloon the love of which places him on the outside of society. The balloon is hunted down and killed on a barren hilltop–-think Calvary–-by a mob of cruel boys. The ending, a bizarre emotional sucker punch, is straight out of the New Testament. Thus is investment rewarded-–with Christian transcendence or, at least, an old-fashioned Assumption. This might be sweet. Or it might be a very cynical reduction of the primary impulse to religious faith.\"\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 95% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on twenty reviews.\n\n\nIn 1960, Lamorisse released a second film, \"Stowaway in the Sky\", which also starred Pascal and was a spiritual successor to \"The Red Balloon\".\n\nA stage adaptation by Anthony Clark was performed at the Royal National Theatre in 1996.\n\nDon Hertzfeld's 1997 short film \"Billy's Balloon\", which also showed at Cannes, is a parody of \"The Red Balloon\".\n\nThe music video for \"Son of Sam\" by Elliott Smith, from his 2000 album Figure 8, is a direct homage to \"The Red Balloon\".\n\nHou Hsiao-hsien's 2007 film \"Flight of the Red Balloon\" is a direct homage to the film.\n\nA boy with a bright red balloon is featured in the epilogue of Damien Chazelle's 2016 musical film \"La La Land\".\n\nThe film was first released on VHS by Embassy Home Entertainment in 1984. A laserdisc of it was later released by The Criterion Collection in 1986, and was produced by Criterion, Janus Films, and Voyager Press. Included in it was Lamorisse's award-winning short \"White Mane\" (1953). A DVD version became available in 2008, and a Blu-Ray version was released in the United Kingdom on January 18, 2010; it has now been confirmed as region-free.\n\nA tie-in book was first published by Doubleday Books, (now Penguin Random House), in 1957, using black and white and color stills from the film, with added prose. The book was highly acclaimed and went on to win 'A New York Times Best Illustrated Children’s Book of the Year.' Albert Lamorisse was credited as the book's sole author. \n\nA soundtrack, featuring music adapted from the film by Lamorisse, was released on the Nonesuch Records label.\n\n"}
{"id": "57993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57993", "title": "Tragedy", "text": "Tragedy\n\nTragedy (from the , \"tragōidia\") is a form of drama based on human suffering that invokes an accompanying catharsis or pleasure in audiences. While many cultures have developed forms that provoke this paradoxical response, the term \"tragedy\" often refers to a specific tradition of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of Western civilisation. That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of cultural identity and historical continuity—\"the Greeks and the Elizabethans, in one cultural form; Hellenes and Christians, in a common activity,\" as Raymond Williams puts it.\n\nFrom its origins in the theatre of ancient Greece 2500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, as well as a large number of fragments from other poets; through its singular articulations in the works of Shakespeare, Lope de Vega, Jean Racine, and Friedrich Schiller to the more recent naturalistic tragedy of August Strindberg; Samuel Beckett's modernist meditations on death, loss and suffering; Müller's postmodernist reworkings of the tragic canon; and Joshua Oppenheimer's incorporation of tragic pathos in his nonfiction film, \"The Act of Killing\" (2012), tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change. A long line of philosophers—which includes Plato, Aristotle, Saint Augustine, Voltaire, Hume, Diderot, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Freud, Benjamin, Camus, Lacan, and Deleuze—have analysed, speculated upon, and criticised the genre.\n\nIn the wake of Aristotle's \"Poetics\" (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make genre distinctions, whether at the scale of poetry in general (where the tragic divides against epic and lyric) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to comedy). In the modern era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, melodrama, the tragicomic, and epic theatre. Drama, in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-generic deterritorialisation from the mid-19th century onwards. Both Bertolt Brecht and Augusto Boal define their epic theatre projects (non-Aristotelian drama and Theatre of the Oppressed, respectively) against models of tragedy. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation.\n\nThe word \"tragedy\" appears to have been used to describe different phenomena at different times. It derives from Classical Greek , contracted from \"trag(o)-aoidiā\" = \"goat song\", which comes from \"tragos\" = \"he-goat\" and \"aeidein\" = \"to sing\" (\"cf.\" \"ode\"). Scholars suspect this may be traced to a time when a goat was either the prize in a competition of choral dancing or was that around which a chorus danced prior to the animal's ritual sacrifice. In another view on the etymology, Athenaeus of Naucratis (2nd–3rd century CE) says that the original form of the word was \"trygodia\" from \"trygos\" (grape harvest) and \"ode\" (song), because those events were first introduced during grape harvest.\n\nWriting in 335 BCE (long after the Golden Age of 5th-century Athenian tragedy), Aristotle provides the earliest-surviving explanation for the origin of the dramatic art form in his \"Poetics\", in which he argues that tragedy developed from the improvisations of the leader of choral dithyrambs (hymns sung and danced in praise of Dionysos, the god of wine and fertility):\nIn the same work, Aristotle attempts to provide a scholastic definition of what tragedy is:\nThere is some dissent to the dithyrambic origins of tragedy, mostly based on the differences between the shapes of their choruses and styles of dancing. A common descent from pre-Hellenic fertility and burial rites has been suggested. Friedrich Nietzsche discussed the origins of Greek tragedy in his early book \"The Birth of Tragedy\" (1872). Here, he suggests the name originates in the use of a chorus of goat-like satyrs in the original dithyrambs from which the tragic genre developed.\n\nScott Scullion writes: \n\nAthenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of dance-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state. Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the Hellenistic period. No tragedies from the 6th century and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in the 5th century have survived. We have complete texts extant by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.\n\nAthenian tragedies were performed in late March/early April at an annual state religious festival in honor of Dionysus. The presentations took the form of a contest between three playwrights, who presented their works on three successive days. Each playwright offered a tetralogy consisting of three tragedies and a concluding comic piece called a satyr play. The four plays sometimes featured linked stories. Only one complete trilogy of tragedies has survived, the \"Oresteia\" of Aeschylus. The Greek theatre was in the open air, on the side of a hill, and performances of a trilogy and satyr play probably lasted most of the day. Performances were apparently open to all citizens, including women, but evidence is scant. The theatre of Dionysus at Athens probably held around 12,000 people.\n\nAll of the choral parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an \"aulos\") and some of the actors' answers to the chorus were sung as well. The play as a whole was composed in various verse metres. All actors were male and wore masks. A Greek chorus danced as well as sang, though no one knows exactly what sorts of steps the chorus performed as it sang. Choral songs in tragedy are often divided into three sections: strophe (\"turning, circling\"), antistrophe (\"counter-turning, counter-circling\") and epode (\"after-song\").\n\nMany ancient Greek tragedians employed the \"ekkyklêma\" as a theatrical device, which was a platform hidden behind the scene that could be rolled out to display the aftermath of some event which had happened out of sight of the audience. This event was frequently a brutal murder of some sort, an act of violence which could not be effectively portrayed visually, but an action of which the other characters must see the effects in order for it to have meaning and emotional resonance. A prime example of the use of the \"ekkyklêma\" is after the murder of Agamemnon in the first play of Aeschylus' \"Oresteia\", when the king's butchered body is wheeled out in a grand display for all to see. Variations on the \"ekkyklêma\" are used in tragedies and other forms to this day, as writers still find it a useful and often powerful device for showing the consequences of extreme human actions. Another such device was a crane, the mechane, which served to hoist a god or goddess on stage when they were supposed to arrive flying. This device gave origin to the phrase \"deus ex machina\" (\"god out of a machine\"), that is, the surprise intervention of an unforeseen external factor that changes the outcome of an event.\n\nFollowing the expansion of the Roman Republic (509–27 BCE) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BCE, Rome encountered Greek tragedy. From the later years of the republic and by means of the Roman Empire (27 BCE-476 CE), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and even reached England. While Greek tragedy continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BCE marks the beginning of regular Roman drama. Livius Andronicus began to write Roman tragedies, thus creating some of the first important works of Roman literature. Five years later, Gnaeus Naevius also began to write tragedies (though he was more appreciated for his comedies). No complete early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three other early tragic playwrights—Quintus Ennius, Marcus Pacuvius and Lucius Accius.\n\nFrom the time of the empire, the tragedies of two playwrights survive—one is an unknown author, while the other is the Stoic philosopher Seneca. Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are \"fabula crepidata\" (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his \"Phaedra\", for example, was based on Euripides' \"Hippolytus\". Historians do not know who wrote the only extant example of the \"fabula praetexta\" (tragedies based on Roman subjects), \"Octavia\", but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a character in the tragedy.\n\nSeneca's tragedies rework those of all three of the Athenian tragic playwrights whose work has survived. Probably meant to be recited at elite gatherings, they differ from the Greek versions in their long declamatory, narrative accounts of action, their obtrusive moralising, and their bombastic rhetoric. They dwell on detailed accounts of horrible deeds and contain long reflective soliloquies. Though the gods rarely appear in these plays, ghosts and witches abound. Senecan tragedies explore ideas of revenge, the occult, the supernatural, suicide, blood and gore. The Renaissance scholar Julius Caesar Scaliger (1484–1558), who knew both Latin and Greek, preferred Seneca to Euripides.\n\nClassical Greek drama was largely forgotten in Western Europe from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 16th century. Medieval theatre was dominated by mystery plays, morality plays, farces and miracle plays. In Italy, the models for tragedy in the later Middle Ages were Roman, particularly the works of Seneca, interest in which was reawakened by the Paduan Lovato de' Lovati (1241–1309). His pupil Albertino Mussato (1261–1329), also of Padua, in 1315 wrote the Latin verse tragedy \"Eccerinis\", which uses the story of the tyrant Ezzelino III da Romano to highlight the danger to Padua posed by Cangrande della Scala of Verona. It was the first secular tragedy written since Roman times, and may be considered the first Italian tragedy identifiable as a Renaissance work. The earliest tragedies to employ purely classical themes are the \"Achilles\" written before 1390 by Antonio Loschi of Vicenza (c.1365–1441) and the \"Progne\" of the Venetian Gregorio Correr (1409–1464) which dates from 1428–29.\n\nIn 1515 Gian Giorgio Trissino (1478–1550) of Vicenza wrote his tragedy \"Sophonisba\" in the vernacular that would later be called Italian. Drawn from Livy's account of Sophonisba, the Carthaginian princess who drank poison to avoid being taken by the Romans, it adheres closely to classical rules. It was soon followed by the \"Oreste\" and \"Rosmunda\" of Trissino's friend, the Florentine Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai (1475–1525). Both were completed by early 1516 and are based on classical Greek models, \"Rosmunda\" on the \"Hecuba\" of Euripides, and \"Oreste\" on the \"Iphigenia in Tauris\" of the same author; like \"Sophonisba\", they are in Italian and in blank (unrhymed) hendecasyllables. Another of the first of all modern tragedies is \"A Castro\", by Portuguese poet and playwright António Ferreira, written around 1550 (but only published in 1587) in polymetric verse (most of it being blank hendecasyllables), dealing with the murder of Inês de Castro, one of the most dramatic episodes in Portuguese history. Although these three Italian plays are often cited, separately or together, as being the first regular tragedies in modern times, as well as the earliest substantial works to be written in blank hendecasyllables, they were apparently preceded by two other works in the vernacular: \"Pamfila\" or \"Filostrato e Panfila\" written in 1498 or 1508 by Antonio Cammelli (Antonio da Pistoia); and a \"Sophonisba\" by Galeotto del Carretto of 1502.\n\nFrom about 1500 printed copies, in the original languages, of the works of Sophocles, Seneca, and Euripides, as well as comedic writers such as Aristophanes, Terence and Plautus, were available in Europe and the next forty years saw humanists and poets translating and adapting their tragedies. In the 1540s, the European university setting (and especially, from 1553 on, the Jesuit colleges) became host to a Neo-Latin theatre (in Latin) written by scholars. The influence of Seneca was particularly strong in its humanist tragedy. His plays, with their ghosts, lyrical passages and rhetorical oratory, brought a concentration on rhetoric and language over dramatic action to many humanist tragedies.\n\nThe most important sources for French tragic theatre in the Renaissance were the example of Seneca and the precepts of Horace and Aristotle (and contemporary commentaries by Julius Caesar Scaliger and Lodovico Castelvetro), although plots were taken from classical authors such as Plutarch, Suetonius, etc., from the Bible, from contemporary events and from short story collections (Italian, French and Spanish). The Greek tragic authors (Sophocles and Euripides) would become increasingly important as models by the middle of the 17th century. Important models were also supplied by the Spanish Golden Age playwrights Pedro Calderón de la Barca, Tirso de Molina and Lope de Vega, many of whose works were translated and adapted for the French stage.\n\nThe common forms are the:\n\nIn English, the most famous and most successful tragedies are those of William Shakespeare and his Elizabethan contemporaries. Shakespeare's tragedies include:\n\nA contemporary of Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, also wrote examples of tragedy in English, notably:\n\nJohn Webster (1580?–1635?), also wrote famous plays of the genre:\n\nContemporary with Shakespeare, an entirely different approach to facilitating the rebirth of tragedy was taken in Italy. Jacopo Peri, in the preface to his \"Euridice\" refers to \"the ancient Greeks and Romans (who in the opinion of many sang their staged tragedies throughout in representing them on stage).\" The attempts of Peri and his contemporaries to recreate ancient tragedy gave rise to the new Italian musical genre of opera. In France, tragic operatic works from the time of Lully to about that of Gluck were not called opera, but \"tragédie en musique\" (\"tragedy in music\") or some similar name; the \"tragédie en musique\" is regarded as a distinct musical genre. Some later operatic composers have also shared Peri's aims: Richard Wagner's concept of \"Gesamtkunstwerk\" (\"integrated work of art\"), for example, was intended as a return to the ideal of Greek tragedy in which all the arts were blended in service of the drama. Nietzsche, in his \"The Birth of Tragedy\" (1872) was to support Wagner in his claims to be a successor of the ancient dramatists.\n\nFor much of the 17th century, Pierre Corneille, who made his mark on the world of tragedy with plays like \"Medée\" (1635) and \"Le Cid\" (1636), was the most successful writer of French tragedies. Corneille's tragedies were strangely un-tragic (his first version of \"Le Cid\" was even listed as a tragicomedy), for they had happy endings. In his theoretical works on theatre, Corneille redefined both comedy and tragedy around the following suppositions:\n\nCorneille continued to write plays through 1674 (mainly tragedies, but also something he called \"heroic comedies\") and many continued to be successes, although the \"irregularities\" of his theatrical methods were increasingly criticised (notably by François Hédelin, abbé d'Aubignac) and the success of Jean Racine from the late 1660s signalled the end of his preeminence.\n\nJean Racine's tragedies—inspired by Greek myths, Euripides, Sophocles and Seneca—condensed their plot into a tight set of passionate and duty-bound conflicts between a small group of noble characters, and concentrated on these characters' double-binds and the geometry of their unfulfilled desires and hatreds. Racine's poetic skill was in the representation of pathos and amorous passion (like Phèdre's love for her stepson) and his impact was such that emotional crisis would be the dominant mode of tragedy to the end of the century. Racine's two late plays (\"Esther\" and \"Athalie\") opened new doors to biblical subject matter and to the use of theatre in the education of young women. Racine also faced criticism for his irregularities: when his play, \"Bérénice\", was criticised for not containing any deaths, Racine disputed the conventional view of tragedy.\n\nFor more on French tragedy of the 16th and 17th centuries, see French Renaissance literature and French literature of the 17th century.\n\nBourgeois tragedy (German: Bürgerliches Trauerspiel) is a form that developed in 18th-century Europe. It was a fruit of the Enlightenment and the emergence of the bourgeois class and its ideals. It is characterised by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play, George Lillo's \"The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell\", which was first performed in 1731. Usually, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's play \"Miss Sara Sampson\", which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest \"Bürgerliches Trauerspiel\" in Germany.\n\nIn modernist literature, the definition of tragedy has become less precise. The most fundamental change has been the rejection of Aristotle's dictum that true tragedy can only depict those with power and high status. Arthur Miller's essay \"Tragedy and the Common Man\" (1949) argues that tragedy may also depict ordinary people in domestic surroundings. British playwright Howard Barker has argued strenuously for the rebirth of tragedy in the contemporary theatre, most notably in his volume \"Arguments for a Theatre\". \"You emerge from tragedy equipped against lies. After the musical, you're anybody's fool,\" he insists. Critics such as George Steiner have even been prepared to argue that tragedy may no longer exist in comparison with its former manifestations in classical antiquity. In \"The Death of Tragedy\" (1961) George Steiner outlined the characteristics of Greek tragedy and the traditions that developed from that period. In the Foreword (1980) to a new edition of his book Steiner concluded that ‘the dramas of Shakespeare are not a renascence of or a humanistic variant of the absolute tragic model. They are, rather, a rejection of this model in the light of tragi-comic and “realistic” criteria.’ In part, this feature of Shakespeare’s mind is explained by his bent of mind or imagination which was ‘so encompassing, so receptive to the plurality of diverse orders of experience.’ When compared to the drama of Greek antiquity and French classicism Shakespeare’s forms are ‘richer but hybrid'.\n\nAristotle wrote in his work \"Poetics\" that\ntragedy is characterised by seriousness and involves a great person who experiences a reversal of fortune (\"Peripeteia\"). Aristotle's definition can include a change of fortune from bad to good as in the \"Eumenides\", but he says that the change from good to bad as in \"Oedipus Rex\" is preferable because this induces pity and fear within the spectators. Tragedy results in a catharsis (emotional cleansing) or healing for the audience through their experience of these emotions in response to the suffering of the characters in the drama.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, \"the structure of the best tragedy should not be simple but complex and one that represents incidents arousing fear and pity—for that is peculiar to this form of art.\" This reversal of fortune must be caused by the tragic hero's \"hamartia\", which is often translated as either a character flaw, or as a mistake (since the original Greek etymology traces back to \"hamartanein\", a sporting term that refers to an archer or spear-thrower missing his target). According to Aristotle, \"The misfortune is brought about not by [general] vice or depravity, but by some [particular] error or frailty.\" The reversal is the inevitable but unforeseen result of some action taken by the hero. It is also a misconception that this reversal can be brought about by a higher power (e.g. the law, the gods, fate, or society), but if a character’s downfall is brought about by an external cause, Aristotle describes this as a misadventure and not a tragedy.\n\nIn addition, the tragic hero may achieve some revelation or recognition (anagnorisis--\"knowing again\" or \"knowing back\" or \"knowing throughout\") about human fate, destiny, and the will of the gods. Aristotle terms this sort of recognition \"a change from ignorance to awareness of a bond of love or hate.\"\n\nIn \"Poetics\", Aristotle gave the following definition in ancient Greek of the word \"tragedy\" (τραγῳδία):\n\n\"Ἔστιν οὖν τραγῳδία μίμησις πράξεως σπουδαίας καὶ τελείας μέγεθος ἐχούσης, ἡδυσμένῳ λόγῳ χωρὶς ἑκάστῳ τῶν εἰδῶν ἐν τοῖς μορίοις, δρώντων καὶ οὐ δι᾽ ἀπαγγελίας, δι᾽ ἐλέου καὶ φόβου περαίνουσα τὴν τῶν τοιούτων παθημάτων κάθαρσιν.\"\n\nwhich means \"Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete (composed of an introduction, a middle part and an ending), and possesses magnitude; in language made pleasurable, each of its species separated in different parts; performed by actors, not through narration; effecting through pity and fear the purification of such emotions.\"\n\nCommon usage of tragedy refers to any story with a sad ending, whereas to be an Aristotelian tragedy the story must fit the set of requirements as laid out by \"Poetics\". By this definition social drama cannot be tragic because the hero in it is a victim of circumstance and incidents that depend upon the society in which he lives and not upon the inner compulsions — psychological or religious — which determine his progress towards self-knowledge and death. Exactly what constitutes a \"tragedy\", however, is a frequently debated matter.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, there are four species of tragedy:\n\n1. Complex, which involves Peripety and Discovery\n\n2. Suffering, tragedies of such nature can be seen in the Greek mythological stories of Ajaxes and Ixions\n\n3. Character, a tragedy of moral or ethical character. Tragedies of this nature can be found in Phthiotides and Peleus\n\n4. Spectacle, that of a horror-like theme. Examples of this nature are Phorcides and Prometheus\n\nG.W.F. Hegel, the German philosopher most famous for his dialectical approach to epistemology and history, also applied such a methodology to his theory of tragedy. In his essay \"Hegel's Theory of Tragedy,\" A.C. Bradley first introduced the English-speaking world to Hegel's theory, which Bradley called the \"tragic collision\", and contrasted against the Aristotelian notions of the \"tragic hero\" and his or her \"hamartia\" in subsequent analyses of the Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy and of Sophocles' Antigone. Hegel himself, however, in his seminal \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" argues for a more complicated theory of tragedy, with two complementary branches which, though driven by a single dialectical principle, differentiate Greek tragedy from that which follows Shakespeare. His later lectures formulate such a theory of tragedy as a conflict of ethical forces, represented by characters, in ancient Greek tragedy, but in Shakespearean tragedy the conflict is rendered as one of subject and object, of individual personality which must manifest self-destructive passions because only such passions are strong enough to defend the individual from a hostile and capricious external world:\nHegel's comments on a particular play may better elucidate his theory: \"Viewed externally, Hamlet's death may be seen to have been brought about accidentally... but in Hamlet's soul, we understand that death has lurked from the beginning: the sandbank of finitude cannot suffice his sorrow and tenderness, such grief and nausea at all conditions of life... we feel he is a man whom inner disgust has almost consumed well before death comes upon him from outside.\"\n\nThe writer Bharata Muni, in his work on dramatic theory \"A Treatise on Theatre\" (Sanskrit: \"Nātyaśāstra\", नाट्य शास्त्र, c. 200 BCE – 200 CE), identified several \"rasas\" (such as pity, anger, disgust and terror) in the emotional responses of audiences for the Sanskrit drama of ancient India. The text also suggests the notion of musical modes or jatis which are the origin of the notion of the modern melodic structures known as ragas. Their role in invoking emotions are emphasised; thus compositions emphasising the notes gandhara or rishabha are said to provoke \"sadness\" or \"pathos\" (\"karuna rasa\") whereas rishabha evokes heroism (\"vira rasa\"). Jatis are elaborated in greater detail in the text \"Dattilam\", composed around the same time as the \"Treatise\".\n\nThe celebrated ancient Indian epic, \"Mahabharata\", can also be related to tragedy in some ways. According to Hermann Oldenberg, the original epic once carried an immense \"tragic force\". It was common in Sanskrit drama to adapt episodes from the \"Mahabharata\" into dramatic form.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "188307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188307", "title": "United Service Organizations", "text": "United Service Organizations\n\nThe United Service Organizations Inc. (USO) is a nonprofit organization that provides live entertainment, such as comedians and musicians, and other programs to members of the United States Armed Forces and their families. Since 1941, it has worked in partnership with the Department of War, and later with the Department of Defense (DoD), relying heavily on private contributions and on funds, goods, and services from various corporate and individual donors. Although it is congressionally-chartered, it is not a government agency.\n\nDuring World War II, the USO became the GI's \"home away from home\" and began a tradition of entertaining the troops that continues today. Involvement in the USO was one of the many ways in which the nation had come together to support the war effort, with nearly 1.5 million people having volunteered their services in some way. After it was disbanded in 1947, it was revived in 1950 for the Korean War, after which it also provided peacetime services. During the Vietnam War, USOs were sometimes located in combat zones.\n\nThe organization became particularly famous for its live performances, called camp shows, through which the entertainment industry helped boost the morale of its servicemen and women. Hollywood in general was eager to show its patriotism, and many famous celebrities joined the ranks of USO entertainers. They entertained in military bases at home and overseas, sometimes placing their own lives in danger, by traveling or performing under hazardous conditions.\n\nThe USO has over 200 locations around the world in 14 countries (including the U.S.) and 27 states. During a gala marking the USO's 75th anniversary in 2016, retired Army Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the current chairman of the USO Board of Governors, estimated that the USO has served more than 35 million Americans over its history.\n\nThe USO was founded in 1941 by Mary Ingraham in response to a request from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to provide morale and recreation services to U.S. uniformed military personnel. Roosevelt was elected as its honorary chairman. This request brought together six civilian organizations: the Salvation Army, Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA), Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA), National Catholic Community Service, National Travelers Aid Association and the National Jewish Welfare Board. They were brought together under one umbrella to support U.S. troops. Roosevelt said he wanted \"these private organizations to handle the on-leave recreation of the men in the armed forces.\" According to historian Emily Yellin, \"The government was to build the buildings and the USO was to raise private funds to carry out its main mission: boosting the morale of the military.\"\n\nThe first national campaign chairman was Thomas Dewey, who raised $16 million in the first year. The second chairman was future senator Prescott Bush. The USO was incorporated in New York on February 4, with the first facility erected in DeRidder, Louisiana,1941. More USO centers and clubs opened around the world as a “Home Away from Home” for GIs. The USO club was a place to go for dances and social events, for movies and music, for a quiet place to talk or write a letter home, or for a free cup of coffee and an egg.\n\nThe USO also brought Hollywood celebrities and volunteer entertainers to perform for the troops. According to movie historian Steven Cohan, \"most of all ... in taking home on the road, it equated the nation with showbiz. USO camp shows were designed in their export to remind soldiers of home.\" They did this, he noted, by \"nurturing in troops a sense of patriotic identification with America through popular entertainment.\" An article in \"Look\" magazine at the time, stated, \"For the little time the show lasts, the men are taken straight to the familiar Main Street that is the goal of every fighting American far away from home.\" Maxene Andrews wrote, \"The entertainment brought home to the boys. \"Their\" home.\" Actor George Raft stated at the beginning of the war, \"Now it's going to be up to us to send to the men here and abroad real, living entertainment, the songs, the dances, and the laughs they had back home.\"\n\nUSO promotional literature stated its goals:\n\nAfter being formed in 1941, in response to World War II, \"centers were established quickly... in churches, barns, railroad cars, museums, castles, beach clubs, and log cabins.\" Most centers offered recreational activities, such as holding dances and showing movies. And there were the well-known free coffee and doughnuts. Some USO centers provided a haven for spending a quiet moment alone or writing a letter home, while others offered spiritual guidance and made childcare available for military wives.\n\nBut the organization became mostly known for its live performances called \"Camp Shows\", through which the entertainment industry helped boost the morale of its servicemen and women. USO Camp Shows, Inc. began in October 1941, and by that fall and winter 186 military theaters existed in the United States. Overseas shows began in November 1941 with a tour of the Caribbean. Within five months 36 overseas units had been sent within the Americas, the United Kingdom, and Australia, and during 1942 1,000 performed as part of 70 units. Average performers were paid $100 a week; top stars were paid $10 a day because their wealth let them contribute more of their talents.\n\nThese overseas shows were produced by the American Theatre Wing, which also provided food and entertainment for the armed services in their Stage Door Canteens. Funds from the sale of film rights for a story about the New York Canteen went toward providing USO tours of shows for overseas troops.\n\nFollowing the Invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, Edward G. Robinson was the first movie star to travel to Normandy to entertain the troops. He had already been active back home selling war bonds, and donated $100,000 to the USO. During his show, he said, \"This is the most privileged moment of my life, the opportunity to be here with you.\" The following month, Camp Shows began in Normandy. \n\nUntil fall 1944 overseas units contained five performers or fewer; \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\", using local theaters in France and Italy, was the first to use an entire theater company, including scenery. At its high point in 1944, the USO had more than 3,000 clubs, and curtains were rising on USO shows 700 times a day. The USO's fundraising efforts were controversial. An MGM film, \"Mr. Gardenia Jones\", created to assist the USO in its fundraising campaign, was nearly withdrawn from theaters due to objections by the War Department, mainly because of scenes showing soldiers jumping with joy at the opportunity to shower in canteens and rest in overstuffed and comfortable USO chairs. The Army, noted the \"New York Times\", \"feels this is not good for morale as it implies that there are no showers or other comforts for soldiers in military camps.\" The film starred Ronald Reagan, then a captain in the Army Air Force.\n\nFundraising was also aided by non-USO entertainment groups. Soldier Shows, which troops – often experienced actors and musicians – organized and held their own performances, were common. The army formed a Special Services unit that organized such shows and supervised the USO, and the experience from the Soldier Shows led to Irving Berlin's Broadway show \"This Is the Army\". Performers and writers from throughout the army were recruited for the production; they remained soldiers and continued drills. Berlin, who had written and produced the similar \"Yip, Yip, Yaphank\" during World War I, took the entire 165-person cast on tour in Europe in 1942, raising nearly $10 million for the Army Emergency Relief Fund. The following year the show was made into a film by the same title, again starring Ronald Reagan. One of the highlights of the film was its introduction of Berlin's song, \"God Bless America,\" considered one of the nation's most patriotic songs. The \"This Is The Army\" stage production toured worldwide until it closed in October 1945 in Honolulu.\n\nWar correspondent Quentin Reynolds, wrote in an article for \"Billboard magazine\" in 1943, that \"Entertainment, all phases of it – radio, pictures and live – should be treated as essential. You don't know what entertainment means to the guys who do the fighting until you've been up there with the men yourself. [...] You can quote me as saying that we should use entertainment as an essential industry so long as it's for the boys in service. Anybody who has been there would insist on it. [...] Hell, you should have seen how happy the G.I.'s were when they heard the ballplayers were coming over. And John Steinbeck, just back from a chore as war correspondent, [...] also applauded show business as part of the war effort and its importance as a morale builder.\"\nAccording to historian Paul Holsinger, between 1941 and 1945, the USO did 293,738 performances in 208,178 separate visits. Estimates were that more than 161 million servicemen and women, in the U.S. and abroad, were entertained. The USO also did shows in military hospitals, eventually entertaining more than 3 million wounded soldiers and sailors in 192 different hospitals. There were 702 different USO troupes that toured the world, some spending up to six months per tour. In 1943, a United States Liberty ship named the SS \"U.S.O.\" was launched. She was scrapped in 1967.\n\nTwenty-eight performers died in the course of their tours, from plane crashes, illness, or diseases contracted while on tour. In one such instance in 1943, a plane carrying a USO troupe crashed outside Lisbon, killing singer and actress Tamara Drasin, and severely injuring Broadway singer Jane Froman. Froman returned to Europe on crutches in 1945 to again entertain the troops. She later married the co-pilot who saved her life in that crash, and her story was made into the 1952 film \"With a Song in My Heart\", with Froman providing the actual singing voice. Others, such as Al Jolson, the first entertainer to go overseas in World War II, contracted malaria, resulting in the loss of his lung, cutting short his tour.\n\nOne author wrote that by the end of the war \"the USO amounted to the biggest enterprise American show business has ever tackled. The audience was millions of American fighting men, the theatre's location: the world, the producer: USO camp shows\" Performances continued after the end of the war in 1945. 60 new units went to Europe after V-E Day, and 91 new units went to the Pacific after V-J Day. The USO dissolved in December 1947, after having spent $240 million in contributions on Camp Shows, canteens, and other services. Special Services productions grew in number as replacement.\n\nIn 1991, 20th Century Fox produced the film, \"For the Boys\", which told the story of two USO performers, and starred Bette Midler and James Caan. It covered a 50-year timespan, from the USO's inception in 1941 through Operation Desert Storm, in 1991. Another movie was planned in 1950 but never made. Just 10 days after Al Jolson returned from entertaining troops in Korea, he agreed with RKO producers to star in a new movie, \"Stars and Stripes for Ever,\" about a USO troupe in the South Pacific during World War II. Unfortunately, he died a week later as a result of physical exhaustion from his tour.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1947, the USO presented more than 400,000 performances, featuring entertainers such as: Abbott and Costello, Larry Adler, Brian Aherne, Louise Allbritton, Morey Amsterdam, Marian Anderson, The Andrews Sisters, Armida, Jean Arthur, Fred Astaire, Gene Autry, Lauren Bacall, Fay Bainter, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Tallulah Bankhead, Lynn Bari, Count Basie, Peg Leg Bates, Constance Bennett, Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen, Ingrid Bergman, Milton Berle, Eubie Blake, Ben Black, Ben Blue, Ray Bolger, Humphrey Bogart, Mary Brian, Hillary Brooke, Phyllis Brooks, Joe E.

USO historian Julia Carson writes that this \"nostalgic hour,\" designed to cheer and comfort soldiers, involved \"listening to music – American style\" and \"looking at pretty girls, like no other pretty girls in the world – American girls.\"\n\nAfrican-American women scrambled to rally the community around the soldiers and create programs for them. By 1946, hostesses had served more than two thousand soldiers a day while also providing facilities for the wounded and convalescent who were on leave. They went to black businesses and fraternal organizations in order to find sponsorship for their USO group, and later expanded to fulfill the needs of soldiers during the Korean War. Moreover, they worked to merge black and white USOs into one desegregated unit. As black historian Megan Shockley noted, \"Their work for the desegregation of USOs had begun during World War II, and it finally paid off.\"\n\nWomen were also key entertainers who performed at shows. Stars such as Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth had traveled over a million miles. Yellin notes that on one tour, Hayworth visited six camps, gave thousands of autographs, and \"came back from Texas with a full-fledged nervous breakdown from over-enthusiasm!\" Opera singer Lily Pons, after she had performed a \"serious\" opera song to troops in Burma, \"an applause erupted that stunned even the most seasoned performers.\" She later wrote in a letter, \"Every woman back home wears a halo now, and those who represent her had better keep theirs on, too.\"\n\nAuthor Joeie Dee pointed out that \"for women entertainers, traveling with the USO made it possible to be patriots and adventurers as well as professionals.\" She adds, however, that the G.I.s in the USO audiences \"tended to see these women in a different light – as reminders of and even substitutes for their girls back home, as a reward for fighting the war, as embodiments of what they were fighting for.\" Edward Skvarna remembers 1943, when he met Donna Reed at a USO canteen and asked her to dance. \"I had never danced with a celebrity before, so I felt delighted, privileged even, to meet her... But I really felt she was like a girl from back home.\" Jay Fultz, author of a biography of Reed, states that soldiers \"often wrote to her as if to a sister or the girl next door, confiding moments of homesickness, loneliness, privation and anxiety.\"\n\nOne female entertainer wrote about conditions while performing:\nSinger-actress-dancer Ann Miller described performing for badly wounded soldiers. She did forty-eight shows for \"broken soldiers,\" who were mostly lying on stretchers in the lobbies of hotels, watching as she entertained them. Yellin writes, \"During her last show she collapsed and had to be taken home on an Army airplane.\" Afterwards, Miller described the experience:\n\nIn November and December 1968 Jennie and Terrie Frankel (the Doublemint Twins) performed in Vietnam with the USO – Hollywood Overseas Committee and were shepherded around Vietnam by escort officers (USO Performers were given GS15 ratings, equivalent to Colonel, to help maintain their safety) to entertain troops in the field, where larger USO shows could not perform.\n\nIn 1947, the USO was disbanded, due partly to lack of funds. In 1951, when the United States entered the Korean War, Secretary of Defense George Marshall and Secretary of the Navy Francis P. Matthews requested that the USO be reactivated \"to provide support for the men and women of the armed forces with help of the American people.\" According to war historian Paul Edwards, Between 1952 and 1953, not a day went by without the USO providing services somewhere in Korea. At home or overseas, in 1952 it was serving 3.5 million in the armed forces using much the same methods of operation as it did in World War II.\n\nMany stars, both well-known and new, came to perform, including Bob Hope, Errol Flynn, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, Piper Laurie, Jane Russell, Paul Douglas, Terry Moore, Marilyn Monroe, Danny Kaye, Rory Calhoun, Mickey Rooney, Jayne Mansfield, Al Jolson and many others. Hispanic-American soldiers were entertained by artists such as Pérez Prado's Show featuring Evita Muñoz as his invited mambo dancer. Jolson was the first to volunteer, but due to lack of USO funds traveled to Korea at his own expense (he was also the first to entertain troops during World War II).\nVeterans have recalled many of the USOs events, sometimes in vivid detail:\n\nAuthor Linda Granfield in describing the show, writes, \"For two hours, the men could forget they were soldiers at war. After the show, they returned to the fighting in the hills. Some in that audience never made it back.\" By the end of the war, over 113,000 American USO volunteers were working at 294 centers at home and abroad. And 126 units had given 5,422 performances to servicemen in Korea and the wounded in Japan.\n\nThe USO was in Vietnam before the first combat troops arrived, with the first USO club opened in Saigon in April 1963. The 23 centers in Vietnam and Thailand served as many as a million service members a month, and the USO presented more than 5,000 performances during the Vietnam War featuring stars such as John Wayne, Ann-Margret, Sammy Davis Jr., Raymond Burr, Phyllis Diller, Martha Raye, Joey Heatherton, Wayne Newton, Jayne Mansfield, Redd Foxx, Rosey Grier, Anita Bryant, Nancy Sinatra, Jimmy Boyd, Lola Falana, George Peppard and Bob Hope. Philip Ahn, the first actor of Korean descent to become a Hollywood star, became the first Asian American USO performer to entertain troops in Vietnam.\n\nIn addition, the USO operated centers at major U.S. airports to provide a lounge and place to sleep for American servicemen between their flights. Vietnam historian James Westheider noted that the USO \"tried to bring a little America to Vietnam.\" Volunteer American civilians, who did 18-month tours, staffed the clubs. According to Westheider, \"The young women wore miniskirts – no slacks were allowed.\" Each club had a snack bar, gift shops, a barbershop, photo developing, overseas phone lines, and hot showers.\n\nWhen providing entertainment, the USO did its best to attract known stars from back home to help relieve the stresses of war. Senator John Kerry recalled how important this kind of diversion would become. He remembered a \"Bob Hope Follies\" USO show, which included actress Ann-Margret, Miss America, football star Rosey Grier, and others. According to Kerry biographer Douglas Brinkley, \"When the Swift finally made it back to the My Tho River, the crew confronted the heartbreaking sight of a huge Navy landing craft ferrying the troops back. The USO show was over.\" Kerry later wrote, \"The visions of Ann Margret and Miss America and all the other titillating personalities who would have made us feel so at home hung around us for a while until we saw three Chinook helicopters take off from the field and presumed that our dreams had gone with them.\"\n\nBut for GIs who saw the show, it was worth it: \"We turned to watch Ann perform, and for about two minutes of American beauty, the war was forgotten. Everyone fully understood just what was really worth fighting for. . . . The show was fantastic, but the escape the Bob Hope tour provided us in expectation for days before, and after, helped us keep in touch with what we were there for – God, Country, apple pie ... and Ann-Margret!\"\n\nThe visits by the stars meant a lot to the men and women in Vietnam. \"It was not just the entertainment; it meant that they were not forgotten that far away from home,\" writes Westheider. He adds that the tours made a \"deep impression\" on the stars as well. Singer and actress Connie Stevens remembered her 1969 tour with Bob Hope, when she decided to go despite the fact she had two children both under the age of two. Today, she claims that \"veterans were still stopping her and thanking her for visiting Vietnam over 30 years later.\"\n\nSimilarly, Ann-Margret during a book signing was approached by a veteran who asked her to sign a photo he took of her performing in Vietnam. Although the book's publishing representative for the signing event would not allow her to sign anything other than her book, the veteran's wife recalls:\n\nIn November–December 1968 the Sig Sakowitz troop from Chicago performed over 36 shows in South Vietnam with the USO in: Pleiku, Dalat, Danang, Cam Ran Bay, Phu Bai, Phu Loy, Hue, Natrang, Tan Son Nhut Airbase, Saigon and places in the boonies known only to military intelligence and the lonely soldiers yearning for a taste of home. The troop consisted of Doublemint Twins Terrie and Jennie Frankel, Gaslight Club singer Sara Sue, Comedian Tony Diamond and personality Sig Sakowitz. Shows were also performed with comedian Joey Bishop of the Rat Pack.\n\nGeorge Peppard, successful star of stage, TV and motion pictures, arrived in Vietnam for a USO HANDSHAKE TOUR in 1970 to visit the military in the hospitals and out in the “boonies.” ...He showed a keen interest in the men’s mission while they were hungry for news of life back in the “World.” ... Polaroid pictures were taken by Mr. Peppard’s escort officer, autographed, and given to the men.\nIn 1983, a bloody civil war was raging in Lebanon. In an effort to stop the violence in the region a Multinational Force of peacekeepers composed largely of U.S., Italian and French armed service members was created and sent to the region to attempt a restoration of order. As part of the multinational force the United States mobilized an expeditionary force composed of members of the United States Marine Corps and elements of the United States Sixth Fleet which operated out of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nCarrying on a tradition he had begun in World War II of spending Christmas with U.S. forces overseas, Bob Hope and his troupe of entertainers gave a show on board the USS \"New Jersey\" (BB-62) on December 24, 1983. Four hundred Marines stationed in Beirut attended the show.\n\nAmerican troops have been deployed in Italy since the end of World War II. In 1988, a car bomb targeted the USO club in Naples, which killed five people including a U.S. Navy officer.\n\nTo support troops participating in Operation Desert Shield, USO centers opened in Saudi Arabia. Entertainers performing for the troops included Jay Leno, Steve Martin, Delta Burke, Ann Jillian, Gerald McRaney, Marie Osmond, the Pointer Sisters, country singer Gina James, and Bob Hope on his final USO tour.\n\nTo support troops participating in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, USO centers opened in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar. USO centers number more than 160 around the world. In those years, the USO opened centers at Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Riley, Kansas; Fort Bliss, Texas; Fort Carson, Colorado; and Afghanistan. The USO provides a variety of programs and services, including orientation programs, family events, free Internet and e-mail access, free drinks and snacks, free phone calls home and recreation services. One of the newer programs, called \"USO in a Box,\" delivers program materials ranging from DVD players and videos to musical instruments to remote forward operating bases in Afghanistan.\n\nU.S. military personnel and their families visit USO centers more than eight million times each year.\nBruce Willis visited Baghdad, Camp Kir Kush and Camp Caldwell, Iraq around December 2003. Mr. Willis visited military bases in Iraq during his visit in Iraq.\n\nFrom June 8 to 11, 2009, TV personality Stephen Colbert traveled to Iraq to film his show \"The Colbert Report\" for four days in a USO sponsored event.\n\nOther entertainers who have traveled to the Middle East to perform include Al Franken (who made six USO tours in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan before being elected a United States Senator from Minnesota), Robin Williams, Craig Ferguson, Gary Sinise, Zac Brown, Five Finger Death Punch, Artie Lange, Gary Dell'Abate, Nick DiPaolo, Jim Florentine, Dave Attell, Avenged Sevenfold, Jessica Simpson, Carrie Underwood, Drowning Pool, Toby Keith (with special guest Gina James), Montgomery Gentry, Kellie Pickler, Mayra Veronica, Carlos Mencia, O.A.R., Trace Adkins, Kathleen Madigan, Louis C.K., Dane Cook, Lewis Black, Third Day, Colin Quinn, Kathy Griffin and Neil McCoy.\n\nThe USO has provided services for the annual \"Tribute to the Troops\" special of World Wrestling Entertainment. They have aired WWE RAW from Afghanistan and Iraq every Christmas in the United States in a pre-taped show from the combat zone.\n\nOn July 16, 2012, Hollywood actor Charlie Sheen announced that he would donate at least $1 million to the USO. This would be among the largest single monetary donations ever given to the organization.\n\nIn 1997, the U.S. Congress honored Bob Hope by declaring him the \"first and only honorary veteran of the U.S. armed forces.\" According to Hope biographer William Faith, his reputation has become ingrained in the \"American consciousness\" because he had flown millions of miles to entertain G.I.s during both wartime and peace. His contribution to the USO began in 1941 and ended with Operation Desert Shield in 1991, spending 48 Christmases overseas with American service personnel. He was always treated as \"an asset to the U.S. Government with his willingness to entertain whenever they needed him.\" After WWII was declared over, the USO had sent out an \"impassioned bulletin\" asking entertainers not to abandon the GIs now that the war was over. Hope was among the first to say yes. The Military Order of the Purple Heart notes that \"his contributions to the USO are well known: they are legend.\"\n\nAs a result of his non-stop entertainment to both the civilian population and the military, he received numerous other honors over the years: a C-17 Air Force plane was named \"The Spirit of Bob Hope\"; a naval vessel was named the \"USNS Bob Hope\"; and streets, schools, hospitals, and a golf tournament were also named in his honor. A Senate resolution declared him \"a part of American folklore.\" The \"Guinness Book of Records\" called him the most honored entertainer ever. And during his 1993 televised birthday celebration, when he turned 90, General Colin Powell saluted Hope \"for his tireless USO trouping\", which was followed by onstage tributes from all branches of the armed forces. General William Westmoreland spoke about his loyalty to the GI throughout the gritty Vietnam years. And bandleader Les Brown, who was with him during many of his tours, mentioned that his band \"had seen more of Hope's ass in the last forty years than any of Hope's immediate family.\"\n\nWar correspondent Quentin Reynolds wrote in 1943, \"He and his troupe would do 300 miles in a jeep, and give four shows... One of the generals said Hope was a first rate military target since he was worth a division; that that's about 15,000 men. Presumably the Nazis appreciated Hope's value, since they thrice bombed towns while the comic was there.\"\n\nDuring the Vietnam War years he gave a number of high-rating television specials and sensed that the media had given him a broad endorsement for continuing on his GI mercy missions. Soon after his Christmas show in Saigon in 1967, he learned that the Vietcong had planned a terrorist attack at his hotel against him and his entire troupe, missing him by ten minutes. He was later \"mystified,\" writes Faith, \"and ... increasingly intolerant of the pockets of dissent. Draft-card burnings on college campuses angered him...\" \"Can you imagine,\" Hope wrote in a magazine article, \"... that people in America are burning their draft cards to show their opposition and that some of them are actually rooting for your defeat?\" In the spring of 1973, Hope began writing his fifth book, \"The Last Christmas Show\", which was dedicated to \"the men and women of the armed forces and to those who also served by worrying and waiting.\" He signed over his royalties to the USO.\n\nHis final Christmas show was during Operation Desert Shield in 1990. The show was not easy, notes Faith. \"There were so many restrictions. Hope's jokes were monitored by the State Department to avoid offending the Saudis... and the media was restricted from covering the shows... Because in Saudi Arabia national custom prescribes that women must be veiled in public, Ann Jillian, Marie Osmond, and the Pointer Sisters were left off Hope's Christmas Eve show.\"\n\nIn 2009, Stephen Colbert performing his last episode of weeklong taping in Iraq for his \"The Colbert Report\" show, carried a golf club on stage and dedicated it to Bob Hope's service for the USO.\n\nThe USO has a paid staff of approximately 300. Additionally, more than 44,000 USO volunteers provide an estimated 371,417 hours of service annually. As reported by the USO, the unpaid volunteer to paid employee ratio overseas is 20 to 1. Within the United States, the number is \"significantly higher.\"\n\nThe following information is based on USO's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011:\n\nBilly Joel's song, \"Allentown\" (1982), includes the lines: \"Well our fathers fought the Second World War/\nSpent their weekends on the Jersey Shore/\nMet our mothers in the USO/\nAsked them to dance/\nDanced with them slow.\"\n\nFrom the 1979 film \"Apocalypse Now\": \"Charlie didn't get much USO. He was dug in too deep or moving too fast. His idea of great R&R was cold rice and a little rat meat. He had only two ways home: death, or victory.\"\n\nThe music video for the My Chemical Romance song, \"The Ghost of You\" is set at a USO dance. \n\nThe climax of the 1999 \"South Park\" movie, \"\", is set at a USO show.\n\n\n"}

It is a short, descriptive passage, more about evoking meaning through imagery than about plot.\n\nA blog or web series can also provide a form of vignette or be presented as a series of vignettes. An example of this is the critically acclaimed web series \"High Maintenance\", which presents a different set of characters in each episode, focusing intensely on their specific traits, ideas, and worlds.\n\nVignettes are more commonly used and have been particularly influential in the development of the contemporary notions of a scene as shown in postmodern theater, film and television, where less emphasis is placed on adhering to the conventions of traditional structure and story development. It is also a part of something bigger than itself: for example, a vignette about a house belonging to a collection of vignettes or a whole story, such as \"The House On Mango Street\", by Sandra Cisneros.\n\nThe word \"vignette\" means \"little vine\" in French, and the name of the literary form comes from the drawings of little vines that nineteenth-century printers used to decorate the title pages and beginnings of chapters.\n\n"}
{"id": "2222324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2222324", "title": "Visual gag", "text": "Visual gag\n\nIn comedy, a visual gag or sight gag is anything which conveys its humour visually, often without words being used at all. The gag may involve a physical impossibility or an unexpected occurrence. The humor is caused by alternative interpretations of the goings-on. Visual gags are used in magic, plays, and acting on television or movies.\n\nThe most common type of visual gag is based on multiple interpretations of a series of events. This type is used in the 1935 Alfred Hitchcock film \"The 39 Steps\". Lead actor Robert Donat was kidnapping actress Madeleine Carroll and they were handcuffed. When they checked into an inn, the innkeeper assumed that they were passionate lovers because of the handcuffs. The film used dialogue that could be interpreted both ways.\n\nAnother visual gag is a switched image, often at the beginning of a film. A subsequent view of the scene shows something not viewed before. Switched movement may be the gag, such as Charlie Chaplin in \"The Pawnshop\". Chaplin fights with his coworker and punches at him once. Their boss walks in mid-swing and Chaplin changes the motion to act like he was dropping to his knees to scrub the floor. \n\nNoel Carroll established the most influential taxonomy of sight gags, breaking down the varieties into six types, two of which are enumerated below.\n\nMutual Interference: The audience is fully aware of the on-screen situation, but a character comically misunderstands\n\nMimed Metaphor: A variety of virtual simile an object may be treated as if it is a different object or be used in an unconventional way, such as acting like a doughnut is a barbell or using a tuba as an umbrella holder.\n\nThere are numerous examples in cinema history of directors who based most of the humor in their films on visual gags, even to the point of using no or minimal dialogue. Visual gags began in live theater. The first known use of a visual gag in a film was in the Lumière brothers' 1895 short, \"L'Arroseur Arrosé\" (\"The Waterer Watered\"), in which a gardener watering his plants becomes the subject of a boy's prank. An early pioneer in visual gags was Georges Méliès. The filmmaker experimented with techniques in the then-new film media creating techniques to trick viewers.\n\nVaudeville actors often used gags in their routines. A classic vaudeville visual gag was for two actors to mirror each other's actions around a prop. Visual gags were continued into silent films and are considered a hallmark of the genre. In silent films, the actors in the mirror bit performed in silence with no music playing. Comedians including Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and the Marx Brothers often used visual humour because the technology used to record voices in film (and play it back in a synchronized presentation) did not yet exist. Often the differences between people are part of the comic duos, especially thin and fat actors are used such as Abbott and Costello and Laurel and Hardy.\n\n\"The New York Times\" cites the fourth \"Gilligan's Island\" episode, \"Goodnight, Sweet Skipper\", as a classic American sight gag. The castaways were trying to contact civilization with a radio. In the episode, Skipper can recall only how he converted the radio into a transmitter in World War II when he was sleepwalking. After Skipper was unsuccessful, Gilligan got it to work by pounding on the radio; he used it to briefly contact a pilot flying overhead. Gilligan retrieved Skipper and demonstrated how he pounded on the radio, causing the guts of the radio to fall out. Their rescue was foiled.\n\n"}

With many professional voice talent utilizing home studios, clients are able to cut out traditional bricks and mortar agents.

For example, costumes, sets and musical accompaniment may be excluded, or may be included in a simpler form.\n\nOne common purpose of a workshop production is to provide a preview staging of a new work in order to gauge audience and critical reaction, following which some parts of the work may be adjusted or rewritten before the work's official premiere. Because a workshop production generally pays less for the rights to perform the play, workshop productions also provide an opportunity for smaller theatres to generate increased publicity by staging a popular or highly anticipated work for which a full production might be too costly. Some theatre companies, in fact, specialize exclusively in workshop productions; amateur and youth theatre companies, for example, are commonly structured on the workshop production model.\n\nSome fictional works, including the musical \"A Chorus Line\" and the television series \"Smash\", depict the audition and workshop processes of developmental theatrical productions.\n"}
