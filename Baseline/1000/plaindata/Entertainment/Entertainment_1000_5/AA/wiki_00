ABS-CBN accused rival GMA Network of funding bribing operations at Bacolod City, to discredit the former. The Court further ordered ABS-CBN to file comment on the plea of AGB Nielsen for the alleged gathering and dissemination of television ratings data, within five days or until 22 December.\n\nOn December 21, 2007, DZMM correspondent Junrie Hidalgo reported a news story titled \"AGB Nielsen, umamin sa dayaan: GMA Network, tahasang itinurong nasa likod ng dayaan\" (AGB Nielsen admits the cheating: GMA Network fiercely accused of being responsible of the cheating) during the program Showbiz Mismo, hosted by Cristy Fermin and Jobert Sucaldito. The news story is based on an interview of AGB Nielsen's General Manager Maya Reforma regarding the alleged cheating.\n\nIn response, GMA aired a TV plug condemning the alleged biased reporting and denied the accusations of ABS-CBN. They later filed a PHP15-million civil libel suit against ABS-CBN on 3 January 2008. The respondents included Hidalgo, Fermin, Sucaldito, the station manager and news manager of DZMM and hosts, writers and executive producers of TV programs Bandila, Entertainment Live and The Buzz after the same story was aired on the mentioned programs.\n\nOn January 7, 2008, the Quezon City RTC junked ABS-CBN's suit against AGB Nielsen, saying the case was \"prematurely filed\" before the court. Judge Charito Gonzales's basis is the principle of mutuality of contracts, citing Article 1308 and 1196, New Civil Code of the Philippines. Also, Judge Samuel Gaerlan, QCRTC, Branch 92 issued court summons against ABS-CBN and its 15 personnel, in the P15-million damage suit by GMA Network.\n\nOn January 17, 2008, Judge Gaerlan recused himself from the case, considering that he has a cousin working in the legal department of ABS-CBN. The case was later re-raffled on January 28, 2008, and the case was eventually assigned to Judge Henri Inting of Branch 95, QCRTC. Judge Inting submitted GMA's petition for a temporary restraining order for decision.\n\nOn February 1, ABS-CBN presented two witnesses, Romie Diamanse and Francis Casumpang, saying RGMA head Mike Enriquez was said to have given the order to cheat in a meeting. Enriquez denied the charges and said that the statements were \"shameless, malicious fiction delivered by tainted informers with an axe to grind.\" Diamanse and Casumpang were former employees of RGMA's 93.5 Campus Radio Iloilo (now Barangay FM 93.5 Iloilo). Casumpang resigned from the station after charges of embezzlement, and now works for ABS-CBN's MOR 91.1 Iloilo. On the other hand, RGMA accepted Diamanse's resignation \"because he was regarded as ineffective in his duties.\"\n\nOn February 14, 2008, Judge Inting issued a TRO barring ABS-CBN from airing defamatory statements against GMA.\n\n"}
{"id": "61194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61194", "title": "A Prairie Home Companion", "text": "A Prairie Home Companion\n\nA Prairie Home Companion is a weekly radio variety show created and hosted by Garrison Keillor that aired live from 1974 to 2016. In 2016, musician Chris Thile took over as host, and the successor show was eventually renamed \"Live from Here\". \"A Prairie Home Companion\" aired on Saturdays from the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul, Minnesota; it was also frequently heard on tours to New York City and other U.S. cities. The show is known for its musical guests, especially folk and traditional musicians, tongue-in-cheek radio drama, and relaxed humor. Keillor's wry storytelling segment, \"News from Lake Wobegon\", was the show's best-known feature during his long tenure.\n\nDistributed by Minnesota Public Radio's distribution arm, American Public Media, \"A Prairie Home Companion\" was heard on 690 public radio stations in the United States at its peak in spring 2015 and reached an audience of four million U.S. listeners each week. The show borrowed its name from a radio program in existence in 1969 that was named after the Prairie Home Cemetery near Concordia College, in Moorhead, Minnesota. It inspired a 2006 film of the same name, written by Keillor, directed by Robert Altman, and featuring Keillor, Kevin Kline, Lily Tomlin, Meryl Streep, and Lindsay Lohan.\n\nThe Saturday-evening show was a partial spin-off of \"A Prairie Home Morning Show\" with Keillor and Tom Keith, which ran from 6 to 9 a.m. on Minnesota Public Radio and was continued by Keith and Dale Connelly for many years as \"The Morning Show.\"\n\nAfter researching the Grand Ole Opry for an article, Keillor became interested in doing a variety show on the radio. On July 6, 1974, the first live broadcast of \"A Prairie Home Companion\" took place. That show was broadcast from St. Paul in the Janet Wallace Auditorium of Macalester College. Twelve audience members turned out, mostly children. The second episode featured the first performance on the show by Butch Thompson, who became house pianist. Thompson stayed with the program until 1986 and still frequently performs on the show.\n\nIn 1978, the show moved into the World Theater in St. Paul, which Minnesota Public Radio purchased and renovated in 1986 and renamed the Fitzgerald Theater in 1994. This is the same venue the program uses today.\n\nThe show went off the air in 1987, with a \"final performance\" on June 13, and Keillor married and spent some time abroad during the following two years. For a brief time, the show was replaced—both on the air and in the World Theater—by \"Good Evening\", hosted by Noah Adams, a live variety show designed by ex-\"Prairie Home\" and \"All Things Considered\" staffers to retain the audience Keillor had cultivated over the years. However, many stations opted instead to continue \"APHC\" repeats in its traditional Saturday time slot.\n\nIn 1989, Keillor returned to radio with \"The American Radio Company of the Air\" (renamed \"Garrison Keillor's American Radio Company\" in its second season), broadcast originally from the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The new program featured a broadly similar format to \"A Prairie Home Companion\", with sketches and musical guests reflecting a more New York sensibility, rather than the country and folk music predominant in \"APHC\". Also, while Keillor sang and delivered a regular monologue on \"American Radio Company\", Lake Wobegon was initially downplayed, as he felt it was \"cruel\" to talk to a Brooklyn audience about life in a small town. During this period, Keillor revived the full \"APHC\" format only for \"annual farewell performances\". In the fall of 1992, Keillor returned to the World Theater with \"ARC\" for the majority of the season, with Lake Wobegon and other \"APHC\" elements gradually but unmistakably returning to prominence.\n\nThe following year, on October 2, 1993, the program officially reverted to the \"A Prairie Home Companion\" name and format.\n\nWhile many of the episodes originated from St. Paul, the show often traveled to other cities around the U.S. and overseas for its live weekly broadcasts. Common road venues included The Town Hall in New York City; Tanglewood in Lenox, Massachusetts; Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts in Vienna, Virginia; Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee; the Greek Theater in Los Angeles; and the State Theater in Minneapolis. It also broadcast a show each year from the Minnesota State Fair.\n\nThe show was originally distributed nationally by Minnesota Public Radio in association with Public Radio International. Later, its distributor was Minnesota Public Radio's distribution unit, American Public Media.\n\nSinger Sara Watkins of San Diego, California hosted the January 15, 2011, broadcast. The format was the same, but Keillor appeared only as a guest actor and to deliver the News from Lake Wobegon. He claimed he had taken the chance to see the show being performed for himself. It was reported that this could be the beginning of a trend toward Keillor's eventual retirement, and on March 16, 2011, Keillor stated in an interview with the AARP that he would most likely retire from the show by the time he turned 70 in August 2012. On January 29, 2011, Erica Rhodes expressed frustration over not being picked to guest host.\n\nIn September 2011, Keillor told \"The Tuscaloosa News\" that his last broadcast would be recorded in \"early July 2013\", and that instead of a permanent replacement host, there will be \"a whole group of people. A rotation of hosts\", but in December 2011 Keillor said he had changed his mind and reconsidered his plans to retire because he still enjoyed hosting the show.\n\nOn February 7 and 14, 2015, mandolinist Chris Thile hosted the show (like Sara Watkins, a member of Nickel Creek). As when Watkins hosted, the format remained largely unchanged, but Keillor did not make an appearance. Instead, storyteller Tristan Jimerson appeared on the February 7 show and comedian/storyteller Elna Baker on the February 14 show. Thile's band Punch Brothers performed on the February 7 show. Thile was named permanent host of the show in late June 2015. Keillor's last show as host was recorded on July 1, 2016, and broadcast the following day. Thile took over as permanent host on October 15, 2016.\n\nWhen Keillor formally announced his departure from \"APHC\" at the show's airing on July 21, 2015, he indicated that Thile would succeed him as permanent host in 2016. Keillor recorded his final episode as host live at the Hollywood Bowl before an audience of 18,000, on July 1, 2016; it was aired on the following day. The episode was titled \"\" (), and was a vocal duet show of \"time-honored American ballads, British Invasion romps, country-western weepers, and Broadway classics,\" guest-starring Sara Watkins, Sarah Jarosz, Aoife O'Donovan, Heather Masse, and Christine DiGiallonardo, alongside the \"Royal Academy of Radio Actors,\" Tim Russell, Sue Scott, and Fred Newman, and the \"APHC\"' band, with music director and pianist Rich Dworsky and Bernie Dresel (drums), Larry Kohut (bass), Richard Kriehn (mandolin and fiddle), and Chris Siebold (guitar).\n\nBarack Obama recorded a telephone call into the show, which ran on the Saturday broadcast, and Keillor performed his last \"Lives of the Cowboys\" sketch as regular host, with regulars Scott, Russell, and Newman, and including a series of duets with the guests Masse, O'Donovan, Jarosz, DiGiallonardo, and Watkins. As well, he performed his last \"News from Lake Wobegon\" segment, with its final closing description of the fictional town, where “all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.” Thile made his debut as permanent host on October 15, 2016.\n\nOn November 29, 2017, Minnesota Public Radio terminated its contract with Keillor because of \"allegations of his inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him.\" Because Keillor still owned artistic rights and the trademark to the show's name, MPR also announced that it would change the name, which was announced as \"Live from Here\" live on the December 16, 2017 broadcast of the show. MPR also announced it would cease distributing reruns of \"A Prairie Home Companion\" featuring Keillor. Keillor stated he had been \"fired\" from MPR, but he had technically not been employed by MPR / APM since 2002, working instead as an independent contractor.\n\nOn April 13, 2018, Minnesota Public Radio posted a message stating its intent to reinstate the online archives of \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"The Writer's Almanac\": \n\nFrom the show's inception until 1987, its theme song was Hank Snow's hit \"Hello Love\". After 1987, each show has opened with Spencer Williams' composition \"Tishomingo Blues\" as the theme song, with lyrics written especially for \"A Prairie Home Companion\".\n\nMusic is a main feature of the program; the show is a significant outlet for American folk music of many genres, especially country, bluegrass, blues, and gospel, but it also has guest performers from a wide variety of other styles of music, including classical, opera, and music from a number of different countries. The country musician and former record company executive Chet Atkins has appeared on the show many times, as have singer-songwriters Mark Knopfler (lead guitarist and frontman of the bands Dire Straits and the Notting Hillbillies) and Jeff Lang. Folk/gospel duo Robin and Linda Williams have been regular guests since 1976, and often join Keillor and another female performer, often Jearlyn Steele, to form \"The Hopeful Gospel Quartet\". Peter Ostroushko, Greg Brown, Jean Redpath, and Prudence Johnson, among others, were recurring guests on the program between 1974 and 1987. The Wailin' Jennys and Andra Suchy are current recurring guests, and when the show travels, Keillor generally features local musicians and acts.\n\nGreetings from members of the audience to friends and family at home (frequently humorous) are read each week by Keillor just after the show's intermission, at the top of the second hour. Birthdays and anniversaries of famous composers and musicians are also observed.\n\nKeillor and the ensemble performed comedy skits. Notable skits and characters often recur, such as the satirical \"Guy Noir, Private Eye\", which parodied film noir and radio dramas. Guy Noir's popularity was such that the first few notes of the theme or the first lines of the announcer's introduction (\"A dark night in a city that knows how to keep its secrets ...\") often drew applause and cheers from the audience. Also regularly featured were the adventures of Dusty and Lefty, \"The Lives of the Cowboys\".\n\nOne of the show's best-known features was Keillor's \"News from Lake Wobegon\", a weekly storytelling monologue, claiming to be a report from his fictitious hometown of Lake Wobegon, \"the little town that time forgot and the decades cannot improve ... where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average\". The opening words of the monologue usually did not change: \"Well, it's been a quiet week in Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, my hometown, out on the edge of the prairie.\" Keillor often poked fun at central Minnesota's large Scandinavian-American and German-American communities, and many of his fictional characters have names that reflect this. The \"News from Lake Wobegon\" did not have a set structure, but featured recurring characters and places such as the Chatterbox Café, the Sidetrack Tap, Pastor Ingqvist of the Lake Wobegon Lutheran Church and his successor Pastor Liz, Father Emil of Our Lady of Perpetual Responsibility Roman Catholic Church (a parody of Our Mother of Perpetual Help), the Lake Wobegon Whippets sports teams, various members of the Bunsen and Krebsbach families, and an assortment of nearby \"Norwegian bachelor farmers\".\n\nOnce a year the program featured a special \"joke show\", which generally included the Lake Wobegon monologue and musical acts, but with other skits replaced by the performers taking turns telling jokes. Humorists such as Paula Poundstone and Roy Blount Jr. often made guest appearances on those shows, and listeners and audience members were encouraged to submit jokes for use on the air.\n\nIn-jokes are also sprinkled through the show, such as \"Piscacadawadaquoddymoggin\", a made-up word that's been used both for places and for people's names. The components of this made-up word are portions of Native American place names in the New England region of the United States, most of them in Maine (i.e.: Piscataqua, Passamaquoddy, and Androscoggin).\n\nThe show creates fictional advertisements for fictional products, performed in the style of live old-time radio commercials. The show acknowledges its actual underwriters at the beginning, end, and middle (break) of the show.\n\n\"Prairie Home\"s most prominent \"sponsor\" is the fictitious \"Powdermilk Biscuits\". Before he and the band performed the product's jingle every week (\"Has your family tried 'em, Powdermilk?\"), Garrison Keillor would extol Powdermilk's virtues in this way:\n\nAmong its other \"sponsors\", Bebop-A-Reebop Rhubarb Pie (and Frozen Rhubarb Pie Filling) has been prominent, with ads featuring the Bebop-A-Reebop jingle, performed to the tune of \"Shortnin' Bread\": The jingle is usually sung after a bombastic, sound-effect-enhanced tale of woe, and is immediately followed by Keillor asking, \"Wouldn't this be a great time for a piece of rhubarb pie? Yes, nothing gets the taste of shame and humiliation out of your mouth quite like Bebop-A-Reebop Rhubarb Pie.\"\n\nOther prominent \"sponsors\" include Bertha's Kitty Boutique, whose locations in the fictional \"Dales\" shopping centers (\"Roy 'n' Dale, Airedale, Teasdale, Clydesdale, Chippendale, Mondale, and all the other fine shopping centers\") allude to various real people and things, and The Catchup Advisory Board — its name a mashup of the common \"catsup\" and \"ketchup\" spellings—which has the tagline \"Catchup: For the good times.\"\n\nOther \"sponsors\" have included:\n\nIn addition, the recurring segment \"The Lives of the Cowboys\" featured its own Western-themed sponsors, including Prairie Dog Granola Bars (\"healthier than chewing tobacco and you don't have to spit\") and Cowboy Toothpicks (\"the toothpick that's guaranteed not to splinter\").\n\nWhile much of the show is directed toward radio comedy, a portion is usually devoted to some more sentimental and sometimes dark stories put together by Keillor and others. The program occasionally also features political satire. At the beginning of the June 5, 2004, show (broadcast from Meadowbrook Musical Arts Center in Gilford, New Hampshire), Keillor announced that former U.S. President Ronald Reagan had died. A member of the audience hooted and cheered loudly, but Keillor, a staunch Democrat, gave the Republican Reagan a warm tribute in the form of a gospel song. Similarly, in a 2002 show airing the weekend after the death of Senator Paul Wellstone, Keillor changed the format of the show, starting it off with Wellstone's favorite segment, Guy Noir, skipping even the show's theme song.\n\nRegularly appearing actors include Tim Russell (beginning in 1994) and Sue Scott (beginning in 1989). When the show resumed as \"The American Radio Company of the Air\" in November 1989, radio comedian Bob Elliott, half of the longtime radio and comedy television duo Bob and Ray, became a regular cast member. Actor Bill Perry was a member. Walter Bobbie made frequent appearances, as early as 1989, and continuing through 2006-2007. Ivy Austin was a regular contributing comedian (and vocalist) in the early '90s. Prudence Johnson has performed frequently on the show as an actress (and a singer). Mark Benninghofer joined the cast as a substitute actor for a brief time after Russell broke his ankle in February 2009, forcing him to take a month of medical leave. Erica Rhodes has been an occasional guest on the show, beginning in 1996 when she was 10 years old. Serena Brook joined the cast in October 2016 when Chris Thile became host.\n\nTom Keith, also known as Jim Ed Poole, appeared in all of the home-based shows. Keith died on October 30, 2011, at age 64. Fred Newman filled this role in the away shows. Steve Kramer and Leslye Orr have also provided sound effects for the show.\n\nRegular musicians in Guy's All-Star Shoe Band include Richard Dworsky, a composer who appeared weekly as pianist, bandleader, and music director, Gary Raynor on bass and bass guitar, Peter Johnson on percussion, Jevetta Steele on vocals, and Andy Stein on violin, tenor and bass saxophones, and vocals. When the Shoe Band had a horn section, Keillor referred to them as the Shoe Horns.\n\nOther frequent, occasional, former, or one-time musicians on the show include:\n\nProduction staff, who work onstage, offstage, backstage, or behind the scenes, are led by Albert Webster, the show's stage manager, the only staff person who appears in front of large audiences, and who frequently appears onstage during performance, speaking off-air with Keillor or other performers.\n\nReleased on June 9, 2006, \"A Prairie Home Companion\" is a film about \"a dying radio show that bears striking similarities to 'A Prairie Home Companion,'\" with the actual \"APHC\" home venue, the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul chosen to serve \"as set piece, soundstage and framing device\". The film was written by Garrison Keillor and directed by Robert Altman, and shot digitally, with camera by Altman's son, Robert Altman Jr.; the film stars Keillor, Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones, Lily Tomlin, Kevin Kline, John C. Reilly, Lindsay Lohan, Maya Rudolph, Woody Harrelson, Virginia Madsen, and L.Q. Jones. \"APHC\" regular Rich Dworsky appears as the bandleader, and served as the film's pianist, conductor, arranger, and composer. The film depicts the unnamed radio program's behind-the-scenes activities, and the relational dynamics within the cast over its anticipated, imminent cancellation. The antagonist, Axeman, \"who has come to shut the show down\", is played by Tommy Lee Jones. As described in a 2005 on-set piece by David Carr for \"The New York Times\", the film set's atmosphere had The film, which makes no reference to Lake Wobegon, is of feature length, with its financing provided by GreeneStreet Films, River Road Entertainment, and local Minnesota sources. Its award nominations (2006, unless noted) include the Berlin International Film Festival-Golden Bear award for best film, the National Association of Film Critics-Bodil Award for Best American Film, the Film Independent (film association) Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Screenplay, the International Press Academy-Satellite Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay, the Independent Filmmaker Project-Gotham Independent Film Award for Best Ensemble Performance, the Broadcast Film Critics Association-Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Cast, and the Casting Society of America-Artios Award for Best Casting for Feature Film (Comedy); its wins include the Yomiuri Shimbun (film association) Hochi Film Award (2007) for Best Foreign Film. In addition, Meryl Streep was nominated for an International Press Academy-Satellite Awards for Best Supporting Actress (Motion Picture), and won the National Society of Film Critics Awards for the same category.\n\n\n\n\n"}

There are hundreds of companies that operate acting, modeling, and dancing audition websites. Originally, only talent agents were able to provide actors, models, dancers and other performers with audition information. This meant that only performers that were represented by Talent Agents could go on auditions. Today, both open auditions and private auditions can be found on reliable audition websites. Talented performers can browse the World Wide Web and find many different audition websites. The primary organization of professional screen and theater casting in the United States is the Casting Society of America (CSA). Membership to the CSA is optional.\n\nAudition websites are an integral component in the employment statistics of actors and other industry professionals. Most acting assignments are typically short term and range from 1 day to a few months. Many professional actors use either agents or managers to find work, and plan their careers. A talent agent generally earns a percentage of the pay earned by an actor, as specified in the actor’s contract. Other actors rely solely on attending open auditions, found on audition websites, for parts.\n\nSome audition websites require membership and others are free to use. Most all audition websites involve the member regularly browsing audition listings and \"self-submitting\" for auditions. This enables members to choose the types of jobs that they audition for. Other than membership dues, audition websites do not charge other fees or take a percentage of income earned from jobs. Audition websites have grown in popularity and the most visited audition websites have memberships in the millions. A casting director, talent agent, film producer, or movie director can use Audition websites to locate performers for casting. These industry professionals use audition websites to find talent for commercials, music videos, movies, and other entertainment projects.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "588564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=588564", "title": "Authorial intent", "text": "Authorial intent\n\nIn literary theory and aesthetics, authorial intent refers to an author's intent as it is encoded in his or her work. Authorial intentionalism is the view, according to which an author's intentions should constrain the ways in which it is properly interpreted.\n\nNew Criticism, as espoused by Cleanth Brooks, W. K. Wimsatt, T. S. Eliot, and others, argued that authorial intent is irrelevant to understanding a work of literature. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley argue in their essay \"The Intentional Fallacy\" that \"the design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art\". The author, they argue, cannot be reconstructed from a writing—the text is the primary source of meaning, and any details of the author's desires or life are secondary. Wimsatt and Beardsley argue that even details about the work's composition or the author's intended meaning and purpose that might be found in other documents such as journals or letters are \"private or idiosyncratic; not a part of the work as a linguistic fact\" and are thus secondary to the trained reader's rigorous engagement with the text itself.\n\nWimsatt and Beardsley divide the evidence used in making interpretations of poetry (although their analysis can be applied equally well to any type of art) into three categories:\n\n\n\nThus, a text's internal evidence—the words themselves and their meanings—is open for literary analysis. External evidence—anything not contained within the text itself, such as statements made by the poet about the poem that is being interpreted—does not belong to literary criticism. Preoccupation with the authorial intent \"leads away from the poem.\" According to Wimsatt and Beardsley, a poem does not belong to its author but rather \"is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it. The poem belongs to the public.\"\n\nIn psychoanalytic criticism, the author's biography and unconscious state were seen as part of the text, and therefore the author's intent could be revived from a literary text—although the intent might be an unconscious one.\n\nThe Cambridge School of contextualist hermeneutics, a position most elaborated by Quentin Skinner, in the first instances distinguishes linguistic meaning from speech-acts: that is to say, things which the performance of an utterance \"does\". Consider the following. Typically, the ceremony of marriage concludes upon the exchange of the utterance \"I do\". In such a case, to utter \"I do\" is not merely to report an internal disposition, but to perform an action, namely, to \"get\" married. The intended force of \"I do\" in such a circumstance is only ever retrievable through understanding something about the complex social activity of marriage. Indeed, to understand a speech-act is to understand what conventions are regulating its significance. Since actions are always publicly legible—they are done by the speech itself—this presupposes no knowledge about the author's mental states. The task is always thus: with as much contextual information as possible, can we establish which conventions a text was interacting with, and by inference to the best explanation, what the author's intent was.\n\nIn post-structuralism, there are a variety of approaches to authorial intent. For some of the theorists deriving from Jacques Lacan, and in particular theories variously called \"écriture féminine\", gender and sex predetermine the ways that texts will emerge, and the language of textuality itself will present an argument that is potentially counter to the author's conscious intent.\n\nFor Marxist literary theorists, the author's intent is always a code for a particular set of ideologies in the author's own day. For Marxists (especially those of the Soviet realism type), authorial intent is manifest in the text and must be placed in a context of liberation and the materialist dialectic. However, Marxist-derived theorists have seen authorial intent in a much more nuanced way. Raymond Williams, for example, posits literary productions always within a context of emerging, resistant, and synthetic ideological positions. The author's intent is recoverable from the text, but there are always encoded within it several separate positions. The author might be arguing consciously for empire, but hidden within that argument will be a response to a counterargument and a presentation of an emerging synthesis. Some members of the reception theory group (Hans Robert Jauss, in particular) have approximated the Marxist view by arguing that the forces of cultural reception reveal the ideological positions of both author and readership.\n\nReader response critics view the authorial intent variously. In general, they have argued that the author's intent itself is immaterial and cannot be fully recovered. However, the author's intent will shape the text and limit the possible interpretations of a work. The reader's \"impression\" of the author's intent is a working force in interpretation, but the author's actual intent is not.\n\nWeak intentionalism combines intentionalism with insights from reader response. Mark Bevir in \"The Logic of the History of Ideas\" sees meanings as necessarily intentional but suggests that the relevant intentions can be those of readers as well as those of authors. Weak intentionalists privilege intentionality to emphasize that texts do not have meanings in themselves. They believe that meanings are always meanings for people—albeit the relevant people, whether authors or readers.\n\nAuthorial intention is of great practical concern to some textual critics. These are known as intentionalists and are identified with the Bowers-Tanselle school of thought. Their editions have as one of their most important goals the recovery of the author's intentions (generally final intentions). When preparing a work for the press, an editor working along the principles outlined by Fredson Bowers and G. Thomas Tanselle will attempt to construct a text that is close to the author's final intentions. For transcription and typesetting, authorial intentionality can be considered paramount.\n\nAn intentionalist editor would constantly investigate the documents for traces of authorial intention. On one hand, it can be argued that the author always intends whatever the author writes and that at different points in time the same author might have very different intentions. On the other hand, an author may in some cases write something he or she did not intend. For example, an intentionalist would consider for emendation the following cases:\n\n\nIn cases such as these where the author is living, they would be questioned by the editor who would then adhere to the intention expressed. In cases where the author is deceased, an intentionalist would attempt to approach authorial intention. The strongest voices countering an emphasis on authorial intent in scholarly editing have been D. F. McKenzie and Jerome McGann, proponents of a model that accounts for the \"social text,\" tracing material transformations and embodiments of works while not privileging one version over another.\n\n"}

This is an old tradition, well illustrated in works such as Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Voltaire's \"Candide\".\n\nThis theme was commonly used by British comedy troupe, Monty Python. In their sketches, a \"common comedic device was for authority figures (such as military officers, police, judges, Conservative politicians, BBC news announcers and even God) to take their characters to extremes by suddenly spouting complete nonsense\".\n\nExamples include: \n\nSome television shows, such as \"South Park\" and \"The Simpsons\", have a collection of characters that represent all of the main groups of authority figures, and each portray such figures as humorously flawed. Indeed, each show has a resident police officer — Officer Barbrady and Chief Wiggum, respectively — portrayed as an incompetent and bumbling idiot. The shows also mockingly portray their resident religious leader — Priest Maxi in \"South Park\" and Reverend Timothy Lovejoy in \"The Simpsons\". The shows also include, with slightly different characteristics, the flawed exercise of authority by parents, teachers, school principals, mayors, and occasionally of soldiers and politicians.\n\nExamples can also be found in the art of the Russian joke.\n"}

{"id": "339806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=339806", "title": "Burlesque", "text": "Burlesque\n\nA burlesque is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects. The word derives from the Italian ', which, in turn, is derived from the Italian ' – a joke, ridicule or mockery.\n\nBurlesque overlaps in meaning with caricature, parody and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with extravaganza, as presented during the Victorian era. \"Burlesque\" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. It has been applied retrospectively to works of Chaucer and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics. Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are Alexander Pope's \"The Rape of the Lock\" and Samuel Butler's \"Hudibras\". An example of musical burlesque is Richard Strauss's 1890 Burleske for piano and orchestra. Examples of theatrical burlesques include W. S. Gilbert's \"Robert the Devil\" and the A. C. Torr – Meyer Lutz shows, including \"Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué\".\n\nA later use of the term, particularly in the United States, refers to performances in a variety show format. These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s, often in cabarets and clubs, as well as theatres, and featured bawdy comedy and female striptease. Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s, or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films, such as 1972's \"Cabaret\" and 1979's \"All That Jazz\", among others. There has been a resurgence of interest in this format since the 1990s.\n\nThe word first appears in a title in Francesco Berni's \"Opere burlesche\" of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as \"poesie bernesca\" in his honour. 'Burlesque' as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic. Shakespeare's Pyramus and Thisbe scene in \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher's \"The Knight of the Burning Pestle\" were early examples of such imitation.\n\nIn 17th century Spain, playwright and poet Miguel de Cervantes ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes' works are \"Exemplary Novels\" and the \"Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes\" published in 1615. The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of Chaucer and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.\n\nBurlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with \"pastiche\", \"parody\", and the 17th and 18th century genre of the \"mock-heroic\". Burlesque depended on the reader's (or listener's) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted.\n\n17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: High burlesque refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary parody and the mock-heroic. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is Alexander Pope's \"sly, knowing and courtly\" \"The Rape of the Lock\". Low burlesque applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is Samuel Butler's poem \"Hudibras\", which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric doggerel verse, using a colloquial idiom. Butler's addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into satire.\n\nIn more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in revues and sketches. Tom Stoppard's 1974 play \"Travesties\" is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition.\n\nBeginning in the early 18th century, the term burlesque was used throughout Europe to describe musical works in which serious and comic elements were juxtaposed or combined to achieve a grotesque effect. As derived from literature and theatre, \"burlesque\" was used, and is still used, in music to indicate a bright or high-spirited mood, sometimes in contrast to seriousness.\n\nIn this sense of farce and exaggeration rather than parody, it appears frequently on the German-language stage between the middle of the 19th century and the 1920s. Burlesque operettas were written by Johann Strauss II (\"Die lustigen Weiber von Wien\", 1868), Ziehrer (\"Mahomed's Paradies\",1866; \"Das Orakel zu Delfi\", 1872; \"Cleopatra, oder Durch drei Jahrtausende\", 1875; \"In fünfzig Jahren\", 1911) and Bruno Granichstaedten (\"Casimirs Himmelfahrt\", 1911). French references to burlesque are less common than German, though Grétry composed for a \"drame burlesque\" (\"Matroco\", 1777). Stravinsky called his 1916 one-act chamber opera-ballet \"Renard\" (\"The Fox\") a \"Histoire burlesque chantée et jouée\" (\"burlesque tale sung and played\") and his 1911 ballet \"Petrushka\" a \"burlesque in four scenes\". A later example is the 1927 burlesque operetta by Ernst Krenek entitled \"Schwergewicht\" (\"Heavyweight\") (1927).\n\nSome orchestral and chamber works have also been designated as burlesques, of which two early examples are the Ouverture-Suite \"Burlesque de Quixotte\", TWV 55, by Telemann and the Sinfonia Burlesca by Leopold Mozart (1760). Another often-performed piece is Richard Strauss's 1890 Burleske for piano and orchestra. Other examples include the following:\n\nBurlesque can be used to describe particular movements of instrumental musical compositions, often involving dance rhythms. Examples are the Burlesca, in Partita No. 3 for keyboard (BWV 827) by Bach, the \"Rondo-Burleske\" third movement of Symphony No. 9 by Mahler, and the \"Burlesque\" fourth movement of Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1.\n\nThe use of burlesque has not been confined to classical music. Well known ragtime travesties include \"The Russian Rag\", by George L. Cobb, which is based on Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, and Harry Alford's \"Lucy's Sextette\" based on the sextet, 'Chi mi frena in tal momento?', from \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" by Donizetti.\n\nVictorian burlesque, sometimes known as \"travesty\" or \"extravaganza\", was popular in London theatres between the 1830s and the 1890s. It took the form of musical theatre parody in which a well-known opera, play or ballet was adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, often risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and quoting or pastiching text or music from the original work. The comedy often stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the modern activities portrayed by the actors. Madame Vestris produced burlesques at the Olympic Theatre beginning in 1831 with \"Olympic Revels\" by J. R. Planché. Other authors of burlesques included H. J. Byron, G. R. Sims, F. C. Burnand, W. S. Gilbert and Fred Leslie.\n\nVictorian burlesque related to and in part derived from traditional English pantomime \"with the addition of gags and 'turns'.\" In the early burlesques, following the example of ballad opera, the words of the songs were written to popular music; later burlesques mixed the music of opera, operetta, music hall and revue, and some of the more ambitious shows had original music composed for them. This English style of burlesque was successfully introduced to New York in the 1840s.\nSome of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera. The dialogue was generally written in rhyming couplets, liberally peppered with bad puns. A typical example from a burlesque of \"Macbeth\": Macbeth and Banquo enter under an umbrella, and the witches greet them with \"Hail! hail! hail!\" Macbeth asks Banquo, \"What mean these salutations, noble thane?\" and is told, \"These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'\". A staple of burlesque was the display of attractive women in travesty roles, dressed in tights to show off their legs, but the plays themselves were seldom more than modestly risqué.\nBurlesque became the speciality of certain London theatres, including the Gaiety and Royal Strand Theatre from the 1860s to the early 1890s. Until the 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using pastiches and parodies of popular songs, opera arias and other music that the audience would readily recognize. The house stars included Nellie Farren, John D'Auban, Edward Terry and Fred Leslie. From about 1880, Victorian burlesques grew longer, until they were a whole evening's entertainment rather than part of a double- or triple-bill. In the early 1890s, these burlesques went out of fashion in London, and the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new more wholesome but less literary genre of Edwardian musical comedy.\n\nAmerican burlesque shows were originally an offshoot of Victorian burlesque. The English genre had been successfully staged in New York from the 1840s, and it was popularised by a visiting British burlesque troupe, Lydia Thompson and the \"British Blondes\", beginning in 1868. New York burlesque shows soon incorporated elements and the structure of the popular minstrel shows. They consisted of three parts: first, songs and ribald comic sketches by low comedians; second, assorted olios and male acts, such as acrobats, magicians and solo singers; and third, chorus numbers and sometimes a burlesque in the English style on politics or a current play. The entertainment was usually concluded by an exotic dancer or a wrestling or boxing match.\n\nWhile burlesque went out of fashion in England towards the end of the 19th century, to be replaced by Edwardian musical comedy, the American style of burlesque flourished, but with increasing focus on female nudity. Exotic \"cooch\" dances were brought in, ostensibly Syrian in origin. The entertainments were given in clubs and cabarets, as well as music halls and theatres. By the early 20th century, there were two national circuits of burlesque shows competing with the vaudeville circuit, as well as resident companies in New York, such as Minsky's at the Winter Garden.\nThe transition from burlesque on the old lines to striptease was gradual. At first, soubrettes showed off their figures while singing and dancing; some were less active but compensated by appearing in elaborate stage costumes. The strippers gradually supplanted the singing and dancing soubrettes; by 1932 there were at least 150 strip principals in the US. Star strippers included Sally Rand, Gypsy Rose Lee, Tempest Storm, Lili St. Cyr, Blaze Starr, Ann Corio and Margie Hart, who was celebrated enough to be mentioned in song lyrics by Lorenz Hart and Cole Porter. By the late 1930s, burlesque shows would have up to six strippers supported by one or two comics and a master of ceremonies. Comics who appeared in burlesque early in their careers included Fanny Brice, Mae West, Eddie Cantor, Abbott and Costello, W. C. Fields, Jackie Gleason, Danny Thomas, Al Jolson, Bert Lahr, Phil Silvers, Sid Caesar, Danny Kaye, Red Skelton and Sophie Tucker.\nThe uninhibited atmosphere of burlesque establishments owed much to the free flow of alcoholic liquor, and the enforcement of Prohibition was a serious blow. In New York, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia clamped down on burlesque, effectively putting it out of business by the early 1940s. It lingered on elsewhere in the U.S., increasingly neglected, and by the 1970s, with nudity commonplace in theatres, reached \"its final shabby demise.\" Both during its declining years and afterwards there have been films that sought to capture American burlesque, including \"Lady of Burlesque\" (1943), \"Striporama\" (1953), and \"The Night They Raided Minsky's\" (1968).\nIn recent decades, there has been a revival of burlesque, sometimes called Neo-Burlesque, on both sides of the Atlantic. A new generation, nostalgic for the spectacle and perceived glamour of the classic American burlesque, developed a cult following for the art in the early 1990s at Billie Madley's \"Cinema\" and later at the \"Dutch Weismann's Follies\" revues in New York City, \"The Velvet Hammer\" troupe in Los Angeles and The Shim-Shamettes in New Orleans. Ivan Kane's Royal Jelly Burlesque Nightclub at Revel Atlantic City opened in 2012. Notable Neo-burlesque performers include Dita Von Teese, and Julie Atlas Muz and Agitprop groups like Cabaret Red Light incorporated political satire and performance art into their burlesque shows. Annual conventions such as the Vancouver International Burlesque Festival and the Miss Exotic World Pageant are held.\n\n\n\n"}

The series deals with solved or cold criminal cases, often related to well-known murders and serial crimes. Many early episodes relate to Australian cases (e.g. Port Arthur or the Snowtown murders), although notable crimes from the UK and the USA are increasingly featured, and cases from Canada, France, Guyana, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, and Ukraine have also been included. Unlike a number of similar podcasts, the series is scripted and narrative, relying primarily on original police or mass-media documents, eyewitness accounts, and interview or public announcement recordings. Larger and more-complex cases, such as The Yorkshire Ripper, The Moors Murders, and The East Area Rapist, have received multiple-week serialised broadcasts, and case updates to previously aired cases are also provided from time to time. The series has been well received, and has won a number of awards since its debut, including Best of 2016 (iTunes).\n\nThe podcast first aired on 9 January 2016 and was conceived by an anonymous Australian host who started producing the show in 2015 in his spare room. The host had just had surgery and was listening to a lot of podcasts and true-crime shows (e.g. \"The Joe Rogan Experience\", \"Hardcore History\", \"Serial\" and \"Making A Murderer)\" at the time, and was encouraged by Joe Rogan to make his own based on in-depth research and a storytelling style. According to one source, the host remains anonymous because \"he wants the stories, facts, and questions speak for themselves\" and \"It makes the show about the stories and that's it.\" According to another review, the podcast's:deliberately sparse production value became its strongest asset, plunging listeners into a pool of ambient silence with a host neither named nor contextualized. ... the podcast does not go the typical route of parading listeners through a montage of primary source material like evening news reports or interviews with now-wizened investigators; instead, the stories are unfolded slowly and methodically by the anonymous host, with just enough editorializing to make it feel like a friend or a witness is relaying the tale.In its current format, the 2018 \"Casefile\" team now consists of two researcher/writers, two composers, a designer, and the host/narrator. It has also had a producer, Mike Migas, “since about episode 7”, which led to episodes 1–6 being reworked. Researchers have also travelled internationally to access primary resources in some cases, such as former researcher and co-writer Anna Priestland, who travelled from Melbourne to visit the national archives in Kew in 2017 to examine police files on Myra Hindley. A number of the more recent international cases have also been written and researched by the Australian author Eileen Ormsby. \n\nEach case includes a corresponding page on the podcast's official homepage, which details information such as special thank yous, official support phone numbers and websites (for Australia, the UK, the US, Canada and New Zealand), other credits, and resources (such as books, websites, videos, documents, articles, maps, wanted posters, and suspect sketches), as in this example. Warnings are regularly given at the start of podcasts due to the graphic content. It is available via numerous sites. One episode, Case 55 (Simone Strobel, released 15 July 2017), has been removed due to legal issues, although general details of the case itself are publicly available.\n\nAlong with the recent rise in true crime podcasting, as seen in Serial or S-Town, the series has been reviewed positively by several sources:\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" (22 July 2016):As \"Casefile\" points out in their tagline, fact is scarier than fiction. But what the podcast might really prove is that fact is \"even scarier\" when told in a thick Australian accent – especially when accompanied by ambient, pulsing noise from a trio of professional sound designers and musicians. In each weekly episode, which can run anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half, the narrator... calmly tells a story of a devastating Australian crime. The podcast expertly covers murder and abduction, sometimes walking the listener through the criminal's trial, and other times discussing potential theories for a crime whose perpetrator was never caught.\"Evening Standard\" (28 March 2017):The Australian-made show, which launched in January last year, has regularly featured in the UK’s top 10 podcasts on iTunes in recent months. It also regularly reaches the top 50 in the US chart, rising as high as fourth last July. ... Its mini-series on Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe received 5.8 million downloads — the most for a single case since the launch. Its most popular single episode was on British tourist Peter Falconio ... [which] has more than 4.2 million downloads. A series covering the Moors Murders ... had more than a million downloads in four days.Download statistics by iTunesChart.net state that Casefile has charted in the top 100 in 4 regions, with peak ranking positions of the podcast including: Australia (1), Canada (9), United Kingdom (14), and United States (7).

{"id": "5215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5215", "title": "Casino", "text": "Casino\n\nA casino is a facility which houses and accommodates certain types of gambling activities. The industry that deals in casinos is called the gaming industry. Casinos are most commonly built near or combined with hotels, restaurants, retail shopping, cruise ships or other tourist attractions. There is much debate over whether the social and economic consequences of casino gambling outweigh the initial revenue that may be generated. Some casinos are also known for hosting live entertainment events, such as stand-up comedy, concerts, and sporting events.\n\nThe term \"casino\" is a confusing linguistic false friend for translators.\n\n\"Casino\" is of Italian origin; the root \"casa\" means a house. The term casino may mean a small country villa, summerhouse, or social club. During the 19th century, the term \"casino\" came to include other public buildings where pleasurable activities took place; such edifices were usually built on the grounds of a larger Italian villa or palazzo, and were used to host civic town functions, including dancing, gambling, music listening, and sports; examples in Italy include Villa Farnese and Villa Giulia, and in the US the Newport Casino in Newport, Rhode Island. In modern-day Italian a \"casino\" is either a brothel (also called \"casa chiusa\", literally \"closed house\"), a mess, or a noisy environment, while a gaming house is spelt \"casinò\", with an accent.\n\nNot all casinos were used for gaming. The Catalina Casino, a famous landmark overlooking Avalon Harbor on Santa Catalina Island, California, has never been used for traditional games of chance, which were already outlawed in California by the time it was built. The Copenhagen Casino was a theatre, known for the mass public meetings often held in its hall during the 1848 Revolution, which made Denmark a constitutional monarchy. Until 1937, it was a well-known Danish theatre. The Hanko Casino in Hanko, Finland—one of that town's most conspicuous landmarks—was never used for gambling. Rather, it was a banquet hall for the Russian nobility which frequented this spa resort in the late 19th century and is now used as a restaurant.\n\nIn military and non-military usage in German and Spanish, a \"casino\" or \"kasino\" is an officers' mess.\n\nThe precise origin of gambling is unknown. It is generally believed that gambling in some form or another has been seen in almost every society in history. From the Ancient Greeks and Romans to Napoleon's France and Elizabethan England, much of history is filled with stories of entertainment based on games of chance.\n\nThe first known European gambling house, not called a casino although meeting the modern definition, was the Ridotto, established in Venice, Italy in 1638 by the Great Council of Venice to provide controlled gambling during the carnival season. It was closed in 1774 as the city government felt it was impoverishing the local gentry.\n\nIn American history, early gambling establishments were known as saloons. The creation and importance of saloons was greatly influenced by four major cities: New Orleans, St. Louis, Chicago and San Francisco. It was in the saloons that travelers could find people to talk to, drink with, and often gamble with. During the early 20th century in America, gambling became outlawed and banned by state legislation and social reformers of the time. However, in 1931, gambling was legalized throughout the state of Nevada. America's first legalized casinos were set up in those places. In 1976 New Jersey allowed gambling in Atlantic City, now America's second largest gambling city.\n\nMost jurisdictions worldwide have a minimum gambling age (16 to 21 years of age in most countries which permit the operation of casinos).\n\nCustomers gamble by playing games of chance, in some cases with an element of skill, such as craps, roulette, baccarat, blackjack, and video poker. Most games played have mathematically determined odds that ensure the house has at all times an overall advantage over the players. This can be expressed more precisely by the notion of expected value, which is uniformly negative (from the player's perspective). This advantage is called the \"house edge\". In games such as poker where players play against each other, the house takes a commission called the rake. Casinos sometimes give out complimentary items or comps to gamblers.\n\n\"Payout\" is the percentage of funds (\"winnings\") returned to players.\n\nCasinos in the United States say that a player staking money won from the casino is \"playing with the house's money\".\n\nVideo Lottery Machines (slot machines) have become one of the most popular forms of gambling in casinos. investigative reports have started calling into question whether the modern-day slot-machine is addictive.\nCasino design—regarded as a psychological exercise—is an intricate process that involves optimising floor plan, décor and atmospherics to encourage gambling.\n\nFactors influencing gambling tendencies include sound, odour and lighting. Natasha Dow Schüll, an anthropologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, highlights the decision of the audio directors at Silicon Gaming to make its slot machines resonate in \"the universally pleasant tone of C, sampling existing casino soundscapes to create a sound that would please but not clash\".\n\nDr Alan Hirsch, founder of the Smell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago, studied the impact of certain scents on gamblers, discerning that a pleasant albeit unidentifiable odour released by Las Vegas slot machines generated about 50% more in daily revenue. He suggested that the scent acted as an aphrodisiac, causing a more aggressive form of gambling.\n\nCasino designer Roger Thomas is credited with implementing a successful, disruptive design for the Las Vegas Wynn Resorts casinos in 2008. He broke casino design convention by introducing natural sunlight and flora to appeal to women. Thomas put in skylights and antique clocks, defying the commonplace notion that a casino should be a timeless space.\n\nThe following lists major casino markets in the world with casino revenue of over US$1 billion as published in PricewaterhouseCoopers's report on \nthe outlook for the global casino market:\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, accumulated revenue of the biggest casino operator companies worldwide amounted almost US$55 billion in 2011. SJM Holdings Ltd. was the leading company in this field, and earned $9.7 billion in 2011, followed by Las Vegas Sands Corp. ($7.4 bn). The third-biggest casino operator company (based on revenue) was Caesars Entertainment, with revenue of US$6.2 bn.\n\nWhile there are casinos in many places, a few places have become well known specifically for gambling. Perhaps the place almost defined by its casino is Monte Carlo, but other places are known as gambling centers.\n\nMonte Carlo Casino, located in Monte Carlo city, in Monaco, is a famous casino and a tourist attraction popular with well-off visitors. The casino is mentioned in the song The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo as well as the film of the same name.\n\nMonte Carlo Casino has been depicted in many books, including Ben Mezrich's \"Busting Vegas\", where a group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology students beat the casino out of nearly $1 million. This book is based on real people and events; however, many of those events are contested by main character Semyon Dukach. Monte Carlo Casino has also been featured in multiple James Bond novels and films.\n\nCasinò di Campione is located in the tiny Italian enclave of Campione d'Italia, within Ticino, Switzerland. The casino was founded in 1917 as a site to gather information from foreign diplomats during the First World War. Today it is owned by the Italian government, and operated by the municipality. With gambling laws being less strict than in Italy and Switzerland, it is among most popular gambling destination besides Monte Carlo. The income from the casino is sufficient for the operation of Campione without the imposition of taxes, or obtaining of other revenue. In 2007, the casino moved into new premises of more than , making it the largest casino in Europe. The new casino was built alongside the old one, which dated from 1933 and has since been demolished.\n\nThe former Portuguese colony of Macau, a special administrative region of China since 1999, is a popular destination for visitors who wish to gamble. This started in Portuguese times, when Macau was popular with visitors from nearby British Hong Kong, where gambling was more closely regulated. The Venetian Macao is currently the largest casino in the world. Macau also surpassed Las Vegas as the largest gambling market in the world.\n\nThe Casino Estoril, located in the municipality of Cascais, on the Portuguese Riviera, near Lisbon, is the largest casino in Europe by capacity.\n\nDuring the Second World War, it was reputed to be a gathering point for spies, dispossessed royals, and wartime adventurers; it became an inspiration for Ian Fleming's James Bond 007 novel \"Casino Royale\".\n\nSingapore is an up-and-coming destination for visitors wanting to gamble, although there are currently only two casinos (both foreign owned), in Singapore. The Marina Bay Sands is the most expensive standalone casino in the world, at a price of US$8 billion, and is among the world's ten most expensive buildings. The Resorts World Sentosa has the world's largest oceanarium.\n\nWith currently over 1,000 casinos, the United States has the largest number of casinos in the world. The number continues to grow steadily as more states seek to legalize casinos. 40 states now have some form of casino gambling. Relatively small places such as Las Vegas are best known for gambling; larger cities such as Chicago are not defined by their casinos in spite of the large turnover.\n\nThe Las Vegas Valley has the largest concentration of casinos in the United States. Based on revenue, Atlantic City, New Jersey ranks second, and the Chicago region third.\n\nTop American casino markets by revenue (2015 annual revenues):\n\n\nThe Nevada Gaming Control Board divides Clark County, which is coextensive with the Las Vegas metropolitan area, into seven market regions for reporting purposes.\n\nNative American gaming has been responsible for a rise in the number of casinos outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City.\n\nGiven the large amounts of currency handled within a casino, both patrons and staff may be tempted to cheat and steal, in collusion or independently; most casinos have security measures to prevent this. Security cameras located throughout the casino are the most basic measure.\n\nModern casino security is usually divided between a physical security force and a specialized surveillance department. The physical security force usually patrols the casino and responds to calls for assistance and reports of suspicious or definite criminal activity. A specialized surveillance department operates the casino's closed circuit television system, known in the industry as the eye in the sky. Both of these specialized casino security departments work very closely with each other to ensure the safety of both guests and the casino's assets, and have been quite successful in preventing crime. Some casinos also have catwalks in the ceiling above the casino floor, which allow surveillance personnel to look directly down, through one way glass, on the activities at the tables and slot machines.\n\nWhen it opened in 1989, The Mirage was the first casino to use cameras full-time on all table games.\n\nIn addition to cameras and other technological measures, casinos also enforce security through rules of conduct and behavior; for example, players at card games are required to keep the cards they are holding in their hands visible at all times.\n\nOver the past few decades, casinos have developed many different marketing techniques for attracting and maintaining loyal patrons. Many casinos use a loyalty rewards program used to track players' spending habits and target their patrons more effectively, by sending mailings with free slot play and other promotions.\n\nCasinos have been linked to organised crime, with early casinos in Las Vegas originally dominated by the American Mafia and in Macau by Triad syndicates.\n\nAccording to some police reports, incidences of reported crime often double and triple in communities within three years of a casino opening. In a 2004 report by the US Department of Justice, researchers interviewed people who had been arrested in Las Vegas and Des Moines and found that the percentage of problem or pathological gamblers among the arrestees was three to five times higher than in the general population.\n\nIt has been said that economic studies that show a positive relationship between casinos and crime usually fail to consider the visiting population at risk when they calculate the crime rate in casino areas. Such studies thus count the crimes committed by visitors, but do not count visitors in the population measure, and this overstates the crime rates in casino areas. Part of the reason this methodology is used, despite it leading to an overstatement of crime rates is that reliable data on tourist count are often not available.\n\nThere has been some research into occupational health issues in the casino industry. Particular issues that have been reported on include alcohol abuse, second-hand tobacco smoke, and some musculo-skeletal problems associated with card-dealing.\n\n"}
{"id": "386112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=386112", "title": "Charles Ingram", "text": "Charles Ingram\n\nCharles William Ingram (born 1963) is an English former British Army major who became known for cheating on the television game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" in 2001, after winning the maximum prize of a million pounds. Following a lengthy trial at Southwark Crown Court, he was convicted on a single count of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception. In 2003, he was convicted of an unrelated insurance fraud, and ordered to resign his commission as a major by the Army Board.\n\nIngram is married to Diana Ingram, and has since participated in other television shows, including \"The Weakest Link\", \"Wife Swap\", \"Hell's Kitchen\", and on \"Big Brother's Big Mouth\".\nIn 1986, he trained for the Army at Sandhurst and was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Engineers. He was promoted to the rank of captain in 1990 and major in 1995, and in 1999, he served in Bosnia for six months on NATO peacekeeping duties.\nHe was forced to resign from the Army in August 2003.\n\nSince leaving the Army, Ingram has written two novels: \"The Network\", published on 27 April 2006, and \"Deep Siege\", published on 8 October 2007.\n\nOn 9 and 10 September 2001, Ingram was a contestant on the television game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\". His wife Diana Ingram and her brother Adrian Pollock had previously been contestants on the show, both winning £32,000. The show, presented by Chris Tarrant, was one of the highest-rated in the United Kingdom at its peak in 1999; one edition was watched by 19 million viewers, a third of the British population.\n\nBy the time recording ended on the first day, Ingram had reached £4,000 and used two of his three \"lifelines\". The production team doubted he would proceed much further when recording resumed, but he went on to win the top prize of £1 million. Ingram flipped between answers erratically, appearing to settle on one answer before suddenly moving to another. For example, when asked who recorded the 2000 Craig David album \"Born to Do It\", Ingram said he had \"never heard of\" David and appeared to go for a different option before moving to the correct answer.\n\nThe show's production company Celador suspended the £1 million payout after they suspected Ingram had cheated. Production staff accused Ingram and his wife of defrauding the show by having an accomplice in the audience, lecturer Tecwen Whittock, cough when Ingram read out a correct answer.\n\nTarrant, who drank champagne with the Ingrams in their dressing room, said he was convinced that Ingram was genuine when he signed the £1 million cheque: \"If I thought there was anything wrong, I certainly would not have signed it.\" When asked whether the atmosphere in the dressing room was tense after the show, Tarrant replied: \"No, not at all. They seemed as normal as people who have just won a million pounds would be in the situation.\" However, he said that on his way to the dressing room, \"I had been told there had been quite an unpleasant exchange.\" A member of the crew, Eve Winstanley, testified in court that Ingram seemed \"very unhappy\" for someone who had just won a million pounds.\n\nCelador employees produced and reviewed various compilation tapes before and after contacting the police. Celador and their editing company, Editworks, retained all the tapes during the case and reproduced all tapes for the court.\n\nIn court, Paul Smith of Celador Productions confirmed that his company had previously produced a television programme involving witnesses in the case, for broadcast on ITV after the trial. The program, \"Tonight With Trevor McDonald – Major Fraud\", was broadcast on ITV a month after the trial, and credited with over 17 million viewers. Two weeks later, the day after \"Major Fraud\" aired in the US, the same channel broadcast another programme on the same topic, entitled \"The Final Answer\", which was credited with over 5 million viewers.\n\nFollowing a trial at Southwark Crown Court lasting four weeks (including jury deliberation for three-and-a-half days), which ended soon after a jury member was evicted for discussing the case in public, Charles and Diana Ingram and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of \"procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception\" on 7 April 2003. Both the Ingrams and Whittock were each given prison sentences suspended for two years (the Ingrams were sentenced to 18 months and Whittock was sentenced to 12 months), each fined £15,000, and each ordered to pay £10,000 towards prosecution costs. Within two months of the verdict and sentence, the trial judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs: Charles Ingram £40,000 and Diana Ingram £25,000. Altogether with legal fees, the Ingrams had to pay £115,000.\n\nOn 19 August 2003, the Army Board ordered Ingram to resign his commission as a major, after 17 years of service, but stated that this would not affect his pension entitlements.\n\nOn 19 May 2004, the Court of Appeal denied Ingram leave to appeal against his conviction and upheld his sentence, but agreed to quash his wife's fine and prosecution costs. On 5 October 2004, the House of Lords denied Ingram his leave to appeal against his fine and prosecution costs, and he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. On 20 October 2004, the original trial judge reduced Ingram's defence costs order to £25,000 and Diana Ingram's defence costs order to £5,000.\n\nIn 2006, journalist Jon Ronson, who covered the case at the time for the \"Guardian\", wrote that he believed the Ingrams might be innocent. Ronson had observed that when the word \"cough\" was mentioned during the trial, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. James Plaskett, who had won £250,000 on \"Millionaire\" and had been in the audience three times, argued that this was an example of coughs being caused by unconscious triggers; Tecwen had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Plaskett argued that Tecwen had audibly said \"no\" in response to an incorrect option in the same way that many audience members whisper \"no\" to each other.\n\nA book covering the case, \"Bad Show: The Quiz, The Cough, The Millionaire Major\" by Bob Woffinden and James Plaskett was published in January 2015.\n\nCharles Ingram's fine and court costs, totalling £25,000, were later reduced to £5,000 on appeal.\n\n\"Quiz\", a play written by James Graham that re-examines the events and subsequent conviction of the Ingrams and Whittock, opened at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester, on 3 November 2017, running until 9 December 2017. The play transferred to the West End—playing at the Noël Coward Theatre from 31 March 2018 to 16 June 2018.\n\nIn court, Ingram claimed the video tape was \"unrepresentative of what I heard\", and he continues to assert that it was \"unfairly manipulated\". A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and for the \"benefit of the jury\" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither \"listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing\". The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time after the correct answer had been spoken. Chris Tarrant also denied hearing any coughing in court, claiming he was too busy to notice.\n\nLarry Whitehurst, another contestant who has appeared on the show as a Fastest Finger First contestant on four occasions, was adamant that he had known the answers to Ingram's questions. He told the court that he had been able to detect a pattern of coughing, and that he was entirely convinced that coughing had helped Ingram.\n\nWhittock claims to have suffered a persistent cough for his entire life and insisted that he had a genuine cough caused by a combination of hay fever and a dust allergy, and that it was only coincidence that his throat problem coincided with the right answer. During the trial, however, the jury heard evidence that once Whittock himself earned the right to sit in the hot seat, his throat problems disappeared. Whittock later testified that he drank several glasses of water before he went in front of the cameras. Whittock also insisted that he had not known the answers to three of the questions he allegedly helped with. However, the police found the answer to question number 12, regarding the artist who painted \"The Ambassadors\", in a hand-written general knowledge book at his home.\n\nDavies, the floor manager, said that, as soon as the coughing came to his notice during the recording, he decided to find out who was responsible. \"The loudest coughing was coming from Tecwen in seat number three\", he said. \"He was talking to the person to his left when I was observing him, and then he turned towards the set and the hot seat to cough.\" Whittock remarked during the trial that \"you do not cough into someone's face\".\n\nDuring the trial, Whittock portrayed himself as a \"serial quiz show loser\" because he had been eliminated in round one of \"15 to 1\" and had only won an atlas on his appearance on \"Sale of the Century\".\n\nIn late 2003, the Ingrams were again in court, charged with further fraud offences. On 28 October, Charles Ingram was found guilty at Bournemouth Crown Court of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception, and of a second charge of deception, having attempted to claim on an insurance policy after an alleged burglary at his home. Ingram had failed to tell Direct Line Insurance about claims he had made in the three years before he took out the policy in July 2001. The court was told that Ingram had been a \"habitual claimant\" with Norwich Union after suffering \"unfortunate\" losses of private possessions.\n\nChristopher Parker, prosecuting, said Ingram switched insurers to Zurich in 1997, after Norwich Union reduced a burglary claim from £19,000 to £9,000, and in 2000 switched again to Direct Line. \"He has been ineluctably dishonest,\" Mr Parker said. \"He went to Direct Line and didn't make a disclosure about his claims history because he knew he wouldn't have been insured. It might not have started off as the most monstrous piece of villainy but these things tend to snowball and it all came to a sticky end when he claimed for £30,000.\" Staff at Direct Line were already \"suspicious\" about Ingram's £30,000 burglary claim but decided to investigate only after reading newspaper coverage about his questionable win on the game show.\n\nIngram was given a conditional discharge on the charge of fraudulently claiming £30,000 on insurance. The judge told Ingram he took into account \"the punishment you have brought upon yourself and your dire financial state\", and he rejected an alternative option of a community service order after Ingram told a probation officer he feared other criminals would bully him.\n\n"}
{"id": "1460069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1460069", "title": "Clip show", "text": "Clip show\n\nA clip show is an episode of a television series that consists primarily of excerpts from previous episodes. Most clip shows feature the format of a frame story in which cast members recall past events from past installments of the show, depicted with a clip of the event presented as a flashback. Clip shows are also known as cheaters, particularly in the field of animation. Clip shows are often played before series finales, or once syndication becomes highly likely. Other times, however, clip shows are simply produced for budgetary reasons (i.e. to avoid additional costs from shooting in a certain setting, or from casting actors to appear in new material).\n\nClip shows have their origin in theatrical short films and serials. Every serial chapter always had a brief recap showing where the previous chapter left off, but, beginning in 1936, entire chapters were largely devoted to material that audiences had already seen. In these recap chapters (also called \"economy chapters\"),\nprevious chapters were summarized for those who may have missed some episodes (which were unlikely to be rerun). The practice began with the Republic Pictures serial \"Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island\". Adverse weather conditions slowed the filming of this outdoor adventure budgeted for 12 chapters, and screenwriter Barry Shipman was forced to create two more chapters to recoup the lost production costs. Shipman wrote a few scenes in which the screen characters recount their adventures to date, and stock footage from previous chapters is shown instead of new sequences. Shipman's brainstorm was a convenient way to economize on production, and soon Republic made the recap chapter standard procedure.\n\nMovie studios often resorted to old footage to save money. The most famous example is the short comedies of The Three Stooges which, from 1949 until 1957, borrowed lengthy sequences and often entire storylines from old shorts. Only a few new scenes would be filmed as a framework for the old footage. This practice was adopted because the studios could charge more money for \"new\" films than for old ones.\n\nAnimation studios were also known to periodically make cartoon shorts - often referred to as \"cheaters\" - made up primarily of clips for earlier cartoons in order to save money. Examples of this include \"Betty Boop's Rise to Fame\" (Fleischer/Paramount, 1934), \"What's Cookin' Doc?\" (1944, Schlesinger/Warner Bros.) and a regular yearly series of \"Tom & Jerry\" \"cheaters\" such as \"Smitten Kitten\" (1952, MGM).\n\nOne variant of the modern clip show is the compilation episode, using clips from the most popular episodes, assembled together in one episode, sometimes without a frame story as such.\n\nAnother format is to have a host who describes various characters and characteristics of the show to introduce various clips from past episodes. For example, a special one-hour clip show episode of \"All in the Family\" featured actor Henry Fonda discussing the main characters on the show followed by relevant clips from previous episodes; a similar two-part clip show appeared on \"Three's Company\", hosted by Lucille Ball. This format was parodied in a clip show for \"The Simpsons\" (\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\"), in which fictional actor Troy McClure—a recurring \"Simpsons\" character—introduced the clips.\n\nA third variation, used in a two-part clip show episode of \"Cheers\" featured the entire cast of the show, including former cast members, sitting on a stage while being interviewed by talk host John McLaughlin about their characters on the show, with clips of previous episodes mixed in. A similar clip episode of \"Barney Miller\" aired after the death of cast member Jack Soo, with flashbacks introduced by the rest of the cast highlighting Soo's character Detective Sergeant Nick Yamana.\n\n\"\" had a flashback episode 2 episodes in to the series. The two main leads reminisce on the previous episode and other adventures they went on. The episode was highly praised.\n\nIn the \"\" episode \"The Ember Island Players\", the show's main characters watch a play about themselves based upon the events of the series thus far. Although the episode contains no actual footage from previous episodes, the actors recount many scenes from the series and show all the significant plot events. \"The Ember Island Players\" was the last episode before the four-part series finale.\n\nThe NBC sitcom \"Community\" used the clip show format with the episode \"Paradigms of Human Memory\", but rather than using clips from previous episodes, the cut-away scenes in that episode were all newly shot. In some cases the clips were set in events of previous episodes, and in other cases the clips showed events that had never before occurred on the show, such as visiting an Old West ghost town, taking over for a glee club killed in a bus crash or going on a fishing trip. The creator of \"Community\", Dan Harmon, used the same format in another one of his shows, \"Rick and Morty\", where all the clips were completely new and related to the episode, 'Total Rickall', in some way.\n\nIn anime, a common type of episode is the Recap episode, which presents clips from previous episodes in a manner to remind viewers of the story so far and help newer viewers catch up on the plot and details.\n\nWhile clip shows do reduce production costs, they were originally employed in an era when there were far fewer program outlets and it was less likely that episodes from previous seasons would be aired again. Clip shows typically received strong ratings, and it was expected for any successful comedy series to feature clip shows regularly in its later years. However, the episodes were subject to some ridicule due to their forced or \"corny\" framing devices (such as a family sitting peacefully around a fireplace) and the frequently awkward transitions between the frame story and the clips (such as characters staring into space while the screen blurs to represent \"remembering\").\n\nDaytime soap operas frequently present clip shows as a way to commemorate a show's milestone anniversary or the death of a long-running character. Many fans take advantage of the shows in order to see vintage clips of a particular soap opera. One example was an episode of \"As the World Turns\" in which seven of the longest running characters were stranded in a forest and remembered some of their best moments, all in honor of \"AtWT\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 50th anniversary.\n\nAnother common rationale for a clip show is the lack of a new show to air, due to failure to meet production schedules. For example, the computer-animated series \"\" used clip shows four times for this purpose, interrupting in-progress story arcs. Similarly, the \"Moonlighting\" season 3 episode \"The Straight Poop\" helped to fill out a production schedule that was rife with delays: in 15 weeks since that season began, only 8 episodes of the \"weekly\" series had been broadcast. \"Chappelle's Show\" resorted to producing \"five\" clip shows (using material from only 25 episodes) over the course of its first two seasons.\n\nOther times budgetary considerations force clip shows. At the end of its second season, \"\" had one more episode to shoot. However, Paramount cut that show's budget to make up for an episode earlier in the season that had gone over budget—and, similarly, over schedule, leaving only three days for principal photography. Because the season had gotten off to a slow start due to a writers' strike, the producers had no scripts set aside for future use as they normally would have. The result was \"\", in which the \"clips\" were the induced dreams of a comatose William T. Riker. The episode is widely considered among the worst of any \"Star Trek\" series.\n\nClip shows today tend to offset such criticism by trying to make the frame tale surrounding the clips compelling, or by presenting clip shows without any framing device. A show might also diffuse the awkwardness by indulging in self-parody, explicitly acknowledging or intentionally over-playing the device. Many series have included parody clip shows using \"clips\" from episodes which never happened. The \"South Park\" episode \"City on the Edge of Forever\" shows scenes from previous episodes, but the details are always wrong, and in the end, everyone gets ice cream. As another example, \"\" ran a clip show as its second episode, even though there was only one prior episode from which to pull material. The aforementioned \"Moonlighting\" clip episode, in typical fashion for the show, used a framing story that broke the fourth wall to determine if the characters themselves were the source of the show's notorious production delays, and ended with the characters promising a \"new episode next week!\".\n\nThe clip show has been employed more seriously as a means to bring viewers up to date on highly serialized dramas, such as on \"Lost\", \"Once Upon a Time\" and the reimagined \"Battlestar Galactica\". Many anime dramas used similar techniques, particularly when a series ran for more episodes in one season than could be reasonably rerun (such as \"Mobile Suit Gundam Wing\" running for 49 episodes, which were originally aired weekly).\n\nSometimes clip shows air before or during a series finale as a way for audiences to reminisce about their favorite moments. Some examples of shows that have used clip shows in this sense are: \"Animaniacs\", \"Frasier\", \"The Golden Girls\", \"Seinfeld\", \"Friends\", \"Thunderbirds\", \"Everybody Loves Raymond\", \"The Outer Limits\", \"Stargate SG-1\"/\"Atlantis\", and \"Cheers\".\n\nClip shows are also a way to compile the best episodes or sketches from a series to air in a single, concise package when rerunning a whole episode or series is implausible. The annual Scottish New Year special \"Scotch and Wry\" was condensed into four feature film-length episodes for home video release. \"Carson's Comedy Classics\" compiled memorable sketches from the first 20 seasons of \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" for airing in syndication. Surviving content from Bozo the Clown and other Chicago children's television programs was incorporated into \"\", an annual holiday special.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5928", "title": "Clown", "text": "Clown\n\nA clown is a comic performer who employs slapstick or similar types of physical comedy, often in a mime style.\n\nClowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable modern clown character is the \"Auguste\" or \"red clown\" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, exaggerated footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. \n\nModern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the circus clown, which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or \"Varieté\" shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.\n\nMany circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by Joseph Grimaldi (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of Clown in the harlequinade that formed part of British pantomimes, notably at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as \"Joey\", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.\n\nThe comedy that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary—and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition. \n\nThe \"fear of clowns,\" circus clowns in particular as a psychiatric condition has become known by the term coulrophobia.\n\nThe \"\"clown\" character developed out of the zanni \"rustic fool\" characters of the early modern commedia dell'arte, which were themselves directly based on the \"rustic fool\"\" characters of ancient Greek and Roman theatre.\nRustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as \" sklêro-paiktês\" (from \"paizein\" \"to play (like a child)\") or \"deikeliktas\", besides other generic terms for \"rustic\" or \"peasant\". In Roman theater, a term for clown was \"fossor\", literally \"digger; labourer\".\n\nThe English word \"clown\" was first recorded c. 1560 (as \"clowne, cloyne\") in the generic meaning \"rustic, boor, peasant\". \nThe origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with \"clumsy\".\nIt is in this sense that \"Clown\" is used as the name of fool characters in Shakespeare's \"Othello\" and \"The Winter's Tale\".\nThe sense of \"clown\" as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on Elizabethan \"rustic fool\" characters such as Shakespeare's.\n\nThe harlequinade developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that \"Clown\" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for Harlequin's slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.\n\nThe now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by Joseph Grimaldi, who played Clown in Charles Dibdin's 1800 pantomime \"Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World\" at Sadler's Wells Theatre, where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.\n\nThe circus clown developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from Philip Astley's London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian George L. Fox became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.\nTom Belling senior (1843–1900) developed the \"red clown\" or \"Auguste\" (\"Dummer August\") character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated \"white clown\". Belling worked for Circus Renz in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or \"hobo\" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in Ruggero Leoncavallo's 1892 opera \"Pagliacci\" (\"Clowns\").\nBelling's \"Auguste\" character was further popularized by Nicolai Poliakoff's \"Coco\" in the 1920s to 1930s.\n\nThe English word \"clown\" was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, into many other languages, such as French \"clown\", Russian (and other Slavic languages) кло́ун, Greek κλόουν, Danish/Norwegian \"klovn\", Romanian \"clovn\" etc.\n\nItalian retains \"Pagliaccio\", a Commedia dell'arte zanni character, and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French \"Paillasse\", Spanish \"payaso\", Catalan/Galician \"pallasso\", Portuguese \"palhaço\", Greek παλιάτσος, Turkish \"palyaço\", German \"Pajass\" (via French), Yiddish פּאַיאַץ (\"payats\"), Russian пая́ц.\n\nIn the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the tramp or hobo. Examples include Marceline Orbes, who performed at the Hippodrome Theater(1905), Charlie Chaplin's \"The Tramp\" (1914), and Emmett Kelly's \"Weary Willie\" based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by Otto Griebling during the 1930s to 1950s. Red Skelton's Dodo the Clown in \"The Clown\" (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, \"a funny man with a drinking problem\".\n\nIn the United States, Bozo the Clown was an influential \"Auguste\" character since the late 1950s. \"The Bozo Show\" premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. McDonald's derived its mascot clown, Ronald McDonald, from the \"Bozo\" character in the 1960s. Willard Scott, who had played \"Bozo\" during 1959–1962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.\n\nBased on the \"Bozo\" template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (\"Bozo\"-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to \"Clown Care\" or \"hospital clowning\" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. Clowns of America International (established 1984) and World Clown Association (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.\n\nThe shift of the \"Auguste\" or \"red clown\" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a \"Bozo\"-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the evil clown character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.\n\nThere are different types of clowns portrayed around the world. They include\n\nThe classical pairing of the White Clown with Auguste in modern tradition\nhas a precedent in the pairing of Pierrot and Harlequin in the Commedia dell'arte.\nOriginally, Harlequin's role was that of a light-hearted, nimble and astute servant, paired with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.\n\nIn the 18th-century English Harlequinade, Harlequin was now paired with Clown.\nAs developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.\n\nThe \"white clown\", or \"clown blanc\" from the original French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy auguste. They are also distinguished as the \"sad clown\" (blanc) and \"happy clown\" (auguste).\n\nThe Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit — either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.\n\nThe auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.\n\nThe \"contra-auguste\" plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.\n\nThere are two major types of clowns with \"whiteface\" makeup:\nThe classic \"white clown\" is derived from the Pierrot character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque \"Auguste\" types. Francesco Caroli and Glenn \"Frosty\" Little are examples of this type. The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the \"Bozo\" type, known as \"Comedy\" or \"Grotesque Whiteface\". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. \nIn the comedic partnership of Abbott and Costello, Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.\n\nTraditionally, the whiteface clown uses \"clown white\" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible. In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.\n\nWhiteface makeup was originally designed by Joseph Grimaldi in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.\n\nAmerica's first great whiteface clown was stage star George \"G.L.\" Fox. Following English Joseph Grimaldi, Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.\n\nThe character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or hobo. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps Otto Griebling and Emmett Kelly. Red Skelton, Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Sacha Baron Cohen would all fit the definition of a character clown.\n\nThe character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.\n\nThe most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the \"hobo\", \"tramp\" or \"bum\" clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is attitude. According to American circus expert Hovey Burgess, they are :\n\nClowns International claims to be the oldest clown society in the world. It was set up in 1946. Apart from being a membership organisation, Clowns International has set up a museum of clown memorabilia and a register of clown make-up. The latter also has a collection of full eggshells decorated as replicas of the specific clown's head.\n\nThe World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.\n\nClowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims \"to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns\".\n\nIn the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as tightrope, juggling, unicycling, Master of Ceremonies, or ride an animal. Clowns may also \"sit in\" with the orchestra. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.\n\nFrameworks are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act. Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.\n\nShows are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entrées, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.\n\n\n\n\"Clown Stops\" or \"interludes\" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few \"gags\" or several \"bits\". Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called \"reprises\" or \"run-ins\" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of \"business\" usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a tightrope walker the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the \"artiste\" by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.\n\nAmong the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the \"too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car\" stunt; doing just about anything with a rubber chicken, tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or \"clown bikes\". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.\n\nIn anthropology, the term \"clown\" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures. A society in which such \"clowns\" have an important position are termed \"clown societies\", and a \"clown\" character involved in a religious or ritual capacity is known as a \"ritual clown\".\n\nThe most ancient \"clowns\" have been found in the Fifth dynasty of Egypt, around 2400 BC. Unlike court jesters, clowns have traditionally served a socio-religious and psychological role, and traditionally the roles of priest and clown have been held by the same persons.\nPeter Berger writes that \"It seems plausible that folly and fools, like religion and magic, meet some deeply rooted needs in human society\". For this reason, clowning is often considered an important part of training as a physical performance discipline, partly because tricky subject matter can be dealt with, but also because it requires a high level of risk and play in the performer.\n\nIn Native American mythology, the Trickster channels the spirit of the Coyote and becomes a sacred Clown character. A Heyoka is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles. The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse. The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a Winkte.\n\nMany native tribes have a history of clowning.\nThe Canadian Clowning method developed by Richard Pochinko and furthered by his former apprentice, Sue Morrison, combines European and Native American clowning techniques.\n\nIn this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the medicine wheel. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Together with dialogue, narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes.

{"id": "13022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13022", "title": "Garfield", "text": "Garfield\n\nGarfield is a comic created by Jim Davis. Published since 1978, it chronicles the life of the title character, Garfield, the cat; Jon Arbuckle, the human; and Odie, the dog. As of 2013, it was syndicated in roughly 2,580 newspapers and journals, and held the Guinness World Record for being the world's most widely syndicated comic strip.\n\nThough this is rarely mentioned in print, \"Garfield\" is set in Muncie, Indiana, the home of Jim Davis, according to the television special \"Happy Birthday, Garfield\". Common themes in the strip include Garfield's laziness, obsessive eating, coffee, and disdain of Mondays and diets. The strip's focus is mostly on the interactions among Garfield, Jon, and Odie, but other recurring minor characters appear as well. Originally created with the intentions to \"come up with a good, marketable character\", \"Garfield\" has spawned merchandise earning $750 million to $1 billion annually. In addition to the various merchandise and commercial tie-ins, the strip has spawned several animated television specials, two animated television series, two theatrical feature-length live-action/CGI animated films, and three fully CGI animated direct-to-video movies.\n\nPart of the strip's broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of social or political commentary; though this was Davis's original intention, he also admitted that his \"grasp of politics isn't strong,\" joking that, for many years, he thought \"OPEC was a denture adhesive\".\n\nIn the 1970s, Davis created a comic strip called \"Gnorm Gnat\", which met with little success. One editor said, \"his art was good, his gags were great,\" but that \"nobody can identify with bugs.\" Davis decided to take a long, hard look at the comics and he saw that dogs were doing very well, but there were no cats at the time. Davis figured that since he had grown up on a farm with 25 cats that he could come up with a strip based on a cat. He then proceeded to create a new strip with a cat as its main character and thus created Garfield, who borrows the first letter of his name from Davis's earlier work. \"Garfield\" originally consisted of four main characters. Garfield, the titular character, was based on the cats Davis was around growing up; he took his name and personality from Davis's grandfather, James A. Garfield Davis, who was, in Davis's words, \"a large, cantankerous man\". Jon Arbuckle came from a 1950s coffee commercial, and Odie was based on a car dealership commercial written by Davis, which featured Odie the Village Idiot. Early on in the strip, Odie's owner was a man named Lyman. He was written in to give Jon someone to talk with. Davis later realized that Garfield and Jon could \"communicate nonverbally\". The strip, originally centered on Jon, was first rejected by the King Features, Post-Hall and the Chicago Tribune-New York News agencies, all of which asked Davis to focus on the cat, who in their opinion, got the better lines. United Feature Syndicate accepted the retooled strip in 1978 and debuted it in 41 newspapers on June 19 of that year (however, after a test run, the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" dropped it, only to reinstate it after readers' complaints). \"Garfield\"'s first Sunday page ran on June 25, 1978, being featured as a third-pager until March 22, 1981. A half-page debuted the following Sunday, March 29, with the strips for March 14 and 21, 1982, having a unique nine-panel format, but UFS curtailed further use of it (it did, however, allow Davis to use the format for his \"U.S. Acres\" strip).\n\nThe strip underwent stylistic changes, evolving from the style of the 1978–83 strips, to a more cartoonish look from 1984 onward. This change has mainly affected Garfield's design, which underwent a \"Darwinian evolution\" in which he began walking on his hind legs, \"slimmed down\", and \"stopped looking ... through squinty little eyes\" His evolution, according to Davis, was to make it easier to \"push Odie off the table\" or \"reach for a piece of pie.\"\n\n\"Garfield\" quickly became a commercial success. In 1981, less than three years after its release, the strip appeared in 850 newspapers and accumulated over $15 million in merchandise. To manage the merchandise, Davis founded Paws, Inc. In 1982 the strip was appearing in more than 1,000 newspapers.\n\nBy 2002, \"Garfield\" became the world's most syndicated strip, appearing in 2,570 newspapers with 263 million readers worldwide; by 2004, \"Garfield\" appeared in nearly 2,600 newspapers and sold from $750 million to $1 billion worth of merchandise in 111 countries. In 1994, Davis's company, Paws, Inc., purchased all rights to the strips from 1978 to 1993 from United Feature. The strip is currently distributed by Universal Press Syndicate, while rights for the strip remain with Paws.\n\nWhile retaining creative control and being the only signer, Davis now only writes and usually does the rough sketches. Since the late 1990s most of the work has been done by long-time assistants Brett Koth and Gary Barker. Inking and coloring work is done by other artists, while Davis spends most of the time supervising production and merchandising the characters.\n\n\"Garfield\" was originally created by Davis with the intention to come up with a \"good, marketable character\". Now the world's most syndicated comic strip, \"Garfield\" has spawned a \"profusion\" of merchandise including clothing, toys, games, books, Caribbean cruises, credit cards, dolls, DVDs of the movies or the TV series, and related media.\n\nGarfield.com is the strip's official website, which contains archives of past strips along with games and an online store. Jim Davis has also collaborated with Ball State University and Pearson Digital Learning to create www.ProfessorGarfield.org, an educational website with interactive games focusing on math and reading skills, and with Children's Technology Group to create MindWalker, a web browser that allows parents to limit the websites their children can view to a pre-set list.\n\nA variety of edited \"Garfield\" strips have been made available on the Internet, some hosted on their own unofficial, dedicated sites. Dating from 2005, a site called the \"Garfield Randomizer\" created a three-panel strip using panels from previous \"Garfield\" strips. Another approach, known as \"Silent Garfield\", involves removing Garfield's thought balloons from the strips. Some examples date from 2006. A webcomic called \"Arbuckle\" does the above but also redraws the originals in a different art style. The \"Arbuckle\" website creator writes: \"'Garfield' changes from being a comic about a sassy, corpulent feline, and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely, pathetic, delusional man who talks to his pets. Consider that Jon, according to Garfield canon, cannot hear his cat's thoughts. This is the world as he sees it. This is his story\". Another variation along the same lines, called \"Realfield\" or \"Realistic Garfield\", is to redraw Garfield as a real cat as well as removing his thought balloons. Still another approach to editing the strips involves removing Garfield and other main characters from the originals completely, leaving Jon talking to himself. While strips in this vein can be found online as early as 2006, the 2008 site \"Garfield Minus Garfield\" by Dan Walsh received enough online attention to be covered by news media. Reception was largely positive: at its peak, the site received as many as 300,000 hits per day. Fans connected with Jon's \"loneliness and desperation\" and found his \"crazy antics\" humorous; Jim Davis himself called Walsh's strips an \"inspired thing to do\" and said that \"some of [the strips] work better [than the originals]\". Ballantine Books, which publishes the \"Garfield\" books, released a volume of \"Garfield Minus Garfield\" strips on October 28, 2008. The volume retains Davis as author and features a foreword by Walsh.\n\nGarfield's animation debut was on \"The Fantastic Funnies\", which aired on CBS in May 15, 1980, voiced by actor Scott Beach. \"Garfield\" was one of the strips featured, introduced as a newcomer (the strip was only two years old at the time). From 1982 to 1991, twelve primetime \"Garfield\" cartoon specials and one hour-long primetime documentary celebrating the character's 10th anniversary were aired; Lorenzo Music voiced Garfield in all of them. A Saturday morning cartoon show, \"Garfield and Friends\", aired for seven seasons from 1988 to 1994; this adaption also starred Music as the voice of Garfield. \"The Garfield Show\", a CGI series, started development in 2007 to coincide with the strip's 30th anniversary the following year. It premiered in France in December 2008 and made its U.S. debut on Cartoon Network on November 2, 2009.\n\n\"\" was released in theaters on June 11, 2004. Its sequel, \"\", was released on June 16, 2006. Three direct-to-video films were released, \"Garfield Gets Real\" on August 9, 2007, \"Garfield's Fun Fest\" on August 5, 2008, and \"Garfield's Pet Force\" on June 16, 2009. \nOn May 24, 2016, it was announced that Alcon Entertainment will develop a new CG animated Garfield movie with John Cohen and Steven P. Wegner ready to produce and to be directed by Mark Dindal.\n\nA \"Garfield\" video game was developed by Atari, Inc. for its Atari 2600 home video game system and appears in their 1984 catalog. However, after Atari's spinoff and sale of its home games and computers division, owner Jack Tramiel decided the character's royalties were too expensive given the declining state of the video game industry at the time, and the game was cancelled.\n\n\"\" is a 1987 video game for the Atari ST, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and the Amiga based on the comic strip. Towa Chiki made \"A Week of Garfield\" for the Family Computer, released only in Japan in 1989. Sega also made video games based on Garfield for the Genesis (\"\") and Windows 3.1 computers. Other companies made games, such as \"\" for the DS, published by Game Factory, \"Garfield's Nightmare\" for DS, \"Garfield's Funfest\" for DS, and \"Garfield Labyrinth\" for Game Boy. On PlayStation 2 were \"Garfield\" and \"Garfield 2\" (known in the US as \"Garfield, a Tale of Two Kitties\"). \"Garfield Lasagna World Tour\" was also made for PS2. And recent additions for mobile devices are \"Garfield's Diner\" and \"Garfield's Zombie Defense\".\n\nKonami also released a Garfield \"Handheld electronic game\" titled \"Lasagnator\" in 1991, which met with mild success.\n\nIn 2012, a series of Garfield video games was launched by French publisher Anuman Interactive, including \"My Puzzles with Garfield!\", \"Multiplication Tables with Garfield\", \"Garfield Kart\", and \"Garfield's Match Up\".\n\nJoseph Papp, producer of \"A Chorus Line\", discussed making a Garfield stage musical, but due to some complications, it never got off ground. A full-length stage musical, titled \"Garfield Live\", was planned to kick off its US tour in September 2010, but got moved to January 18, 2011, where it premiered in Muncie, Indiana. The book was written by Jim Davis, with music and lyrics by Michael Dansicker and Bill Meade, and it was booked by AWA Touring Services. The opening song, \"Cattitude\" can be heard on the national tour's website, along with two more, \"On the Fence,\" and \"Going Home!\". When the North-American tour concluded in 2012, it toured throughout Asia.\n\nIn agreement with Paws, Boom! Studios launched in May 2012 a monthly \"Garfield\" comic book, with the first issue featuring a story written by Mark Evanier (who has supervised \"Garfield and Friends\" and \"The Garfield Show\") and illustrated by Davis's long-time assistant Gary Barker.\n\nIn 2016, Hermes Press signed an agreement with Paws, Inc to publish an art book on the art of author Jim Davis, titled \"The Art of Jim Davis' Garfield\". The book includes an essay by author R.C. Harvey and other original material, and was released in July 2016 for the San Diego Comic-Con.\n\nThrough the Garfield strips, there have been many additional characters, but the main ones are described here.\n\nFirst appearance: June 19, 1978\n\nGarfield is an orange, fuzzy tabby cat born in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant (later revealed in the television special \"\" to be Mama Leoni's Italian Restaurant) who immediately ate all the pasta and lasagna in sight, thus developing his love and obsession for lasagna and pizza.\n\nGags in the strips commonly deal with Garfield's obesity (in one strip, Jon jokes, \"I wouldn't say Garfield is fat, but the last time he got on a Ferris wheel, the two guys on top starved to death\"), and his disdain of any form of exertion or work. He is known for saying \"breathing is exercise\".\n\nThough Garfield can be very cynical, he does have a soft side for his teddy bear, Pooky, food and sleep, and one Christmas he says, \"they say I have to get up early, be nice to people, skip breakfast ... I wish it would never end.\"\nHowever, in the feature film \"Garfield Gets Real\" and its sequels, Garfield is better behaved, friendlier towards Jon and Odie, less self-centered, and more sympathetic.\n\nIt has been wondered by many readers if Garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him. Sometimes, it seems like Jon can hear him. However, it is mentioned in more than one strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield. However, in the feature film Garfield Gets Real and its sequels, Garfield and the other animals save for Odie are able to talk to, and be understood by, Jon and the other humans. In the 1 April (April Fools' Day) 1997 strip, Garfield, still with thought balloons, can be understood by Jon.\n\nTo break the fourth wall, 19 June is celebrated within the strip as Garfield's birthday. The appearance in 1979 claimed it to be his first birthday, although in the first appearance of the strip (19 June 1978), he was portrayed as a fully-grown cat, implying that the birthday is of the strip itself.\n\nFirst appearance: June 19, 1978\n\nJon (Jonathan Q. Arbuckle) is Garfield's owner, usually depicted as an awkward clumsy geek who has trouble finding a date. Jon had a crush on Liz (Garfield's veterinarian) and is now dating her. Jon disapproves of Garfield's \"don't care, not interested,\" attitude, and often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him, sometimes stating an interesting fact, or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt Garfield into thought, Garfield tends to brush this off with a simple, yet logical remark, and despite the trouble Garfield causes, Jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of Garfield's shortcomings, a fact which Garfield often takes advantage of. In the December 23, 1980 strip, Jon states that he is thirty years old (nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties, although he has not aged physically). His birthday is July 28.\n\nJon loves (or occasionally hates) Garfield and all cats. Many gags focus on this; his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills, his poor taste in clothes (Garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that \"two hundred moths committed suicide\"; in another, the \"geek police\" ordered Jon to \"throw out his tie\"), and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with \"polka ninjas\". Other strips portray him as lacking intelligence (he is seen reading a pop-up book in one strip).\n\nJon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities; in one strip, his father, upon seeing indoor plumbing, remarks, \"Woo-ha! Ain't science something?\" Jon occasionally visits his parents, brother and grandmother at their farm. It was implied that Jon is inspired by a drawing of Davis himself when he was first drawing the strip. Jon was initially portrayed as a cartoonist in earlier strips, as Jim Davis stated this would've been a way to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist himself, but this eventually faded in the later strips.\n\nFirst appearance: August 8, 1978\n\nOdie is a yellow, long-eared beagle with a large, slobbering tongue, who walks on all four legs, though occasionally he will walk on two like Garfield. He was originally owned by Jon's friend Lyman, though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book \"Garfield: His 9 Lives\" (1984) retcons Odie's origin: there is no mention of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten). Odie is younger than Garfield and usually portrayed as naïve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading \"War and Peace\" and watching a television program, \"An Evening With Mozart\". Odie has only talked once. In another strip, published on January 28, 2010, he is seen solving Jon's sudoku puzzle.\n\nFirst appearance: June 26, 1979\nDr. Liz Wilson is Garfield's veterinarian and a long-time crush of Jon Arbuckle. She has a somewhat deadpan, sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to Jon's outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion. Jon often attempted to ask her out on a date, but rarely succeeded; however, in an extended story arc from June 19 to July 29, 2006 (the main event on July 28), Liz and Jon kiss. Now, they are a couple.\n\nMany of the gags focus on Garfield's obsessive eating and obesity; his dislike of spiders; his hatred of Mondays, diets, and any form of exertion; his constant shedding (which annoys Jon); and his abuse of Odie and Jon as well as his obsession with mailing Nermal to Abu Dhabi, or simply throwing \"through\" the front door. Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of raisins and spinach), Garfield is particularly fond of lasagna; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish). He also has odd relationships with household pests; Garfield generally spares mice, and even cooperates with them to cause mischief (much to Jon's chagrin), but will readily swat or pound spiders flat. Other gags focus on Jon's poor social skills and inability to get a date; before he started dating Liz, he often tried to get dates, usually without success (in one strip, after failing to get a date with \"Nancy\", he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother; he ended up getting \"shot down by three generations\"). When he does get a date, it usually goes awry; Jon's dates have slashed his tires, been tranquilized, and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears. The storylines featuring Jon's dates rarely appear now. Before, he had dates with many odd characters, whereas now, he exclusively dates Liz.\n\nGarfield's world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, a place he loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food is the center of most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his tractor (which he double-parked) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon takes Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to. Frequently, the characters break the fourth wall, mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out), or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting, \"I can hardy eben understad by own thoughts.\"\n\nOne particular semi-recurring storyline features Jon and Liz on a date in a restaurant. They sometimes are waited on by the Italian Armando, who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards Jon, presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery. On other occasions, the couple receives a different waiter, such as a large ogre-like man who intimidates Jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food.\n\nAnother commonly recurring character, although hardly ever seen, is Jon's neighbor, Mrs. Feeny. Garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her, to the point the she even erects an electric fence (which of course, does not stop him).\n\nOther unique themes are things like \"Garfield's Believe it or Don't\", \"Garfield's Law\", \"Garfield's History of Dogs\", and \"Garfield's History of Cats\", which show science, history, and the world from Garfield's point of view. Another particular theme is \"National Fat Week\", where Garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people. Also, there was a storyline involving Garfield catching Odie eating his food and \"kicking Odie into next week\". Soon, Garfield realizes that \"Lunch isn't the same without Odie. He always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food\" (Garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself). A few days after the storyline began, Garfield is lying in his bed with a \"nagging feeling I'm forgetting something,\" with Odie landing on Garfield in the next panel. Jon and Liz began to go out more frequently, Jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after Garfield and Odie, though they do not always work out. Two particular examples are Lillian, an eccentric (and very nearsighted) old lady with odd quirks, and Greta, a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during New Year's Eve. Most of December is spent preparing for Christmas, with a predictable focus on presents. Other Christmas themed strips include Jon's attempts at decorating the tree and house, or the attempt to buy the tree. Some years, the Christmas strips started as early as the end of November. Another example is \"Splut Week\", when Garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him. For most of Garfield's history, being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia \"splut\", hence the name.\n\nEvery week before June 19, the strip focuses on Garfield's birthday, which he dreads because of his fear of getting older. This started happening after his sixth birthday. However, before his 29th birthday, Liz put Garfield on a diet. On June 19, 2007, Garfield was given the greatest birthday present: \"I'M OFF MY DIET!\" Occasionally the strip celebrates Halloween as well with scary-themed jokes, such as mask gags. There are also seasonal jokes, with snow-related gags common in January or February and beach- or heat-themed jokes in the summer.\n\nOne storyline, which ran the week before Halloween in 1989 (Oct 23 to Oct 28), is unique among Garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous. It depicts Garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists. In Garfield's \"Twentieth Anniversary Collection\", in which the strips are reprinted, Jim Davis discusses the genesis for this series:\n\nOne of the recurring storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest one of these lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off – and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, monkeys, a seal, a snake, a kangaroo and joey, and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.\n\nAnother story involved Jon going away on a business trip around Christmas time, leaving Garfield a week's worth of food, which he devoured instantly. Garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out. He then reunites with his mother, and eventually makes it back home in the snow on Christmas Eve (1984 December 3 to 23). Part of this storyline was taken from the 1983 Emmy-winning special \"Garfield on the Town\".\n\nPaws, Inc. was founded in 1981 by Jim Davis to support the Garfield comic strip and its licensing. It is located in Muncie, Indiana, and has a staff of nearly 50 artists and licensing administrators. In 1994, the company purchased all rights to the Garfield comic strips from 1978 to 1993 from United Feature Syndicate. However, the original black and white daily strips and original color Sunday strips remain copyrighted to United Feature Syndicate. The full color daily strips and recolored Sunday strips are copyrighted to Paws as they are considered a different product. Though rights to the strip remain with Paws, Inc., it is currently distributed by Universal Press Syndicate.\n\nDavis attracted criticism from the mainstream media for a \"Garfield\" strip in which the last panel appeared to be a negative reference to Veterans Day that appeared in newspapers on November 11, 2010. In the strip, a spider who is about to be squashed by Garfield boasts that if he is squished, he will get a holiday in his remembrance. The next panel shows a classroom of spiders in which a teacher asks the students why spiders celebrate \"National Stupid Day,\" implying that the spider was squished. Davis quickly apologized for the poorly timed comic strip, saying that it had been written a year in advance and that both his brother and son were veterans.\n\n\n\n"}

Because of the self-published nature of webcomics, the internet has become a successful platform for social commentary, as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) expression.\n\nA 2015 study by David Harper concluded that webcomics were vastly more popular format to female, transgender, and non-binary comic artists than for men. More than 40% of the women, transgender, and non-binary comic artists reported to work primarily in webcomics in this study, while only 15% of men did. Harper suggested that this may be because the self-published nature of webcomics form a lower barrier to entry, while traditional mediums such as comic books are gatekept by cisgender men, though he also suggested that this disparity may just be a difference in interest between the groups.\n\nAccording to a study by Erik Melander in 2005, at least 25% of webcomic creators were female. This percentage was significantly larger than the number of successful women creating print comics at the time, and the number may have been even higher, as a certain percentage of contributors were unknown. In 2015, 63% of the top 30 comic creators on webcomic conglomerate Tapastic were female. In 2016, 42% of the webcomic creators on Line Webtoon were female, as was 50% of its 6 million active daily readers.\n\n\"Girls with Slingshots\" creator Danielle Corsetto stated that webcomics are probably a female dominated field because there is no need to go through an established publisher. Noelle Stevenson, creator of \"Nimona\" and \"Lumberjanes\", noticed that webcomics predominantly feature female protagonists, possibly to \"balance out\" the content of mainstream media. Corsetto noted that she has never encountered sexism during her career, though Stevenson described some negative experiences with Reddit and 4Chan, websites outside of her usual channels.\n\nOliver Sava of \"The A.V. Club\" pointed out in 2016 that there exists a growing community of black women cartoonists creating webcomics.\n\nIn India, where rape of women has been a big issue in the 2010s, Indian webcomics formed a platform for artists to poke fun at patriarchy, feminism, and various other gender-related topics. According to human rights activist and webcomic creator Rachita Taneja, humor aids in communicating complex subjects to large groups of people, and the inclusiveness of webcomics makes it an excellent medium for said communication.\n\nGirlamatic was a subscriber-based webcomic site founded by Joey Manley in 2003. The website's purpose was to syndicate webcomics created primarily by women and marketed primarily to women. Girlamatic included webcomics created by various well-known female webcomic artists, including Shaenon Garrity and Lea Hernandez. The syndicate had won various Lulu awards for being among the \"most women-friendly and reader- friendly work in comics.\" Writing for \"Comixpedia\", Eric Burns voiced his worries that initiatives like Girlamatic section off and divide the webcomic community, making it \"less\" likely for male readers to come across the works of female webcartoonists.\n\nThere exist a large amount of openly gay and lesbian comic creators that self-publish their work on the internet. These include amateur works, as well as more \"mainstream\" works, such as \"Kyle's Bed & Breakfast\". According to Andrew Wheeler from \"Comics Alliance\", webcomics \"provide a platform to so many queer voices that might otherwise go undiscovered,\" and Tash Wolfe of \"The Mary Sue\" has a similar outlook on transgender artists and themes.\n\n"}

This idea evolved into a concept for a robotic creature that would hatch itself from an egg, necessitating the design of a mechanism for the hatching, and a material for the egg itself. Hatchimals was officially launched on October 7, 2016, backed by advertising on television and digital platforms, such as social networking services.\n\nDemand for Hatchimals has been extremely high, which have led to them being designated as the \"hottest\" toy of the 2016 Christmas shopping season; in late-October 2016, Hatchimals occupied multiple spots on NPD Group's top ten list of best-selling toys in the United States, including first, second, sixth, and ninth place.

The company attempted to address the supply issues by having its remaining stock from China delivered via air freight instead of by ship, but stated that there may not be new stock of Hatchimals until 2017. However, Martin added that the company planned to introduce new species and features to the Hatchimals line, and asked customers to be patient.

{"id": "19441749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19441749", "title": "Inherently funny word", "text": "Inherently funny word\n\nCertain words have been suggested to be inherently funny. Vaudeville tradition holds that words with the letter \"k\" are funny. A 2015 study at the University of Alberta suggested that the humor of certain nonsense words can be explained by whether they seem rude, and by the property of entropy – the improbability of certain letters being used together in a word. The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer posited that humor is a product of one's expectations being violated. (Realisation)\n\nVaudeville words can be found in Neil Simon's 1972 play \"The Sunshine Boys\", in which an aging comedian gives a lesson to his nephew on comedy, saying that words with \"k\" sounds are funny:\n\nRichard Wiseman, a professor of the public understanding of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, conducted a small experiment to determine whether words with a \"k\" sound were actually considered funnier than others for English speakers. His LaughLab tested the degree of funniness among a family of jokes based on animal sounds; the joke rated the funniest was also the one with the most \"k\" sounds:\n\nRobert Beard, a professor emeritus of linguistics at Bucknell University, told an interviewer that \"The first thing people always write in [to his website] about is funny words\". Beard's first book was \"The 100 Funniest Words in English\", and among his selected words are \"absquatulate\", \"bowyangs\", \"collywobbles\", \"fartlek\", \"filibuster\", \"gongoozle\", \"hemidemisemiquaver\", and \"snollygoster\".\n\nA 2015 study published in the \"Journal of Memory and Language\" examined the humor of nonsense words. The study used a computer program to generate pronounceable nonsense words that followed typical English spelling conventions and tested them for their perceived funniness to human test subjects.\n\nThe funniest nonsense words tended to be those that reminded people of real words that are considered rude or offensive. This category included four of the top-six nonsense words that were rated the funniest in the experiment: \"whong\", \"dongl\", \"shart\", and \"focky\". To explain why these words seemed funny, the study's author said \"The expectation that you've read or uttered a rude word is raised – and then violated, because in fact it's harmless nonsense. There's a sense of relief – of getting away with it.\"\n\nAfter removing from consideration the words that seemed rude, another factor was suggested to also be significant. The study's lead author, Chris Westbury from the University of Alberta, suggests that the humor of certain invented words can be explained by the property of entropy. Entropy (specifically Shannon entropy) here expresses how unlikely the letter combinations in certain nonsense words are: the more unlikely the letters are to be used together in English, the more funny the combination is likely to be found. Nonsense words such as \"rumbus\", \"skritz\", and \"yuzz-a-ma-tuzz\", which were created by children's book author and illustrator Dr. Seuss, were found to have less probable letter combinations and to seem funnier than most ordinary English words. According to Westbury, \"there's actually a consistent relationship between how funny [nonwords] are and how weird they are\".\n\nThe entropy explanation also supports the notion that words with a 'k' in them tend to be more funny, as the letter 'k' is one of the least frequently used letters in the English language.\n\nThe idea that humor can be predicted by a word's entropy corresponds to the work of 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who posited that humor is a product of one's expectations being violated. According to Westbury, \"One reason puns are funny is that they violate our expectation that a word has one meaning\". Violating expectations corresponds mathematically to having a low probability combination of letters, which also makes the word seem particularly funny, according to Westbury.\n\nTo provide a possible evolutionary explanation of these phenomena, the authors of the study said that unusual occurrences may be experienced as indicating the presence of potential threats, and that humor may be a way of signalling to others that one has realized that a perceived threat is actually harmless. Westbury said \"Strange as it may seem, that same mechanism may be activated when you see an unlikely looking word or a highly taboo one – you experience relief as you recognize that it's completely harmless – just a joke.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Its purpose is to establish a legal framework for the social responsibility of radio and television broadcasters, national and independent producers of radio and TV programming, and viewers and listeners in the dissemination and reception of transmitted information.\n\nIts objectives, stated in Article 3, are: “[securing] respect for freedom of expression and information without censorship”; “[furthering] the actual exercise of and respect for human rights”; “[facilitating] the broadcasting of information and materials intended for minors”; “[furthering] the broadcasting of national productions and [encouraging] the development of the national audiovisual industry”; “[facilitating]the dissemination of the values of the Venezuelan culture”; and “[furthering]public participation.”\n\nArticle 4 of the law allows the use of indigenous languages in programs directed specifically to indigenous peoples, and makes it a requirement to provide subtitles or sign language translation in informative programs for people with auditory disabilities.\n\nArticle 14 supports national production of TV and radio content - including music - by requiring broadcasters to transmit at least 10 hours of Venezuelan-made content every day.\n\nThe government called it a \"building block for the modernization of the country's communications sector\", whereas the opposition believes it increases state control over the media. According to Human Rights Watch, the law \"severely threatens press freedom in Venezuela\", and \"[i]ts vaguely worded restrictions and heavy penalties are a recipe for self-censorship by the press and arbitrariness by government authorities.\" \n\nThe law's purpose is to instruct the Venezuelan television networks to air cultural content and to establish schedules for each category of the series and programs. The rating for each program is based on four content types: \"Language\", \"health\", \"sex\", and \"violence\"; when a program is about to be broadcast, these content issues can either be announced with their respective \"level measure\" or not, depending on the channel's way to show the advice. Also, depending on the schedule and the advised contents, the program may either be suitable, in need of parental guidance or non-suitable for young children and teenagers. It is also specified if the series is a national production (made by the channel), an independent national production (made by a separate company) or an international production (a foreign program).\n\nLikewise, every network is instructed to air the government's teasers, their political campaigns and to interrupt the usual schedule when national announcements by the President of the Republic, known as \"Cadenas\" (\"Chains\", referring to the fact that \"every\" radio and TV network must air simultaneously these announcements) are about to be broadcast.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17406217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17406217", "title": "Lexis (Aristotle)", "text": "Lexis (Aristotle)\n\nIn philosophical discourse, lexis (from the Greek: λέξις \"word\") is a complete group of words in a language, vocabulary, the total set of all words in a language, and all words that have meaning or a function in grammar.\n\nAccording to Plato, lexis is the manner of speaking. Plato said that lexis can be divided into mimesis (imitation properly speaking) and diegesis (simple narrative). Gerard Genette states: \"Plato's theoretical division, opposing the two pure and heterogeneous modes of narrative and imitation, within poetic diction, elicits and establishes a practical classification of genres, which includes the two distinct modes...and a mixed mode, for example the Iliad\".\nIn the \"Iliad\", a Greek epic written by Homer, the mixed mode is very prevalent. According to Gerald Prince, diegesis in the \"Iliad\" is the fictional storytelling associated with the fictional world and the enacting/re-telling of the story. Mimesis in the\" Iliad\" is the imitation of everyday, yet fantastical life in the ancient Greek world. Diegesis and mimesis combined represent the fullest extent of lexis; both forms of speech, narrating and re-enacting.\nIn conclusion, lexis is the larger overview of literature. Within lexis the two areas of differentiation of mimesis (imitation) are diegesis (narrative) and the \"direct representation of the actors speaking to the public.\"\n\nAccording to Jose M. Gonzalez, \"Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis.\" Pistis is the Greek word for faith and is one of the rhetorical modes of persuasion.\nGonzalez also points out that, \"By invoking phantasia, lexis against the background Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis.\" Phantasia is a Greek word meaning the process by which all images are presented to us. Aristotle defines phantasia as \"our desire for the mind to mediate anything not actually present to the senses with a mental image.\" Aristotle instructs the reader to use his or her imagination to create the fantastic, unordinary images, all the while using narrative and re-enactment to create a play either written or produced.\n\nAlthough Aristotle at times seems to demean the art of diction or 'voice,' saying that it is not an \"elevated subject of inquiry,\" he does go into quite a bit of detail on its importance and its proper use in rhetorical speech. Often calling it \"style,\" he defines good style as follows: that it must be clear and avoid extremes of baseness and loftiness. Aristotle makes the cases for the importance of diction by saying that, \"it is not enough to know what we ought to say; we must also say it as we ought.\". In an oratorical speech, one must consider not only the facts, but also how to put the facts into words and which words and, also, the \"proper method of delivery.\" Aristotle goes on to say that only the facts in an argument should be important but that since the listeners can be swayed by diction, it must also be considered. \nVoice \n\nAt the time when Aristotle wrote his treatise on Rhetoric, orators had not paid much attention to voice. They thought it was a subject only of concern to actors and poets. In \"The Rhetoric\", Aristotles says, \"proper method of delivery…affects the success of a speech greatly; but hitherto the subject has been neglected.\" Aristotle defined voice as controlling one's voice, using rate, volume and pitch, to convey the appropriate emotions. The manner of voice in which an idea or speech is conveyed affects not only the emotions of the audience but, also, their ability to understand this concept.\nAlthough Aristotle gives this mention and explanation of voice, he does not go into specifics about how to produce appropriate voice or how to convey specific tones with one's voice. This may or may not be due to his mild disdain for the topic as a whole. Modern scholars have explored voice more extensively. According to Taylor Stoehr, \"voice is the pervasive reflection in written or spoken language, of an author's character, the marks by which we recognize his utterance as his.\". However, just as in Aristotle's time set of specific rules or guidelines has yet been laid out for the production or interpretation of voice. Due to the vast array of elements involved in the production of voice this task would be nearly, if not entirely, impossible. \n\nLanguage\n\nAs mentioned before, Aristotle thought the language of a speech should avoid being too lofty or too crude. The speaker must use the ordinary language of everyday life. However, because people best remember what is out of the ordinary, the speaker must use some language that gives the speech an air of importance.\n\nThe elevation of the language must correlate to the elevation of the subject or, in poetry, the character that is speaking. In poetry, language and linguistic devices that convey a sense of importance are more appropriate, and should be used more often because the events of poetry are more removed from ordinary life. They are less appropriate in rhetorical speech because the topics relate more directly to ordinary things and the people who are listening to the speech. Most of all, the speaker must \"give the impression of speaking naturally and not artificially.\" When one seems to speak with ease, the audience is more easily persuaded that the facts he is communicating are truthful. \n\nAlso, a speaker must avoid using very many \"strange words, compound words, and invented words.\". Aristotle considered this kind of language an excessive departure from the way people normally speak. However, one acceptable departure from plain language is the use of metaphor because metaphors are used by all people in everyday conversation.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, lexis, meaning the delivery of words, is the least important area of speech when in comparison to invention, arrangement and style. However, lexis is still closely looked at and broken down into two forms. The two types of lexis in rhetoric include: \"lexis graphike\" and \"lexis agonistike\" The separate terms that describe the two forms of lexis, graphike and agonistike, have been conformed by several Latin terms. Although the words directly relate to the type of lexis, the theories of Aristotle and Plato do not compare.\n\n\"Lexis graphike\" comes from the term \"zographia\", meaning realistic painting, and graphe, meaning writing. Plato believes that writing and painting are one of the same. His theory proves that both do not have the capability to defend themselves through an argument, question and answer, which conveys that these forms can not prove truth. Although for Aristotle, \"lexis graphik\"e is the most accurate delivery of language, which leads to his theory that proves that writing does not need to be questioned because it is already exact. \"Lexis agonistike\" however is from the term \"skiagraphia\", meaning a rough sketch or outline of painting. Aristotle once again opposes Plato by believing that \"lexis agonistike\" does not need questions asked, but only answers. The answer refers to the use of invention given to the actor because the writing portion is only outlined.\n\nTo further understand the separate types of lexis, each type can be broken down by how the writing is prepared and delivered. \"Lexis graphike\" is the most precise style of rhetoric and strongly appeals to intelligence. The delivery of \"lexis graphike\" is designed for a careful reading from either the book or paper as opposed to a performance that leaves room for improvisation. This type of lexis is a simple, straight forward recitation rather than an elaborate presentation. \"Lexis graphike\" is most accurately written and depends the least upon the person who is delivering the speech. \"Lexis agonistike\" contradicts \"lexis graphike\" because it is typically carelessly written and meant for a full performance. The lack of attention given to the written words allows the performer to improvise. This gives the presentation a style that reflects the entertainer rather the writer.\n"}

{"id": "10671765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10671765", "title": "Media meshing", "text": "Media meshing\n\nMedia meshing is the process of using one of the media, such as a blog or a website, to enhance the experience of another medium, such as a newspaper article or a fictional television program. \"Meshing\" may describe activities and motivations of an information receiver which are completely independent of the intentions of the source of that information. \"Meshing\" may also be used to describe the activities of an information provider, who may intentionally encourage consumer engagement by using multiple media or channels of information exchange related to a product or organization, as in an integrated advertising campaign. Strictly, in both cases, \"media meshing\" ultimately describes the \"behaviour\" of the person \"receiving\" the information.\n\nWhen the meshing of media sources is encouraged by the source itself, as is often the case with commercial products and special interest promotions, media meshing may be better described as integrated media. This describes the activity desired by commercial entities when they encourage web traffic through non-web media such as billboards or newspaper articles in a comprehensive advertising campaign.\n\nHowever, from the perspective of the information consumer, Lerma describes that meshing represents a way to experience media which is fundamentally different from the way people interacted with mass media in the past. When the participants themselves choose the channels, pieces, sources, and specific media that they use to enhance or disassemble the first piece of media they encounter, especially when these are perceived to be mostly independent sources, the result is an enriched self-discovery experience with a level of engagement not possible from even the most well designed guided experiences. Meshing goes beyond simply mutually inclusive public relations across media channels, pieces, and product placement. Broadband technology and diversity of online services have increased the accessibility and prevalence of simultaneous media experiences to the point where some would argue there is a new, more demanding and more inquisitive, incarnation of information consumers. The richness of experience in meshing becomes even more evident when information receivers puts their new views and interpretations back into the media by posting or answering questions on a discussion forum or blog, publishing a formal in-depth response, or creating an independent fan site. In cases like these, the persons may be called information prosumers, as they are both consuming information from various sources and producing a web of related information for other \"meshers\" to \"consume\" (or \"prosumers\" to mesh).\nIt is arguable, however, that this is the traditional approach of historians and scientists to information sources, and that what is new is the speed and ease with which cross-referencing and elaboration can be achieved with the media delivery and display technology that is used, and the amount of time invested in multi-source research by the non-specialized population. It is also arguable that multi-form/multi-source information gathering only \"seems\" new when contrasted to the recent era of single-voice and non-interactive commercial television and radio information broadcasting. It is also important to note that if the sources are not chosen carefully to be as orthogonal as possible, media meshing will result in a false reassurance of the \"facts\" presented by the single-voice of the original articles, but it would still technically be media meshing (i.e., confirming a CNN television story about an event in London by meshing the CNN.com web-site, BBC radio, and \"The Guardian\" newspaper will probably confirm the original facts, but a different set of facts may be forthcoming from an email to a friend who lives there or from reading a blog from a beat-cop in the area.)\n\nThe following activities, while perhaps not unique to media meshing, are characteristic of this type of 'enhanced' media consumption\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1299072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1299072", "title": "Meta-reference", "text": "Meta-reference\n\nMeta-reference is a special type of self-reference that can occur in all media or medial artefacts, for instance literature, film, painting, TV series, comic strips, or video games. It includes all references to, or comments on, a specific medium, medial artefact, or the media in general. These references and comments originate from a logically higher level (a 'meta-level') within any given artefact, and draw attention to -- or invite reflection about -- media-related issues (e.g. the production, performance, or reception) of said artefact, specific other artefacts (as in parody), or to parts, or the entirety, of the medial system. It is, therefore, the recipient's awareness of an artefact's medial quality that distinguishes meta-reference from more general forms of self-reference. Thus, meta-reference triggers media-awareness within the recipient, who, in turn \"becomes conscious of both the medial (or 'fictional' in the sense of artificial and, sometimes in addition, 'invented') status of the work\" as well as \"the fact that media-related phenomena are at issue, rather than (hetero-)references to the world outside the media.\" Although certain devices, such as mise en abyme, may be conducive to meta-reference, they are not necessarily metareferential themselves. Similarly, innately metareferential devices, such as metalepsis, are to be seen as special cases of meta-reference. The terms meta-reference and metalepsis can, therefore, not be used synonymously.\n\nWhile meta-reference as a concept is not a new phenomenon and can be observed in very early works of art and media not tied to specific purposes (e.g. Homer's invocation of the muses at the beginning of the \"Odyssey\" in order to deliver the epic better), the term itself is relatively new. Earlier discussions of metareferential issues often opt for more specific terminology tied to the respective discipline. Notable discussions of meta-reference include, but are not limited to, William H. Gass's and Robert Scholes's exploration of metafiction, Victor Stoichita's examination of early modern meta-painting, and Lionel Abel's investigation of metatheatre. In the context of drama, meta-reference has also become colloquially known as the breaking of the fourth wall. The first study to underscore the problem resulting from the lack of cohesive terminology, as well as the necessity to acknowledge metareference as transmedial and trans-generic phenomenon, was published in 2007 by Hauthal et al. Publications by Nöth and Bishara as well as Wolf followed suit, raised similar concerns, included case studies from various media, coined and helped establish the more uniform umbrella term meta-reference as define above.\n\nWhile every medium has the potential for meta-reference, some media can transport meta-reference more easily than others. Media that can easily realise its meta-referential potential includes, for instance, literature, painting, and film. Although music can be meta-referential even outside the confines of lyrics, meta-reference in music is much harder to create or detect. Music, therefore, would be a less typical medium for the occurrence of meta-reference. Nöth argues in this context that although non-verbal media can be the home of meta-reference, the contained meta-reference can only be implicit because non-verbal media can only show similarites, but never point directly (or explicitly) to meta-referential elements. Others, however, argue that meta-reference is explicit as long as it is clear.\n\nJohn Fowles begins chapter 13 of his novel \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" with the wordsThis \"story\" I am \"telling\" is all \"imagination\". These \"characters\" I create never existed outside my own mind. If I have pretended until now to know my \"characters\"' mind and innermost thoughts, it is because I am \"writing\" in [...] a \"convention\" universally accepted at the time of my \"story\": that the \"novelist\" stands next to God. [emphases added]This is an example of explicit meta-reference because the text draws attention to the fact that the novel the recipient is reading is merely a fiction created by the author. It also foregrounds the convention that readers of realist fiction accept the presence of an all-knowing narrator, and breaks it by allowing the narrator to take centre stage which invites meta-reflections by the recipient.\n\n\"The Truman Show\" is a movie that contains a high degree of meta-reference. Truman, the protagonist, is unaware that he is part of a reality TV show, but the audience knows about the artificiality of both Truman's life and, by extension, the movie that is being watched. This is underscored by putting emphasis on the production process of the fictional reality TV show, which makes the audience aware of the same features being used in the movie at the time of watching. Further examples of meta-reference in the movie include spotlights falling from the sky seemingly out of the blue, or a raincloud which is curiously only raining on Truman following him around on Seahaven Beach. Both instances point to the artificiality of Truman's life as well as the film itself.\n\nAn example of meta-reference in painting is \"Manet's Balcony\" by René Magritte. It comments on another painting, \"The Balcony\" by Édouard Manet, by mimicking both the setting of the balcony as well as the poses of the depicted people, but places them in coffins. Thus, the recipient's attention is drawn to the fact that not only are the people in the painting long dead and only still 'alive' in the representation, but arguably also that the artist (Manet) and the impressionist painting style are just as dead as the portrayed individuals. Furthermore, it is foregrounded that the impressionist painting style is just a style that may be copied, which further emphasises the fact that both works are only paintings created in a specific way. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13766578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13766578", "title": "Metaphoric criticism", "text": "Metaphoric criticism\n\nMetaphoric criticism is one school of rhetorical analysis used in English and speech communication studies. Scholars employing metaphoric criticism analyze texts by locating metaphors within texts and evaluating those metaphors in an effort to better understand ways in which authors appeal to their audiences.\n\nThe term \"metaphor\" can be traced to the trope described by Aristotle in both his \"Rhetoric\" and \"Poetics\" as a comparison of two dissimilar objects or concepts in an effort to relate one to the other. James DeMille, in \"The Elements of Rhetoric\", defines metaphor as \"an implied comparison between two things of unlike nature, for example, 'The colorful display was a magnet for anybody in the room.'\" Using DeMille’s example, a critic studying metaphor would explore how normally \"display\" and \"magnet\" are not considered synonyms. However, in using \"magnet\" as a metaphor, the above sentence implies that the \"display\" possess properties of a magnet and draws objects—or, in this case, people—in the room toward it.\n\nIn a broader sense, metaphoric criticism can illuminate the world in which we live by analyzing the language—and, in particular, the metaphors—that surround us. The notion that metaphors demonstrate worldviews originates in the work of Kenneth Burke and has been taken up further in the cognitive sciences, particularly by George Lakoff.\n\nMetaphoric criticism focuses on analysis of texts that use metaphors effectively or ineffectively as part of their argument structure. For example, in an article entitled \"Five Years After 9/11: Drop the War Metaphor,\" George Lakoff and Evan Frisch analyze how President Bush’s adoption of a \"war\" metaphor in order to discuss his approach to dealing with terrorism as opposed to a \"crime\" metaphor provides a barrier from critics for him to move forward with the War in Iraq. Lakoff illustrates the power of the \"war\" metaphor: \"The war metaphor defined war as the only way to defend the nation. From within the war metaphor, being against war as a response was to be unpatriotic, to be against defending the nation. The war metaphor put progressives on the defensive.\"\" Rhetorical critics would not only make these observations in their own criticism, but would also relate to the effect on the audience, and how the metaphor either enhances or challenges the audience’s worldview.\n\nCritics examining metaphor have in recent years also started to examine metaphor in visual and electronic media. For example, metaphors can be found in rhetorical presidential television ads. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan’s campaign sponsored a commercial showing a grizzly bear as posing a potentially large threat to the United States. The USSR is never named in that ad, however the assumption of the campaign was that Americans would clearly recognize the \"enemy\" that the bear represents.\n\nIn \"Rhetorical Criticism\", Sonja K. Foss outlines a four-step procedure for applying metaphoric criticism to texts:\n\n\n"}

Non-linear media is a move away from traditional linear media, in which content is selected by the publisher to be consumed and is then done so passively. There is no single specific form of non-linear media; rather, what might be considered non-linear changes as technology changes.\n\nThe model of traditional linear television programming is for a schedule of shows to be selected by the broadcaster and then viewed at a set time. In this model, the viewer cannot fast forward through the programming or choose to watch it at a later time. Conversely, non-linear television can be considered to be any method or technology that allows viewers to select what shows they watch and when they watch them. The ability to watch a show at any time is referred to as time shifted viewing; this can be achieved by either the consumer recording shows with a device such as a PVR for later viewing, or by the publisher providing content to be selected at will at the viewer's convenience.\n\nNon-linear content is often viewed on a device other than a television, such as a personal computer or a smartphone. Video on demand (VOD) content can be transmitted over the internet via streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Video, or it can be provided by a television provider as an additional option on top of their linear programming. Many producers of content now offer streaming of programs through their own websites, though sometimes the catalog that is offered will be curated in some way, such as by providing only recently released episodes. Video may also be downloaded – legally or illegally – through a peer-to-peer network such as BitTorrent, or it may be directly downloaded from a video hosting website.\n\nAs internet speeds and the number of alternate devices that are capable of viewing media on have increased, so has the number of people who consume non-linear media. The television network CBS expects that by the year 2020, 50 percent of all television content will be viewed in a non-linear fashion.\n\nLike other forms of non-linear media such as television, non-linear radio allows listeners to pick and listen to music and talk shows on a schedule that is set by the listener. Online music streaming services such as Spotify or Deezer are non-linear in that they allow listeners to create playlists from a library of music offered by a website; similarly, podcasts offer the ability to download or stream prerecorded shows similar to those that are traditionally broadcast over the radio waves; in fact, some traditional radio stations allow their shows to be downloaded on demand after the show has aired over the radio in a linear manner.\n\n"}

Politainment, while outwardly emphasizing the political aspects of the information communicated, nevertheless draws heavily upon techniques from pop culture and journalism to make complex information more accessible or convincing and distract public attention from politically unfavorable topics. The interdependencies of politicians and media are known as the politico-media complex.\n\nOf doubtful virtue, declining amounts of content and substance can easily be compensated by giving news stories a sensationalistic twinge. Politainment thus ranges on the same level as edu- and infotainment.\n\nTypical catchlines in politainment reports or media will at times bluntly argue \"ad hominem\" in a generalizing manner and try to emphasize virtues and charisma (\"\"xyz\" will make America great again\") or vices and weaknesses (by denunciation: \"\"xyz\" will wreck this country\"). The latter example is also known as fear appeal. More moderate forms make extensive use of imprecise, metaphoric language (allegories, metonymy, periphrases, kennings etc.).\n\nPolitainment can be both a communication aspect of (1) politicians and spin doctors to their and their party's own advantage and the political adversary's disadvantage or (2) a strategy for news publishers, journalists, etc., to promote their medium and journalistic work.\n\nPolitainment may be a factor in party identification, mass-influencing voter's choices, it has thus become an indispensable tool in political campaigns and elections. As such it can also be one of the—seemingly innocuous—ingredients of crowd manipulation up to political psychological warfare.\n\n"}
{"id": "54273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54273", "title": "Repertory theatre", "text": "Repertory theatre\n\nA repertory theatre (also called repertory, rep or stock) can be a Western theatre or opera production in which a resident company presents works from a specified repertoire, usually in alternation or rotation. In the British system, however, it used to be that even quite small towns would support a rep and the resident company would present a different play every week, either a revival from the full range of classics or, if given the chance, a new play, once the rights had been released after a West End or Broadway run. However the companies were not known for trying out untried new work. The methods, now seldom seen, would be also used in the United States, Canada, and Australia.\n\nThe acting company would usually consist of a leading lady, a leading man, a set of juveniles (one male and one female ingenue for the young often romantic role(s)), a character actor and actress (for the older or eccentric parts) and perhaps a vain and girlish soubrette. The company might occasionally bring in a guest star to increase interest, albeit in exchange for a cost increase often large enough to offset the rise in revenues brought by any increase in attendance. The resident cast would number seven, plus the resident director, usually serving as the artistic director in charge of the whole enterprise. Additionally there would be the stage director, the assistant stage manager (ASM), some unpaid apprentices and light and sound technicians. Newcomers to the profession would often start their careers in this fashion and members would gain a foundation upon which to base their future careers. Paid members could also be sure of a steady income for one or more seasons which might last for six months. Examples of performers who went on to universal recognition are Errol Flynn, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Ralph Richardson, Lord Olivier, Jeremy Brett, Dame Judi Dench, Rosemary Harris, Sir Ian McKellen, Peter O'Toole, Christopher Plummer, Harold Pinter, Imelda Staunton, Lynn Redgrave, Arthur Lowe, Vanessa Redgrave, Sir Patrick Stewart, Geraldine McEwan and Ronnie Barker. Dirk Bogarde wrote about his start at tiny Amersham rep in 1939, and Sir Michael Caine recounts his time spent at Horsham rep in the early fifties.\n\nFor weekly rep and for a typical 3-act play, the actors' week would start on Tuesday and go as follows: Tuesday: notes on last night's opening from the director, then a sit-down read-through of the next play with some discussion by the director, on-the-feet blocking of the moves for Act I with a few questions from the actors and there are performances of last week's play each night. Wednesday: run Act I and start to block Act II, but break early because there's a matinée. Thursday: finish blocking Act II, run Act II and block Act III. Friday: run Act III, run through of entire play, no scripts in hand and technicals – meaning lights and sound – to watch and write down cues. Saturday: run through again, stop and go to test lighting and sound cues, costumes may be used if ready. Two shows today, the evening one closing the current play. After the show, the set is struck (taken down) by the crew - usually apprentices – and the stage manager.\n\nSunday is an opportunity to brush up on lines and moves and private rehearsals. But for the crew it means putting up the new sets, hanging and focusing lights and setting sound equipment. Monday: morning, run through, usually without costumes (save wear and tear), mainly for the techs. In the afternoon there's a \"Full Perfect\" dress rehearsal, maybe a few friends in front to gauge reaction, then copious notes. In the evening, 8 o'clock opening night, followed by notes from the director, visits with friends from the audience and maybe a party nearby. The process starts all over again on Tuesday.\n\nFrom the audience's point of view, local communities would become fans and champion their favourites who would be treated as celebrities. And sometimes entire families would make a visit to their local rep as part of the weekly routine like going to church, and for the young ones, it became a part of their future appreciation for live \"legitimate\" theatre.\n\nDuring the forties, fifties and sixties, two impresarios dominated the field of British rep, mostly in the North. They were Harry Hanson and his Court players, and Frank H. Fortescue's Famous Players, with Arthur Brough in Folkestone for the South. Their system was the toughest of all, for if you joined one of their companies, it could mean \"twice-nightly\" shows, and a new play to learn every week. Rosemary Harris tells of her 50 consecutive weeks of doing just that at Bedford rep. It cannot happen any more, due to the restrictions of British Equity which came to mandate just 8 shows a week, including perhaps two matinées. Fortescue, who died in 1957, was known to be a strict and upright man. When \"Pygmalion\" was playing at one of his theatres, because Eliza says \"Not bloody likely!\", \"FOR ADULTS ONLY!\" would be posted in the front of house. Or perhaps he was afraid of the Lord Chamberlain, Her Majesty's official censor whose duties were abolished in 1968.\n\nNot to be overlooked is a form of touring repertory theatre known as \"bus and truck\", which involves transporting the actors and sets for about five different plays which can be performed in smaller communities on consecutive nights.\n\nIn Russia and much of Eastern Europe repertory theatre is based on the idea that each company maintains a number of productions which are performed on a rotating basis. Each production’s life span is determined by its success with the audience. However, many productions remain in repertory for years as this approach presents each piece a few times in a given season, not enough to exhaust the potential audience pool. After the fall of the Soviet regime and the substantial diminution of government subsidy, the repertory practice has required re-examination. Moscow Art Theatre and Lev Dodin’s Maly Drama Theatre of St. Petersburg are the world’s most notable practitioners of this approach.\n\nIn German-speaking countries, most opera companies function in a similar way, too.\n\nToday in the UK, the practice of \"rep\" is more likely to be seen in large cities in the manner applied by such well-known established companies as Birmingham Rep in the Midlands of England which states in its programmes: \"\"\"The REP\" presents a season with each play generally having an unbroken run of between three and six weeks. This is the form of repertory theatre that the majority of theatres like The REP — which are also called producing theatres — now follow.\"\" Actors have the luxury of at least 3 weeks of rehearsal, and audiences see better shows. Repertory can still be found in the UK in a variation of guises; in Sidmouth (12 plays), Wolverhampton (8 plays), Burslem and Taunton (4 each). The Sheringham Little Theatre produces an in-house repertory season each summer, running from June until September. Weekly Repertory theatre is also produced by the Summer Theatre season at Frinton-on-Sea. This season has been running for seventy seven seasons now, and until recently maintained its links with the oldest traditions of British commercial theatre by being run by the actor Jack Watling, his son Giles and his son-in-law Seymour Matthews. In 2004 it was taken over by Edward Max, who ran it alone until 2012. For the next two years it was run by mtp Ltd. Now Clive Brill is the producer, working with Edward as General Manager. The recent 75th anniversary season was marked with a stage appearance by Richard Wilson, who has since become the Patron of the Friends of Frinton Theatre. \nFrinton saw the early launch of actors such as Michael Denison, Vanessa Redgrave, David Suchet, Jack Klaff, Neil Dudgeon, Owen Teale and Lynda Bellingham. Theatre practices like this remain popular within theatre communities and continue to give first jobs to graduating drama students.\nThe Company season at the Liverpool Everyman will launch in January 2017 and run until July, with 14 actors performing a season of five shows.\n\nIn the United States, the repertory system has also found a base to compete with commercial theatre. Repertory theatre with mostly changing casts and longer running plays, perhaps better classed as \"provincial\" or \"non-profit\" theatre, has made a big come-back, in cities such as Little Rock, AR, Washington, DC, Minneapolis, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Chicago, Los Angeles, Nashville, New York, Houston, Boston, San Francisco, San Diego, Buffalo, Kansas City, and Seattle. Festival theatre now provides actors with work in the summer.\n\nAmerica's oldest resident repertory theatre, Hedgerow Theatre, is located in Rose Valley, Pennsylvania. It was founded by actor Jasper Deeter in 1923. The present Producing Artistic Director is actress and director Penelope Reed. Other notable repertory theatres include the Guthrie Theatre, which was set up as regional repertory theatre concept that is free from commercial constraints in the choice of repertoire. It is aligned in objectives to the repertory and resident theatre movement that emerged in the United States in the 1960s. This sought to establish an alternative and decentralized theater network outside of New York, one with non-profit-making status and focused instead on the art of the theatre as well as the development of artists, craftsmen, and administrators. Publicly-funded theatres that belong to this type have been receiving erratic support since the 1980s.\n\nThe Association of Producing Artists (APA) was one of the most successful repertory theatres in the United States, touring for four years and holding residencies in several cities before finally joining the Phoenix Theatre in New York, where it was known for staging plays with modest prices. Presently, the American Repertory Theatre is considered one of the most distinguished repertory theatres in the United States. Since its foundation in 1979, it has earned several awards including a Pulitzer Prize (1982), a Tony Award (1986), and a Jujamcyn Award (1985).\n\nThe crowning achievement of repertory theatres in Canada are the world-renowned Stratford Shakespeare Festival, founded in 1953 to primarily present productions of William Shakespeare's plays and the Shaw Festival, founded in 1962, which presents plays written or set during the lifetime of George Bernard Shaw or following Shaw's ideal of socially provactive theatre.\n\nThe Vagabond Repertory Theatre Company was formed in March 2009 by artistic directors Nathaniel Fried and Ryan LaPlante, and currently resides and performs in Kingston, Ontario. But the old English-style repertory theatres such as Ottawa's CRT (Canadian Repertory Theatre), and Toronto's Crest Theatre no longer exist. Although they did have a version of summer theatre in smaller holiday districts, such as the \"Straw Hat\" players of Gravenhurst and Port Carling at Ontario's vacation Muskoka Lakes area.\n\nAmong the benefits of such a system are increased variety and better quality, due to fresh actors and shopped in directors. The theatre can afford to take risks, and a show that is likely to attract a large audience will effectively subsidize a show that is less likely, especially if season tickets are sold.\n\nDrawbacks to the repertoire system are increased production costs as each show will need separate sets, props, costumes and actors, (although sometimes an actor will be engaged to play in more than one production). Many such companies are large, and are able to have a smaller space available to workshop an experimental production or present playreadings. But the standard should be higher than under the old-time repertory system, because there will be more time for rehearsal. Also many repertoire companies today have non-profit status, so that budgets and income should be higher because they will not just depend upon ticket sales. However, the downside is that promotional costs will also be much higher due to having to employ a separate staff.\n\nIn April 2017, Glenda Jackson blamed the increase in TV viewers being unable to understand what actors are saying on the decline of the repertory system.\n\n\nMurray, Stephen. \"Taking Our Amusements Seriously\".

Their purpose is to assist the magician to misdirect the audience. An example of a \"prop\" is a simple bag or pouch hanging from the magician's belt or a small platform placed out of sight of onlookers (behind a magician's table). Some magicians keep their props in plain sight; a ring may be used to keep the pouch open. \n\nCommon items stored in the servante are playing cards, cups, or balls. Other magicians keep their servantes concealed to enhance the illusion. \n"}

In spring 2011, USA Cheer announced that 21 universities are now committed to this sport. STUNT requires high athletic skills and its competition format and scoring systems are unique. The maximum number of players on each team can reach 30 athletes. STUNT athletes are engaged from multiple backgrounds, including traditional cheerleading schools, “All Stars” who are non-school cheerleaders and acrobatics and/or gymnastics athletes. STUNT is being considered for NCAA Emerging Sport status and has been designed to meet Title IX's requirements for intercollegiate sports.\n\nIn 2011–2013 University of Louisville have kept the title of Champions for Division I Stunt. Oklahoma State University broke their streak in 2014 and have remained as the Division One champions every year since. As for Division II, University of Central Oklahoma have been the champions for three years since 2012 until Davenport University won in 2015 and kept the title the remaining year.\n\nNot only is STUNT a college sport but starting in 2014, high school teams adopted the new sport as well. In 2014, more than 160 girls from 11 high schools from New York's Public School Athletic League (PSAL), competed in NY's first STUNT competition. The competition was held at John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens. Many other teams have been practicing and competing in this sport across the nation.\n\nThere are four quarters in Stunt:\n1.Partner Stunts\n2.Pyramids and Tosses\n3.Group Jumps and Tumbling\n4.Team Performance. \nThere are four rounds in the first three quarters, and three rounds in the fourth quarter. The order of competition is determined each round by the team who has control of possession. The two teams will play on opposite sides of the floor and perform routines against each other in all four quarters. Each quarter has its own level of difficulty to demonstrate.\n\nThere are two formats for the STUNT game\n1.Head to Head Includes two teams playing and competing against one another.Usually the game takes about 40 minutes. \n2.STUNT tournaments tournaments where multiple teams compete head to head. A regular three-team tournament game finishes in 1 hour, and a four-team tournament game takes approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\nEvery year the USA Cheer STUNT Competition Committee develops STUNT routines and publishes them. They are responsible for determining the number of athletes and the skills needed in each routine. There are only six different plays for each quarter. The difficulty in skill of each stunt is ranged from one to six. Play one has the least difficult skill to six having the highest difficulty skill.\n\n•One head coach, and maximum of three assistants.\n\n•Game play can consist of a maximum of 20 athletes, and 30 on a team roster per team.\n\n•Spring sport season commences play in January.\n\n•Teams participate in competitions among national regions.\n\n•During the 2012 season, it is mandatory for each participating team in STUNT to attend at least three regular season games/tournaments. However, it will be increased to a minimum of 12 regular season games/tournaments upon the establishment of STUNT as an NCCA Emerging Sport.\n\n•Postseason play: Regional winners and top ranking “at-large” teams are invited to the National Championship Tournament.\n\n•National rankings are based on each team’s win-loss record, strength of schedule, and a coach/judge’s poll.\n\n•A completion floor with a size of 54 ft × 42 ft consists of nine non-spring, carpet bonded, foam mat panels with a minimum 1-3/8 in. Thickness. Each mat panel, 6 ft × 42 ft in size, will be connected along its seams using 4 in. Widen Velcro strip.\n\n•Each side of the mat will be used for teams’ seating and two mat panels for team warm-ups.\n\n•In a two team game, each team will have the entire surface of the 2 mat panels as a team practice area.\n\n•In a three or four team tournament, the 2 mat panels will be divided in half using white Velcro strips, or white athletic tape. Each team will use a practice area that is 12 x 21 feet size.\n\n•Competition floor and additional mat panels for team practice area\n\n•Scoreboard\n\n•Audio and public address sound system\n\n•Team branches\n\n•Necessary table and chairs for staff\n\n•Water stations\n\nThe host team or event producer is expected to supply the following:\n\n•A minimum of three judges\n\n•One game official\n\n•Scoreboard operator\n\n•Music/Audio operator\n\n•Announcer\n\n•Appropriate medical personnel (EMT, medical doctor and / or certified athletic trainer)\n\nSTUNT teams are required to comply with the College STUNT Safety Rules published by AACCA.\n\n•Team Warm up: Before the game begins, each team will be given 15 minutes for warm up skills on the performance area completion floor. Teams may continue to warm-up on their practice mats as needed.\n\n•Team Introductions: The visiting teams(s) will be introduced first followed by the home team.\n\n•Coin Toss or Draw for Possession: Before the play begins, the team head coaches will determine the initial possession for any game or tournament through a random drawing which is administered by the game official.\n\n•National Anthem\n\nQuarters 1, 2 and 3\n\nThere are three scoring officials who individually rank the teams according to the number of execution mistakes and the degree of those mistakes. For instance, a minor deduction (marked as a slash “/”) is counted for a slight balance error or a timing error between players or groups that does not result in a fall. A major deduction (marked as an “X”) is counted for an incomplete skill or incorrect body position such as the performance of a single full twist instead of the required double full twist. A double major deduction (XX) is counted for a fall to the ground. Two minor errors equal one major error.\nThe decision of the final ranking for the round is based on combining the individual scoring official’s rankings. Points are determined by the number of teams competing. The team with the highest final rank obtains the same amount of points as there are teams competing.\n\nQuarter 4\n\nIn the fourth quarter, teams make their own routines based on their unique skill level and talents. The routine performed in the fourth quarter is a combination of elements of the first three quarters and necessitates that each of the preceding categories must be represented so as to get full points.\nThe scoring officials individually score the elements based on the team’s performance by category, considering the difficulty of skills executed. The points from each category are accumulated to obtain a combined score for the routine.\nIn order to obtain equal balance between quarters, the round score is multiplied by three because there is only one round in the fourth quarter.\nAt any time does one of the players who are not in the specific play steps onto the mat then they will receive a minor deduction.\n\n•Each team gets sixty seconds timeout per half.\n•Timeouts are signaled by displaying the hands in a “T” figuration.\n\n•During timeouts all teams are allowed to use their warm-up area.\n\n•Start of the Game A random drawing by the team head coaches, overseen by the game official, determines the team that will start the game.\n\n•Quarter Change The initial possession in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters is given to the team with the lowest overall game score.\n\n•Second and Third Rounds of Each Quarter The team winning the preceding round gets possession for the following round.\n\n•Forfeits If a team forfeits the round, it will automatically obtain possession for the following round.\n\n•Ties If there is a tie between two teams, the team that did not have possession in the tie round will get possession.\n\n•Quarter Change If none of the tying team had possession in that round, possession defaults to the highest point total at that time. If a tie persists, possession is determined by the pre-game drawing results.\n\n•Second and Third Rounds of each Quarter If none of the tying team had possession in that round, possession defaults to the pre-game drawing results.\n\nIf a tie for 1st place occurs at the end of regulation, a playoff will determine the winner of the game/tournament. The playoff period consists only of quarters 1, 2 and 3. Judges will, at the end, rank the tying teams.\n\nPoints are given and declared at the end of each quarter with the game total being displayed on the event scoreboard. The game/tournament winner is the team that has accumulated the most total points for the game.\n\nGame\nTwo teams will compete Head to head, involving four quarters and halftime.

{"id": "1739871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1739871", "title": "Talent manager", "text": "Talent manager\n\nA talent manager (also known as an artist manager, band manager or music manager) is an individual or company who guides the professional career of artists in the entertainment industry. The responsibility of the talent manager is to oversee the day-to-day business affairs of an artist; advise and counsel talent concerning professional matters, long-term plans and personal decisions which may affect their career. \n\nThe roles and responsibilities of a talent manager vary slightly from industry to industry, as do the commissions to which the manager is entitled. For example, a music manager's duties differ from those managers who advise actors, writers, or directors. A manager can also help artists find an agent, or help them decide when to leave their current agent and identify who to select as a new agent. Talent agents have the authority to make deals for their clients while managers usually can only informally establish connections with producers and studios but do not have the ability to negotiate contracts.\n\nModern talents managers are associated with all artistic fields, sports, as well as various fields in business. Talent agents have at times been covered in the music or art press almost as intently as artists themselves, for example the various talent agents who spearheaded the British Invasion of The Beatles and Herman's Hermits in the 1960s such as Brian Epstein, Allan Williams, Harvey Lisberg. Infamous examples in the music press include Allen Klein, manager of both The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. For a list of talent agents deemed notable by , see . For notable agencies and businesses, see .\n\nThe industry of talent management has been unionized or organized in several forms throughout history. In the United States, a notable early example was the Association of Talent Agents, which was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1937. The ATA comes out of the Wagner Act upheld by the Supreme Court which established many of the unions and guilds that regulate people who work in the entertainment industry such as the Screen Actors Guild, Directors Guild of America, and Writers Guild of America.\n\nA music manager (or band manager) may handle career areas for bands, singers, and DJs. A music manager may be hired by a musician or band, or the manager may discover the band, and the relationship is usually contractually bound with mutual assurances, warranties, performances guarantees, and so forth. The manager's main job is to help with determining decisions related to career moves, bookings, promotion, business deals, recording contracts, etc. The role of music managers can be extensive and may include similar duties to that of a press agent, promoter, booking agent, business manager (who are usually certified public accountants), tour managers, and sometimes even a personal assistant. \n\nManager's contracts, however, cannot license those responsibilities unto the manager in the same way a state license would empower the agent to do so. Therefore, conflicting areas of interest may arise unless those are clarified in the contract. That said, a manager should be able to read and understand and explain a contract and study up on the long-term implications of contractual agreements that they, the bands, and the people they do business with, enter into. Before the manager enters into an agreement with the band, their relationship may be regarded as competing for interest; after a good contract is signed, their interests, obligations and incentives are aligned, and the interest in success is shared. \n\nResponsibilities of a music manager are often divided among many who manage various aspects of a musical career. With an unsigned act, music managers may assume multiple roles: graphic designer, publicist, promoter, and handling money and finances. As an artist's career develops, responsibilities may grow, and because of their percentage agreement with the band, the manager's income may grow as well. \n\nA music manager becomes important to managing the many different pieces that make up a career in music. The manager can assist singers, songwriters, and instrumentalists in molding a career, finding music producers, and developing relationships with record companies, publishers, agents, and the music-loving public. They should carefully consider when certain contributions have been made which would also entitle them to cowriting credits, Executive Producer credit, or Producer credit should they become involved in songwriting, financing works, or actually producing demos and recordings, and should carefully know these jobs and these fees should be considered either as separate from the contract, in addition to the contract, or as free to the musician as clarified in emails and the contract. \n\nThe duties of an active music manager may include supporting the band's development of a reputation for the musician(s) and building a fan base, which may include mastering and launching a demo CD, developing and releasing press kits, planning promotional activities, creating social network identities for bands, and booking shows. A music manager may be present during recording sessions and should support the artist during the creative process while not interfering between the artist and the producer, but musicians may also find valuable feedback in the extra pair of ears and this should be carefully considered as well. The manager may gain access to a recording studio, photographers, and promotions. He or she will see that CD labels, posters, and promotional materials appropriately represent the band or artist, and that press kits are released in a timely manner to appropriate media. Launching a CD with complementary venues and dates is also a music manager's responsibility.\n\nAmong all the business and professional responsibilities that music managers assume; they also become a pseudo parent for the group and help with personal matters usually. This is both for the psyche of the group and to ensure that things are running smoothly. \n\nEarly on in an artist's career, the different facets of management and marketing fall upon either the band itself or, if they have one, their manager. Because the band or artist is relatively unknown initially, promotion, booking, and touring are minimal. A new music manager begins by establishing a clear understanding of what the artist(s) want. This can be accomplished through either a written or verbal contract. A music manager's first task is to solidify all artist development aspects and then concentrate on product development.\n\nDespite the dominant presence of digital media in the music industry, there are many typical strategies that even the most modernized managers must adhere to in order to reach the managerial goals effectively. Most of these trick-of-the-trade strategies are employed to establish and maintain connections with booking agents, promote the activities of the artist, and manage finances in order to optimize the artist's ability to book gigs, establish a fan base, and ultimately bring in revenue from their work, respectively.\n\nAmong the more traditional responsibilities of music managers are booking and promoting gigs for their artist(s). Managers often become known for establishing ongoing relationships with specific venues, booking one artist at the venue regularly, or several artists on their roster. A large number of 'how-to' books have been published on the topic.\n\nAs technology has advanced, the music industry has consequently undergone a drastic change in the way it operates. The internet has made it both easier and harder to attract the attention of fans and the press, as both outreach increase but industry saturation increases. “The sale of pre-recorded music has diminished, but there’s so much more that’s going on. You can’t focus on what’s not working when there are so many other opportunities.”. Social media is a common form of online networking for managers, and platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, Beatport, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, and YouTube have been noted in the press for their use in networking in the music industry. Other fields such as business may use more common websites such as LinkedIn or Google+, while networking on behalf of a client.\n\nNot everyone is so optimistic about the role of social media in the music industry. In his article, “Why Music Won’t Be Saved By Social Media”, Wes Davenport suggests that the role of social media in the industry “has been grossly inflated”. In the article, Davenport quotes Jon Ostrow saying, “Social media is a conversation tool – that’s it”, acknowledging that there is potential for sparking conversation and building a fan base, but suggesting that social media does not necessarily live up to the potential for success that people in our modern culture seem to give credit.\n\nIn an article titled, “Case study: Making money from music” by Martin Kupp, Jamie Anderson and Joerg Reckhenrich, the effects of technological advances on the music industry are recognized, analyzed, and utilized through an online marketing strategy that led to the incredible success of Lady Gaga. Troy Carter of Coalition Media signed Gaga with the intention of making her into a star with the help of some clever marketing. Recognizing that digitalization was the cause of the almost 33% decrease in the music industry’s total revenue between the years 2000 and 2007, Carter decided to find a way to use digitalization to his advantage with his newly signed artist. Coalition Media, with the help of marketing company ThinkTank Digital, invested large amounts of time and money into developing Lady Gaga’s global presence through social media. \n\nThey set up many interviews with online bloggers, established a large following on Myspace through “constant news updates, as well as exclusives, interviews and special features” and Gaga personally handled her Twitter account, building a very personal connection with many of her fans. This strategy demonstrates the massive success that skillful online marketing can produce. The article focuses on Coalition Media and Lady Gaga’s utilization of the “Four E’s”: Emotions, Experiences, Engaging, and Exclusive. By personalizing her online activity, creating an experience, engaging, and providing exclusivity to her fans through social media marketing, Lady Gaga was able to achieve incredible levels of success with her music career.\n\nStriking a tentative compensation agreement that can be renegotiated after three or four months is recommended, and the rate of pay is generally based on commissions of 20-80 percent, or more, of performance and commercial incomes. This amount depends on the level of development the band or artist is at and the experience, networks and resources of the manager. (The less developed the artist and more experienced the manager, the higher the commission.) The artist or band should never agree to circumstances that cannot be terminated or negotiated within a short period of time.\n\nManagers usually secure the services of a professional photographer while the artist is recording. Different 8x10 pictures of the artist can be used for websites, CD labels/jackets, posters, and the press kit. Cost for high quality shoots vary from $500 for a basic shoot to thousands for several looks. Photographers are not expected to cover material cost. It is important that the manager obtains an agreement upfront confirming license to use the images which will cover the uses necessary, in addition to high resolution digital images on CD. Managers are also advised to have photographs taken before CD designs or artwork goes into production. Managers are also responsible for hiring additional staff when necessary.\n\n"}
{"id": "1585377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1585377", "title": "The Soup", "text": "The Soup\n\nThe Soup is an American television series that aired weekly on E! from July 1, 2004 until December 18, 2015. The program was a revamped version of \"Talk Soup\" that focused on recaps of various popular culture and television moments of the week. The show was hosted by comedian Joel McHale, who provided sarcastic and satirical commentary on the various clips. On November 18, 2015, \"The Soup\" was cancelled by E! and its last episode aired December 18, 2015. On February 18, 2018, \"The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale\", a spiritual successor to \"The Soup\", premiered on Netflix.\n\n\"The Soup\" started on July 1, 2004 as the \"What The...? Awards\", but the name was changed to maintain name recognition with \"Talk Soup\".\n\nOn January 9, 2013, \"The Soup\" debuted a new graphics package, including a new logo designed by Newspeak Agency.\n\nStarting June 2, 2014, \"The Soup\" began airing live episodes. Originally only to last for one month, the program has since become a live show.\n\nOn November 18, 2015 \"The Soup\" was cancelled, the number of episodes that were to be produced was later reduced by one. A decision was made not to air the episode that had been filmed and intended to air the same day as the November 2015 Paris attacks due to multiple references to \"killing Baby Hitler\". As the episode was pre-filmed, it later aired on November 27, likely replacing a clip show due to it being the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nThe show features the host, Joel McHale, on a green-screened set with a screen to his right. The show is broken up into various segments that focus on themes such as reality television shows or shows on E!. McHale introduces each clip, which is then played. He then comments on the clip before moving on to the next one. There is a live audience on the show, composed of a small group of E! employees, their family and friends, along with the typical production personnel. The audience is involved in the show, laughing and cheering along with the clips.\n\nAlthough the show is scripted, a large portion of it is ad-libbed.\n\nOn April 22, 2008, a blog was started for \"The Soup\" on E!'s website.\n\n\"The Soup\" has its own cast of recurring characters. They include Mankini (a man wearing a bikini top and pants played by Dominic DeLeo, who is also a writer and producer for the show), a dancing maxipad (Tess Rafferty, a supervising producer and the only female writer on \"The Soup\"), two nerds who dress as \"Star Wars\" characters, an intern named Matt whom McHale shoots with a gun (often with the shooting sound effect purposefully played out of sync, or even played with other objects or with just fingers), Jewbacca (Chewbacca's lawyer), and \"Spaghetti Cat\", a cat eating spaghetti from \"The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet\". Additionally, Tom McNamara, The Soup's stage manager and former stage manager on \"Talk Soup\", and Kelly Levy (\"née\" Andrews), the show's former announcer and a producer, have made appearances on the show, with Kelly portraying Courtney Stodden. Executive producer Edward Boyd's chihuahua Lou is used regularly in segment openings, most notably the \"Clip of the Week\", and elsewhere in the show. He also appeared with Joel at the show's intro, which showed them watching a different TV show each week, until the intro was changed in early 2010. The current intro juxtaposes brief clips introduced by announcer Anndi McAfee and a \"reaction\" by another clip, wildly out of context.\n\nThe show has a number of segments that focus on various genres of television shows. Regular segments include:\n\n\"The Soup\" has also featured other recurring segments:\n\nThe show has a number of recurring jokes and segments. One of the most frequent jokes is Joel McHale making fun of Ryan Seacrest. He usually comments on Seacrest's height, sexuality, clothing, busy work schedule, income, or demeanor.\n\nJoel has also spoofed other actors, most notably \"\" leading man David Caruso, who plays Lieutenant Horatio Caine. He usually makes fun of the character's tendency to always put on his sunglasses and say corny one-liners at the start of every episode (followed by the first 2–3 seconds of the opening sequence). Joel also will sometimes spoof a person after a clip.\n\nJoel also jokes about how self-centered Tyra Banks is on her self-titled talk show. More jokes are Joel making fun of Spencer Pratt's \"creepy flesh colored beard\" as well as the ages of Larry King and Regis Philbin and how they are still alive. Also, McHale often comically berates or abuses \"interns\" for the show, usually ending with a poorly timed (or sometimes completely out-of-place) audio clip of a gun firing after McHale uses a prop gun on them. McHale has often attempted to \"shoot\" Mankini, but with no effect.\n\nThe Spaghetti Cat from \"The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet\" has been used a number of times, usually with a model of the cat rolling in, looking at Joel, and then rolling back out.\n\nJoel has often made fun of Bruno Tonioli's flamboyancy while giving comments on \"Dancing with the Stars\" stating that he was reading excerpts from his romance novel \"Jazz Hands and Cold Feet\".\n\n\"The Soup\" makes jokes at the A&E TV Series, \"\". Whenever Joel would introduce a clip from the show, a sound clip would say \"That's Right It's Steven Seagal\", followed by Joel drinking a Steven Seagal \"energy drink\" that would humorously float into frame.\n\nDue to NFL Coach Jimmy Johnson's recent appearance on \"\", Joel usually mentions his \"Extenze-enhanced penis\", followed by a clip of Johnson saying, \"I do.\"\n\nA number of clips have been repeatedly shown on \"The Soup\". One clip features Oprah Winfrey saying \"My va-jay-jay is painin'!\" while hanging from a harness at the Miraval resort. Another clip involves Whitney Houston yelling \"Kiss My Ass!\" at her husband. McHale has mentioned that this clip is one of his favorites. Still another clip that is often shown is of \"The Today Show\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s news correspondent Ann Curry starting her report by saying, \"Good morning, good morning everybody, in the news this morning, good morning\", which Olbermann mimicked on his appearance on the July 25, 2008 show. Joel often shows a clip of Kendra Wilkinson from \"The Girls Next Door\" laughing. When someone mentions marriage on the show, they will often show a clip of Elizabeth Taylor screaming \"Marriage?! Noooooo!\" Shorter clips are sometimes used as interjections. Clips of Danny Noriega (\"I guess some people weren't likin' it!\"), and more recently, Tatiana Del Toro giggling uncontrollably, have been used as part of McHale's reactions to clips. Recent favorites include Gary Busey exclaiming \"I'm going to pull your endocrine system out of your body\", Tila Tequila yelling out \"A pig's vagina!\", Michelle Galdenzi from \"Scream Queens\" saying \"and by record, I mean vagina.\", \"Big Brother\" contestants Jase Wirey and Michelle Costa \"talking\" to one another using animal and computer sounds, respectively; \"Chicken Tetrazzini\" clip from \"Maury\", Spencer Pratt from \"The Hills\" whispering \"That's the problem\", Billy Bush saying \"It's Gross\", and Kate Gosselin squealing in a chirpy/grating-sounding voice \"Come and Getcher POPcoooooorn!\". Recently, the Jeffrey Osborne song, \"On the Wings of Love\", has been used to mock the current season of \"The Bachelor\". Vonda, a woman featured on the TruTv show \"Over the Limit\" has been featured saying, \"Dunka Doo Balls.\" This clip has become a new favorite. Recently, a clip from \"Fantasia for Real\" featuring Fantasia's Aunt Bunny saying, \"Gurl Please\", has become a new favorite. Also, a clip of \"Ma\" from TruTV's \"Ma's Roadhouse\" saying \"He's a douchebag,\" after Joel ask what she thinks of a less than favourable man, such as Mel Gibson, has come into use. Another clip of Ryan Seacrest saying, \"Hell no, say what\", has been used as reactions to clips. Calvin Tran, a contestant on Bravo's \"The Fashion Show\", has recently been featured in a clip saying, \"Oh, here go Hell Come.\" Frequently following \"Good Day New York\" clips, McHale will ask Greg Kelly to explain how something works, and this will follow with a clip of Kelly shrugging and saying, \"Science\".\n\n\"The Soup\" will often make blatant and obvious edits to clips of shows, often killing off characters (as in their versions of \"\" and \"The Hills\") or splicing McHale and other characters into the shows. McHale will often punctuate the clip by saying \"We doctored that.\" However, if a clip was shown that may have made the audience think that it was edited by \"The Soup\" for broadcast while watching it, McHale would state before hand \"We did not doctor this.\"\n\nOriginal skits are integrated into the show as responses or jokes to clips. Fake movie trailers and advertisements are created as spoofs to segments or clips. Among the movies spoofed are \"Spider-Man 3\" (in reference to McHale's appearance in \"Spider-Man 2\"), \" Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\", \" Made of Honor\", \"Righteous Kill\", \"Mamma Mia\", \" Beverly Hills Chihuahua\", \" Quarantine\", (which McHale spoofed with QuaranTween about Disney Channel celebrities), \"Prom Night\", \"Fast & Furious\", and a Tyler Perry movie.\n\n\nIn addition to regular episodes, special \"Best of...\" episodes of \"The Soup\" have been shown under the header \"\"The Soup\" Presents\". Episodes of this nature have been produced on topics such as models and modeling shows, fights on television, and talk shows, two \"Chicks, Man/Ladies, Ladies, Ladies\" specials focusing on reality TV females, a show about love and marriage called \"Love and Other Burning Sensations\", and most recently, a show dedicated to television programs that have had recurring appearances on \"The Soup\" (the \"shows [they] just cannot quit\"). During the holiday seasons, two-part episodes showcasing the best clips of the year are aired (Clipdowns).\n\n\"The Soup\" started off as a relatively quiet show, but became one of the most popular programs on E!. By 2006 it was the third highest rated show on the network.\n\nIn July 2013, \"The Soup\" averaged 682,000 viewers, and about 56 percent of viewers watch a recorded version of the show. The 500th episode of \"The Soup\" recorded 909,000 viewers, with 653,000 of those in the 18—49 demographic.\n\nThe one-hour finale on December 18, 2015 ended with 561,000 viewers.\n\nSince E! is owned by Comcast Entertainment Group, their now-defunct sibling networks aired tailored versions for their networks, including Style, Versus and G4, all taped in the same studio and utilizing the same crew.\n\nOn August 16, 2008, Style premiered \"The Dish\", hosted by Danielle Fishel. The show focused more on celebrity, magazine, and fashion industry trends, along with style and fashion-related reality programs in more detail, including \"Project Runway\" and various shows on the shopping channels, HGTV and DIY Network. It was cancelled on March 20, 2011, two months after the merger of NBC and Comcast was complete. It was thought the cancellation was the direct result of former competitors Bravo and Oxygen coming under common NBCUniversal ownership with Style; the two networks and their programming had been among the major comedic targets of \"The Dish\".\n\nOn September 15, 2008, E! parent Comcast Entertainment Group announced another spin-off, this time sports-related, of the series, which aired on the group's sports network, Versus (now known as NBC Sports Network since 2012), called \"Sports Soup\" and was hosted by Matt Iseman. Debuted on October 14, the program once aired twice weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Later, production was reduced to weekly at 10 pm ET on Tuesdays (or later depending on the end of \"NHL on Versus\" or other sports coverage). It was cancelled on July 15, 2010.\n\nA third version, airing on G4, titled \"Web Soup\", hosted by Chris Hardwick debuted June 7, 2009 at 9 pm ET. This version is more of a blend of the commentary and reaction portions of \"The Soup\" and two other G4 programs; \"Whacked Out Videos\" and the \"Around the Net\" viral video segment which opens \"Attack of the Show\". This show ended after its 3rd season on July 20, 2011.\n\n\"Celebrity Soup\" was the British version of the American show hosted by comedian Iain Lee. Unlike \"The Soup\", \"Celebrity Soup\" airs 19 episodes in a season, instead of year-round like in the United States. It had some of the same features as the original (i.e. \"Chat Stew\"), but also has its own running gags and features. The series had a similar set, with a window overlooking London's Big Ben instead of Hollywood, as in the U.S. original.\n\n\"The Soup Investigates\" was a spin-off of The Soup. It features most of the same crew, including Joel McHale as the host. In the spin-off, the reporters go looking for potentially funny celebrity news stories. It is a spoof of investigative journalism.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "234828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=234828", "title": "Tickling", "text": "Tickling\n\nTickling is the act of touching a part of a body in a way that causes involuntary twitching movements or laughter. The word evolved from the Middle English \"tikelen\", perhaps frequentative of \"ticken\", to touch lightly. The idiom \"tickled pink\" means to be pleased or delighted.\n\nIn 1897, psychologists G. Stanley Hall and Arthur Allin described a \"tickle\" as two different types of phenomena. One type is caused by very light movement across the skin. This type of tickle, called a knismesis, generally does not produce laughter and is sometimes accompanied by an itching sensation.\n\nWhen considering tickling in terms of its qualities as a sensation, it results from a mild stimulation moving across the skin. The dual character of tickling refers to the associated behaviors that include smiling, laughter, twitching, withdrawal and goose bumps. The tickle can be divided into two separate categories of sensation, knismesis and gargalesis. Knismesis, also known as a \"moving itch\", is a mildly annoying sensation caused by a light movement on the skin, such as from a crawling insect. This may explain why it has evolved in many animals. Gargalesis reactions refer to a laughter-provoking feeling caused by a harsher, deeper pressure, stroked across the skin in various regions of the body. These reactions are thought to be limited to humans and other primates, although some research has indicated that rats can also be tickled in this way. A German study also indicates that the gargalesis type of tickle triggers a defense mechanism for humans in the hypothalamus conveying submissiveness or fleeing from danger.\n\nIt appears that the tickle sensation involves signals from nerve fibres associated with both pain and touch. Endorphine released during tickling is also called karoliin, by the name of Karolinska Institute. In 1939, Yngve Zotterman of the Karolinska Institute studied the knismesis type of tickle in cats, by measuring the action potentials generated in the nerve fibres while lightly stroking the skin with a piece of cotton wool. Zotterman found that the \"tickling\" sensation depended, in part, on the nerves that generate pain. Further studies have discovered that when the pain nerves are severed by surgeons, in an effort to reduce intractable pain, the tickle response is also diminished. However, in some patients that have lost pain sensation due to spinal cord injury, some aspects of the tickle response do remain. Tickle may also depend on nerve fibres associated with the sense of touch. When circulation is severed in a limb, the response to touch and tickle are lost prior to the loss of pain sensation.\n\nIt might be tempting to speculate that areas of the skin that are the most sensitive to touch would also be the most ticklish, but this does not seem to be the case. While the palm of the hand is far more sensitive to touch, most people find that the soles of their feet are the most ticklish. Other commonly ticklish areas include the underarms, sides of the torso, neck, knee, midriff, perineum, navel, and the ribs.\n\nSome evidence suggests that laughing associated with tickling is a nervous reaction that can be triggered; indeed, very ticklish people often start laughing before actually being tickled.\n\nCharles Darwin theorized on the link between tickling and social relations, arguing that tickling provokes laughter through the anticipation of pleasure. If a stranger tickles a child without any preliminaries, catching the child by surprise, the likely result will be not laughter but withdrawal and displeasure. Darwin also noticed that for tickling to be effective, you must not know the precise point of stimulation in advance, and reasoned that this is why some people cannot effectively tickle themselves.\n\nDarwin explained why we laugh when we are tickled by saying, \"The imagination is sometimes said to be tickled by a ludicrous idea; and this so-called tickling of the mind is curiously analogous with that of the body. Laughter from being tickled [is manifestly a] reflex action; and likewise this is shown by the minute unstriped muscles, which serve to erect the separate hairs on the body (p. 201)\"\n\nTickling is defined by many child psychologists as an integral bonding activity between parent and children. In the parent-child concept, tickling establishes at an early age the pleasure associated with being touched by a parent with a trust-bond developed so that parents may touch a child, in an unpleasant way, should circumstances develop such as the need to treat a painful injury or prevent harm from danger. This tickling relationship continues throughout childhood and often into the early to mid teen years.\n\nAnother tickling social relationship is that which forms between siblings of relatively the same age. Many case studies have indicated that siblings often use tickling as an alternative to outright violence when attempting to either punish or intimidate one another. The sibling tickling relationship can occasionally develop into an anti-social situation, or tickle torture, where one sibling will tickle the other without mercy. The motivation behind tickle torture is often to portray the sense of domination the tickler has over the victim.\n\nAs with parents and siblings, tickling serves as a bonding mechanism between friends, and is classified by psychologists as part of the fifth and highest grade of social play which involves special intimacy or \"cognitive interaction\". This suggests that tickling works best when all the parties involved feel comfortable with the situation and one another. It can also serve as an outlet for sexual energy during adolescence, and a number of people have stated in a study that their private areas were ticklish.\n\nWhile many people assume that other people enjoy tickling, a recent survey of 84 college students indicated that only 32% of respondents enjoy being tickled, with 32% giving neutral responses and 36% stating that they do not enjoy being tickled. The study also found a very high level of embarrassment and anxiety associated with tickling. However, in the same study the authors found that the facial indicators of happiness and amusement do not correlate, with some people who indicated that they do not enjoy being tickled actually smiling more often during tickling than those who indicated that they do enjoy being tickled, which suggests that there may be other factors at play (such as embarrassment and anxiety) in the case of those who indicated a dislike for tickling than the mere physical sensation experienced. It has also been suggested that people may enjoy tickling \"because\" it elicits laughter as well as the feeling of being tickled. Social psychologists find that mimicking expressions generally cause people to some degree experience that emotion.\n\nIn a 2008 study, 89% of students admitted to being ticklish on their right foot, 80% under their arm, 77% on their left foot, 77% on their ribs, 65% on their palm, 61% on their knee cap, and 51% on their stomach. 27% claim they are not ticklish at all.\n\nExcessive tickling has been described as a primary sexual obsession and, under these circumstances, is sometimes considered a form of paraphilia. Tickling can also be a form of sexual harassment.\n\nSome of history's greatest thinkers have pondered the mysteries of the tickle response, including Plato, Francis Bacon, Galileo Galilei and Charles Darwin. In \"The Assayer\", Galileo philosophically examines tickling in the context of how we perceive reality:\nWhen touched upon the soles of the feet, for example, it feels in addition to the common sensation of touch a sensation on which we have imposed a special name, \"tickling.\" This sensation belongs to us and not to the hand... A piece of paper or a feather drawn lightly over any part of our bodies performs intrinsically the same operations of moving and touching, but by touching the eye, the nose, or the upper lip it excites in us an almost intolerable titillation, even though elsewhere it is scarcely felt. This titillation belongs entirely to us and not to the feather; if the live and sensitive body were removed it would remain no more than a mere word.\n\nFrancis Bacon and Charles Darwin believed that humorous laughter requires a \"light\" frame of mind. But they differed on ticklish laughter: Darwin thought that the same light state of mind was required, whereas Bacon disagreed. When tickled, noted Bacon, \"men even in a grieved state of mind, yet cannot sometimes forbear laughing.\"\n\nOne hypothesis, as mentioned above, is that tickling serves as a pleasant bonding experience between parent and child. However, this hypothesis does not adequately explain why many children and adults find tickling to be an unpleasant experience. Another view maintained is that tickling develops as a prenatal response and that the development of sensitive areas on the fetus helps to orient the fetus into favourable positions while in the womb.\n\nIt is unknown why certain people find areas of the body to be more ticklish than others; additionally, studies have shown that there is no significant difference in ticklishness among the genders.\nIn 1924, J. C. Gregory proposed that the most ticklish places on the body were also those areas that were the most vulnerable during hand-to-hand combat. He posited that ticklishness might confer an evolutionary advantage by enticing the individual to protect these areas. Consistent with this idea, University of Iowa psychiatrist Donald W. Black observed that most ticklish spots are found in the same places as the protective reflexes.\n\nA third, hybrid hypothesis, has suggested that tickling encourages the development of combat skills. Most tickling is done by parents, siblings and friends and is often a type of rough-and-tumble play, during which time children often develop defensive and combat moves. Although people generally make movements to get away from, and report disliking, being tickled, laughter encourages the tickler to continue. If the facial expressions induced by tickle were less pleasant the tickler would be less likely to continue, thus diminishing the frequency of these combat lessons.\n\nTo understand how much of the tickle response is dependent on the interpersonal relationship of the parties involved, Christenfeld and Harris presented subjects with a \"mechanical tickle machine\". They found that the subjects laughed just as much when they believed they were being tickled by a machine as when they thought they were being tickled by a person. Harris goes on to suggest that the tickle response is reflex, similar to the startle reflex, that is contingent upon the element of surprise.\n\nRecently it was possible to show that it can be assumed that tickling (by passing leaves) served as a triggering-mechanism to issue an acoustic signal (namely laughing) to avoid crashes when our ancestors moved through tree tops. After our descent from the trees only body-parts remained ticklish that could not be touched by passing leaves (arm pits, sole of our feet etc.). It is also possible to show the further development of this trait which finally led to the upcoming of humor.\n\nThe question as to why a person could not tickle themselves was raised by the Greek philosopher Aristotle.\n\nKnismesis may represent a vestige of the primitive grooming response, in effect; knismesis serves as a \"non-self detector\" and protects the subject against foreign objects. Perhaps due to the importance of knismesis in protection, this type of light touch is not dependent on the element of surprise and it is possible for one to induce self-knismesis, by light touching.\n\nGargalesis, on the other hand, produces an odd phenomenon: when a person touches \"ticklish\" parts on their own body no tickling sensation is experienced. It is thought that the tickling requires a certain amount of surprise, and because tickling oneself produces no unexpected motion on the skin, the response is not activated. A recent analysis of the \"self-tickle\" response has been addressed using MRI technology. Blakemore and colleagues have investigated how the brain distinguishes between sensations we create for ourselves and sensations others create for us. When the subjects used a joystick to control a \"tickling robot\", they could not make themselves laugh. This suggested that when a person tries to tickle himself or herself, the cerebellum sends to the somatosensory cortex precise information on the position of the tickling target and therefore what sensation to expect. Apparently an unknown cortical mechanism then decreases or inhibits the tickling sensation.\n\nWhile the reasons for the inhibition of the tickling sensation during self-tickling remain unknown, research shows that the human brain is trained to know what sensation to expect when the body moves or performs an action. Another reason may be the lack of awareness of many sensations arising from self-movement, such as not paying attention to one's own vocal cords. When we try to tickle ourselves by grabbing our sides, the brain foresees this contact between body and hand and prepares itself for it. This removes the feeling of unease and panic, causing the body to not react to tickling in the same way it would if someone else supplied the stimulus.\n\nHowever, some people with schizophrenia have the ability to tickle themselves. This is most likely largely due to the difficulty many people with the disorder have recognising their own actions.\n\nAlthough consensual tickling can be a positive, playful experience, non-consensual tickling can be frightening, uncomfortable, and painful for the recipient. Therefore, non-consensual tickling can be categorized as physical abuse, and sources indicate that tickling has been used as torture. Heinz Heger, a man imprisoned in the Flossenbürg concentration camp during World War II, witnessed Nazi prison guards perform tickle torture on a fellow inmate. He describes this incident in his book \"The Men With The Pink Triangle\": \"The first game that the SS sergeant and his men played was to tickle their victim with goose feathers, on the soles of his feet, between his legs, in the armpits, and on other parts of his naked body. At first the prisoner forced himself to keep silent, while his eyes twitched in fear and torment from one SS man to the other. Then he could not restrain himself and finally he broke out in a high-pitched laughter that very soon turned into a cry of pain, while the tears ran down his face, and his body twisted against his chains. After this tickling torture, they let the lad hang there for a little, while a flood of tears ran down his cheeks and he cried and sobbed uncontrollably.\"\n\nAn article in the \"British Medical Journal\" describes a European method of tickle torture in which a goat was compelled to lick the victim's feet after they had been dipped in salt water. Once the goat had licked the salt off, the victim's feet would be dipped in the salt water again and the process would repeat itself. In ancient Japan, authority figures could administer punishments to those convicted of crimes that were beyond the criminal code. This was called \"shikei\", which translates as ‘private punishment’. One such torture was \"kusuguri-zeme\": \"merciless tickling.\"\n\nIn his book \"Sibling Abuse\", Vernon Wiehe published his research findings regarding 150 adults who were abused by their siblings during childhood. Several reported tickling as a type of physical abuse they experienced, and based on these reports it was revealed that abusive tickling is capable of provoking extreme physiological reactions in the victim, such as vomiting, incontinence (losing control of bladder), and loss of consciousness due to inability to breathe.\n\n\n\n"}

The show covers a variety of topics, such as politics, corporate food history, 1970s rock music, as well as frequently analysing the latest in contemporary pop music by contrasting it with music released in another era. In addition to Koenig, a variety of guest hosts have appeared over the show's history, including Jonah Hill, Rashida Jones and Jamie Foxx. Generally, Koenig is accompanied by his L.A. co-host, Jake Longstreth, who regularly discusses his love for the \"tasteful\" palette of rock music, mostly 70s rock, such as The Grateful Dead, Ween and Guided by Voices.\n\nThe show airs every two weeks. As of November 04, 2018, 80 episodes have aired. The show is currently airing its fourth season.\n\nThe show follows a general format each episode during its two-hour runtime, usually with listener emails and other discussions in the first half of the show and the \"Top Five on iTunes\" at the episode's conclusion.\n\nThe most common segment on the call, in which Koenig and his co-hosts discuss the most relevant and obscure news topics of the week, generally relating to politics or current happenings in the world of entertainment.\n\nFrequently, Koenig and guests analyse the current landscape of the corporate food industry, as well as looking back on the history of snack foods across the world. In 2016, Jennifer Saenz, chief marketing executive of the Frito-Lay corporation appeared. Additionally, the show has discussed Subway on multiple episodes and their obscure promotions, such as the \"Five Dollar Footlong\" deal. In 2018, the show highly criticised the \"Lady Dorito\" proposition by hosting a \"Lady Dorito's Town Hall\", featuring Rashida Jones and Longstreth's wife and filmmaker, Hannah Fidell.\n\nKoenig regularly takes phone calls and has intimate discussions with notable journalists, political commentators, corporate food professionals and celebrities. Notable calls have included \"Seinfeld\" theme composer, Jonathan Wolff, Reading Rainbow composer, Steve Horelick and more.\n\nThis has been a regular segment since the show's third season. Initially, the segment began after a fan located Jake Longstreth's personal email. The segment now utilizes the email 8minutecapecod@gmail.com a reference to an episode aired in July 2017 where they joked about the prospect of an 8 minute Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa to be played on the next Vampire Weekend tour.\n\nFans generally send in questions regarding 1970s music and suggest artists to the hosts that they believe are \"tasteful\" and fit Longstreth's ideal palette. Another popular topic submitted by fans relates to the corporate food history segment of the show.\n\nA recurring segment in which Longstreth recommends or discusses music, with notable recommendations such as The Grateful Dead, Guided by Voices, Ween, Phish, Neil Young, Small Faces and more. Occasionally, Longstreth compiles playlists for Apple Music, notably \"The Tasteful Palette of Seventies Rock\" and more recently, \"Jake's New Age and Ambient Playlist\".\n\nKoenig and Longstreth regularly compare and contrast the iTunes chart from the current week with another music chart from the same week in another year. Notably, the show has regularly jokingly criticized the music of Ed Sheeran, such as his 2017 hit, \"Shape of You\". Koenig and Longstreth commonly refer to the song as \"Bed Sheets\", in reference to one of the song's lines. Fan response to this criticism has been overwhelmingly positive, with one particular fan even compiling the discussions into a complete 32-minute compilation.\n\nOther segments have included \"New York News\".\n\n\nSeason 1 aired from 2015 to 2016.

{"id": "20800509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20800509", "title": "Toy Story (franchise)", "text": "Toy Story (franchise)\n\nToy Story is a computer animated film series and Disney media franchise that began with the 1995 film of the same name, produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The franchise is based on the anthropomorphic concept that all toys, unknown to humans, are secretly alive, and the films focus on a diverse group of toys that feature a classic cowboy named Sheriff Woody and a modern spaceman named Buzz Lightyear. The group unexpectedly embark on adventures that challenge and change them.\n\nThe first two films of the franchise were directed by John Lasseter, and the third by Lee Unkrich, who acted as the co-director of the second film (together with Lasseter and Ash Brannon). Josh Cooley is directing the upcoming fourth film, set for release in June 2019.\n\nAll three films, produced on a total budget of $320 million, have grossed more than $1.9 billion worldwide. Each film set box office records, with the third included in the top 15 all time worldwide films. Critics have given all three films positive reviews. Special Blu-ray and DVD editions of \"Toy Story\" and \"Toy Story 2\" were released on March 23, 2010. They were also re-released in theaters as a Disney Digital 3-D \"double feature\" for at least two weeks in October 2009.\n\nThe series is the 24th highest-grossing franchise worldwide, the fifth highest-grossing animated franchise (behind \"Despicable Me\", \"Shrek\", \"Ice Age\", and \"Madagascar\"), and is among the most critically acclaimed trilogies of all time. On November 1, 2011, all three \"Toy Story\" films were released in Disney Blu-ray 3D as a trilogy pack and as individual films.\n\nThe \"Toy Story\" series consists of three CGI animated films: \"Toy Story\" (1995), \"Toy Story 2\" (1999), and \"Toy Story 3\" (2010). A fourth film, \"Toy Story 4\", is in production and set for release on June 21, 2019. \"Toy Story\" was the first feature-length film to be made entirely using computer-generated imagery. The films were produced by Pixar Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.\n\nThe first and second films got a perfect 100%, and the third a 98% rating, on Rotten Tomatoes. The third film in the series is the third highest-grossing animated film and the 18th highest-grossing film of all time. It also became the third animated film in history to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, following \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"Up\".\n\n\"Toy Story\", the first film in the franchise, was released on November 22, 1995. It was the first feature-length film created entirely by CGI and was directed by John Lasseter. The plot involves Andy, an imaginative young boy, getting a new Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday, causing Sheriff Woody, a vintage cowboy doll, to think that he has been replaced as Andy's favorite toy. In competing for Andy's attention, Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out a window, leading the other toys to believe he tried to murder Buzz. Determined to set things right, Woody attempts to save Buzz, and both must escape from the house of the next-door neighbor Sid Phillips, who likes to torture and destroy toys. The film was critically and financially successful, grossing over $361 million worldwide. The film was later re-released in Disney Digital 3-D as part of a double feature, along with \"Toy Story 2\", for a 2-week run, which was later extended due to its financial success.\n\n\"Toy Story 2\", the second film in the franchise, was released on November 24, 1999. John Lasseter reprised his role as director. The plot involves Woody getting stolen by a greedy toy collector named Al McWhiggin. Buzz and several of Andy's toys set off to attempt to free Woody, who meanwhile has discovered his origins as a historic television star. \"Toy Story 2\" was not originally intended for release in theaters, but as a direct-to-video sequel to the original \"Toy Story\", with a 60-minute running time. However, Disney's executives were impressed by the high quality of the in-work imagery for the sequel, and were also pressured by the main characters' voice actors Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, so they decided to convert \"Toy Story 2\" into a theatrical film. It turned out to be an even greater success than the original \"Toy Story\", grossing over $497 million worldwide. The film was re-released in Disney Digital 3-D as part of a double feature, along with \"Toy Story\", on October 2, 2009.\n\n\"Toy Story 3\", the third film in the franchise, was released on June 18, 2010, nearly 11 years after \"Toy Story 2\" was. It was the first \"Toy Story\" film not to be directed by John Lasseter (although he remained involved in the film as executive producer), but by Lee Unkrich, who edited the first two films and co-directed the second. The plot focuses on the toys being accidentally dropped off at a daycare center while their owner, Andy, is getting ready to go to college. The film contains over 150 new characters, according to Pixar. It remains Pixar's highest-grossing film of all time both domestically and worldwide, surpassing \"Finding Nemo\". \"Toy Story 3\" grossed more than the first and second films combined, making it the first animated film to have crossed the $1 billion mark. In August 2010, it surpassed \"Shrek 2\", becoming the highest-grossing animated film of all time until it was surpassed by \"Frozen\", another Disney production, in March 2014. \"Toy Story 3\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 2, 2010.\n\nOn November 6, 2014, \"Toy Story 4\" was officially announced by Disney during an investors' call, with a provisional release date of June 16, 2017. The film was to be directed by John Lasseter and produced by Galyn Susman, with a screenplay by Rashida Jones and Will McCormack from a story by Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter and Lee Unkrich. Lasseter told \"Variety\": \"\"Toy Story 3\" ended Woody and Buzz's story with Andy so perfectly that for a long time, we never even talked about doing another \"Toy Story\" movie. But when Andrew, Pete, Lee and I came up with this new idea, I just could not stop thinking about it. It was so exciting to me, I knew we had to make this movie—and I wanted to direct it myself.\" In March 2015, Pixar president Jim Morris stated that the film would be a stand-alone sequel rather than a continuation of the third film. The same month, \"Variety\" revealed that Josh Cooley, the head of story on Pixar's \"Inside Out\", would co-direct \"Toy Story 4\". Around the same time, Lasseter revealed that the fourth film had been such a closely held secret at Pixar that even Morris and Edwin Catmull (president of both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, to whom Morris reports) did not know it was being discussed until Stanton had already finished a polished treatment.\n\nIn August 2015, at the D23 Expo, Lasseter stated that the film would focus on the romance between Woody and Bo Peep, building on Bo Peep's absence from \"Toy Story 3\", with Woody and Buzz trying to find her and bring her home.

These shorts also appeared as bonus features on both \"The Ultimate Toy Box\", and the \"10th Anniversary Edition\" DVD of the first film.\n\nPixar has also developed two 22-minute \"Toy Story\" television specials. The first, a Halloween-themed special, titled \"Toy Story of Terror!\", aired on October 16, 2013, on ABC, while the second, a Christmas-themed special titled \"Toy Story That Time Forgot\", aired on December 2, 2014.\n\nA Halloween-themed 22-minute television special, titled \"Toy Story of Terror!\", aired on ABC on October 16, 2013.

Michael Giacchino composed the music for the special. The film's soundtrack was released on October 15, 2013, on Amazon.com in digital format.\n\nThe special follows the toys on their road trip when a flat tire leads Bonnie and her mother to spend the night in a roadside motel. After one of the toys goes missing, the others begin to search for it, but they too are picked off one by one. The toys discover that they are being targeted by the hotel manager's pet iguana, Mr. Jones, who has been trained to steal the toys of his guests so that they can be sold via the Internet. The manager nearly succeeds in selling Woody and Jessie, but Jessie manages to escape—overcoming her old fear of being packed away in the process—and draw Bonnie's attention to the cabinet where the toys are being kept. As a result, Bonnie recovers her toys, and her mom calls in the police, who then presumably arrests the manager for theft.\n\nA Christmas-themed 22-minute television special, titled \"Toy Story That Time Forgot\", aired on ABC on December 2, 2014.

After the film's debut, various industries were interested in the technology used for the film. Graphics chip makers desired to compute imagery similar to the film's animation for personal computers; game developers wanted to learn how to replicate the animation for video games; and robotics researchers were interested in building artificial intelligence into their machines that compared to the lifelike characters in the film. Various authors have also compared the film to an interpretation of \"Don Quixote\" as well as humanism.\n\nIn 2013, Pixar designed a \"Gromit Lightyear\" sculpture based on the Aardman Animations character Gromit from Wallace and Gromit for Gromit Unleashed which sold for £65,000.\n\nBuzz Lightyear's classic line \"To infinity and beyond!\" has seen usage not only on T-shirts, but among philosophers and mathematical theorists as well. Lucia Hall of \"The Humanist\" linked the film's plot to an interpretation of humanism. She compared the phrase to \"All this and heaven, too!\", indicating one who is happy with a life on Earth as well as having an afterlife. In 2008, during STS-124, astronauts took an action figure of Buzz Lightyear into space on the \"Discovery\" Space Shuttle as part of an educational experience for students that also stressed the catchphrase. The action figure was used for experiments in zero-g. Also, in 2008, the phrase made international news when it was reported that a father and son had continually repeated the phrase to help them keep track of each other while treading water for 15 hours in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n"}

Cowboys developed various tricks to show off their prowess with the lasso and demonstrations of these tricks evolved into entertainment and competitive disciplines.\n\nThere is a well-established repertoire of tricks that can be divided into three fundamental categories: \"flat loop\", \"vertical loop\" and \"butterfly\". In addition there are thrown loop tricks and tricks that involve the use of two ropes.
