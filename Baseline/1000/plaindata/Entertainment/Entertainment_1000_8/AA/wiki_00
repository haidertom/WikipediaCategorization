{"id": "683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=683", "title": "Adventure", "text": "Adventure\n\nAn adventure is an exciting experience that is typically a bold, sometimes risky, undertaking. Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting or participating in extreme sports.\n\nAdventurous experiences create psychological arousal, which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. fear) or positive (e.g. flow). For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer André Malraux, in his \"La Condition Humaine\" (1933), \"If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?\". Similarly, Helen Keller stated that \"Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.\"\n\nOutdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the British adventurer Jason Lewis, for example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. Adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.\n\nSome of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as Homer's \"The Odyssey\".\n\nThe knight errant was the form the \"adventure seeker\" character took in the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe adventure novel exhibits these \"protagonist on adventurous journey\" characteristics as do many popular feature films, such as \"Star Wars\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\".\n\nAdventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the wilderness or Mother Nature. Examples include books such as Hatchet or My Side of the Mountain. These books are less about \"questing\", such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.\n\nMany adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a skill, prize, or perhaps the safety of a person. On the way, the hero must overcome various obstacles. Mythologist Joseph Campbell discussed his notion of the monomyth in his book, \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\". Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the \"call to adventure\", followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph.\n\nMany video games are adventure games.\n\nFrom ancient times, travelers and explorers have written about their adventures. Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as Marco Polo's journal \"The Travels of Marco Polo\" or Mark Twain's \"Roughing It\". Others were personal journals, only later published, such as the journals of Lewis and Clark or Captain James Cook's journals. There are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question, such as The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe, or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such as Conquistadors of the Useless by Lionel Terray. Documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well.\n\nThere are many sports classified as adventure sports, due to their inherent danger and excitement. Some of these include mountain climbing, skydiving, or other extreme sports.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3329308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3329308", "title": "Applied Drama", "text": "Applied Drama\n\nApplied Drama, also known as Applied Theatre, Interactive Theatre or Applied Drama and Theatre (ADT) is an umbrella term for the use of drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context. It is often done in non-theatrical spaces, with participants who do not consider themselves to be artists.\n\nThere are several forms and practices considered to be under the umbrella of Applied Drama. In all these fields approaches and methods of Applied Improvisation are used. \n\nApplied Drama is a term that has been contested, gaining popularity towards the end of the 20th century to describe drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.\n\nJames Thompson states that \"Applied theatre is a participatory theatre created by people who would not usually make theatre. It is, I would hope, a practice by, with and for the excluded and marginalised.\" \n\nJudith Ackyroyd confirms the inclusion of both of these elements in ADT: \"I have identified two features which I believe to be central to our understanding of applied theatre; an intention to generate change (of awareness, attitude, behaviour, etc), and the participation of the audience.\"\n\nApplied drama can be either scripted or unscripted. Some practitioners focus primarily on improvisation, whereas others introduce a range of artistic practices, such as developing scripted plays, devised performances, or indigenous forms of cultural performance, sometimes combined with new forms of digital communication.\n\nPlayback Theatre involves audience or group members telling stories from their lives and viewing them as enacted by actors improvising. It can also be used in conjunction with Narrative Therapy.\n\nDrama in healthcare is drama created in medical contexts, often with the intention of rehabilitation.\n\nThis form of Applied Drama focuses on using theatre to educate, engage, and stimulate healing in medical professionals, patients, and the general public. Theatre and drama in healthcare are tilted towards conscientizing the populace about their health and improving their health and longevity irrespective of status or social stratification. This form of drama is often used to educate people on important health issues such as healthy eating, grief and loss, exercise, and sexual assault prevention. Examples include using actors to role-play health ailments in order to train healthcare professionals, performing plays focused on primary prevention, and facilitating drama workshops for patients.\n\nDrama therapy is the use of Applied Drama techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote mental health.\n\nDrama therapy is rooted in a clinical practice, facilitated by licensed clinicians, that stimulates language, cognitive development and builds resilience.\n\nTheatre for Development uses Applied Drama techniques to facilitate development in less developed countries.\n\nDrama in Education can allow students to develop an understanding of themselves and others. Kathleen Galllagher has argued that 'What is clear is that there is no correct pedagogical model on offer for drama education. [...] In theatre pedagogy, we not only endow experience with meaning, but we are - as players - invited to make manifest our own subjectivities in the world evoked through character and play, a world laden with metaphor and nuance, a world where relationship to other and self-spectatorship are in dynamic and unrelenting interaction.'\n\nTheatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in the mid-1960s. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cite TIE as \"one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice.\" TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.\n\nPractitioner Lynn Hoare defines TIE as a combination of \"theatrical elements with interactive moments in which audience participants (in or out of role) work with actor-teachers towards an educational or social goal, using the tools of theatre in service of this goal.\"\n\nScholar Helen Nicholson notes that this work \"involves professional theatre-makers working with young people in all kinds of educational settings and learning environments, including schools, hospitals, theaters, museums and heritage sites.\"\n\nTIE seeks to educate young people in issues that are relevant to both them and their communities, for example: bullying, dating violence, environmental preservation, and peer conflict resolution. \"TIE companies have always been among the most socially conscious of theatre groups, consistently choosing to examine issues they believe to be of direct relevance to the lives of the children with whom they work.\"\n\n\"Theatre for Dialogue\" (TFD) is a more recent term describing a model that was created specifically for the University of Texas at Austin campus community which pulls methods and theory from a variety of applied theatre practices such as TO and TIE. In her thesis, Spring Snyder explains that \"Theatre For Dialogue performances explore the intersection between theatre and education as a way to investigate, reflect, provoke dialogue and serve as a rehearsal for reality without asking participants to share their own personal experiences. Although some of the Theatre For Dialogue’s roots originate from an adapted form of Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed’s forum structure, it is Theatre in Education (TIE) that more closely aligns with TFD.\"\n\nIn prison theatre, practitioners engage offenders in correctional facilities, jails, prisons, and detention centers in exploring drama work often with the objective of education or rehabilitation.\n\nExamples include Wabash Valley Correctional Facility’s \"Shakespeare in Shackles\" where maximum security prisoners learn about and perform Shakespeare. The University of Texas’ Center for Women and Gender Studies’ Performing Justice Project works with incarcerated female youth to learn about gender and racial justice while devising a play based on the youth’s unique experiences.\n\nThe Theatre of the Oppressed (TO) describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal first developed in the 1960s, initially in Brazil and later in Europe. Boal's techniques aim to use theatre as means of promoting social and political change through allowing the audience to take an active role in the creation of the show. Theatre of the Oppressed can include aspects of Forum Theatre, Invisible Theatre, Legislative Theatre and Image Theatre.\n\nMuseum theatre aims to use theatrical techniques to add emotion and value to the museum experience. It is typically more common in cultural institutions like heritage sites, history museums, and science and industry museums. As with the other forms of applied drama, it can involve a variety of theatrical techniques.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21290934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21290934", "title": "Audition", "text": "Audition\n\nAn audition is a sample performance by an actor, singer, musician, dancer or other performer. It typically involves the performer displaying their talent through a previously memorized and rehearsed solo piece or by performing a work or piece given to the performer at the audition or shortly before. In some cases, such as with a model or acrobat, the individual may be asked to demonstrate a range of professional skills. Actors may be asked to present a monologue. Singers will perform a song in a popular music context or an aria in a Classical context. A dancer will present a routine in a specific style, such as ballet, tap dance or hip-hop, or show his or her ability to quickly learn a choreographed dance piece.\n\nThe audition is a systematic process in which industry professionals select performers, which is in some ways analogous to a job interview in the regular job market. In an audition, the employer is testing the ability of the applicant to meet the needs of the job and assess how well the individual will take directions and deal with changes. After some auditions, after the performer has demonstrated their abilities in a given performance style, the audition panel may ask a few questions that resemble those used in standard job interviews (e.g., regarding availability).\n\nAuditions are required for many reasons in the performing arts world. Often, employing companies or groups use auditions to select performers for upcoming shows or productions. An audition for a performing opportunity may be for a single performance (e.g., doing a monologue at a comedy club), for a series or season of performances (a season of a Broadway play), or for permanent employment with the performing organization (e.g., an orchestra or dance troupe). Auditions for performing opportunities may be for amateur, school, or community organizations, in which case the performers will typically not be paid. As well, auditions are used to select or screen candidates for entry to training programs (ballet school or circus school); university programs (B.Mus, M.Mus, MFA in Theater); performance-related scholarships and grants; or to be considered for representation by a talent agency or individual agent.\n\nFor actors in theater, film, and TV, the \"audition is a systematic process in which industry professionals make final casting decisions. Industry professionals may consist of casting directors, producers, directors or agency representatives\". In film and television, the audition is called a screen test, and it is filmed so that the casting director or director can see how the actor appears on screen. Auditions are advertised in major media outlets (such as newspaper or radio), industry magazines and newsletters (e.g., auditions for musicians are advertised in the American Federation of Musicians newsletter), audition websites, and through a talent/casting agencies. Some performers hire an agent, to be able to draw on the agent's connections with casting directors and performing arts companies. However, the agent will take a cut (often 10–20%) of the performer's earnings. Although an actor's talents comprise crucial criteria in the casting process, an almost equal amount of attention is given to an actor's \"type\", (a combination of personality, looks and general casting intuition) as required for a particular production.\n\nActors who are selecting an audition piece may select a monologue by a character who is close to their own age. They may wear neutral clothing that allows freedom of movement. Auditionees may avoid going over the stated time limit. By convention, some actors choose to not direct their speech to the audition panel if they are doing an on-stage audition. In some cases, the audition panel may request that the auditionee interacts with them (e.g., a director may ask the actor to speak the lines while looking directly at the director). An actor who is doing an audition may warm up before the audition, like an athlete would, although with an actor, a warm up might include vocal exercises in addition to stretching. Just as with any interview outside of the performing arts world, an auditionee may dress well. Even if the auditionee does not have expensive clothing, simple clothing may be acceptable if it is clean and of good quality. Auditionees know casting directors are also considering \"whether or not the actor will be easy to work with, that they know what they are doing and can take direction well\".\n\nAudition pieces are not always from the show the actor is being considered for; an actor wishing to be cast in \"Hamlet\" may not do a monologue from that play. Most performers do have a range of audition pieces and select something appropriate; an actor auditioning for \"Hamlet\" would have a dramatic Shakespearean monologue ready, and not perform a monologue from an Oscar Wilde comedy, or a contemporary playwright. Some auditions involve cold reading, or performing a script that the actor is not familiar with. Auditions often involve monologues or speeches, but not always. In some cases, an auditionee is asked to read a scene (with a second person reading the other character).\n\nFor most auditions, it is expected that auditionees will bring a professional 8\"x10\" photo called a \"head shot\" and a resume that indicates their acting experience and training. Actors may bring additional copies of the head shot and resume, in case there are additional members of the casting team present at the audition. The casting agent or company may \"call back\" an auditionee days, weeks, or even months after the initial audition for a second audition. At a major audition for a professional company, the time limits are strictly enforced. A musical theater performer may be given a moment to tell the piano accompanist the tempo, and state their name and audition number to the audition panel. Then, once the auditionee starts acting or singing, the clock starts running. A buzzer sounds when the time limit runs out, which may be a minute and a half, two minutes, or three minutes, depending on the company. At this point, the auditionee is expected to stop and leave to free up the stage for the next auditionee.\n\nRight before the audition, the casting director may give new instructions that were not in the advertisement; for example, due to time constraints, the time limit for the monologues might be cut in half, or the vocal selections might be cut. Actors know that it is important that they follow these last-minute instructions, and not be \"thrown off balance\" by these changes. At an audition, a director may ask for changes in the delivery of the lines or in other aspects of the performance. The goal may be to see if the auditionee is versatile or because the director disagrees with the initial approach used by the auditionee. In either case, the behavior of the auditionee is important; if the auditionee is cooperative in making the changes, it shows that he or she will be easy to work with. If a script is provided beforehand, actors often try to memorize as much as possible, because this shows that they have prepared and it allows them to look up from the script and show their facial expressions more.\n\nFilm auditions are different from theatre auditions. For film auditions, actors and actresses are given \"sides\" which are often a few pages of the script with the roles that they are auditioning for. These sides are often given to the actors 1–3 days before the audition.\n\nIn 2015, the widespread availability of relatively inexpensive video cameras has made video recordings of auditions feasible. To find their talent, casting directors are able to request video auditions from actors and actresses from a different state or country.\n\nIn some styles of music, such as jazz-oriented stage bands, instrumentalists may be asked to sight read printed music at various levels of difficulty. In jazz groups, auditionees may be asked to perform standard pieces (e.g., a jazz standard such as \"Now's the Time\") with an ensemble. Similarly, in a rock or blues band, auditionees may be asked to play a rock or blues standard. An auditionee for a rhythm section role (rhythm guitar, electric bass, drumkit, etc.) will be asked to play a range of standard styles or \"feels\" which are used in a given style. For example, a drummer applying to play in a jazz band might be asked to play a slow ballad, a medium \"standard\", and an up-tempo swing style. A bassist auditioning for a pop band might be asked to play in a Motown style bassline, a syncopated 1970s funk \"slapping\" style line, and a reggae-style bassline. A person auditioning for a role as a rhythm section member in some styles of music may be expected to be able to demonstrate the ability to perform as a backup singer.\n\nA performer auditioning for a solo or \"lead\" instrument role will typically perform prepared solos that showcase a range of skills, including the ability to perform a melody with sensitivity and expression; the ability to play virtuosic passages; and, in some styles (e.g., fusion jazz or blues), the ability to improvise a melody over a chord progression. In some popular genres, there is relatively less emphasis on \"stage presence\" and movement onstage, such as classic jazz or traditional 1950s-style country music. In these styles, there is more of a focus on the sound of the music and the expressiveness of the performer with their voice or instrument. In other genres, such as heavy metal \"shred guitar\" or hardcore punk, it may be very important that a performer can move about in a dramatic fashion onstage. One of the differences between instrumentalist auditions in rock music styles and Classical styles is that in a rock context, the performers will be expected to have memorized most or all of the music. In a Classical context, most or all of the music is read from sheet music (with the exception of a solo Bach suite movement or a solo concerto movement).\n\nFor rock, country, and other forms of popular music, auditions are used to test the ability of an instrumentalist or singer to perform a specific style of music, or several styles. A singer auditioning for a role in a musical theatre production would not, unless instructed otherwise, need to sing opera or country music, and a musician auditioning for a seat in an orchestra would not perform rock. Occasionally a musical theatre audition may require the performer to sing a song in the genre to which the musical pertains. For instance, a singer auditioning for \"Destry Rides Again\" may be asked to sing a standard country-western song. A person auditioning for \"The Rocky Horror Show\" may be asked to sing a standard rock song. As well, in some cases, an audition may require a performer to demonstrate pieces in several styles. A hard rock band auditioning a new singer may request that the individual perform songs from heavy metal and related styles such as blues rock. A pop or rock band that is selecting a new lead singer that has whittled the number of applicants down to the top two or three singers may test out how the singers perform in live shows by performing a few live concerts with each guest singer. This allows the band to see how the singer performs in a full multi-hour concert, including how well the singer can develop a rapport with the audience, deal with the inevitable problems that occur in live music (e.g., microphones failing or stage lights malfunctioning), and maintain their vocal endurance until the end of the evening.\nFor smaller roles in a large musical theater production, mass auditions are held at which many inexperienced or aspiring performers, most without agents, show up. These are popularly known as \"cattle calls\", since the hopefuls are often kept together in one large room. The musical \"A Chorus Line\" depicts this type of audition. \"American Idol\" also auditions its aspiring vocalists using this technique, since there are so many auditions. In musical theater and in pop music styles for which onstage dancing is part of the performance (e.g., hip hop), singers who are doing a vocal audition may also be required to demonstrate that they can dance while singing. In some popular music groups, such as a rock band, a backup singer may be expected to be able to play an instrument while singing, such as strumming a simple rhythm guitar part or playing a percussion instrument (e.g., tambourine or congas). While an ability to sing in multiple languages with the appropriate diction and pronunciation is more associated with Classical music than popular music, there are some popular styles where multiple languages are expected, including Latin jazz styles such as Bossa Nova (Portuguese songs may be requested); Tango (Spanish songs may be requested); folk music (French songs may be requested); and Celtic music (Irish songs may be requested).\n\nIn classical music, auditions are used to screen candidates for positions as instrumentalists in chamber groups or orchestras or as soloists, and to screen singers for positions as members of a choir or as solo performers. In classical music, auditions are also used to screen candidates for entry to training programs, university or Conservatory programs or degrees, and training festival activities (e.g., classical summer camps). In comparison with some types of pop music auditions, classical auditions tend to be much more formal. The performer may, by tradition, wear a tuxedo or a formal dress, and the judges may sit behind a desk and write comments on clipboards.\n\nIn classical music, each instrument or vocal type has a standard repertoire of music which is commonly requested at auditions. Instrumentalists in an orchestral context are typically asked to perform excerpts from the orchestral literature, including both exposed solos and \"tutti\" parts which are particularly demanding. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the conductor, the Concertmaster, and a number of Principal players from the orchestra. Since the post-WW II era, professional orchestra auditions often include a musician's union representative, who ensures that the audition is being run in a fair manner. In many major orchestras, a cloth screen may be used at some stages of the audition process, to protect the audition panel from allegations of favouritism or sexism.\n\nAn orchestral audition will normally set out a list of orchestral excerpts which each performer has to prepare. As well, each performer plays a movement from a Sonata or Concerto which may be performed with piano accompaniment. When the performer plays the orchestral excerpts, he or she may be given a tempo, or asked to follow the gestures of the conductor. Orchestral auditions are often run in several stages, in order to screen candidates and reduce those who are less likely to meet the needs of the job. A large number of applicants typically apply for a professional orchestra job. The orchestra personnel manager then selects the most promising candidates based on the experience and training indicated in the applicants' CVs (and, in some cases, based on the performing ability demonstrated in a recording of the applicant).\n\nThis first \"cut\" of auditionees then perform in front of the audition panel. Typically in a professional orchestra, this would require the performance of excerpts representing stylistic and technical challenges drawn from repertoire typical to that orchestra. The most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music.\n\nIf a candidate is successful in passing the audition, typically a Trial period of several months to a year takes place allowing the Chief Conductor and Principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.\n\nThere is a standard repertoire of vocal literature for each voice type (e.g., soprano, alto) that is used at auditions for singers. Each sub-type of vocal activity has a separate standard audition repertoire (e.g., choirs, operas, etc.). A person auditioning for a role in a choir will be expected to be able to sight read choral parts. In auditions for opera, a singer will be expected to demonstrate the ability to act out the movements that are associated with the lyrics of the aria, which may include pretending to be dying from a stab wound, miming an activity (e.g., pouring wine), or doing a simple dance routine. Both choral and opera singers are expected to be able to follow the gestures of a conductor in regards to expression and tempo. Since microphones are not used in most classical music performances, the audition panel will be assessing the auditionees ability to project a strong, room-filling vocal tone. In classical music, in addition to judging singing ability (e.g., tone, intonation, etc.), the audition panel will be judging the applicant's ability to use the appropriate diction and pronunciation of the major languages used in Art music: German, Italian, and French. Other languages that the applicant may be asked to sing in include English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin.\n\nIn musical theatre, a standard audition consists of two sixteen-measure selections of songs, contrasting in style, intention, characters, time period, or all of the above. There is also usually a monologue portion, where the actor is asked to perform a one-minute monologue. A headshot and résumé are almost always required. Although auditions vary depending on the theatre, program, or show, this formula is considered “the norm” in the musical theatre world. The purpose of an audition is two-fold. Practically, performers audition to get a callback. \"Callbacks\", or callback auditions, allow the artistic team to assess a performer’s skills in accordance with specific characters. During the callback, the panel has shortlisted a candidate, because they have noted his or her potential for particular parts. As such, during a callback audition, the candidate is asked to sing the songs performed by certain characters or read their lines. The first audition is not a platform for selling oneself as a particular character. Character-specific auditions take place during callbacks. Instead, the first audition is a chance for the performer to show off the songs she does best.\n\nThere are many types of dance auditions for different performance venues. Dance companies hire employees for ballet and modern dance shows. Broadway companies hire dancers for traditional musicals (Rodgers and Hammerstein) and more modern dance musicals (e.g., \"Fame\" and \"Grease\"). Casinos, resorts, amusement parks, and cruise ships hire dancers for revue-style shows that can range from jazz dance to hip-hop. For these shows, some backup singing skills or acting skills may be required. Pop music concert producers and pop music video producers recruit dancers to perform onstage during concerts or during videos. For live pop concerts, onstage dancers may be required to perform simple backup singing. Movie and TV producers also hire dancers for short term shoots; even though a dancer may only get several days of work from a movie or TV show, there may be residual payments. Most auditions specify what type of dance skills are required (e.g., Classical, pointe, contemporary, jazz, hip-hop, etc.). In the case of modern dance, some dance companies ask applicants to demonstrate their ability to improvise dance moves.\n\nMany dance auditions test the ability of applicants to learning new choreography in a short time period, rather than showcasing a prepared work. In other cases, a short prepared solo piece may also be required (about 90 seconds long). Applicants will be instructed in a technical routine or pattern in a group session. Some auditions require applicants to have completed training at a recognised dance school or conservatoire, and in some cases, auditionees may be requested to bring a reference letter from a dance teacher or dance company director (especially in the case of young dancers with little professional experience). At some auditions, applicants are asked to make a short verbal statement about their dancing goals or why they wish to join the troupe. Auditionees should ensure that they know the major dance terms, because the judges may request that certain dance moves be demonstrated.\n\nDancers are often asked to bring one or two photographs, such as a \"headshot\" and a full-body photo of the applicant in a dancing pose. The clothing that auditionees need to wear at auditions varies. At some auditions, particularly Classical auditions, there is a strict dress code: applicants wear dance leotards and pointe shoes, and long hair is tied back. Other dance auditions specify loose clothing. For some contemporary dance auditions, applicants must dance barefoot. In some music theater roles, applicants need to bring tap shoes to demonstrate their tap dancing skills. Some auditions where there is a large number of applicants require the performers to wear a number pinned to their shirt, in a similar way to marathon runners. This way, if the casting director sees an exceptional dancer, he or she can take note of the number. Unless jewellery or make-up is an expected part of a dancer's appearance in a certain dance style, dance auditionees generally avoid jewellery and makeup.\n\nIn music theater and pop music, there is a lot of crossover between dancing and singing roles. Almost all dancers in music theater and many dancers in pop music will be expected to have some singing ability as a backup singer (singing harmony parts to accompany the solo vocalists). In rarer cases, dancers will be asked to demonstrate the ability to play a musical instrument (e.g., guitar), because there are some shows in which some of the dancer-actors have to play instruments onstage, such as the \"Threepenny Opera\". In music theater, there is also often crossover between dancing and acting roles. Dancers may be expected to be able to take on an acting role and speak lines (often in a supporting role).\n\nSome major dance companies have \"open calls\" once a year, in which any or almost any applicant can come to demonstrate their dancing skills. At these open calls, the entire group of applicants are taught a dance routine by a choreographer, and then the group of dancers performs the routine while judges assess their performance. It can be hard for a good dancer to get noticed by the judges in such a large group of dancers. For this reason, some dance coaches encourage their students to wear outgoing clothes and bright things to stand out, so that the dancer will get personal attention during his or her audition. For any audition interviews, dancers should send their resume and headshot to the company director ahead of time.\n\nPerformers auditioning for amusement parks world wide are generally viewed by one or more casting directors in a rehearsal hall or a large facility. Most theme park auditions, like other auditions, are closed to the public. This means that no one is allowed into the audition room who is not auditioning. Vocalists for Disney auditions are asked to prepare two separate vocal selections of contrasting styles. The singers do not sing the entire songs; instead they just need to sing the best 16 bars of each song. Disney provides a piano accompanist for all vocal auditions, and so singers have to bring sheet music in the correct key. Disney does not allow any pre-recorded accompaniment. The casting directors may also ask auditionees to learn additional music or learn a movement combination. Disney Parks & Resorts casts performers for theme parks, resorts, and cruise ships.\n\nAt Cirque du Soleil, depending on a performer's discipline, the audition may last an hour, a day or even two days. Depending on a performer's discipline, he or she might have to perform a solo presentation in front of the group of participants and/or participate in individual and group exercises following the solo presentation. Auditions for Cirque du Soleil are filmed.\n\nModelling agencies and other organizations that are looking for models, such as fashion designers and advertising agencies also use auditions to screen and select potential candidates. Aspiring female models for most fashion industry roles need to be in their teens or early twenties and be tall and slim. Although there are \"niche markets\" for non-svelte models (\"plus size models\" and \"real life models\" who model clothes for middle-market clothing catalogues), most female models need to be slender and between 108–125 lbs. Young men who are aspiring models should be between 18 and 25, tall, and fit. While male models who are selected at modelling auditions may well end up having careers that last till beyond age 25 (even into their 40s), modelling agencies prefer to recruit new models in the 18–25 age range. Most models work with an agent who arranges auditions, bookings, and negotiates fees. At an audition, casting agents will ask the model to demonstrate different poses, which a photographer may record with a digital camera.\n\nFor high fashion auditions, the model may be asked to demonstrate the \"catwalk\" style of modelling clothes on a raised runway. At most modelling auditions, models wear fairly simple clothes that will allow the talent agents to imagine the model in different garments. Typically, a model wears fairly body-hugging clothes, so that the judges can see the body type of the model.

{"id": "34903115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34903115", "title": "Autism spectrum disorders in the media", "text": "Autism spectrum disorders in the media\n\nAutism spectrum disorders (\"ASD\"s) or autism spectrum conditions (\"ASC\"s) describe a range of conditions classified as neurodevelopmental disorders in the DSM-5, used by the American Psychiatric Association. As with many neurodivergent people and conditions, the popular image of autistic people and autism itself is often based on inaccurate media representations.\n\nSince the 1970s, fictional portrayals of people with autism, Asperger syndrome, and other ASCs have become more frequent. Public perception of autism is often based on these fictional portrayals in novels, biographies, movies, and TV series. These depictions of autism in media today are often made in a way that brings pity to the public and their concern of the topic, because their viewpoint is never actually shown, leaving the public without knowledge of autism and its diagnosis. Portrayals in the media of characters with atypical abilities (for example, the ability to multiply large numbers without a calculator) may be misinterpreted by viewers as accurate portrayals of all autistic people and of autism itself.\n\nSince the 1970s, characters have appeared in film, television, and print that could be qualified as \"on the [autism] spectrum.\" Characters have been presented as being described as openly autistic in canon, or have been designed with one of many ASCs in mind.\n\n\n\nThe MMR vaccine was the subject of controversy resulting from publication of a (now retracted) 1998 paper by Andrew Wakefield \"et al.\" In 2010, Wakefield's research was found by the General Medical Council to have been \"dishonest\"; the research was declared fraudulent in 2011 by the \"BMJ\".\n\nA March 2007 article in \"BMC Public Health\" postulated that media reports on Wakefield's study had \"created the misleading impression that the evidence for the link with autism was as substantial as the evidence against\". Earlier papers in \"Communication in Medicine\" and \"British Medical Journal\" concluded that media reports provided a misleading picture of the level of support for Wakefield's theory.\n\n\"PRWeek\" noted that after Wakefield was removed from the general medical register for misconduct in May 2010, 62% of respondents to a poll regarding the MMR controversy stated they did not feel that the media conducted responsible reporting on health issues.\n\nA \"New England Journal of Medicine\" article examining the history of antivaccinationists said that opposition to vaccines has existed since the 19th century, but \"now the antivaccinationists' media of choice are typically television and the Internet, including its social media outlets, which are used to sway public opinion and distract attention from scientific evidence\".\n\nThe role of the media in the sensationalization of the MMR vaccination issue was discussed by the \"BMJ\":The original paper has received so much media attention, with such potential to damage public health, that it is hard to find a parallel in the history of medical science. Many other medical frauds have been exposed, but usually more quickly after publication and on less important health issues.\n\nConcerns were also raised about the role of journalists reporting on scientific theories that they \"are hardly in a position to question and comprehend. Neil Cameron, a historian who specializes in the history of science, writing for \"The Montreal Gazette\" labeled the controversy a \"failure of journalism\" that resulted in unnecessary deaths, saying that 1) \"The Lancet\" should not have published a study based on \"statistically meaningless results\" from only 12 cases; 2) the anti-vaccination crusade was continued by the satirical \"Private Eye\" magazine; and 3) a grapevine of worried parents and \"nincompoop\" celebrities fueled the widespread fears. The \"Gazette\" also reported thatThere is no guarantee that debunking the original study is going to sway all parents. Medical experts are going to have to work hard to try to undo the damage inflicted by what is apparently a rogue medical researcher whose work was inadequately vetted by a top-ranked international journal.\n\nMedia speculation of historical figures on the autism spectrum is based on reported behavior and anecdotal evidence rather than any clinical observation of the individual. Fred Volkmar of the Yale Child Study Center has remarked that \"there is unfortunately a sort of cottage industry of finding that everyone has Asperger's\". Professor Michael Fitzgerald's research, which portrays many historical figures are autistic, has been heavily criticised, and described by some as \"fudged pseudoscience\" and \"frankly absurd\".\n\nAdditionally, media speculation of contemporary figures as being on the autism spectrum has become popular in recent times. \"New York\" magazine reported some examples, which included that \"Time\" magazine suggested that Bill Gates is autistic, and that a biographer of Warren Buffett wrote that his prodigious memory and \"fascination with numbers\" give him \"a vaguely autistic aura.\" The magazine also reported that on \"Celebrity Rehab\", Dr. Drew Pinsky deemed basketball player Dennis Rodman a candidate for an Asperger's diagnosis, and the UCLA specialist consulted \"seemed to concur\". Nora Ephron criticized these conclusions, writing that popular speculative diagnoses suggest autism is \"an epidemic, or else a wildly over-diagnosed thing that there used to be other words for.\" Thomas Sowell has criticized \"Time\" diagnosis of Bill Gates, saying that the people diagnosing him have not seen him personally. Paul Steinberg has also criticized the literary portrayals of Warren Buffett and Tim Page as autistic, writing these men are able to compensate more completely than a truly autistic child or adult whose language deficiencies and cognitive deficits can often put him at a level of functioning in the mentally retarded range.\n"}

Various dice arrangements, colors of dice, scooping patterns and props allow for many degrees of complexity and difficulty. Dice stacking is usually performed with canceled casino dice, as their square edges and heavy weight give them an advantage when being stacked.\n\nDice stacking comes from lower Germany.\n\nIn Germany the first national dice stacking championship tournament took place in May 2008.

The series focuses on the exploits of an unnamed space marine operating under the auspices of Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC), who fights hordes of demons and the undead in order to survive.\n\n\"Doom\" is considered to be one of the pioneering first-person shooter games, introducing to IBM-compatible computers features such as 3D graphics, third-dimension spatiality, networked multiplayer gameplay, and support for player-created modifications with the \"Doom\" WAD format. Since the release of \"Doom\" in 1993, the series has spawned numerous sequels, expansion packs, and a film.\n\nSince its debut, over 10 million copies of games in the \"Doom\" series have been sold.\n\nThe \"Doom\" video games consist of first-person shooters in which the player controls an unnamed space marine also referred to as \"Doomguy\". The player has to battle the forces of Hell, consisting of demons and the undead. In the games, the player's character will often go back and forth through hell. \"Doom II: Hell on Earth\" follows after the events in \"Doom\", the player once again assumes the role of the unnamed space marine. After returning from Hell, the player finds that Earth has also been invaded by the demons, who have killed billions of people.\n\nThe development of the original \"Doom\" started in 1992, when John Carmack developed a new game engine, the Doom engine, while the rest of the id Software team finished the \"Wolfenstein 3D\" prequel, \"Spear of Destiny\".\n\n\"\" was released in 1994, followed by two other official releases based on its version of the Doom engine: \"Master Levels for Doom II\" in 1995, and \"Final Doom\" in 1996.\n\n\"Doom 64\" was released in 1997, developed by Midway Games and supervised by id Software.\n\n\"Doom 3\" was announced in 2000. A reboot to the original \"Doom\", it uses new graphics technology. \"Doom 3\" was hyped to provide as large a leap in realism and interactivity as the original game and helped renew interest in the franchise when it was released in 2004. \"Doom 3\" had its own expansion pack released in 2005, titled \"\".\n\nAfter the \"Doom 4\" project development was scrapped in 2013, id Software's Tim Willits said that the next game in the \"Doom\" series was still the team's focus, but it has not been confirmed to be titled \"Doom 4\". It was later renamed to simply \"Doom\" in 2014. The game became a second reboot of the series, rather than a continuation or origin story of earlier games and was released in 2016.\n\nA sequel to the 2016 reboot, \"Doom Eternal\" was announced in 2018.\n\nA set of four novels based on \"Doom\" were written with permission of id Software by Dafydd ab Hugh and Brad Linaweaver. The books, listed in order, are titled \"Knee Deep in the Dead\", \"Hell on Earth\", \"Infernal Sky\" and \"Endgame\". All were published between June 1995 and January 1996 by Pocket Books. The unnamed Marine is called \"Flynn Taggart\" or \"Fly\" in the novels. The first two books feature recognizable locations and situations from the first two games.\n\nA comic book was issued in May 1996, produced by Tom Grindberg of Marvel Comics as a giveaway for a video game convention.\n\nOn January 31, 2005, a board game resembling the classic Space Hulk was released, entitled \"\".\n\nThe first film adaptation was released in 2005.\n\nIn early 2008, a new series of \"Doom\" novels by Matthew J. Costello, an author who had worked on the story and scripts for \"Doom 3\" and \"Resurrection of Evil\", were published. The series of books aim to novelize the story of \"Doom 3\", with the first installment, \"\", published on February 26, 2008. The second book in the series, \"\", was released in March 2009.\n\nIn 2008, Id Software CEO Todd Hollenshead stated in an interview that another \"Doom\" movie, possibly based on the cancelled \"Doom 4\", might be made.\n\nStrategy guides released in printed editions include:\n\nFor the 20th anniversary of the series, the Game-Art-HQ community created an art tribute with 20 illustrations of the characters from the game.\n\nActress and singer Nina Bergman teased April 17, 2018 on Twitter that Universal are making a \"Doom\" film.\n\nIn 1996, \"Next Generation\" ranked the series as the 19th top game of all time, for how \"despite the hundreds of copycat titles, no one has ever been able to equal id's original, pulsing classic.\"\n\nThe series' unnamed protagonist, a marine, has had a mostly positive reception. In 2009, GameDaily included \"the Marine\" on its list of \"ten game heroes who fail at the simple stuff\" for his inability to look up and down in the original series. UGO Networks ranked him fourth on its 2012's list of best silent protagonists in video games, noting his courage to continue in silence even when he faces the Hell's army. In 2013, \"Complex\" ranked Doomguy at number 16 on its list of the greatest soldiers in video games for being \"the original video game space marine\" and \"one of the classic silent protagonists\". Both CraveOnline and VGRC ranked him the fifth most \"badass\" male character in the video game's history.\n"}
{"id": "2719363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2719363", "title": "Dotto", "text": "Dotto\n\nDotto is an American television game show that was a combination of a general knowledge quiz and the children's game connect the dots. Jack Narz served as the program's host, with Colgate-Palmolive as its presenting sponsor. \"Dotto\" rose to become the highest rated daytime program in television history, as of 1958.\n\n\"Dotto\" replaced \"Strike it Rich\" in CBS's 11:30 am daytime time slot on January 6, 1958. In a rare instance of two networks programming the same show, a weekly nighttime edition was launched on July 1, 1958 on CBS's competitor NBC on Tuesday nights in their 9:00p.m. slot. At the height of both shows' popularity, \"Dotto\" was abruptly cancelled without public explanation over the weekend of August 16, 1958. Soon after, Dotto was publicly revealed to have been fixed by its producer, tarnishing the show's reputation and setting the stage for legal and political investigation of the fixing of 1950s quiz shows.\n\nTwo contestants, one a returning champion, competed in each game.\n\nThe object of the game was to identify the subject of an incomplete portrait drawing, which was accomplished by answering questions and connecting dots. The champion and the challenger were both given their own version of the portrait, which contained fifty dots for each contestant to connect. The contestants were positioned on stage in a manner where neither one could see the other or their progress. There was also an overhead projector on stage that was called the \"Dottograph\", which would come into play as the game progressed.\nPlay in each game started with the challenger and he/she was given a category along with a choice of three questions, each with a corresponding number of dots to connect. The questions were worth five, eight, or ten dots and more dots meant a higher difficulty. Answering correctly enabled the challenger to have his/her dots connected, but a wrong answer or failure to answer gave that privilege to the champion. \n\nTo further assist the contestants in identifying the subjects of the portrait, three clues were provided. These were unlocked once a contestant reached a certain number of connections. The first required a total of twenty-five connections, the second thirty-five, and the last forty-five.\n\nAt any point in the game, including during the opposing player's turn, a contestant could signal that he/she knew the answer by pressing a button. Narz would then direct that contestant to walk to the Dottograph, which the opposing player could not see, and write that answer on the projecto screen.\n\nAfter the answer was recorded, Narz would reveal if the contestant had answered correctly. If he/she did, the opponent was given one last chance to force a tie and play on by correctly identifying the subject based on his/her own progress during the game; if he/she could not do so the first contestant won the game. If the first contestant was incorrect, the opponent automatically won the game. \n\nThe winning player won money for each unconnected dot left on his/her picture, and the amount increased for each tie up to two. On the daytime series, the payout was $10 per dot and it doubled for each tie up to a maximum of $40. On the nighttime series, the payout was $100 per dot and increased by that amount for each tie, resulting in a maximum of $300 per dot.\n\nAfter a game was completed, usually during the middle of each episode, a \"Home Viewer Dotto\" game was played, in which a person selected by postcard drawing was called by telephone live on the air for a chance to guess the person being drawn. If correct, the home viewer won a new car or other valuable prizes, and if incorrect, the viewer received a consolation prize (the daytime version gave away a supply of products advertised by the show's sponsor, Colgate-Palmolive, while the nighttime version gave away a trip). At the end of each episode, additional dots were connected and a clue was displayed for the next episode's \"Home Viewer Dotto\" game.\n\n\"Dotto\" debuted on January 6, 1958 at 11:30a.m., replacing the long-running (and controversial) Warren Hull game \"Strike It Rich\". Facing Bob Barker's \"Truth or Consequences\" on NBC and local programming on ABC (who had not programmed at 11:30 in three years), within six months \"Dotto\" became the highest-rated quiz program of the year, and Narz achieved a popularity equal to that of Hal March on \"The $64,000 Question\".\n\nThe show became so popular that on July 1 a weekly nighttime version began on NBC with the same format. On NBC's July 29 episode, a contestant on the show, actress and model Connie Hines had a telegram read on air with Columbia Pictures stating interest in her as an actress. Hines later became famous as Carol Post on the popular comedy \"Mister Ed\".\n\n\"Dotto\"'s downfall began with a backstage discovery in May 1958. A notebook belonging to contestant (and later journalist) Marie Winn was found by stand-by contestant, Edward Hilgemeier Jr., who realized that the notebook included questions and answers to be used during Winn's appearances, one of which was against a woman named Yaffe Kimball. He tore out the relevant pages of the notebook for himself. Hilgemeier then told Kimball after her onstage loss that her competitor had been given answers in advance. Hilgemeier later reported that \"Dotto's\" producers paid him $1,500 to keep quiet about his discovery, and Kimball, as the loser of a fixed match, $4,000. \"Dotto\" on CBS, meanwhile, grew in popularity as 1958 went on and became the highest rated Daytime show on the air.\n\nHilgemeier Jr. eventually decided to break his silence. He contacted the Colgate-Palmolive company on approximately August 8, 1958 with his story, which was then relayed to CBS. Executives at CBS and the show's sponsor quickly moved to confirm the allegation internally and worked the issue between August 11 and 16. CBS executive vice president Thomas Fisher tested kinescopes of the show against Winn's notebook and concluded that the show looked fixed. Executives at CBS series met with its creator, Frank Cooper, concerning the potential rigging of the show on the evening of Friday, August 15. Cooper admitted that the show was indeed fixed, and CBS then reported these findings to NBC as the hosts of the nighttime version. Over the weekend of August 16, both the CBS daytime and NBC primetime series were cancelled. In the meantime, in an August 18 affidavit, Hilgemeier complained to the Federal Communications Commission (as he did to Colgate-Palmolive) that \"Dotto\" was fixed. In interviews, host Jack Narz stated that he was not notified of \"Dotto's\" cancellation until some point after the final episodes had been recorded. Narz was later subpoenaed and took a polygraph test, the results indicating that he was not connected to the fraud.\n\nCBS immediately moved its game show \"Top Dollar\", hosted by Warren Hull, to \"Dotto\"'s 11:30a.m. time slot on Monday, August 18. A live studio audience expecting to be seated for Monday's episode of \"Dotto\" was instead set up as an audience for \"Top Dollar\". Viewers were greeted by the opening, “Dotto, the program which normally airs at this time, will no longer be seen. Instead...welcome to \"Top Dollar\"!” The final NBC nighttime weekly episode aired on August 12, 1958; the next week its Tuesday time slot was replaced with \"a filmed drama series\". Dotto's cancellation on both CBS and NBC was quickly established as fact on August 18, but the reason for why it was cancelled took days to be confirmed by the media.\n\nAlthough it was not the first show to be involved in some wrongdoing, \"Dotto\" was the first game show to have such wrongdoing verified. A year earlier, \"Twenty-One\" contestant Herb Stempel told the \"New York Journal-American\" that his run as champion on the series had been choreographed and that he had been ordered to purposely lose his championship to Charles Van Doren. Stempel's statements gained more credibility once the match fixing at \"Dotto\" was publicized, and investigations (in the form of a grand jury, and later, congressional hearings) followed.\n\nJack Narz eventually replaced Warren Hull as host of \"Top Dollar\" by November 1958. That series ran in daytime until October 23, 1959. Narz continued to work as a game show host for most of the next twenty years after \"Top Dollar\" ended.\n\nFrank Cooper would never do another game show after \"Dotto,\" which was his longest-running game and his only one for CBS. His previous gaming efforts did not fare as well – his first game, an NBC show called \"Guess What Happened?\" (dropping the \"Guess\" after the first show), bombed after three episodes in 1952. \"Droodles,\" starring Roger Price, ran for three months in 1954 while ABC's \"Keep It in the Family\" ran for four months from 1957-1958.\n\nConnie Hines was revealed to have been coached for her \"Dotto\" appearance, but unlike Marie Winn, she was not given questions and answers in advance. She enjoyed a five-year run as Carol Post on \"Mister Ed\" and, after a few subsequent television guest roles, retired from acting entirely.\n\nMarie Winn eventually became a journalist whose books include \"The Plug-In Drug\", a scathing critique on television's influence over children. The book became somewhat controversial for its author having been circumspect about her role in one of the medium's greatest scandals.\n\nIt was only in 2013 that RTBF revived the game in digitized form.\n\nIn 2014, it was announced that a revival of \"Dotto\" for French Television is in the works (entitled \"Fizzio\").\n\n\"Dotto\" was also hugely successful in the United Kingdom, where it ran on ITV from September 13, 1958 to June 23, 1960. This version was first hosted by Robert Gladwell, followed by Jimmy Hanley and then Shaw Taylor.\n\nAlthough the series was presumably intact in 1958 (see above), the series is believed to have been destroyed sometime afterward as per network practices (and possibly by Colgate's insistence).\n\nTwo episodes are known to exist – a daytime episode from May 20 featuring Marie Winn's victory over Yaffe Kimball-Slatin (which was subject to the rigging controversy, see above), and the third-to-last nighttime episode from July 29 featuring Connie Hines.\n\n\n"}

It told the story of the last battle for Thebes by the Epigoni, the children of the heroes who had previously fought for the city. Only the first line is now known:\n\nAdditional references, without verbal quotations, suggest that the myth of the death of Procris and the story of Teiresias's daughter Manto formed part of the \"Epigoni\".\n\nThe epic was sometimes ascribed to Homer, but Herodotus doubted this attribution. According to the Scholia on Aristophanes there was an alternative attribution to \"Antimachus.\" This presumably means Antimachus of Teos (8th century BC), and for this reason another verse line attributed without title to Antimachus of Teos is conjecturally thought to belong to the \"Epigoni\". An alternative explanation for the naming of Antimachus here would be that the later epic poet Antimachus of Colophon (4th century BC) had been accused of stealing the traditional \"Epigoni\" by incorporating its plot in his literary epic \"Thebais\".\n\nThe story of the Epigoni was afterwards told again in the form of a tragedy by Sophocles, \"Epigoni\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2529054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2529054", "title": "Family entertainment center", "text": "Family entertainment center\n\nA family entertainment center (or centre), often abbreviated FEC in the entertainment industry (also known as an indoor amusement park or indoor theme park), is a small amusement park marketed towards families with small children to teenagers, and often entirely indoors or associated with a larger operation such as a theme park. They usually cater to \"sub-regional markets of larger metropolitan areas.\" FECs are generally small compared to full-scale amusement parks, with fewer attractions, a lower per-person per-hour cost to consumers than a traditional amusement park, and not usually major tourist attractions, but sustained by an area customer base. Many are locally owned and operated, although there are a number of chains and franchises in the field. FECs are sometimes called family amusement centers, play zones, family fun centers, or simply fun centers. Some non-traditional FECs, called urban entertainment centers (UECs), with more customized and branded attractions and retail outlets, are associated with major entertainment companies and may be tourist destinations. Others, sometimes operated by Non-Profit organizations as Children's Museums or Science Centers, tend to be geared toward edutainment experiences rather than simply amusement. FECs may also be adjuncts to full-scale amusement parks.\n\nFECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of theme restaurants that increasingly developed their in-house amusement features, small-scale amusement parks needing more offerings than just a few rides and midway games, and diversifying formerly one-attraction venues (water parks, skate parks, billiard halls, bowling alleys, and so on). All three categories have moved over several decades continually toward stock, popular entertainment solutions supplied by third-party vendors. Among the earliest of the themed restaurants to become known more for family entertainment than food was Chuck E. Cheese's, a pizza restaurant founded in 1977 in San Jose, California.\n\nMost FECs have at least five common major or \"anchor\" attractions, to provide diverse patrons (often in large parties) at least one to two hours of entertainment, to encourage repeat visits, and to reduce time spent waiting for any given attraction. Some of the more usual attractions include (depending upon size, climate, etc.):\n\nThe most common anchor activities are miniature golf, kart racing, arcade and redemption games, and food & beverage, according to industry specialists StoneCreek Partners. FECs rarely use custom-built attractions, because of the costs involved, and instead install off-the-shelf systems provided and maintained by industry equipment vendors.\n\nAny given FEC may lean more towards outdoor activities, arcade gaming, or passive entertainment and dining. Each may cater to different age ranges, all the time, or during certain hours, e.g. children and entire families in the daytime, and teens to young adults in the evening, with specific promotional programs to attract different market segments at different times.\n\nFECs tend to serve \"sub-regional markets\", such as small cities, quadrants or boroughs of larger cities, and a large suburban area outside such a city. Their busiest times are weekend afternoons and Thursday through Saturday evenings.\n\nBecause most of the attractions are essentially the same from FEC to FEC, two of the most important factors in a particular center distinguishing itself to potential customers are a highly visible location (hard to obtain because other uses for the land are often more competitive), and a consistently developed and promoted theme that appeals to the target market segments, \"the fun factor in the overall decor\".\n\nParental concerns are also important. While children themselves rarely think of it, a major factor in the attractiveness of an FEC to parents is on-site safety and security, as adults may drop off older children at such an establishment to entertain themselves. An increasingly important factor for success is high-quality food and drink to attract parental spending as well as whole-family dining.\n\nVarious major media and entertainment brands, including Disney, Lego, NASCAR, Sega, Sony, United Artists/Regal and Viacom, have been attached to family entertainment centers, often much less \"traditional\" than local and chain FECs, with custom-built, unique attractions, usually heavily branded, and most often located in major metropolitan areas. The first such urban entertainment center (UEC) was the Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles, California, which opened in 1993, linking several Universal properties. Including various retail outlets, restaurants, and attractions, the CityWalk created a great deal of \"sustained buzz\" in the retail real estate industry, which began \"embracing the notion that Universal Studios, Sony, Disney, and other entertainment companies could create new anchors and entertainment programs for shopping centers\". Another significant UEC was the Sony Metreon in San Francisco, California (1999–2006).\n\nSome nonprofit, educational installations, such as the Exploratorium in San Francisco, also have aspects of FECs in format and atmosphere, but with activities geared toward learning and experiencing rather than simple entertainment. Some for-profit enterprises also use this model, or mix edutainment with simpler amusement attractions.\n\nThe major international industry association that supports FECs is the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA), which merged with and absorbed the membership of the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry (IALEI) in October 2009. IAAPA maintains addresses in the Virginia, Hong Kong, Brussels, Belgium and Mexico City. The International Laser Tag Association (ILTA) also remains active (and more broadly than its name suggests). ILTA is based in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S. For many smaller, community centric FEC's and owner/operators who can't always make the IAAPA tradeshow, IAAO the International Association of Amusement Operators is an online resource for family entertainment center operators and startups.\n\nCanadian FECs are called \"family entertainment centres\" or \"fun centres\", due to British-style spelling conventions in Canadian English.\n\n\nThe main national industry group in the U.S. is the National Association of Family Entertainment Centers (NAFEC), which is perhaps incongruously a division of the International Laser Tag Association (ILTA).\n\nSome U.S.-based companies also have venues in Canada (noted above), but this is rare due to the legal/political difficulties involved in cross-border corporations.\n\nAmerican FECs vary wildly in themes, size and features.

It is the first part in a new series of films produced by Musée d'Orsay, and tells the story of a French family as seen through the eyes of a Chinese student. The film was shot in August and September 2006 on location in Paris. This is Hou Hsiao-hsien's first non-Asian film. It references the classic 1956 French short \"The Red Balloon\" directed by Albert Lamorisse.\n\nThe film opened the \"Un Certain Regard\" section of the Cannes Film Festival in May 2007.\n\nSuzanne, a puppeteer, lives with her young son Simon in an apartment in Paris. While Suzanne is busy with producing her new Chinese puppet play based on an ancient Chinese text (求妻煮海人), she hires a Chinese film student Song as Simon's new nanny. For her college project - a homage to Albert Lamorisse's famous 1956 film \"The Red Balloon\" - Song starts to film Simon. She develops a good relationship with mother and son, and translates for Suzanne's masterclass with a Chinese puppet master. \n\nWhile Simon's older sister Louise is about to graduate from a high school in Brussels, Suzanne plans for Louise to apply for colleges in Paris. For that, she tries to evict her downstairs tenant Marc, who has repeatedly failed to pay his rent, while arguing on the phone with Pierre, Simon's father, who has absented himself to Canada for two years to write a novel and who is rarely in touch. Simon visits the Musée d'Orsay on a school trip, where his class is shown \"The Ball\", a painting by Félix Vallotton in which a child chases a red ball.\n\n\nRotten Tomatoes reported that 80% of 87 sampled critics and 90% of top critics gave the film positive reviews. The average rating is 6.9 out of 10.\n\nJ. Hoberman, writing in \"The Village Voice\" was particularly appreciative of the film stating, \"Flight of the Red Balloon is contemplative but never static, and punctuated by passages of pure cinema\".\n\nKate Stables of Sight & Sound also highly praised the film, \"Finding a serene and contemplative beauty in the quotidian world has long been Taiwanese master-minimalist Hou Hsiao Hsien's stock in trade... Hou brings the same depth and deliberation to the film's Parisian exterior... ultimately, it is cinema that is the film's sacred repository of memory and creativity.\"\n\nJonathan Rosenbaum of Chicago Reader likes the film as <nowiki>\"</nowiki>A relatively slight but sturdy work by Taiwanese master Hou Hsiao-hsien, this slice of contemporary urban life more or less does for Paris what his Cafe Lumiere did for Tokyo, albeit with less minimalism and more overt emotion\".<nowiki>\"</nowiki>\"\n\nOn the other hand, Duane Byrge of Hollywood Reporter was not impressed. \"The imagery of the classic movie, where a spirited red balloon wafts unpredictably over Paris, never even attempts to reach a metaphorical height, nor does it even engage us compositionally.\"\n\nThe film appeared on several critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008.\n\n\nThe film won the FIPRESCI Prize at the 2007 Valladolid International Film Festival.\n\n"}
{"id": "4726468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4726468", "title": "Godzilla (franchise)", "text": "Godzilla (franchise)\n\nThe first film, \"Godzilla\", was directed by Ishirō Honda and released by Toho in 1954 and became an influential classic of the genre. It featured political and social undertones relevant to Japan at the time. The original introduced an acclaimed music score by Akira Ifukube, which was reused in many of the later films. The original also introduced the work of special effects master Eiji Tsuburaya, who used miniatures and \"suitmation\" to convey the large scale of the monster and its destruction. For its North American release, the film was reworked as an adaptation and released in 1956 as \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\". The adaptation featured new footage with Raymond Burr edited together with the original Japanese footage.\n\nToho was inspired to make the original \"Godzilla\" after the commercial success of the 1952 re-release of \"King Kong\" and success of \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" (1953). The success of the \"Godzilla\" series itself would go on to inspire other monster films worldwide. The popularity of the films has led to Godzilla being featured in other media, such as television, music, literature, and video games. Godzilla has been one of the most recognizable symbols in Japanese pop culture worldwide, remains a well-known facet of Japanese films and was one of the first examples of the popular \"kaiju\" and \"tokusatsu\" subgenres in Japanese entertainment.\n\nThe tone and themes vary per film. Several of the films have political themes, others have dark tones, complex internal mythology, or are simple action movies featuring aliens or other monsters, while others have simpler themes accessible to children. Godzilla's role varies from purely a destructive force to an ally of humans, or a protector of Japanese values, or a hero to children. The name Godzilla is a romanization of the original Japanese name Gojira—which is a combination of two Japanese words: \"gorira\" (ゴリラ), \"gorilla\", and \"kujira\" (クジラ), \"whale\". The word alludes to the size, power and aquatic origin of Godzilla. As developed by Toho, the monster is an offshoot of the combination of radioactivity and ancient dinosaur-like creatures, indestructible and possessing special powers (see Godzilla characteristics).\n\nThe \"Godzilla\" film series is broken into several (different) eras reflecting a characteristic style and corresponding to the same eras used to classify all kaiju eiga (monster movies) in Japan. The first two eras refer to the Japanese emperor during production: the Shōwa era and the Heisei era. The third is called the Millennium era as the emperor (Heisei) is the same but these films are considered to have a different style and storyline than the Heisei era.\n\nOver the series history, the films have reflected the social and political climate in Japan. In the original film, Godzilla was an allegory for the effects of the hydrogen bomb, and the consequences that such weapons might have on earth. The radioactive contamination of the Japanese fishing boat \"Daigo Fukuryū Maru\" through the United States' Castle Bravo thermonuclear device test on Bikini Atoll on March 1, 1954, led to much press coverage in Japan preceding the release of the first movie in 1954. The Heisei and Millennium series have largely continued this concept.\n\nThe initial series of movies is named for the Shōwa period in Japan (as all of these films were produced before the \"Shōwa Emperor\" Hirohito's death in 1989). This Shōwa timeline spanned from 1954, with \"Godzilla\", to 1975, with \"Terror of Mechagodzilla\". With the exceptions of \"Godzilla\", \"Godzilla Raids Again\", \"Mothra vs. Godzilla\" and \"Terror of Mechagodzilla\", much of the Shōwa series monster-action was intentionally made comical and laughable for children, with Godzilla frequently engaged in clownish slapstick wrestling with other monsters. Starting with \"Ghidorah the Three-Headed Monster\", Godzilla began evolving into a friendlier, more playful antihero (this transition was complete by \"Son of Godzilla\", where it is shown as a good character), and as years went by, it evolved into an anthropomorphic superhero. \"Ghidorah the Three-Headed Monster\" was also significant for introducing Godzilla's arch-enemy and the main antagonist of the movie series, King Ghidorah. The films \"Son of Godzilla\" and \"All Monsters Attack\" were aimed at youthful audiences, featuring the appearance of Godzilla's son, Minilla. \"Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla\" was notable for introducing Godzilla's robotic arch-enemy and secondary villain of the movie series Mechagodzilla. The Shōwa period tied loosely in to a number of Toho-produced films in which Godzilla himself did not appear and consequently saw the addition of many monsters into the \"Godzilla\" continuity, three of which (Mothra, Rodan and Varan) originated in their own solo movies and another five (Anguirus, Kumonga, Baragon, Manda and Gorosaurus) appeared in their first films as either antagonistic or secondary characters.\n\nHaruo Nakajima mainly portrayed Godzilla since 1954 until his retirement in 1972. However, other stunt actors portrayed the character in his absence, such as Katsumi Tezuka, Yū Sekida, Ryosaku Takasugi, Seiji Onaka, Shinji Takagi, Isao Zushi, and Toru Kawai. Eiji Tsuburaya directed the special effects for the first six films of the series. His protege Sadamasa Arikawa took over the effects work for the next three films (with Tsuburaya supervising), while Teruyoshi Nakano directed the special effects for the last six films of the series.\n\nToho rebooted the series in 1984 with \"The Return of Godzilla\", starting the second era of \"Godzilla\" films, known as the \"Heisei\" series. \"The Return of Godzilla\" serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film and ignores the subsequent events of the Showa era. \"The Return of Godzilla\" was released in 1984, five years before the new Emperor, but is considered part of this era, as it is a direct predecessor to \"Godzilla vs. Biollante\" (1989), which came out in the first year of the new Emperor's reign.\n\nThe Heisei films are set in a single timeline, with each film providing continuity to the other films, and brings Godzilla back as a destructive force of nature that is feared by humans. The biological nature and science behind Godzilla became a much more discussed issue in the films, showing the increased focus on the moral aspects of genetics. \"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah\" gave the first concrete birth story for Godzilla, featuring a \"Godzillasaurus\" dinosaur-like creature that was mutated by nuclear radiation into Godzilla. Godzilla was portrayed by Kenpachiro Satsuma for the Heisei films while the special effects were directed by Koichi Kawakita, with the exception of \"The Return of Godzilla\", for which the effects were directed by Teruyoshi Nakano.\n\nToho rebooted the franchise for a second time, with the 1999 film \"\", starting the third era of \"Godzilla\" films, known as the Millennium series. The Millennium series is treated similarly to an anthology series where each film, with the exception of \"Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla\" and \"\" (which are a series all their own), is set in its own timeline and follows-up on the events of the original 1954 film, but ignores the events of the Shōwa and Heisei eras.\n\nAfter the release of 2004's \"\", marking the 50th anniversary of the \"Godzilla\" film franchise, Toho decided to put the series on hiatus for another 10 years. Toho also demolished the water stage on its lot used in numerous \"Godzilla\", kaiju and tokusatsu films. Yoshimitsu Banno, who had directed 1971's \"Godzilla vs. Hedorah\", secured the rights from Toho to make an IMAX 3D short film production, based on a story similar to his \"Hedorah\" film. This project eventually led to the development of Legendary's \"Godzilla\".\n\nTsutomu Kitagawa portrayed Godzilla for the majority of the Millennium films, with the exception of \"\", in which Godzilla was portrayed by Mizuho Yoshida. Unlike the Showa and later Heisei films, the special effects for the Millennium films were directed by multiple effects directors such as Kenji Suzuki (\"Godzilla 2000\", \"Godzilla vs. Megaguirus\"), Makoto Kamiya (\"Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack\"), Yuichi Kikuchi (\"Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla\"), and Eiichi Asada (\"Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.\", \"Godzilla: Final Wars\").\n\nIn December 2014, Toho announced plans for a new \"Godzilla\" film of their own for a 2016 release. The film is intended to be Toho's own reboot of the \"Godzilla\" franchise and is co-directed by Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi (both who collaborated on the anime \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\"), with the screenplay written by Anno and the special effects directed by Higuchi. Principal photography began on September and ended in October with the special effects work following in November that year. \"Shin Godzilla\" was released in Japan on July 29, 2016 in IMAX, 4DX, and MX4D to positive reviews and was a box office success.\n\nIn August 2016, Toho announced plans for a trilogy of anime \"Godzilla\" films with Polygon Pictures animating the films and Netflix distributing the trilogy worldwide, except in Japan where each film will be given a theatrical release by Toho. The first film, titled \"\", was released on November 17, 2017. The second film, titled \"\", was released on May 18, 2018. The third and final film in the trilogy, titled \"\", was released on November 9, 2018.\n\nIn January 2018, Toho announced its plans to invest 15 billion yen ($135 million) for the next three years beginning in 2019 to co-produce content with Hollywood and Chinese studios who have licensed Toho's properties, such as \"Godzilla\", \"Your Name\", and \"Pokémon\". Toho will invest 25% in production costs and will earn a higher share in revenue and manage creators rights so their creative input will be shown in each work.\n\nIn May 2018, Toho’s Chief Godzilla Officer Keiji Ota revealed that a sequel to \"Shin Godzilla\" will not happen but revealed plans for a \"World of Godzilla\", a shared cinematic universe between Godzilla and other Toho monsters after 2021. Ota cited the Marvel Cinematic Universe as an influence, with plans to release a new film every one to two years. Ota stated: \n\nIn 1956, Jewell Enterprises Inc., licensed \"Godzilla\" and produced an \"Americanized\" version of the film \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\". The film utilized a majority of the footage from the Japanese original but a majority of the political themes and social commentaries were removed, resulting in 30 minutes of footage from the Japanese original replaced with new scenes shot exclusively for the film featuring Raymond Burr interacting with Japanese actors and look-alikes to make it seem like Burr was a part of the original Japanese production. In addition, sound-effects and soundtracks were tweaked and some dialogue was dubbed into English. Similar \"Americanizations\" occurred for the North American releases of \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\" and \"Godzilla 1985,\" the latter which included Burr reprising the role of American journalist Steve Martin.\n\nIn 1957, producer Harry Rybnick attempted to produce a Hollywood remake of \"Godzilla Raids Again\" titled \"The Volcano Monsters\", however, funding from AB-PT Pictures collapsed after the company closed down and \"Godzilla Raids Again\" was instead dubbed in English and released in 1959 by Warner Bros. as \"Gigantis the Fire Monster\".\n\nIn 1965, Toho co-produced \"Invasion of Astro-Monster\" with American studio UPA, marking the first time a \"Godzilla\" film was co-produced with an American studio.\n\nIn the 1980s, filmmaker Steve Miner pitched his idea for an American 3D production of \"Godzilla\" to Toho, with story boards by William Stout and a script written by Fred Dekker, titled \"\" which featured Godzilla destroying San Francisco in an attempt to find its only offspring. Various studios and producers showed interest in the project but passed it over due to high budget concerns. The film would have featured a full scale animatronic Godzilla head built by Rick Baker, stop motion animation executed by David W. Allen, additional storyboards by Doug Wildey, an articulated stop motion Godzilla figure created by Stephen Czerkas, and the production design overseen by William Stout.\n\nIn October 1992, TriStar Pictures acquired the rights from Toho with plans to produce a trilogy. Director Jan de Bont and writers Terry Rossio and Ted Eliott developed a script that had Godzilla battling a shape-shifting alien called \"the Gryphon\". De Bont later left the project after budget disagreements with the studio. Roland Emmerich was hired to direct and co-write a new script with producer Dean Devlin.\n\n\"Godzilla\" was released on May 20, 1998 to negative reviews from critics and fans and was a box office success, grossing $136 million domestically and $379 million worldwide, however, it was considered a box office disappointment. Two planned sequels were cancelled and an was produced instead. TriStar let the license expire in 2003. In 2004, Toho began trademarking new iterations of TriStar's Godzilla as \"Zilla\", with only the incarnations from the 1998 film and animated show retaining the Godzilla copyright/trademark.\n\nIn 2004, director Yoshimitsu Banno acquired permission from Toho to produce a short IMAX \"Godzilla\" film. In 2009, the project was turned over to Legendary Pictures to be redeveloped as a feature film reboot. Announced in March 2010, the film was co-produced with Warner Bros. Pictures and was directed by Gareth Edwards.\n\n\"Godzilla\" was released on May 16, 2014 to positive reviews from critics and fans and was a box office success, grossing $200 million domestically and $529 million worldwide. The film's success prompted Toho to produce a reboot of their own and Legendary to proceed with sequels and a shared cinematic franchise, with \"\" set to be released on May 31, 2019, and \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" set to be released on May 22, 2020.\n\nFrom 1954 through 2017, there have been 32 \"Godzilla\" films produced by Toho in Japan. There have been several American productions: adaptations including \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\", \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\" and \"Godzilla 1985\", and three Hollywood productions: \"Godzilla\" (1998) produced by TriStar Pictures, and \"Godzilla\" (2014) and \"Godzilla: King of the Monsters\" (2019) produced by Legendary Entertainment in partnership with Warner Bros. Pictures. \n\n\nIn 1976, Italian director Luigi Cozzi intended to re-release \"Godzilla\" in Italy. Facing resistance from exhibitors to showing a black and white film, Cozzi instead licensed a negative of \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters\" from Toho and created a new movie in color, adding lots of stock footage of graphic death and destruction and short scenes from newsreel footage from World War II, which he released as \"Godzilla\" in 1977. The film was colorized using a process called Spectrorama 70, where color gels are put on the original black and white film, becoming one of the first black and white movies to be colorized. Dialogue was dubbed into Italian and new music was added. After the initial Italian run, the negative became Toho's property and prints have only been exhibited in Italy. Italian firm Yamato Video at one time intended to release the colorized version on a double DVD along with the original \"Godzilla\".\n\nIn 2007, a CGI Godzilla appeared in the Toho slice of life movie \"Always Zoku Sanchōme no Yūhi\" (\"Always: Sunset on Third Street 2\"). In an imaginary sequence, Godzilla destroys part of 1959 Tokyo, with one of the main protagonists getting angry that Godzilla damaged his car showroom. The making of the sequence was kept a secret. Godzilla has been referenced and has briefly appeared in several other films. Godzilla guest starred in the show \"Crayon Shin-chan\" as an antagonist. Godzilla also appears in cave paintings (alongside Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidorah) in a post-credits scene in \"\".\n\nBelow is a chart listing the number of tickets sold for each \"Godzilla\" film in Japan including the imported Hollywood films. The films are listed from the most attended to the least attended. Almost all of the 1960s films were reissued, so the lifetime number of tickets sold is listed with the initial release ticket numbers mentioned in notes.\n\nBy 2016, the series had sold more than 100million tickets at the Japanese box office. It was the highest-grossing film franchise in Japan, up until it was surpassed by the anime film series \"Doraemon\" in 2013.\n\n\"Note: Multiple films do not have a score on Rotten Tomatoes, but do have reviews, which have been converted to a score, the same way that Rotten Tomatoes calculates scores.\"\nIn Japan, Godzilla appeared in five out of 26 episodes of Toho's live-action \"Zone Fighter\" television program in 1973. Also in Japan, Godzilla (along with a plethora of other kaiju) appeared in an animated toy show called \"Godzilla Island\" that ran in 1997–1998.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996, four 30 minute episode OVA's were created featuring Godzilla and various other kaiju from the Showa series of movies. The characters were depicted in a cute and friendly 'chibi'-esque anime style. The series of OVA's was titled \"Godzilland\" (ゴジランド \"Gojirando\") and was aimed at primary school age children. This series featured Godzilla (the main protagonist), Gojirin (a pink female version of Godzilla), Minilla (Godzilla Junior), Mothra (and two Mothra larvae), King Ghidorah, Gigan, Hedorah (who is depicted as female in this adaptation), Moguera, Rodan, Baragon, Mechagodzilla, Anguirus and Ebirah. \"Godzilland\" was conceived initially to sell merchandise for the \"Godzill\"a franchise. The depictions of Godzilla and the various other kaiju were featured on stickers, toys, cards and board games.\n\nThe educational media company Gakken and the film studio Toho collaborated together to release two additional direct-to-video shorts of \"Godzilland\" which were both called \"Recommend! Godzilland\" (すすめ！ゴジランド \"Susume! Gojirando\") in 1994. The main purpose of the first of the two video shorts was teaching Japanese children how to write in Hiragana (すすめ!ゴジランド～ひらがな – \"Susume! Gojirando ~ Hi-ra ga na\") and the other was intended to teach Japanese children how to count. ( すすめ!ゴジランド～かず1・2・3 – \"Susume! Gojirando ~ kazu 1 2 3\"). Both specials featured all the characters who were in the \"Godzilland\" TV anime series. Two other TV specials were released two years later by the same company, but had different educational topics. These two specials were centered around math. The first of these two specials was called \"すすめ！ゴジランド-ゴジラとあそぼう たしざん – \"Susume! Gojirando – Gojira to asobouta shizan\" and the second was titled \"すすめ！ゴジランド ゴジラとあそぼう ひきざん – \"Susume! Gojirando Gojira to asobou hiki zan\". These two specials centered around addition and subtraction.\nThe episodes of \"Recommend! Godzilland\" was directed by Seinosuke Tanaka & Osamu Nakayama.\n\n\"Hi-ra ga na\" and \"kazu 1 2 3\" were the only two episodes to use both cel animation and digital ink and paint animation, but \"Gojira to asobouta shizan\" and \"Gojira to asobou hiki zan\" were the only episodes to fully use digital ink and paint animation.\n\n\"Godzilland\" also included live action segments, which featured a human girl and an actor in a Godzilla suit. The segments would consist of Godzilla telling the girl about his childhood adventures.\n\nThe success of the \"Godzilla\" franchise has spawned two American Saturday morning cartoon TV series: the first one is the collaboration series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and co-produced by Toho, \"Godzilla\", and the second one produced by Sony Pictures Television, \"\", a cartoon sequel to the 1998 film. Both series feature a scientific investigative team who call upon Godzilla as an ally, as well as making several homages to the Shōwa films. Several antagonist monsters in both series have been inspired by extant Toho creations.\n\nIn 1991, two \"Godzilla\" films, \"Godzilla vs. Megalon\" and \"Godzilla versus the Sea Monster\", were shown on the movie-mocking TV show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\".\n\nA creature resembling Godzilla in parody, alongside another parody character resembling what appears to be a cross between Ultraman and Kamen Rider, appears in the television special \"Olive, The Other Reindeer\" during the song \"Merry Christmas After All\", during part of which Olive, Santa, and the other reindeer are shown passing through Tokyo delivering gifts. The two characters are shown to be friendly and taking part in the song and dance routine shown to include numerous figures, both real and fictional, in the show in various locations visited by the team as they make Santa's annual trip around the world.\n\nGodzilla made an appearance in a Nike commercial in which Godzilla (this version was created at ILM) went one-on-one in an oversized basketball game with a giant version of the NBA star Charles Barkley.\n\nGodzilla has been referenced multiple times in the American animated TV sitcom \"The Simpsons\". Godzilla first appeared in the episode \"Lisa on Ice\" when Lisa imagines herself on Monster Island and is chased by various kaiju, including Godzilla. It has also been referenced in \"Treehouse of Horror VI\", \"Mayored to the Mob\" (where Godzilla can be seen signing autographs at Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con), \"Thirty Minutes over Tokyo\" (in which the plane carrying the Simpson family is being attacked by Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra and Gamera), \"Simpsons Tall Tales\", \"Treehouse of Horror XVI\", \"Homerazzi\", \"Wedding for Disaster\", \"The Real Housewives of Fat Tony\", \"Treehouse of Horror XXIV\" and \"Treehouse of Horror XXVI\".\n\nA game called \"Gojira-kun\" (which was originally going to be titled \"Gojiraland\") was released for the MSX in 1985. The art style is similar to the style used in the \"Godzilland\" OVA's. In 1990, \"Gojira-kun: Kaijū Daikōshin\" was released for the Game Boy. It featured sprites that were similar to the ones used in \"Gojira-kun\". The game included cut scenes that depicted a different style to the rest of the game. In 1993, \"Super Godzilla\" 's Bagan, a newly created Toho-approved creation, was released for the SNES and featured original monsters that were video game-only kaiju in a former film/movie. \n\nIn 2007, \"\" Krystalak and Obsidius, two newly created Toho-approved creations, was released for the Wii and DS and featured original monsters that were video game-only kaiju. Legendary's Godzilla was featured as a playable character in Bandai Namco's 2014 video game \"Godzilla\" as \"Hollywood Godzilla\". The widely popular video game \"Pokémon\" has made multiple references to Godzilla. The Dark/Rock type Pokémon Tyranitar is a direct reference to Godzilla. The Pokémon's appearance is a large green lizard monster-type creature who is characterised as an unstoppable force. In 2015–present, \"Gojira\" and \"Godzilla 2600\" from Homebrew fangame were released for the NES and Atari 2600.\n\nA \"Godzilla\" series of books was published by Random House during the late 1990s. The company created different series for different age groups, the Scott Ciencin series being aimed at preteens and the Marc Cerasini series being aimed at teens and young adults. Several manga have been derived from specific \"Godzilla\" films and both Marvel and Dark Horse have published \"Godzilla\" comic book series (1977–1979 and 1987–1999, respectively). In 2011, IDW Publishing started a new series \"Godzilla: Kingdom of Monsters\" rebooting the Godzilla story. It was followed by two sequel series, \"Godzilla\" (published in book form as \"Godzilla: History's Greatest Monster\") and \"Godzilla: Rulers of Earth\", as well as seven five-issue miniseries to date.\n\nTo tie-in with the 2014 film, three books were published. Titan Books published a novelization of the movie in May 2014, written by Greg Cox. The graphic novel \"Godzilla: Awakening\" by Max Borenstein, Greg Borenstein and Eric Battle served as a prequel, and \"Godzilla: The Art of Destruction\" by Mark Cotta told about the making of the movie. Godzilla has been referenced in \"The Simpsons\" comics on three separate occasions. The character is featured in \"Bart Simpson's Guide to Life\" where it and other kaiju characters such as Minilla and King Ghidorah can be seen; it is featured in the comic \"An Anime Among Us!\" and \"K-Bart\". Godzilla is also featured in the comic \"Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror 7\" where it and other kaiju can be seen referenced on the front cover. Godzilla has also been referenced in Marc Brown's \"Arthur\" adventure book called \"Arthur's April Fool\" where Francine told Arthur & Buster that they need to pick on someone their own size like Godzilla. Both Godzilla & Arthur became the two of the most popular characters to root for.\n\n\"\", the soundtrack album of \"Godzilla\" (1998), sold 2.5million copies worldwide. The album's lead single, \"Come with Me\" by Puff Daddy featuring Jimmy Page, sold a certified 2.025million copies worldwide. Its Japan-exclusive single, \"Lose Control\" by Japanese rock band L'Arc-en-Ciel, sold 938,401 copies in Japan. \"Shin Godzilla Ongakushuu\", the soundtrack album of \"Shin Godzilla\" (2016), sold 43,951 copies in Japan. \"Mars\" (1991), an album by the Japanese rock duo B'z featuring a Godzilla-themed song, sold 1,730,500 copies in Japan.\n\nBlue Öyster Cult released the song \"Godzilla\" in 1977. Artists such as Fu Manchu, Racer X and Double Experience have included cover versions of this song on their albums. American musician Michale Graves wrote a song titled \"Godzilla\" for his 2005 album, \"Punk Rock Is Dead.\" The lyrics mention Godzilla and several on-screen adversaries such as Mothra, Hedorah, Destoroyah, and Gigan. The Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura has a song titled \"Biotech is Godzilla\" on its 1993 release \"Chaos A.D.\" The French death metal band Gojira named the band after Godzilla's name in Japanese. \n\nThe song \"Simon Says\" by Pharoahe Monch is a hip-hop remix of the Godzilla March theme song. The instrumental version of this song was notably used in the 2000 film \"Charlie's Angels\". The British band Lostprophets released a song called \"We Are Godzilla, You Are Japan\" on its second studio album \"Start Something\". The American punk band Groovie Ghoulies released a song called \"Hats off to You (Godzilla)\" as a tribute to Godzilla. It is featured on the EP \"Freaks on Parade\" released in 2002. The American artist Doctor Steel released a song called 'Atomic Superstar' about Godzilla on his album \"People of Earth\" in 2002. In 2003, the British singer Siouxsie Sioux released the album \"Hái!\" with her band The Creatures; the album had a Japanese theme with a song dedicated to the monster, simply titled \"Godzilla!\".\n\nThe record label Shifty issued compilation \"Destroysall\" with 15 songs from 15 bands, ranging from hardcore punk to doom-laden death metal. Not all songs are dedicated to Godzilla, but all do appear connected to monsters from Toho Studios. Fittingly, the disc was released on August 1, 2003, the 35th anniversary of the Japanese release of \"Destroy All Monsters\".\nKing Geedorah (a.k.a. MF DOOM) released \"Take Me to Your Leader\", a hip-hop album featuring guests from the group Monsta Island Czars, another Godzilla-themed hip-hop group. These albums include multiple Godzilla samples throughout the series. Taiwanese American electronic musician Mochipet released the EP \"Godzilla Rehab Center\" on August 21, 2012, featuring songs named after monsters in the series including Gigan, King Ghidorah, Moguera and Hedorah.\n\nGodzilla is one of the most recognizable symbols of Japanese popular culture worldwide and is an important facet of Japanese films, embodying the kaiju subset of the tokusatsu genre. It has been considered a filmographic metaphor for the United States (with the \"-zilla\" part of the name being used in vernacular language as a suffix to indicate something of exaggerated proportions), as well as an allegory of nuclear weapons in general. The earlier \"Godzilla\" films, especially the original \"Godzilla\", portrayed Godzilla as a frightening, nuclear monster. Godzilla represented the fears that many Japanese held about the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the possibility of recurrence.\n\nAt least two prehistoric creatures from the fossil record have been named after Godzilla. \"Gojirasaurus quayi\" is a theropod dinosaur that lived in the Triassic Period; a partial skeleton was unearthed in Quay County, New Mexico. \"Dakosaurus andiniensis\", a crocodile from the Jurassic Period, was nicknamed \"Godzilla\" before being scientifically classified. In 2010 the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society named their most recently acquired scout vessel MV \"Gojira\".

{"id": "54285124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54285124", "title": "Grapevine radio", "text": "Grapevine radio\n\nGrapevine radio refers to the transmission infrastructures, used for distributing audio programs, which were built to serve a small number of rural upstate South Carolina communities from the early 1930s to the middle 1940s. Despite their name, these systems did not employ radio transmitters, but were actually a type of \"telephone newspaper\", because the programs were sent telephonically over wires strung to subscribing homes.\n\nThe equipment used to distribute programming over a facility's wire network was located at a central site, for example a general store's back room. Programs normally consisted of retransmissions of radio stations, however, some programming was locally produced, originating from a studio at the distribution site or relayed from a local church or other gathering place. The locally produced programs included announcements and emergency messages, commercials and live performances. The transmissions were made daily, generally starting around 6 a.m. and running until 10:00 p.m. or midnight.\n\nThe grapevine systems soon became unneeded, because they primarily served homes that did not have electricity. Once a community received electric service the local grapevine system would soon close down, as the subscribers switched to radio receivers that could receive a wide selection of programs at no cost, instead of the single program and monthly fees characteristic of the grapevine systems.\nInformation about the grapevine installations (also called \"speakerline\") is limited, because of their brief history and the fact that they do not appear to have been established outside a small region of South Carolina. Unlike radio stations, they did not require government approval to operate. Their existence was also dependent on an unusual and short-lived economic and technical environment, as they required a central distribution site that had access to electricity, plus a surrounding community of prospective subscribers that did not have electric service.\n\nThroughout the 1930s large parts of the United States, including most farms, did not have electricity. Although organized radio broadcasting had begun in the early 1920s, in rural upstate South Carolina there were no nearby radio stations strong enough to be picked up by battery-less crystal radio receivers, and although battery-powered sets existed, without electrical service there was no convenient way to recharge the batteries. The economic struggles caused by the Great Depression meant that many people could not even afford a newspaper subscription. Thus, there was a lack of entertainment and a strong sense of isolation in the region. As one person remembered, connecting to the grapevine service meant that \"we had 'arrived' and were at last in touch with the outside world\".\n\nThe rural electrification projects of the 1930s and 1940s eventually eliminated potential customers, making the grapevine systems no longer needed as their former customers switched to listening to radio stations.\n\nThe first grapevine system was begun in the winter of 1930-1931 by a high school student, Gordon F. Rogers, who lived on farm in central Greenville county near Mauldin, South Carolina. The Rogers farm, unlike most of its neighbors, had electrical service. Gordon Rogers had shown an early aptitude for engineering, developing a clock that automatically turned on the farm's chicken coup lights at 3:00 a.m., as well as an automated system for watering the chickens. Rogers also had an early interest in radio. Dissatisfied with a battery operated set, he successfully reconditioned a vacuum tube receiver that ran on AC electrical power. At this point he decided to also run a single-wire connection with a ground return from his receiver to a loudspeaker at the home of a neighbor who didn't have electricity. With this setup, whenever Rogers' radio was on the neighbor also heard what was being received. Word of this innovation quickly spread, and within a month lines had been run to seven nearby homes.\n\nRogers' system was essentially sending one-way telephone signals over his own wires, but he had to use voltages far higher than that used by standard telephone lines, because he was sending not only audio but also the power needed to operate what would become hundreds of loudspeakers. His initial setup output was 2.5 watts, but as the system expanded this was increased in steps over time to 350-400 watts. This occasionally led to issues when his wires ran too close to standard telephone lines, which sometimes picked up the strong grapevine transmissions. Special steps had to be taken to eliminate interference with the telephone company's service.\n\nSubscribers had to provide the wire, poles (often actually fence posts) and speakers needed to connect to the main system lines. Unskilled attempts by individuals to tap into the lines without paying generally caused service disruptions for nearby customers, which made it possible to locate and remove the improper connections. Although at first the service was provided for free, as the number of participants grew Rogers began charging a monthly 10 cent fee. This charge was later raised to 25 cents, and at times a $1 surcharge was applied to finance replacement of sections of the transmission lines that needed to be upgraded from the original iron wire to higher quality materials. The system became profitable enough to finance Rogers' attendance at Clemson College. In 1933, at the time of his college enrollment, the system had 5 miles (8 kilometers) of lines and 15 subscribers. Increasing demand, spurred by finding a source of affordable speakers ($2.85 each), expanded the number of connections to more than 200 within the next four months, and by June 1934 the transmission lines spanned 15 miles (24 kilometers). By around 1935, there were 600 homes connected to the grapevine service, including sites in Spartanburg and Laurens counties, located up to 24 miles (38 kilometers) distant from the Rogers farm distribution site. The infrastructure had also grown to 400 miles (645 kilometers) of transmission lines.\n\nProgramming was provided for about 12 hours each day. Rogers introduced a \"local talent\" program that featured live performances. A record player provided music for times when static made it difficult to receive the radio rebroadcasts that provided most of the schedule. Provisions were also made to make local announcements. In addition, a carrier current link from the system based at Ware Place allowed programming originating at that location to be picked up and concurrently transmitted by the Mauldin system. \n\nIn the spring of 1936, Rogers, now a junior at Clemson, presented a paper, \"Bringing Radio to the Rural Home\", at a regional conference of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, which provided technical information about his innovation. His review won first place in its category. The Mauldin-based system remained in operation until the area received electrical service, shutting down around 1939.\n\nGordon Rogers' original system served northern Greenville county. A second wire network, originating from a small store in Ware Place, South Carolina, was later established which provided an extensive program service for the southern part of the county. The store's owners, J. R. Chandler, Jr. and his cousin J. E. Chandler, became familiar with the Mauldin facility, and around 1934 arranged for Gordon Rogers and Sherman Fox to install similar distribution equipment at their store. The Chandlers became active participants operating the system and supplying local programming. A studio, which included a piano and a pulpit, was built in the rear of the store. There was also a connection to the local school.\n\nSubscribers were initially charged 25 cents a month, which was later increased to 35 cents. Individual homes had to maintain their local wire connections, and purchase their own speakers: $3 to $5 for a small one, and $7 to $8 for a large one. An unusual additional benefit resulted from the discovery that, after the grapevine programming ended for the night, individual subscribers could hear each other if they spoke loudly into their speakers, resulting in a form of party-line communication. At its peak over 500 homes were connected. The system continued to run during World War II in order to supply war news, after which it was shut down.\n\nThis installation helped launch the political career of Robert C. Wasson, who went on to become the state's Tax Chairman. The Wasson family ran a small store in Hickory Tavern, South Carolina, located in southwest Laurens county. The needed equipment was purchased in March 1936 and the service was immediately popular. Later that year, when Robert Wasson announced what would be a successful candidacy for the state House of Representatives, a newspaper report noted that the store he ran \"is known as Wasson Brothers store, mill, and grapevine radio system serving 200 rural homes\".\n\nCustomers were charged 25 cents per month, and paid $6.50 for a small speaker or $10.50 for a large one — this fee included installation. Robert Wasson's mother, Effie Owens Wasson, handled most of the operational duties, and at its peak about 500 houses within a 12 mile (19 kilometer) radius were connected. Regular news reports and live entertainment made up an important part of the daily schedule. Advertising over the facility was credited with helping to establish the Eaddy-Blakes corner drug store in Laurens, and a former pharmacy employee later wrote that \"were Dr. Eaddy still living I'm sure he would attribute the biggest thing to his success in the drug business was this advertising... It cost him about a dollar a week and he had every person from the area as a regular customer in a short time\". \n\nRobert Wasson served seven terms in the South Carolina legislature. One of his political objectives was getting electrical service for his community, and after the rural electrification program reached his district the grapevine service ceased operations in 1939.\n\nSaylors Crossroads, South Carolina is a small community located in southeastern Anderson county. This system was inspired by the existence of the Ware Place operations, and was established by Charles Murdock in 1937. The Murdock family operated a general store, and a small studio was constructed in a building behind the store. The grapevine service was run by Selma Saylors, who was the twin sister of Charles Murdock's wife. Programming primarily consisted of relaying the transmissions of a local radio station, WAIM in Anderson. WAIM signed off at 9 p.m. each evening, and at that point the program source was switched to picking up \"a station in Cincinnati\" (presumably WLW). Local programming included the Sunday morning church services from Mount Bethel Baptist Church, carried from 1938 to 1940. \n\nSubscribers paid 45 cents a month, and chose between three speaker sizes: a smaller square-shaped speaker for $7.50, a larger square-shaped speaker for $9.50, and a heart-shaped speaker for $12.50. The speaker purchases financed the installation of the wire connection to the main transmission lines. At its peak, the service had 500 subscribers. This system ended operations in 1941, after the community received electric service.\nThis system was operated by Carl Ellison, who owned a general store located at Williamston, South Carolina in east central Anderson county. It remained in operation for \"seven or eight years\", starting sometime in the 1930s and continuing through at least 1940. It had also been initially inspired by the Ware Place operations.\n\nThe Ellisons lived in a house behind the general store, and they converted their living room to serve as a studio for locally produced programming. The service cost 50 cents a month, and reached 700 subscribers. Like the Ware Place system, after the grapevine programming ended for the night individuals could be heard by other subscribers by speaking loudly into their speakers. The system featured ministers from Greenville who preached over the system on Friday nights. It also carried the Sunday services from the First Baptist Church in Williamston.\n\nGordon Rogers estimated that a total of ten to twelve grapevine operations were eventually installed, all located in South Carolina. Additional locations reportedly included Walhalla (located in the center of South Carolina's easternmost county, Oconee), another \"near Mauldin\", and one \"across the Savannah river from Augusta, Georgia\".\n\n"}
{"id": "3990044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3990044", "title": "Gross out", "text": "Gross out\n\nGross out describes a movement in art (often comic), which aims to shock and disgust the audience with controversial material such as toilet humour, nudity, or any sexual topic.\n\nGross-out is a subgenre of comedy movies in which the makers employ humor that is willfully \"tasteless\" or even downright disgusting. It usually involves gratuitous nudity, unrealistic aggressiveness towards property or Schadenfreude. The movies are generally aimed at a younger audience aged between 18 and 24. One boon of this genre is that it provides an inexpensive way to make a movie \"edgy\" and to generate media attention for it.\n\nIn the United States, following the abolition of the film industry's censorious Production Code and its replacement with the MPAA film rating system in the late 1960s, some filmmakers began to experiment with subversive film comedies, which explicitly dealt with taboo subjects such as sex and other bodily functions. Noteworthy examples include 1972's \"Pink Flamingos\" (in which the central character eats dog excrement) and other films by John Waters, and 1974's sketch comedy film \"The Groove Tube\". As these films emerged from the counterculture movement and gained a measure of audience success, they inspired more mainstream films to follow their example. However, long before the Production Code, early silent comedy film makers produced and attempted several 'gross-out' pictures to the disdain of early film reviewers. One such example is the lost \"Nell's Eugenic Wedding\" starring Fay Tincher and Tod Browning.\n\nThe label \"gross-out movie\" was first applied by the mainstream media to 1978's \"National Lampoon's Animal House\", a comedy about the fraternity experience at US colleges. Its humor included not only explicit use of bodily functions (like projectile vomiting), but also references to topical political matters like Kent State shootings, Richard Nixon, the Vietnam war, and the civil rights movement. It was a great box office success despite its limited production costs and thus started an industry trend. Since then, gross-out films increased in number, and became almost the norm for American comedy films. Some films of this genre could be aimed at teen audiences (such as \"Superbad\", \"Porky's\", \"American Pie\" or \"Eurotrip\"), while others are targeted at somewhat more mature audiences (such as \"There's Something About Mary\", \"The Hangover\" or \"Wedding Crashers\").\n\n\"The Tom Green Show and Jackass\" and its UK cousin, \"Dirty Sanchez\", were the pioneers of \"gross out television\". The shows featured dangerous stunts, nudity, profanity, and action new to the television platform. Both series were featured on MTV, and progressed to feature-length movies. \"Beavis and Butt-Head\", \"The Ren & Stimpy Show\", Rugrats, Rocko's Modern Life, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, and \"Animaniacs\" transferred the gross-out television genre to the medium of small screen animation largely in the early 1990s. Today this continues with such shows as \"South Park\", \"Family Guy\", \"The Simpsons\", \"Futurama\", \"Rick and Morty\", Regular Show, American Dad! and \"SpongeBob SquarePants\".\n\nGross-out theater is increasingly practiced on stage, particularly in the Edinburgh Festival. However, it is also displayed in the larger and more adventurous British theaters.\n\nThe prime examples of the above are the stage version of the contemporary drama \"Trainspotting\" by bestselling playwright and author Irvine Welsh; the controversial New York musical \"Urinetown\" by Kotis and Hollmann; the outrageous anarchistic schlockomedy (shock horror comedy) musical about a Manchester jobcentre \"Restart\" by Komedy Kollective; and performances by another United Kingdom-based act, Forced Entertainment, who devised the iconic theatrical gorefest \"Bloody Mess\".\n\nControversial American cartoonist and vaudeville performer Basil Wolverton invented his trademark \"spaghetti and meatballs\" style of artwork.\n\nVarious artists helped create a flourishing gross-out art scene, which began mainly in the 1990s, the most famous of which were Damien Hirst, known for encasing mutilated, rotting cattle in formaldehyde, and making art of endangered marine species such as sharks in formaldehyde tanks, and Tracey Emin, whose exhibit of an unmade bed featured used tampons, condoms and blood-stained underwear.\n\nGross out themes are common in popular music genres, such as hip hop and hard rock, where shock value helps create marketable notoriety. Bands include Blink-182 famous for including breast and fart jokes in their songs, while bands such as Cannibal Corpse and Agoraphobic Nosebleed write extremely revolting lyrics designed to induce nausea and shock the music world.\n\nProbably the biggest gross-out shock to the music world was the act of GG Allin. Allin was infamous for his transgressive music act, which included eating excrement, mutilating himself and attacking audience members.\n\nSometimes the line between truth and urban myth is blurred by the sensationalist sections of the media. For example, Frank Zappa never ate steaming excrement live on-stage, and the famed incident involving Ozzy Osbourne biting a head off of a bat was actually unintentional (he thought the bat was a prop).\n\nSimilar themes are also sometimes conveyed in music videos, the aptly named Gross Out, a single from indie/garage rock band, The Vines.\n\n"}
{"id": "38341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38341", "title": "Harlequin", "text": "Harlequin\n\nHarlequin (; , , Old French \"Harlequin\") is the best-known of the \"zanni\" or comic servant characters from the Italian \"Commedia dell'arte\". The role is traditionally believed to have been introduced by Zan Ganassa in the late 16th century, was definitively popularized by the Italian actor Tristano Martinelli in Paris in 1584–1585, and became a stock character after Martinelli's death in 1630.\n\nThe Harlequin is characterized by his chequered costume. His role is that of a light-hearted, nimble, and astute servant, often acting to thwart the plans of his master, and pursuing his own love interest, Columbina, with wit and resourcefulness, often competing with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot. He later develops into a prototype of the romantic hero. Harlequin inherits his physical agility and his trickster qualities, as well as his name, from a mischievous \"devil\" character in medieval passion plays.\n\nThe Harlequin character first appeared in England early in the 17th century and took centre stage in the derived genre of the Harlequinade, developed in the early 18th century by John Rich. As the Harlequinade portion of English dramatic genre pantomime developed, Harlequin was routinely paired with the character Clown. As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such in Victorian England were William Payne and his sons the Payne Brothers, the latter active during the 1860s and 1870s.\n\nAlthough the origins of the Harlequin are obscure there are several theories for how the character came to be. One theory posits that the name is derived from a bird with polychromatic feathers called a \"Harle\" Another theory suggest that the name Harlequin is taken from that of a mischievous \"devil\" or \"demon\" character in popular French passion plays. It originates with an Old French term \"herlequin\", \"hellequin\", first attested in the 11th century, by the chronicler Orderic Vitalis, who recounts a story of a monk who was pursued by a troop of demons when wandering on the coast of Normandy (France ) at night.\nThese demons were led by a masked, club-wielding giant and they were known as \"familia herlequin\" (var. \"familia herlethingi\"). This medieval French version of the Germanic Wild Hunt, \"Mesnée d'Hellequin\", has been connected to the English figure of \"Herla cyning\" (\"host-king\"; German Erlkönig). \nHellequin was depicted as a black-faced emissary of the devil, roaming the countryside with a group of demons chasing the damned souls of evil people to Hell. The physical appearance of Hellequin offers an explanation for the traditional colours of Harlequin's red-and-black mask. The name's origin could also be traced to a knight from the 9th century, Hellequin of Boulogne, who died fighting the Normans and originated a legend of devils. Cantos XXI and XXII from Dante's \"Inferno\" there is a devil by the name of Alichino. The similarities between the devil in Dante's \"Inferno\" and the Arlecchino are more than cosmetic and that the prank like antics of the devils in the aforementioned antics reflect some carnivalesque aspects.\n\nThe first known appearance on stage of Hellequin is dated to 1262, the character of a masked and hooded devil in \"Jeu da la Feuillière\" by Adam de la Halle, and it became a stock character in French passion plays.\n\nThe re-interpretation of the \"devil\" stock character as a zanni character of the commedia dell'arte took place in the 16th century in France.\nZan Ganassa, whose troupe is first mentioned in Mantua in the late 1560s, is one of the earliest known actors suggested to have performed the part, although there is \"little hard evidence to support [it].\" Ganassa performed in France in 1571, and if he did play the part there, he left the field open for another actor to take up the role, when he took his troupe to Spain permanently in 1574.\n\nAmong the earliest depictions of the character are a 1570-1571 Flemish painting in the Museum of Bayeux and several woodblock prints probably dating from the 1580s in the Fossard collection, discovered by Agne Beijer in the 1920s among uncatalogued items in the Nationalmuseum Stockholm.\n\nTristano Martinelli is the first actor definitely known to have used the name 'Harlequin' (or 'Arlequin') for the \"secondo zanni\" role, and he probably first performed the part in France in (or just before) 1584 and only later brought the character to Italy, where he became known as Arlecchino. The motley costume is sometimes attributed to Martinelli, who wore a linen costume of colourful patches, and a hare-tail on his cap to indicate cowardice. Martinelli's Harlequin also had a black leather half-mask, a moustache and a pointed beard. \nHe was very successful, even playing at court and becoming a favourite of Henry IV of France, to whom he addressed insolent monologues (\"Compositions de Rhetorique de Mr. Don Arlequin\", 1601).\nMartinelli's great success contributed to the perpetuation of his interpretation of the zanni role, along with the name of his character, after his death in 1630, among others, by Nicolò Zecca, active c. 1630 in Bologna as well as Turin and Mantua.\n\nThe character was also performed in Paris at the Comédie-Italienne in Italian by Giovan Battista Andreini and Angelo Costantini (c. 1654–1729) and in French as \"Arlequin\" in the 1660s by (1636–1688), who combined the zanni types, \"making his Arlecchino witty, neat, and fluent in a croaking voice, which became as traditional as the squawk of Punch.\" \nThe Italians were expelled from France in 1697 for satirizing King Louis XIV's second wife, Madame de Maintenon, but returned in 1716 (after his death), when Tommaso Antonio Vicentini (\"Thomassin\", 1682–1739) became famous in the part. The rhombus shape of the patches arose by adaptation to the Paris fashion of the 17th century by Biancolelli.\n\nThe primary aspect of Arlecchino was his physical agility. He was very nimble and performed the sort of acrobatics the audience expected to see. The character would never perform a simple action when the addition of a cartwheel, somersault, or flip would spice up the movement.\n\nEarly characteristics of Arlecchino paint the character as a second zanni servant from northern Italy with the paradoxical attributes of a dimwitted fool and an intelligent trickster. Arlecchino is sometimes referred to as putting on a show of stupidity in a metatheatrical attempt to create chaos within the play. Physically, Arlecchino is described as wearing a costume covered in irregular patches, a hat outfitted with either a rabbit or fox's tail, and a red and black mask. The mask itself is identified by carbuncles on the forehead, small eyes, a snub nose, hollow cheeks, and sometimes bushy brows with facial hair. Arlecchino is often depicted as having a wooden sword hanging from a leather belt on his person.\n\nAside from his acrobatics, Arlecchino is also known for having several specific traits such as: \nand several other techniques.\n\nOne of the major distinctions of \"commedia dell'arte\" is the use of regional dialects. Arlecchino's speech evolved with the character. Originally speaking in a Bergamo dialect, the character adopted a mixture of French and Italian dialects when the character became more of fixture in France so as to help the performers to connect to the common masses.\n\nVarious troupes and actors would alter his behaviour to suit style, personal preferences, or even the particular scenario being performed. He is typically cast as the servant of an \"innamorato\" or \"vecchio\" much to the detriment of the plans of his master. Arlecchino often had a love interest in the person of Columbina, or in older plays any of the Soubrette roles, and his lust for her was only superseded by his desire for food and fear of his master. Occasionally, Arlecchino would pursue the innamorata, though rarely with success, as in the \"Recueil Fossard\" of the 16th century where he is shown trying to woo Donna Lucia for himself by masquerading as a foreign nobleman. He also is known to try to win any given lady for himself if he chances upon anyone else trying to woo her, by interrupting or ridiculing the new competitor. His sexual appetite is essentially immediate, and can be applied to any passing woman.\nBetween the 16th and 17th centuries Arlecchino gained some function as a politically aware character. In the \"Comèdie itlaienne\" Arlecchino would parodie French tragedies as well comment on current events.\n\nDuchartre lists the following as variations on the Harlequin role:\n\nTrivelino or Trivelin. Name is said to mean \"Tatterdemalion.\" One of the oldest versions of Harlequin, dating to the 15th century. Costume almost identical to Harlequin's, but had a variation of the 17th century where the triangular patches were replaced with moons, stars, circles and triangles. In 18th century France, Trivelino was a distinct character from Harlequin. They appeared together in a number of comedies by Pierre de Marivaux including L'Île des esclaves.\n\nTruffa, Truffaldin or Truffaldino. Popular characters with Gozzi and Goldoni, but said to be best when used for improvisations. By the 18th century was a Bergamask caricature.\n\nGuazzetto. In the seventeenth century, a variety of anonymous engravings show Guazzetto rollicking, similar to Arlechino. He wears a fox's brush, a large three-tiered collarette, wide breeches, and a loose jacket tied tightly by a belt. He also dons a neckerchief dropped over the shoulders like a small cape. Guazzetto's mask is characterized with a hooked nose and a mustache. His bat is shaped like a scimitar-esque sword.\n\nZaccagnino. Character dating to the 15th century.\n\nBagatino. A juggler.\n\nPedrolino or Pierotto. A servant or valet clad in mostly white, created by Giovanni Pellesini.\n\n16th century\n17th century\n18th century\n19th century\n20th century\n\nThe Harlequin character came to England early in the 17th century and took center stage in the derived genre of the Harlequinade, developed in the early 18th century by the Lincoln's Fields Theatre's actor-manager John Rich, who played the role under the name of Lun. As the Harlequinade portion of English pantomime developed, Harlequin was routinely paired with the character Clown.\n\nTwo developments in 1800, both involving Joseph Grimaldi, greatly changed the pantomime characters. Grimaldi starred as Clown in Charles Dibdin's 1800 pantomime, \"Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World\" at Sadler's Wells Theatre. For this elaborate production, Dibdin introduced new costume designs. Clown's costume was \"garishly colourful ... patterned with large diamonds and circles, and fringed with tassels and ruffs,\" instead of the tatty servant's outfit that had been used for a century. The production was a hit, and the new costume design was copied by others in London. Later the same year, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in \"Harlequin Amulet; or, The Magick of Mona.\" Harlequin was modified to become \"romantic and mercurial, instead of mischievous\", leaving Grimaldi's mischievous and brutish Clown as the \"undisputed agent\" of chaos, and the foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who retained stylized dance poses. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s, who contributed to 20th-century \"slapstick\" comedy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14612945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14612945", "title": "Hiragasy", "text": "Hiragasy\n\nThe \"hiragasy\" (\"hira\": song; \"gasy\": Malagasy) is a musical tradition in Madagascar and particularly among the Merina ethnic group of the Highland regions around the capital of Antananarivo. \nThe hiragasy is a day-long spectacle of music, dance, and \"kabary\" oratory performed by a troupe (typically related by blood or marriage and of rural origin) or as a competition between two troupes.\n\nThe tradition in its contemporary form began in the late 18th century when Merina prince Andrianampoinimerina first used musicians to draw a crowd for his political speeches (\"kabary\"); these troupes became independent, and began to incorporate political commentary and critique in their performances. The audience plays an active role at hiragasy events, expressing their satisfaction with the talent of the troupe members and the message they proclaim through applause, cheers or sounds of disapproval. Hiragasy troupes were used during the French colonial administration to communicate decrees and other information to the rural population in the Highlands, and as such troupe members were exempt from the forced labor requirements imposed on all other Malagasy.\n\nAfter independence from France in 1960, the hiragasy troupe was held up as an icon of traditional Malagasy culture, and began to find greater popularity along the coasts, although performances remain largely concentrated in the Highlands. Aspiring politicians routinely hire hiragasy troupes to attract a crowd for their political speeches while campaigning. While most troupes remain apolitical, some have opted to throw their support behind particular candidates to spectacular effect, as when former hiragasy member-cum-popstar Rossy authored his 1995 song \"Lera.\" The song was critical of the Zafy regime and was picked up by hiragasy troupes, who performed it across the island; the popularity of this song played a key role in mobilizing popular support for Zafy's impeachment. The most famous troupe is Ramilison Fenoarivo, Rossy's former troupe and staunch supporter of ex-President Didier Ratsiraka.\n\nThe performance of the hiragasy follows a number of conventions, such that there are certain similarities between the 80+ troupes currently performing in Madagascar. Among these are the order in which songs, dances and oratory are performed; how troupes are named (after the last name of the founding member and his/her town of origin); what costumes are worn (men typically wear straw hats, red coats and pants inspired by 19th century French military garb, and matching lamba cloth sashes; women wear identical dresses designed after the style popular among ladies of the court during the Imperial period); and which instruments are used. Traditional instruments are not common at hiragasy performances, due to the origins of the performance with the royal court, where European influences reigned. Instead, the most common instruments are violins, trumpets, and snare and bass drums; the sodina, accordion, kabosy or clarinet may occasionally make an appearance.\n\nHiragasy follow a specific structure under the direction of the troupe leader who is often the oldest member and responsible for the presentation of kabary. \n1. The Sasitehaka: Over the course of approximately ten minutes, the male members of the troupe settle in the middle of the crowd of spectators as the snare and base drummers beat an accompanying militaristic rhythm. The women are often to the side, completing their wardrobe and makeup.\n2. The Mpikabary (Making Kabary): One of the artists, often the troupe leader or oldest member of the group, will typically take off his straw hat and formally announce the beginning of the spectacle. He will invite the female members of the troupe to come to the stage and then, after a short instrumental performance, the artist will take about five minutes to introduce the theme (\"indray miditra\") of the show through \"kabary\" - a traditional type of formalized and poetic speech incorporating ohabolana (proverbs). \n3. The Renihira (Queen Song): The singers of the group form a circle facing outward and sing in harmony on the selected theme while the musicians, seated to the side, accompany them. This theme is explored and developed at length, often for more than an hour, and the singers punctuate their message with emphatic hand gestures and facial expressions. \n4. The Dihy (Dance): The singers take a seat on the ground while the musicians play behind one, two or several dancers who will perform for approximately 15 minutes. A kabary (\"kabarindihy\") is presented on the topic of the dance to be performed and announces the title of the song that accompanies it. There are two typical forms of dance that may be performed. The true \"Dihy\" is typically performed by two dancers and the style is often acrobatic or takes its inspiration from martial arts. The \"Tsikandihy\" or \"Dihy Irery\" is typically performed by one male dancer, occasionally accompanied by a female dancer. The dancing segment is concluded with another short kabary that again touches on the theme of the performance and introduces the final part.\n5. The Zanakira or Vakodrazana: A short performance lasting approximately 20 minutes that concludes the spectacle.\n\nWhen two or more troupes are competing, each troupe takes its turn at each stage before all proceed to the next stage of the performance. The troupes may all complete the entire cycle (this first round is termed the Vakisehatra) before repeating the entire process in a second round with a new set of themes (the second round being known as the Adi-Kiha) before all conclude with the Vakodrazana. In these competitive performances, troupes may have as many as three or more themes to explore and the competition may last from early morning until nightfall.\n\n"}

Possessing technology and combat capabilities far surpassing that of any other arms system, the IS threatens to destabilize the world. Faced with such an overpowered weapon, the world's nations enact the \"Alaska Treaty\", stating that IS shall never be used for military combat purposes, and that the existing IS technology must be equally distributed to all nations, to prevent any one nation from dominating the others. However, sometime after the IS was introduced, the society undergone a drastic change. As IS can only be operated by women, there is a shift in the power balance between men and women, where women now dominate society over men.\n\nTen years after the IS was initially introduced, the world has entered a new age of peace. However, a 15-year-old male Japanese teenager named Ichika Orimura changes everything. During an accidental run-in with a hibernating IS suit, it is revealed that he possesses the innate ability to operate an IS - the only male in the world capable of doing so.

{"id": "600805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=600805", "title": "Innuendo", "text": "Innuendo\n\nAn innuendo is a hint, insinuation or intimation about a person or thing, especially of a denigrating or a derogatory nature. It can also be a remark or question, typically disparaging (also called insinuation), that works obliquely by allusion. In the latter sense the intention is often to insult or accuse someone in such a way that one's words, taken literally, are innocent.\n\nAccording to the \"Advanced Oxford Learner's Dictionary\", an innuendo is \"an indirect remark about somebody or something, usually suggesting something bad, mean or rude\", such as:\" \"innuendos about her private life\" \"or\" \"The song is full of sexual innuendo\".\"\n\nThe term sexual innuendo has acquired a specific meaning, namely that of a \"risqué\" double entendre by playing on a possibly sexual interpretation of an otherwise innocent uttering. For example: \"We need to go deeper\" can be seen as either a request for further inquiry, or a request to go deeper into an intimate part.\n\nIn the context of defamation law, an innuendo meaning is one which is not directly contained in the words complained of, but which would be understood by those reading it based on special knowledge.\n\nComedy film scripts have used innuendo since the beginning of sound film itself. A notable example is the \"Carry On\" film series (1958–1992) in which innuendo was a staple feature, often including the title of the film itself. British sitcoms and comedy shows such as \"Are You Being Served?\" and \"Round the Horne\" have also made extensive use of innuendo. Mild sexual innuendo is a staple of British pantomime.\n\nNumerous television programs targeted at child audiences often use innuendos in attempt to entertain adolescent/adult audiences without exceeding their network's censorship policies.\n\nMany American primetime shows use an extensive amount of innuendo to the point that it is rated TV-PG/14 D for dialogue. Also, many radio shows, are notable for this.\n\nOn \"The Scott Mills Show\" on BBC Radio 1, listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with innuendos in a humorous context, a feature known as \"Innuendo Bingo\". Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game.\n\n"}

{"id": "31967388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31967388", "title": "Media reform", "text": "Media reform\n\nMedia reform refers to proposed attempts to reform mass media towards an agenda which is more in tune with public needs and away from a perceived bias toward corporate, government or political biases. Media reform advocates also place a strong emphasis upon enabling those who are marginalized or semi-marginalized by their individual incomes, immutable characteristics or desperate conditions to possess access to means of publication and dissemination of information. They do not come from a concern with policy, or with a desire to democratize federal bureaucracies and regulations.\n\nA related concept, media justice, refers to an analytical framework and a regional, grassroots movement led by historically disenfranchised communities to transform media and cultural production, rights and policy in the service of social justice. The Media Justice Framework offers a new way to understand and redistribute media power to achieve a fair and accessible information and cultural apparatus that fulfils its promise to inform the public, watchdog power, and serve all segments of the public equally. The Movement for Media Justice believes that media production and distribution must be under the control of communities, not companies; and that achieving social justice victories requires a secondary strategy for media policy change.\n\nMedia reform movement coincides with media democracy as a concept and is interlinked with the agenda setting theory. In 1922, in his book, \"Public Opinion\", Walter Lippmann argued that the mass media are the principal connection between events in the world and the images in the minds of the public. He stated that the media has an ability to influence the thoughts and opinions of the members of public consuming the content. He did not use the term \"agenda setting\", but scholars have come to agree that was the core concept.\n\nUnder the media reform movement there is the traditional media reform movement which has its roots in the broadcasting and freedom of press movements and has been linked with the feminist movement as well as racial and gender justice. However, mainstream media reform groups have so far steered clear from acknowledging media reform’s roots in content work, including the legal victory by the United Church of Christ that forced changes in hiring and reporting practices in Mississippi television journalism. This is said to be done in order to maintain the support of conservative patrons and to downplay the importance of more controversial critical junctures that have shaped the way media reform movement is today.\n\nIt has also been affected by federal policy advocacy, whereby media outlets and governments alter their broadcasting practices to attract powerful allies and making their agenda the national public agenda. Funders provide financial support that support the media outlets and drives business.\n\nThe traditional media reform movement has however undergone some significant changes with the rise of citizen journalism, whereby citizens play an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information. The modern media reform movement relies heavily on the Internet and the numerous social networking tools it offers and the Internet coupled with citizen curated content has led to a decrease in the popularity of traditional media networks.\n\nThe Canadian media reform movement has its roots in the 1930s, Canadian Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom. Highlighting the threats of cultural Americanisation and excessive commercialism, and calling for universal radio service that would not be viable through market forces alone, the Canadian Radio League assembled a blue-ribbon coalition to persuade a Conservative government to create the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nSome of the notable sites and advocates of the movement in Canada include thetyee.ca, the Media Co-op, Media Democracy Days, OpenMedia.ca, the Aboriginal Peoples Television and print outlets such as Canadian Dimension.\n\nLaunched in 2001 and originating in Vancouver, British Columbia, Media Democracy Days are organized around the country with the aim of knowing, being and changing the media. They encourage citizen journalism and expect netizens to take responsibility for bringing the change they wish to see in media. It is part of the Media Democracy Project that aims to create a significant presence for noncommercial media in Canada.\n\nOpenMedia.ca was created in 2007 to celebrate two of the world’s foremost critics of media propaganda, Ed Herman and Noam Chomsky, and since then it has managed to earn national resonance and policy impact. It is by far the leader in the Media Reform movement in Canada.\n\nThe movement's focus in Canada has been predominantly on the not for profit sector. There is overwhelming recognition of the importance of the Internet in NGO work, and unanimous endorsement of the principle of net neutrality as a regulatory underpinning for equitable and affordable access to the Internet. Trade unions and independent media, arts and culture groups, particularly those representing media and cultural workers, are core advocates for democratic communications. Other groups, especially those concerned with human rights, are also supportive.\n\nIn a 2010 survey by Open Media, Canadian mainstream media’s democratic performance has been rated as poor or very poor by Canadians. Although many NGOs report positive relationships with particular media, NGOs appear to have a more favorable view of CBC and of independent media, which relies heavily on citizen journalism and has led to the rise of blogger culture. An overwhelming majority of NGOs agree that the quality and diversity of Canadian journalism affects their organization’s work. There is an encouraging culture of collaboration amongst NGOs in the sectors surveyed. Values such as openness, accessibility, participation, choice, diversity and innovation may resonate well with NGOs in Canada. Media reform organizations should consider some kind of expansive institutional structure, such as an association or network that can facilitate communication and engagement with a broad and diverse array of organizations.\n\nMedia reform movement is a positive step towards a netizen curated web and has given rise to citizen journalism.\n\nCommunications guru Frank Luntz has claimed that \"A compelling story, even if factually inaccurate, can be more emotionally compelling than a dry recitation of the truth. I have seen how effective language attached to policies that are mainstream and delivered by people who are passionate and effective can change the course of history.\" Statements such as the ones by Mr. Luntz, encourage people and provide hope that we can be part of a fair and democratic media system. One that not only reports what the public wants but also tells the truth and does not use agenda setting theory for mere popularity.\n\n"}
{"id": "13766578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13766578", "title": "Metaphoric criticism", "text": "Metaphoric criticism\n\nMetaphoric criticism is one school of rhetorical analysis used in English and speech communication studies. Scholars employing metaphoric criticism analyze texts by locating metaphors within texts and evaluating those metaphors in an effort to better understand ways in which authors appeal to their audiences.\n\nThe term \"metaphor\" can be traced to the trope described by Aristotle in both his \"Rhetoric\" and \"Poetics\" as a comparison of two dissimilar objects or concepts in an effort to relate one to the other. James DeMille, in \"The Elements of Rhetoric\", defines metaphor as \"an implied comparison between two things of unlike nature, for example, 'The colorful display was a magnet for anybody in the room.'\" Using DeMille’s example, a critic studying metaphor would explore how normally \"display\" and \"magnet\" are not considered synonyms. However, in using \"magnet\" as a metaphor, the above sentence implies that the \"display\" possess properties of a magnet and draws objects—or, in this case, people—in the room toward it.\n\nIn a broader sense, metaphoric criticism can illuminate the world in which we live by analyzing the language—and, in particular, the metaphors—that surround us. The notion that metaphors demonstrate worldviews originates in the work of Kenneth Burke and has been taken up further in the cognitive sciences, particularly by George Lakoff.\n\nMetaphoric criticism focuses on analysis of texts that use metaphors effectively or ineffectively as part of their argument structure. For example, in an article entitled \"Five Years After 9/11: Drop the War Metaphor,\" George Lakoff and Evan Frisch analyze how President Bush’s adoption of a \"war\" metaphor in order to discuss his approach to dealing with terrorism as opposed to a \"crime\" metaphor provides a barrier from critics for him to move forward with the War in Iraq. Lakoff illustrates the power of the \"war\" metaphor: \"The war metaphor defined war as the only way to defend the nation. From within the war metaphor, being against war as a response was to be unpatriotic, to be against defending the nation. The war metaphor put progressives on the defensive.\"\" Rhetorical critics would not only make these observations in their own criticism, but would also relate to the effect on the audience, and how the metaphor either enhances or challenges the audience’s worldview.\n\nCritics examining metaphor have in recent years also started to examine metaphor in visual and electronic media. For example, metaphors can be found in rhetorical presidential television ads. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan’s campaign sponsored a commercial showing a grizzly bear as posing a potentially large threat to the United States. The USSR is never named in that ad, however the assumption of the campaign was that Americans would clearly recognize the \"enemy\" that the bear represents.\n\nIn \"Rhetorical Criticism\", Sonja K. Foss outlines a four-step procedure for applying metaphoric criticism to texts:\n\n\n"}

In those years the cinemas were often mobile. Their operators used to travel in the whole region with a selection of movie cassettes, a TV set, a VCR and a generator, going from one village to the next to show their films. To draw attention to their performances, they announced them with colourful hand painted movie posters. These were provided by the local film distributors who collaborated with artists and sign painters like Daniel Anum Jasper, Heavy Jeaurs, Leonardo, Kwesi Blue, Salvation or Dallas who created for each movie a matching billboard.\n\nThe artists and sign writers looked first at the films that were mostly made in Ghana or Nigeria, and then developed their film poster. For the mobile cinemas, these works had to be sturdy, cheap to produce, and light in weight because the cinema operators had to move around with the material. Therefore, the artists used a cheap, but very durable and light linen underlay which they gained from Ghanaian flour sacks. This material adhered very well with their oil and acrylic paints and the posters could even be hung outdoors when it rained. With their bright colors and an iconography adapted to the Ghanaian audiences, these paintings immediately caught the attention of the people and made them much more likely to go to the cinema than the normal posters that were printed in Nigeria.\n\nSince Ghanaians now buy or rent their films on DVD and prefer to watch them at home, they no more go to the small cinemas. Most of the movie houses had to close in the recent years, and the few that are left can barely afford hand-painted movie posters, they rather use printed ones. Therefore, in the Region of Greater Accra, there are hardly any cinemas left who still use hand painted movie posters. Many artists who used to work for the film distributors have turned to other tasks. They are painting street signs that are still very popular in Ghana, and in the Greater Accra Region some are also assisting other artists like Paa Joe or Kudjoe Affutu in painting their figurative coffins, palanquins and small sculptures. Some sign painters, such as Heavy J., Moses, Jasper, Farkira or Leonardo, also work for the international art market, where Ghanaian movie posters as well as the figurative coffins are shown in exhibitions of contemporary African art where they are getting more and more attention.\n\n\n\n"}

The term PMC is often used to name, derogatively, the collusion between governments or individual politicians and the media industry in an attempt to manipulate rather than inform the people.\n\nThere is recent evidence to suggest that newer media portals (as opposed to those outlets of \"traditional\" mainstream media [MSM]) are turning, more readily, to using the PMC framework in critical analysis and interpretation of media behavior. One notable example of this is with regards to the Leveson Inquiry.\n\nBefore Johannes Gutenberg invented movable type in 1450, most information was delivered by town criers, ministers from the pulpit, or bartenders. Town criers spread information and news including royal edicts, police regulations, important community events and war news. These early methods of communication were often delivered by messengers on foot, and could be easily controlled by the ruling class. With the invention of the printing press news began to be spread in writing. Corantos, which were semi-regular pamphlets that reported news, are an example of the early politico-media complex. Popular in England, corantos reported mostly foreign news, as the royal government attempted to control what domestic news reached the masses. Corantos eventually would become regular periodicals that were subject to less political control, and mark one of the earlier forms of industrialized media.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference, and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers\". Most of the international papers present in the world today are national papers re-edited for a wider audience. Because of this, there can be biases based on nationality. In any publication there is some sort of bias just from what news is covered and what stories are shown at the forefront of the publication.\n\nAlthough print media in the West has suffered from declining advertising trends, many newspapers and magazines in the Middle East continue to do well. For countries in which the majority of the population does not have ready access to the Internet or television, newspapers and magazines are one of the few ways to get the news. However, the independence from political influence, and dependability of newsprint is questionable in many countries. The Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index suggests that even in many first world countries the rights of the press are not fully respected, and that the press is not completely free to investigate or criticize the government, though the situation is far worse in third world or politically unstable nations.\n\nNewspapers and magazines do have a back and forth between readers and journalists. Some studies have shown that the print media are more likely to reinforce existing political attitudes of the masses than change them.\n\nReporters Without Borders, an international non-governmental organization that promotes freedom of the press, produces an annual Press Freedom Index assessing countries' press freedom. Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Jean-François Julliard said at the release of the 2009 Press Freedom Index, \"It is disturbing to see European democracies such as France, Italy and Slovakia fall steadily in the rankings year after year [...] Europe should be setting an example as regards civil liberties. How can you condemn human rights violations abroad if you do not behave irreproachably at home? The Obama effect, which has enabled the United States to recover 16 places in the index, is not enough to reassure us.\"\n\nThe press is censored in the People's Republic of China by the Golden Shield Project, known colloquially as the Great Firewall of China. \"Reporters Without Borders\" ranks China's press situation as \"very serious,\" the worst possible ranking on their five-point scale. China's press was ranked 173rd out of 179 countries in the 2013 World Press Freedom Index. The Chinese government maintains the legal authority to censor the press, and in defense of censorship claims that the Communist party in China has the most freedom of press, since there is no wealthy minority controlling it.\n\nMiddle Eastern print media is mainly paid for by private funders, either a specific family or specific government party. Some Middle Eastern newspapers and magazines have been accused of having obvious political ties. Many countries in the Middle East and Africa have harsh government restrictions as to what can be published when, for various reasons depending on political and economic circumstances. Iran, ranked 174 out of 179 in 2013, is described as highly censored, as the Iranian government maintains strict control over much of the print and broadcast media and news websites. Reporters Without Borders has said that journalists in Israel \"enjoy real freedom of expression despite the existence of military censorship.\" However, Professor Yoram Peri of the University of Maryland has said that Israel experienced a media control crackdown as the government censors coverage of military action coverage, displaying how governments often limit press freedom during times of war. According to Reporters Without Borders in 2009, Eritrea in Northern Africa is the worst ranked country for journalistic freedom. Eritrea is currently a one-party \"transitional government\" which has yet to enact its ratified constitution. Other African countries at the bottom of the 2009 Press Freedom Index include Syria (165) and Somalia (164). Both countries exhibit little journalistic freedom, and are both known for their unstable transitional governments and near constant warfare.\n\nWhere newspapers used to represent an exclusive connection between readers and advertisers, print media must now compete with the power of the entire Internet. Because of declining advertising revenue and shrinking audiences, print press has been described as declining. Today a little more than half of Americans read a newspaper every day. However, a 2004 report notes that 55 million newspapers are still sold daily in the United States, and newsprint still plays a significant role in the politico-media complex.\n\nIn addition to economic struggles and readership decline, newsprint has also struggled with losing readers' trust. Surveys have found that people tend to trust newspapers less than other news media, in part because they believe that newspaper journalists are \"isolated and out of touch\" and motivated by commercial interests. Most people believe their local and national news television stations more than their local and national newspapers. The only news medium that people trust less than newspapers is print magazines.\n\nSome have speculated that the youth today are more visually inclined, and are therefore less likely to be influenced by written political news or propaganda. One Pew Center study found that 28% of this generation read the paper on a given day, and average only 10 minutes of reading time. Harvard Professor Thomas Patterson has said: \"What's happened over time is that we have become more of a viewing nation than a reading nation, and the internet is a little of both. My sense is that, like it or not, the future of news is going to be in the electronic media, but we don't really know what that form is going to look like.\"\n\nThe early American radio industry was composed of commercial shipping companies that used radio for navigation, and amateur radio enthusiasts, who built radios at home. This mixture of military, industry and community went unregulated until the Radio Act of 1912, which required all ships to use radio communication and keep a constant radio watch, amateur users to be licensed, and began regulating the use of wavelengths for radio transmissions. This act represents one of the earliest interactions between the government and the radio media and also set a precedent for later radio legislation, including the Radio Act of 1927, which established the Federal Radio Commission and added further regulation to radio users, both commercial and amateur. Government regulation increased again with the American entrance into World War I, when President Woodrow Wilson ordered naval control of all radio stations, and ordered that amateurs cease all radio activity. Jonathan Reed Winkler, a noted WWI historian, said “It was only during World War I that the United States first came to comprehend how a strategic communications network-the collection of submarine telegraph cables, and long-distance radio stations used by a nation for diplomatic, commercial and military purposes- was vital to the global political and economic interests of a great power in the modern world.” After World War I radio was introduced to broader civilian audiences when Westinghouse released the Aeriola Jr. in 1919, and the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) released the Radiola in 1920. The Aeriola Jr. and Radiola helped established a new channel for the politico-media complex to enter into thousand of American homes. By 1919 the oldest licensed American radio station, KDKA, from Pittsburgh, PA began broadcasting regular music shows, and soon music, educational programming, sports coverage and eventually news coverage became popular. Coverage of politics quickly caught on across the countries, as stations began covering elections, and reporting news of government actions. The close politico-media complex between government and radio was finalized in 1924 when the Republican and Democratic National Conventions were covered, and candidates made eve of election speeches, the first instance of radio broadcasting that was meant to affect the American political process.\n\nThe numbers of radio users exploded, by 1935 about 2 in 3 American homes owned a radio. Politicians quickly learned to reach these huge audiences. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Fireside Chats are an example of the politico-media complex. In his series of informal broadcasts from 1933 to 1944, Roosevelt developed a comforting rapport with the American public. The Fireside Chats enabled the President to communicate directly to the public through one of the most popular media outlets of the time. Politicians would continue to use the radio in World War II, in which the radio was used primarily for news transmissions and the spread of propaganda. One example of radio propaganda came from Iva Toguri D'Aquino, Ruth Hayakawa, June Suyamawho, and Myrtle Lipton collectively known as Tokyo Rose. These women hosted anti-American programming intended to lower American soldiers' morale and illustrate the use of governments' use of the media to influence the public, or their enemies. However, many people, such as Iva Toguri D'Aquino and Allied prisoners of war, were forced against their will to participate in these programs and worked hard to help Allied forces.\nAfter WWII and throughout the Cold War era, Democratic nations used long-range radio waves to broadcast news into countries behind the Iron Curtain or otherwise information-compromised nations. The American international radio program, the Voice of America, founded during World War II, became a critical part of Cold War era \"public diplomacy,\" which aimed to spread democratic values, and popularize American policies abroad. In 1950, President Harry S. Truman described the Cold War conflict as a \"struggle, above all else, for the minds of men,\" which the American people would win by getting \"the real story across to people in other countries.\" in other words, embracing the politico-media complex and using it to influence foreign listeners. The Voice of America, operating under the authority of the United States Information Agency, supported programming in forty five languages, broadcasting over 400 hours of programming a week. Programming included unbiased news coverage, musical programs, and Special English broadcasts, which intended to help listeners master American English. The VOA was not alone in its international broadcasting efforts, the United States Central Intelligence Agency supported Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, both propagandist radio networks intended to incite dissent against Communism. Other nations also used international radio as propaganda, for example, Deutsche Welle, the German international radio program was a major broadcaster during the Cold War. By 1965 DW was airing 848 hours of programming to the Soviet Union and abroad and reached 5% of the USSR population weekly by 1980. Deutsche Welle's mission to “promote understanding of Germany as an independent nation with its roots in European culture and as a liberal, democratic, constitutional state based on the rule of law.” illustrates German use of the politico-media complex.\n\nThe Golden Age of Radio may have only lasted from 1935–1950, yet radio is still an active medium in the politico-media complex. Today there is extensive radio programming on politics. One notable example is the Rush Limbaugh Show, which broadcasts the political commentary of Rush Limbaugh, referred to by listeners as \"America's Truth Detector,\" the \"Doctor of Democracy,\" and the \"Most Dangerous Man in America.\" The Rush Limbaugh Show has hosted numerous politicians, illustrating that politicians still use the radio to affect public opinion and the political process. The Air America Media company, provides progressive political commentary and news coverage and has described itself as the \"most recognized progressive talk radio network, providing an independent and unfiltered voice to a grateful listening nation.\" Air America programs such as The Rachel Maddow Show, The Lionel Show, and Live in Washington with Jack Rice discuss recordings of politicians, host politicians as live guests, and act as a connection between the political classes and the media.\n\nOne of film's most powerful political and sociological forms is national cinema, for which there are entire books for individual countries and varying definitions. Through the national cinema, ideological groups within specific countries can construct and reinforce their collective identities through film, as well as the identities of foreigners.\n\nUlf Hedetoft has observed, \"In the real world of politics and influence, certain nationalisms, cultures, ideas and interpretations are more transnationally powerful, assertive and successful than others. Where the less influential ones are not necessarily less self-congratulatory, they are certainly more inward-looking and always carry the label of national specificity.\" He goes on, however, to say that these more transnationally powerful films actually become de-nationalized as a result of its \"national-cultural currency\" more widely and easily dispersed, mixing with other cultures, becoming either a \"positive admixture\" to other countries' cultures and identities or a \"model for emulation.\" He compares national cinema that undergoes such processes to English becoming a global lingua franca: the cultural sharing that results is hegemonic and the globalizing process is non-symmetrical.\n\nPropaganda is a way that politics can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin with the birth of propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality. Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other genre films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much more obscured.\n\nSuch British newsreels as \"The Battle of the Somme\" of World War I were propaganda because they only showed the war from their own perspective, though it can be argued as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for dramatic or epic effect). Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least some truth. According to Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the \"masters of montage\" who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.\nWhen sound became possible, documentaries have been said to become more politically powerful with the use of speakers' voices and music. In Nazi Germany, newsreels were just as important as feature films, while in Fascist Italy propaganda was mostly limited to documentaries. A comparison of the first three installments of the American series \"Why We Fight\" and the Nazi documentary \"Sieg im Westen\" (\"Victory in the West\") demonstrates how convincing even two opposing interpretations of the same events can be. The first covers years in a couple of hours but its density disguises any omission of truth while the latter manages to depict war with real images but without blood or death. The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.\n\nFalsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the \"reality\" it claims to represent. The House Committee on Un-American Activities, for example, did this with \"Operation Abolition\" in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success. Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture \"The Führer Gives the Jews a Town\" did.\n\nWorld War II propaganda persisted 30 years after Dachau and Auschwitz such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film \"The Night Porter\" (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo. What amazes Henry Giroux, as he explains in \"Breaking into the Movies,\" is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of Antonio Gramsci, Herbert Marcuse, and Paulo Freire, the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class hegemony, or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means. He argues, \"We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values.\"\n\nThough feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film. They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.\n\nDespite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular. Besides Frank Capra, no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world. While Capra sought to \"develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action\" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A. Hall describe, he ultimately failed.\n\nCapra's films are characterized by the same basic formula according to which the fundamental American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the corruption and cruelty of politics. Ronald Reagan later extensively quoted the speech made by Mr. Deeds in \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" (1936) in which he expresses his disgust with the complexities of politics and calls for individual goodness. In his next film \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", (1939) Capra reinforces the integrity and decency of the everyman who can transcend politics despite the power and crookedness of special interest groups. After the hero of \"John Doe\" realizes his need for others, he discovers and attempts to expose a fascist bidder for presidency planning to take advantage of his club support. He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.\n\nThe ending of \"John Doe\" was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after \"It's a Wonderful Life\". Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics. Lindholm and Hall observe that \"the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States\" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome. Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like \"Citizen Kane\" (1940) and \"Nixon\" (1995). Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in \"The Candidate\" (1972) and \"Primary Colors\" (1998). Other films, like \"A Face in a Crowd\" (1957) and \"All the King's Men\" (1949), follow the warning of \"John Doe\". \"JFK\" (1991) and \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.\n\nWhile films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to mass culture, has been criticized for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex. One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be \"Norma Rae\" (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.\n\nThe mass media have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television. As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.\n\nThis transformation first kicked off in the early 1960s, when newscast programs were increased to a thirty-minute programs, which allowed for greater news coverage and capacity. This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired political campaigns were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.\n\nRick Shenkman also analyzes the media’s impact on politics in his book, \"Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter\", and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that \"politicians have repeatedly misled voters\" by \"dumbing down of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation.\"\nThrough setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation’s political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it. For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story. When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.\n\nIn his book, \"Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,\" Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the Ram Janmabhumi movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in \"shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present\" in India.\n\nRajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of television in contemporary India. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic Ramayan. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god Ram and aired on Doordarshan, India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that \"television profoundly changes the context of politics\".\n\nThe epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling Congress government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the media effects framework attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own Hindu nationalist beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election. This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.\n\nCentral to the BJP’s success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present. This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.\n\nIn the “Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,” Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation’s television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation’s television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.\n\nThe main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.\n\nAnother group who studied the impact of television on politics included Holli Semetko and Patti Valenburg. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources. News frames are \"conceptual tools which media and individuals rely on to convey, interpret and evaluate information.\" They set the parameters \"in which citizens discuss public events.\" They are \"persistent selection, emphasis, and exclusion.\" Framing is selecting \"some aspects of a perceived reality\" to enhance their salience \"in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation.\" Frames are to help audiences \"locate, perceive, identify, and label\" the flow of information around themGoffman, 1974, p. 21 and to \"narrow the available political alternatives.\"\n\nNews frames have what is known as the framing effect. Framing effects are when relevant attributes of a message – such as its organization, content, or structure – make particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations. Framing has shown to have large effects on people's perceptions, and has also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions.\n\nLike agenda-setting research, framing analysis focuses on the relationship between public policy issues in the news and the public perceptions of these issues. However, framing analysis \"expands beyond agenda-setting research into what people talk or think about by examining how they think and talk about issues in the news.\" The results of Semetko and Valenburg's research indicate that the attribution of responsibility frame was most commonly employed by the news. This particular type of framing focuses on making viewers feel a sense of responsibility, in which they feel bound to perform whatever duties are attached to the given role, and feel a sense of moral accountability for not taking on the role. After understanding the attribution of responsibility frame, it is easy to see why it is such a powerful tool to news programs, as it evokes strong emotions within the viewer.\n\nThe Internet - particularly in the form of the World Wide Web (the Web) - has given the world a tool for education, communication, and negotiation in political information and political roles and its use by individuals and organizations has increased and continues to increase, greatly. This rapid increase can be compared to the boom of the television and its impact on politics as a form of media. The Internet also opens up a world of commentary and criticism which in turn allows for new and better ideas to circulate amongst many people. It gives multidirectional communication, which allows people to stay in connection with organizations or people associated with politics more easily. However, there are many controversies regarding the Internet with respect to the PMC as it (the Internet) can encourage and facilitate the practice of providing bits of information extracted from a far wider context or biased information, which leads to public cynicism toward the media.\n\nThe relative ease of entry into publishing through Internet/Web channels yields opportunities, for those so inclined, to become, in the extreme, one-person contributors/players, with a foot on both sides of the fence - politics \"and\" media - in the PMC (and sometimes information, placed into the public domain through such channels, about a political entity (politician, party etc.), being perhap less than flattering, may be 'adjusted' by one or more \"other\" entities (individuals, organizations etc.) with publishing identities that barely, if at all, conceal a relationship with the political entity in question).\nFor example, Wikipedia itself is a major global channel, currently being around the eighth most visited website, in 2009 found its objectivity being compromised at the highest levels with a 'conflict of interest' of a sitting member of the influential (ArbCom). It was shown that David Boothroyd - a serving Labour Party Councillor for Westminster City\n—had gained a seat on the Arbitration Committee under the pseudonym of the Wikipedia account 'Sam Blacketer' and also, under this name, had gone on to make controversial edits to the Wikipedia entry for the then Leader of the Opposition, later Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron. Boothroyd was also found to have operated earlier, before his appointment to the Arbitration Committee, but while an administrator, other contemporary accounts—a practice in Wikipedia known as '' - enabling the practitioner to give undue weight, through appearing as different identities, to a particular point of view as opposed to representing a neutral point of view (). Given Wikipedia's presence and influence in the world, the \"affair\" attracted mainstream media, and other new media attention nationally and internationally,\n\ncontributing damage to Wikipedia's standing along the way. Boothroyd was forced to step down from the Arbitration Committee, although he claimed he had already asserted his intention to resign.\n\nThe impact of the internet on politics has been notable, as this form of media has more current information than others since it is constantly being updated. Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past. Political Information available on the internet covers every major activity of American politics. Users, nonetheless, remain susceptible to bias, especially on websites that represent themselves as objective sources.\nE-mail has achieved a large scale of usage amongst numerous levels of government, political groups, and even media companies as a means of communicating with the public and thus plays a significant role in the political-media complex. The boom of e-mail hit the Internet and the public in the mid-1990s as a way to keep in touch with family and friends. Different governments got a hold of this technology, and in 1993 the United States Congress and the White House were using this as communication as a means of communicating with the general public. During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day. In order to deal with the influx of e-mail a more sophisticated system was put in. In a six-month period, at one point, there were half a million e-mails sent to the president and vice president.\n\nThe United States Presidential campaign in 1996 between sitting-President Bill Clinton and Bob Dole was one of the first campaigns to utilize the Internet on a national level in the US.\n\nWith so many campaigns using the Internet it raises a significant amount of money in a shorter period of time than with any other method. The web sites are set up like advertising sites – there are links to click on to watch ads, information and background on the candidate, photos from the campaign trail, schedules, donation links, etc. E-mail gives a great low-cost way of connecting with the campaign trail and voters.\n\nDuring the 2008 United States Presidential election between John McCain and Barack Obama, the Internet was extensively utilized by both candidates. Facebook, an Internet social network, was used heavily to give people the ability to support their views and share information with their friends. Both sent out messages daily to promote themselves and the issues at hand, for leverage against the other candidate.\n\nBlogs are a type of website, usually maintained by an individual with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other material such as graphics or video. Blogging started to become popular at the start of the millennium, and was used mostly by highly educated, highly paid, males. Around 2004 blogging became more mainstream and was typically used for political interaction. Many political campaigns use this as a stake in monitoring blogs and actively using them to spread information about their candidate.\n\nThe Internet creates a space in which people can voice their opinions and discuss political issues under the protection of anonymity. Some discussion forums are actually groups or organizations that set up discussion for a specific purpose about one issue or person in politics. Some problems with discussion forums include the lack of personal contact, which allows people not to take responsibility for posts, such as personal attacks on others. Bias is another issue of online discussion forums because many websites attract like-minded individuals, making it less likely for alternative perspectives to be introduced.\n\nAn e-Government is a government that is inter-networked through digital technology for mass media distribution and communication for voters, taxpayers, schools, hospitals, etc. It has been described as a new way to transform government programs by closing the gap between distance and time. This idea has been said to be a more cost effective and convenient way to form programs around the needs of citizens rather than civil servants.\n\nIn perhaps what is the beginning of the first major reappraisal of the relationship between a political elite/class and the media in a major modern Western PMC, with respect to the enervation of representative political and legal processes and the consequent erosion of and dangers to the public interest in a Western democracy, is captured in excerpts from three contributions to an emergency three-hour debate conducted by members of parliament (MPs) in the Parliament of the United Kingdom on the afternoon of the 6 July 2011.\n\n\n\nThese comments refer to the apparent effects of the relationships between the members of (the UK) parliament and those that form the UK Government, the Metropolitan police and News International (NI [UK subsidiary of News Corporation ]) and the influence, expressed as malign, of the latter organization on the former two institutions.\n\nThe debate was precipitated by the type of some of the information procurement methods found to have been used by a major British Sunday newspaper (the title is now shut down) – the \"News of the World\" (was owned by NI). Now known as the (News International) ‘phone hacking affair’, the consequences for the British PMC and NI (as part of the world’s second largest media empire after The Walt Disney Company) are likely to be unfolding for some considerable time as new sectors of vulnerable members of British society subjected to the particular malicious practice are brought to light.\n\nThe Parliamentary turmoil resulted in the UK government instituting a three-pronged public judicial examination into the relations and interactions between the media and the public, the media and the police and the media and the politicians. Known as the Leveson Inquiry, its findings were published November 29, 2012 based on a spread of around eight months (November 2011 to June 2012) of probing into the relationships. While the Leveson findings are obviously oriented toward the PMC of the UK, some commentators argue that its findings will have global implications through their relevance to similar existing networks in other countries.\n\nNaming (as a 'complex') points of intersection and apparent cooperative benefit, to some degree, of diverse, nominally independent, areas of public faced activity puts us in danger of missing a much more fundamental and general insight according to linguist and dissident Noam Chomsky. Such identifiable collaborations/collusions are almost to be expected and are a natural outcome to the working of the 'industrial system,' as it has evolved in the West, having the taxpayer-funded sector at its core (that is as opposed to the contemporary conventional wisdom, with a hard and fast distinction between the state and private sectors - the economist John Kenneth Galbraith has also argued that the \"two sectors\" represent an \"innocent fraud\") and has blamed its existence on the \"socialization of costs and the privatization of profits\".\n\nChomsky discusses the \"military-industrial complex\" (MIC) and argues that its embedded behavior is not just about the \"military\" but is about ensuring that the modern economy, of which that behavior (emptied of particularly military connotations) is at the heart, is nothing much to do with freedom (of choice) or democracy either.\n\nUsing the technology of computing as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time Dwight Eisenhower was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like Harvard University and his own, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce roomfuls of machinery into a package that could be sold as a mainframe (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like International Business Machines (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the National Security Agency (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit, to the very people who had already paid for them.\n\nObserving the prophets of the 'free market', such as Alan Greenspan, enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).\n\nChomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as biotechnology and neuroscience and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, telecommunications, lasers etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.\n\nChomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of fear and under pretence of external threat.\n\nEdward S. Herman and Chomsky, together, advanced a 'propaganda model' to accomplish this '', showing the ways in which power and money filter the news and enable governments and dominant private interests to integrate the behavior of the citizenry into the structures of the industrial system. Earlier, political writer George Orwell had noted, \"All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news.\" ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.\n\nHerman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable hypotheses such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.\n\nThus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the market system (often called the free market) – a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for capitalism according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of sovereign debt, requiring almost constant appeal to the 'banker of last resort' - the taxpayer. Under debt restructuring, 'good debt' is returned to private hands as soon as possible and the taxpayer is left saddled with the 'bad debt' which is probably unrecoverable.\n\nThe shadow that the corporations cast on the media through advertising (corroboration of Herman and Chomsky's propaganda model filters through advertising) was illustrated in the closure of News International's 168-year-old flagship Sunday title, the \"News of the World\", when major advertisers boycotted the paper as a consequence of the 'phone hacking scandal' – the corporations, understandably, not wishing to be seen associated with a paper whose production had been based on frequent engagement in serious criminal activity.\n\nFrom Chomsky's perspective, then, whatever set of interactions is being named by the term 'politico-media complex' (PMC) simply instantiates the propaganda model to manufacture consent in the service of the industrial system.\n\n\n\n"}

The concept was introduced by Mikhail Bakhtin, using a metaphor based on the musical term polyphony.\n\nBakhtin's primary example of polyphony was Fyodor Dostoevsky's prose. Bakhtin contended that Dostoevsky, unlike previous novelists, did not provide a 'single vision', or describe situations with a 'monological' authorial voice. Instead, he aimed for fully dramatic novels of ideas in which conflicting views and characters are left to develop unevenly. According to Bakhtin, the chief characteristic of Dostoevsky's novels is \"a plurality of independent and unmerged voices and consciousnesses, a genuine polyphony of fully valid voices\". His major characters are, \"by the very nature of his creative design, \"not only objects of authorial discourse but also subjects of their own directly signifying discourse.\"\" (italics in the original)\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48609379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48609379", "title": "Public rhetoric", "text": "Public rhetoric\n\nPublic rhetoric refers to discourse both within a group of people and between groups, often centering on the process by which individual or group discourse seeks membership in the larger public discourse. Public rhetoric can also involve rhetoric being used within the general populace to foster social change and encourage agency on behalf of the participants of public rhetoric. The collective discourse between rhetoricians and the general populace is one representation of public rhetoric. A new discussion within the field of public rhetoric is digital space because the growing digital realm complicates the idea of private and public, as well as previously concrete definitions of discourse. Furthermore, scholars of public rhetoric often employ the language of tourism to examine how identity is negotiated between individuals and groups and how this negotiation impacts individuals and groups on a variety of levels, ranging from the local to the global.\n\nA public, not to be confused with \"the\" public, is composed of members that address each other, are addressed as a group, and also subscribe to specific ideals. Michael Warner describes a public as “being self-organized, …a relationship among strangers …[where] merely paying attention can be enough to make [one] a member.” Robert Asen notes that identity formation of members of a public “entails mutual recognition among members of diverse cultures.\" To Warner, publics are a social space where information is exchanged and is required for the exchange of information.\n\nWithin the public sphere, dominant publics exist whose discourse can subordinate other publics or exclude them from a related discourse. Counterpublics are the result of discourse and/or people feeling marginalized, ignored, inadequately voiced, or silenced within the public sphere. “Counterpublic refers to those publics that form through mutual recognition of exclusions in wider publics, set themselves against exclusionary wider publics, and resolve to overcome these exclusions,” writes Asen\".\" Where dominant public groups typically manufacture heteronormative public spaces and discourse, counterpublics seek to insert or reinsert voices and perspectives of and from publics. Discourse then abnormalizes or even challenges dominant public rhetoric. Warner describes the facilities of counterpublic using the LGBTQ+ community:Within a gay or queer counterpublic, for example, no one is in the closet: the presumptive heterosexuality that constitutes the closet for individuals in ordinary speech is suspended. But this circulatory space, freed from heteronormative speech protocols, is itself marked by that very suspension: speech that addresses any participant as queer will circulate up to a point, at which it is certain to meet intense resistance. It might therefore circulate in special, protected venues, in limited publications. The individual struggle with stigma is transposed, as it were, to the conflict between modes of publicness. The expansive nature of public address will seek to keep moving that frontier for a queer public, to seek more and more places to circulate where people will recognize themselves in its address; but no one is likely to be unaware of the risk and conflict involved.As Asen furthers, “Individuals do not necessarily recognize exclusions and resolve to overcome them by virtue of their location in a social order.” Asen maintains that claiming a counterpublic of this form can diminish counterpublic forms to particular contributors who share specific interests with other members but might not consider each other as allies.\n\nAmid publics and counterpublics, prevailing ideology, discourse, and images can create a hierarchy of group members and the rhetoric thereof. The struggle for political and social power within the public sphere between publics gives rise to dominant and weaker internal publics within a public, namely subaltern and bourgeois publics, respectively. For example, in their article “Graffiti Hurts in the United States,” Terri Moreau and Derek H. Alderman describe an anti-graffiti task force, Graffiti Hurts, advocating for the eradication of urban graffiti in public spaces. This organization funded mural projects that would serve as a deterrent for would-be graffitists. While graffiti is often considered a lesser art form compared to the classical arts such as music, canvas painting, and sculpture, the mural projects “actually work to carry out a ‘normative’ prescription of landscape. The normalization has the ability to eradicate the potential for alternative constructions of public expression. As [Kurt] Iveson observes, ‘A legal mural might have some effect in making . . . people’s culture more visible in public space, but often this is on someone else’s’ terms.'” Keith Herring argues that the dominant images of a gay counterpublic produce “clones” representing “well-built,” effeminate, white males. While whiteness is idealized, racial minority imagery and representation was and remains marginalized.\n\nA bourgeois subgroup within a public is primarily composed of “private individuals…[that] do not ‘rule’... Instead, their ideas infiltrated the very principle on which the existing power is based.” The bourgeois within a public represent a prevailing definition of the relevant publics and thereby control a greater degree of shared space for the related discourse between the larger public membership.\n\nStrangers are those who are not aware of their membership within a particular public. They are capable of being members of a public; however, they can also hold no opinion or in other ways pay no attention to their potential membership to a public. Strangers are normally not those who ignore their membership (which implies one is aware of being a member of a public). To Warner, without the presence of strangers in a public sphere, public discourse cannot occur because it is a requirement for public discourse to address strangers and provide them the awareness to identify themselves as an addressed public.\n\nPublic rhetoric participants produce discourse relative to a larger conglomerate of people or publics. Within the public sphere, different publics engage their own or other publics in conversation creating discourse that affects their own and other groups through definition of public boundaries, redefining public structure, and dispersing related public ideology. For a person to produce public rhetoric, one would self-identify with a public. Media, culture, and geography are the more predominant orienting processes that channel people towards and away from specific publics. Through public rhetoric, publics can recruit strangers and embed or polarize members of the same or other publics. Political propaganda and product advertisement are two concrete examples of forces that orient strangers and publics through analog and digital media. When people engage in public discourse, “describ[ing] themselves and others, they do not engage in a value-neutral and transparent process. Rather, representational processes implicate participants in (often unacknowledged) choices regarding how people should be portrayed”. As one begins to form judgments regarding the image of a public, of a particular ideology, or of the protocols governing inclusion and exclusion in public discourse, that person then gains membership within a relevant public, thus becoming, in part, a representation of the whole image of said public.\n\nHow one is introduced to a public varies as existing knowledge and experience can augment how one perceives a public and public rhetoric. Tony Hiss points out how places can orient and disorient civilians. In his discussion, Hiss describes public parks as having the function of “changing the way we look at things, diffusing our attention and also relaxing its intensity…”. The geography of the park often contrasts the image of the city in which it exists. Effective entrance design for parks encourage visitors to enter, displacing prior experience in exchange for “park experience”, in a transition that navigates the visitors smoothly to and from the park experience. Similarly, when strangers are introduced to public discourse, orientation processes enable strangers to adopt and displace specific images of a public and evoke their membership to the new public.\n\nAccording to David J. Coogan and John M. Ackerman, “rhetoric is in the midst of discovering anew its usefulness.” As service learning and civic engagement increase at colleges and universities, rhetoric begins the process of regrouping and becoming relevant in the community outside of the academy. In both the field of English and of communication, rhetoric’s reputation needs to be repaired and adapted to meet the needs of the general populace. In general, the public view of rhetoric is a negative one. It is the talk of politicians—filled with lies and manipulation. Instead, the public work of rhetoric should try to lead to social change. Scholars such as Ellen Cushman and Cynthia Sheard demonstrate this belief in their work; these and other scholars believe that rhetoricians should use their tools for the good of the public. In order to make this shift in rhetoric’s reputation, rhetoric needs a new set of guidelines by which to prepare rhetoricians to participate in social action.\n\nBecause rhetoric and composition are so closely related, the composition classroom becomes an open space for fostering social activism through service learning and allowing students to develop a sense of agency for both their scholarship and their interactions with the public. Ellen Cushman tells readers in her article “The Rhetorician as an Agent of Social Change” that “one way to increase our participation in public discourse is to bridge the university and community through activism. Given the role rhetoricians have historically played in the politics of their communities, [Cushman believes] modern rhetoric and composition scholars can be agents of social change outside the university.” Through their respective institutions, Cushman argues that both young and old scholars of rhetoric and composition can use their educational expertise to connect with the public outside of the university that, as scholars, they are typically estranged from. Because universities are often situated as counterpublics within the overall public of the geographic area in which they are located, it appears that scholars often feel prohibited from approaching and participating in the outside community. In order to negate this feeling of being restricted from community engagement, Cushman urges members of the rhetoric and composition community at universities to participate in service learning.\n\nIn an attempt to bridge the gap between the university and the community, Cushman suggests ways to “empower people in our communities, establish networks of reciprocity with them, and create solidarity with them.” In order to invent this network of reciprocity, Cushman urges rhetoricians and students within the university to venture outside of the boundaries of the institution, foster relationships with members of the community, and to perform work that benefits the community. Hopefully the scholar perceives a kairotic moment in which they come to an understanding of the relationship between the community and public rhetoric and are then, in turn, able to write and publish on their work. In essence, “[Cushman is] asking for a deeper consideration of the civic purpose of our positions in the academy, of what we do with our knowledge, for whom, and by what means.” Aside from the reciprocity that inherently comes from performing social activism within the general community, engaging with those outside of academe allows scholars to improve the public’s general conception of rhetoric, thereby increasing the field's ethos in the eyes of the general public.\n\nWhile the general populace currently views “doing rhetoric” as “menacing our fellow citizens with lies and misdirection,” these devices have the ability to allow rhetoricians and social activists alike to bring about social change and repair rhetoric’s reputation in the eyes of the general populace. For example, in Cynthia Sheard’s article, “The Public Value of Epideictic Rhetoric,” she discusses how epideictic rhetoric, which has traditionally elicited a negative public opinion, can be used to foster social change. Sheard calls rhetoricians to embrace a process of “[r]econceptualizing epideictic in order to emphasize . . . [i]ts close connection to the public sphere and its visionary quality . . . ” Sheard continues to explain that “epideictic discourse alters the reality in which it participates by making its vision a reality for its audience and instilling a belief that the power for realizing the vision lies with them.” According to Sheard, this ability to alter the audience’s perception of reality, an ability that epideictic rhetoric was once criticized for, is exactly what gives this device the power to involve the general populace in social activism and persuade them to view rhetoric in a positive light instead of describing it as a manipulative device.\n\nSpaces are the sites in which public rhetoric happens. These sites are not necessarily physical, geographically bound places, but metaphysical spaces in which discourse is shared and mediated by the members of specific publics.\n\nTo understand the spaces in which public rhetoric is enacted, it is important to understand the differences between “space” and “place.” In his book The Practice of Everyday Life, Michel de Certeau, defines places as an “instantaneous configuration of positions.” To Certeau, places are geographically bound, locatable sites. These sites are defined by location and spatial relations to other places.\n\nCerteau claims that places are different from spaces because places are “ultimately reducible to being there” while spaces are specified “by the actions of historical subjects.” While places could be pointed to on a map and are defined by what is physically inside of them, spaces are sites where things have happened. A space is defined by the interactions that individual agents have with it, not by its physical features. Certeau gives the examples that the place of a street becomes a space only when people walk on it and the places of texts only become spaces when people read them. When people engage in a discourse with a place, when they participate in public rhetoric there, it becomes a space.\n\nMichel Foucault built on Certeau’s definition of space in his essay, “Of Other Spaces: Utopias and Heterotopias,” pointing out that spaces were defined by “a set of relations that delineates sites which are irreducible to one another and absolutely not superimposable on one another.” He argued that these individual, specific spaces could be placed in two main types: utopias and heterotopias.\n\nAccording to Foucault, utopias are spaces with no real place which present society in its perfected form. Since these spaces are not places that exist in reality, but rather as a result of the rhetoric that surrounds them, they are described as fundamentally unreal places.\n\nHeterotopias are real spaces that exist in every culture. Unlike Utopias, they are places that exist in physical space and can be indicated by their location. Foucault describes these heterotopias as “effectively enacted utopias in which the real sites, all the other real sites that can be found within the culture, are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted.” These heterotopic spaces transcend a single place as their value comes from the interactions that take place inside of them, but the fact that they are universally constructed and recognized allows for them to be pointed to geographically.\n\nMiddle-spaces, according to David Coogan, are spaces in which rhetors from different publics can come and have an engaging discourse. As Coogan discusses, these are both physical and ideological places in which agents from two given publics c[an] come together to engage in discourse about “the ‘codes’ to evaluate conduct, entertain political possibilities, and in other ways arrange their affairs.” These spaces are especially conducive as places for counterpublics and publics to meet to question the commonplaces or ideological statements. In enacting discourse in middle spaces, counterpublic discourse can be heard and have influence on public discourse.\n\nIn discussions of public rhetoric, tourism refers both to the act of traveling to a physical location in search of a transformative experience and to the metaphorical action of traveling into the experiential world of another. Public rhetoric scholars use the language of tourism to examine individuals and communities’ relationships to each other.\n\nScholars of public rhetoric frequently invoke the language of tourism to discuss individual and group identity. This is often done to disrupt notions of individuality. Jürgen Habermas, for instance, chronicles the emergence of the concept of the individual in Western society, only to demonstrate the individual’s sublimation before the regulating function of the public sphere: “With the interweaving of the public and private realm, not only do the political authorities assume certain functions in the sphere of commodity exchange and social labor, but conversely social powers now assume political functions. This leads to a kind of ‘refeudalization’ of the public sphere.” Habermas’ concern for the political and social ramifications of individual versus public identity is one shared by other public rhetoric scholars.\n\nWhereas the Western conception of the Subject tends to emphasize individual autonomy, scholars of public rhetoric challenge the notion that individual identity exists separately from the surrounding world. This challenge to Enlightenment notions of identity is exemplified by the work of Phaedra Pezzullo. In \"Toxic Tourism\", Pezzullo argues that tourism as practice has the potential to help bridge the divide between Subject and Object by facilitating interaction on a multi-sensory level. Pezzullo suggests that embracing tourism’s ability to engage all of the body’s senses “may help those of us who study tourism to become more reflexive about our own culpability in privileging and, thus, perpetuating oppressive and colonial sensibilities.” The language of interconnection and responsibility pervades public rhetoric’s concern with tourism as a process that mediates relationships between human beings.\n\nResearchers such as Pezzullo have discussed the large extent that notions of toxicity are reflected in the ways that certain groups are marginalized. For instance, Pezzullo writes “that the ‘toxic baggage’ the nation carries exceeds the material impact of toxins and public discourses about them. It includes our cultural perceptions of our bodies and the bodies of ‘polluted’ and ‘polluting’ Others.” Thus, the language of toxicity is not limited to describing polluted areas or even victims of pollution. Toxicity is used to identify and rhetorically isolate segments of the population that do not conform to the Public’s normative expectations. Yet, as Pezzullo also suggests, the practice of tourism allows for travel between the Public and those citizens and groups who stand outside it. Pezzullo suggests that toxic tours, for instance, stand to allow the marginalized and often ignored Other to “look back” at the tourist who is experiencing the toxic area. The experience of becoming the Object of the Other’s gaze raises the possibility that the tourist’s perspective on the Other may be altered in the exchange, thus raising the possibility that the practice of tourism can induce transformation in the tourist.\n\nTaken in a broad sense, the practice of tourism enables interactions that allow for the formation and maintenance of publics. Tourism as a concept does not merely connote the movement of bodies from one physical place to another; it also refers to the internalization and externalization of ideas. As Michael Warner indicates, the ability to exchange ideas is what enables the participatory creation of the public sphere and is, therefore, a source of great power: “Speaking, writing, and thinking involve us-actively and immediately-in a public, and thus in the being of the sovereign. Imagine how powerless people would feel if their commonality and participation were simply defined by pre-given frameworks, by institutions and law, as in other social contexts it is defined through kinship. . . . Such is the image of totalitarianism.” Examined as an exchange of ideas, the practice of tourism allows individuals to engage in discourse with other individuals, thereby creating publics.\n\nKey to Warner and other scholars’ understanding of publics is the notion of voluntary participation. The citizen-tourist must willingly encounter the perspectives of other citizens. In this sense, public-creating tourist practices are not limited to “the pundits and wonks and reaction-shot secondary celebrities who try to perform our publicness for us . . . [, but include] people whose place in public media is one of consuming, witnessing, griping, or gossiping rather than one of full participation, or fame.” Warner goes on to state that, “a public can only produce a sense of belonging and activity if it is self-organized through discourse rather than through an external framework.” Just as the tourist who travels to a different geographic area chooses to do so, a choice that invites the possibility of being transformed by the experience, the citizen-tourist must choose to engage in discourse with other citizens in order for that exchange to create and maintain a public.\n\nIn its most organic form, the discourse of the public sphere arises spontaneously. In his seminal work “The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article” Habermas discusses the bourgeois public as an instrumental development in the history of publics but recognizes the limitations of the bourgeois public for modernity: “Although the liberal model of the public sphere is still instructive today with respect to the normative claim that information be accessible to the public, it cannot be applied to the actual conditions of an industrially advanced mass democracy…”. The size of the modern state limits the ability of the democratic populace to truly engage in a conversation of public rhetoric. Thus, instead of self-regulating, many of the public’s demands need to be met by the state, which could not please everyone on such a large scale. When these needs are not met, the scale of the democracy requires a dramatic catalyst to bridge the distance between the citizens and bring to light the need for change.\n\nThe most basic (albeit violent) form of public would be that of the riot, which is engendered by “competitions of interest, competitions which assume the form of violent conflicts.” Although this public is less civilized and perfect than is desirable, the spontaneity and power of riots and civil unrest—which Habermas refers to as “the street”—often affect change, as has been demonstrated throughout modern history time and time again. Without any sort of organized formation, the riot embodies the public sphere; the citizenry reacts to an issue with an outburst of the same opinion (one they may not realize they shared) and has thus created a publicly driven rhetorical discourse surrounding the issue.\n\nThe riot is organic; often considered barbaric or savage because of the raw emotions involved. Cynthia Sheard claims that it is a result of “the ways in which words fail us… all-too-common images of violence must make us wonder, indeed, whether words can make any difference in our lives.” Although the riot may have devastating consequences, it is purposeful in its ability to create recognition of a problem across a nation, bridging the gaps of class and distance the issue may otherwise find insurmountable. For example, the Black Lives Matter movement is now global due to the riots following the kairotic police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO. Many of those who have never before been affected by police violence towards black males have now seen the movement “in their own backyards,” and protests have arisen across the country, while both the mainstream and social media coverage of Ferguson has enabled this issue to be prescient in the minds of many far-removed citizens.\n\nA digital public can be considered as a few different entities. According to Patricia G. Lange, a digital space is a social network, or a group of people related to each other in some way. Digital social networks in which knowledge is communicated and shared have been labeled “epistemopolis.” An epistemopolis facilitates the growth of communities in a specific space around a specific topic. These digital social spaces are complicated by the possibility of anyone in the world being related to anyone else in the world in any given way at any given time; measurements or regulations or requirements for defining a specific digital space would need to be applied on an individual basis. While this isn’t necessarily up for debate in fields that study digital realms, it does present challenges for public rhetoric because it provides a more complex, tangled conception of a public.\n\nA digital space can take any of a variety of forms: chat rooms, social media networks, blogs, private journals, news sites, question and answer forums, professional marketing pages, online shopping sites, etc. Additionally, digital space allows for cultural interaction in a way that is not possible in analog device spaces. It is important to note that the internet is a social construction, designed for social interaction among various contexts (including economic, discursive, etc.). To this end, digital spaces can be manipulated, adapted, or even created for different, specific functions. Consider Wikipedia: “the free encyclopedia anyone can edit.” This site encourages individuals to share more information, making verified knowledge public and collaborative. Another example is Douglas Eyman's text Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice. Eyman wrote a print and a digital version of this text and includes a statement encouraging readers to take, revise, reuse, and circulate his original text, which is why he made the book available for free online.\n\nThe digital sphere presents a new set of challenges for public rhetoric. With issues of authorship, autonomy, and anonymity, the field crosses back and forth constantly between private and public. Individuals can create a digital persona, an avatar, while keeping their actual identity a secret. It is relatively easy to steal content and present it as your own (leading to copyright and plagiarism issues). To a certain extent, “technology has fused with human consciousness itself,” resulting in a collective, shared, public memory. Many people may oppose or feel threatened by advancements in technology, especially the internet. Some question personal and financial safety, a fear that may be heard as part of the argument opposing use of digital spaces. Opportunities for extended communication, in a plethora of different ways, litter the argument for development of digital spaces and tools. For example, digital social activism (also referred to as internet activism or cyberactivism) is a growing movement that uses digital spaces to spread awareness and encourage action regarding various topics. Analog spaces tend to allow for a smaller audience than digital spaces, and therefore (typically) results in less action.\n\nDigital rhetoric is important to consider when thinking about digital publics. Individuals create online identities, influencing how a digital audience can be addressed. This in turn influences how the author uses the rhetorical canons in their composition.\n\nPhotographic images can function in public rhetoric as icons of U.S. public culture. According to Robert Hariman and John Louis Lucaites in \"No Caption Needed: Iconic Photographs, Public Culture, and Liberal Democracy\", iconic images “work in several registers of ritual and response.” Public interpretations and influences of iconic photographic images manifest themselves as visual representations, or delivery of rhetoric. How these images function in public depends on the features of the specific image, the motivation for the image, and the responses from the public sphere.\n\nWhile multiple interpretations of photographic images as icons are discussed in conversations of public rhetoric, establishing what makes an icon an icon is important in order to identify and further analyze icons’ functions. Hariman and Lucaites describe the seven characteristics of an icon as follows:\n\nIf a photographic image holds one or more of the above-mentioned characteristics, it is considered an icon and fulfills several important functions in public rhetoric.\n\nAs a version of public rhetoric, iconic images serve to compose meaning and persuade a public audience to respond in some way. According to Hariman and Lucaites, “each image presents a pattern of motivation that can make some responses more likely than others.” An iconic image semiotically promotes an interpretation by its audience that is by no means incumbent on the specific image, but likely will create a realm of similar meanings more frequently than others. Five vectors of influence are identified for iconic photographs: “reproducing ideology, communicating social knowledge, shaping collective memory, modeling citizenship, and providing figural resources for communicative action.”\n\nIconic images have the capability of representing ideology, which Hariman and Lucaites define as “a set of beliefs that presents a social order as if it were a natural order, that presents asymmetrical relationships as if they were mutually beneficial, and that makes authority appear self-evident.” A photograph has the power to create such public meaning that can manipulate order, relationships, and authority as part of reproducing ideology.\n\nBecause icons are distinctively public visual images, they “recast social knowledge with regard to the distinctive concerns and roles of public life.” By tapping into the knowledge of the public to which they are being presented, icons effectively persuade members of a society and their social interactions, as any successful rhetoric does. Photographs can communicate social knowledge because they are accepted as representations of social performance.\n\nPhotographic icons can negotiate collective memory as part of the social knowledge it communicates. An icon can shape public understanding of specific events and contexts at the kairotic time of their occurrence and thereafter. Thus, society as a whole acts as the audience of the rhetorical message sent about the time the photograph was taken. Hariman and Lucaites contend, “the more collective memory is constructed through the visual media, the more likely it is that the iconic photos will be used to mark, frame, and otherwise set the tone for later generations’ understanding of public life” in the specific time period.\n\nMembers of the public interpreting iconic images can themselves be shaped by the messages sent by the icons, as can their rhizomatic relationships with each other. When viewing icons that portray U.S. citizens, the audience sees themselves in those citizens and emulates their portrayal of society. Iconic images essentially “display the public to themselves.”\n\nSince society can be considered “abstract” in terms of relationships between citizens, photographs serve to communicate such ambiguous citizenship and supply models for how to be a “good citizen.” Hariman and Lucaites explain that “an iconic photograph can continue to shape public understanding and action long after the event has passed or the crisis has been resolved pragmatically.” The collective memory formed by iconic photographs inspire action to perform as a moral citizen and motivate public response.\n\n"}
{"id": "3786139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3786139", "title": "Pyrotechnician", "text": "Pyrotechnician\n\nA pyrotechnician is a person who is responsible for the safe storage, handling, and functioning of pyrotechnics and pyrotechnic devices. Although the term is generally used in reference to individuals who operate pyrotechnics in the entertainment industry, it can include all individuals who regularly handle explosives. However, individuals who handle more powerful materials for commercial, demolition, or military applications are generally referred to as explosive technicians.\n\nIt is becoming more common in different countries and regions for individuals involved with the storage, handling and operation of pyrotechnics to have some form of license or certification. The specific requirements for certification, along with any restrictions or prohibitions, however, can vary wildly from one jurisdiction to the next. Most jurisdictions do require some type of minimum professional fireworks training before being allowed to apply for certification.\n\nIn Australia, individuals using, handling or storing pyrotechnics must receive government certification. All individuals must meet certain minimum requirements, including being at least 18 years of age and having received approved training, including working under the direct supervision of a licensed pyrotechnician, before being issued a license. All pyrotechnicians are required to maintain a log of their experience and to submit this log annually during the license renewal process.\n\nThere is a push to form a recreational pyrotechnic association, ARPA (Australian Recreational Pyrotechnic Association) that would benefit those who do not wish to shoot professional displays or acquire a professional license and would rather discharge smaller consumer fireworks that do not pose a higher risk as the professional devices. The association still has guidelines and requirements that form part of a safety strategy, but less training and expenses would be the benefit of the association as individuals do not need the training that the professional devices require.\n\nIn Canada, individuals using, handling or storing pyrotechnics must receive government certification, administered by the Explosives Regulatory Division of Natural Resources Canada. All individuals must meet certain minimum requirements, including being at least 18 years of age and having received government training, before being issued a license. All pyrotechnicians, of any classification or certification, are required to maintain a log of their experience. \n\nCertification for the use of proximate (indoor) pyrotechnics in Canada is separate from certification for display fireworks, and different government training and certification must be obtained.\n\nThe available licenses for the use of proximate pyrotechnics are sub-divided into one of 6 categories.\n\nThe Pyrotechnician classification is the primary classification in Canada. Individuals may use a restricted list of pyrotechnics individually, but may fabricate, handle, and set up a broader list of pyrotechnics typically prohibited to the pyrotechnician under the direct supervision of a higher-licensed individual. After two years of verifiable experience with a sufficient assortment of pyrotechnics, pyrotechnicians may apply for advancement to Senior Pyrotechnician certification. Certification is valid for five years.\n\nThe Senior Pyrotechnician classification is the intermediate classification in Canada. Individuals can supervise other pyrotechnicians and use any pyrotechnic device or product approved for use in Canada, and may also fabricate, handle, and set up a special-purpose or custom-fabricated pyrotechnics typically prohibited while under the direct supervision of a Special Effects Technician. After two years of verifiable experience with a sufficient assortment of pyrotechnics, pyrotechnicians may apply for advancement to Special Effects Technician certification. Certification is valid for five years.\n\nThe Special Effects Technician classification is the most advanced classification in Canada. Individuals may use any pyrotechnic device or product approved for use in Canada, and may also fabricate, handle, and set up a special-purpose or custom-fabricated pyrotechnics device typically prohibited. A Special Effects Technician may also apply for special certification to use restricted material, such as detonating cord and exploding bolts. Certification is valid for five years.\n\nAuthorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) are individuals certified by the Explosive Regulatory Division to inspect and approve pyrotechnic events, including members of agencies associated with pyrotechnics such as fire departments and police forces. Unlike other certification classes, Authorities Having Jurisdiction are not required to pay fees to attend training sessions.\n\nPyrotechnicians based outside of Canada participating in the production of a pyrotechnics special effects event in Canada are required to obtain a Visitor Card at either a Pyrotechnician or Special Effects Technician equivalent level. \nA certified Canadian technician of the applicable class must also be employed for the production. Visitor Cards are valid for one year.\n\nAlternately, pyrotechnicians based outside of Canada may apply for Canadian certification, provided they meet the minimum requirements and attend the Explosive Regulatory Division certification training.\n\nThere is no national certification or licensing requirements for pyrotechnicians in the United States, however, many individual states implement their own certification or licensing programs. Not all states have reciprocity agreements in regards to honouring another state's certification, so it is not uncommon for pyrotechnicians to have certifications from multiple states. Certain states require certification to store, handle and operate fireworks but not proximate (indoor) pyrotechnics; other states use the same certification for all pyrotechnics.\n\nProfessional pyrotechnic companies typically have licenses issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives with regard to manufacturer and distribution of pyrotechnic materials. A special category of driver's license is required for anyone who wishes to transport pyrotechnic materials by vehicle.\n\n\n"}

It is through representation that people organize the world and reality through the act of naming its elements. Signs are arranged in order to form semantic constructions and express relations. \n\nFor many philosophers, both ancient and modern, man is regarded as the \"representational animal\" or \"animal symbolicum\", the creature whose distinct character is the creation and the manipulation of signs – things that \"stand for\" or \"take the place of\" something else.\n\nRepresentation has been associated with aesthetics (art) and semiotics (signs). Mitchell says \"representation is an extremely elastic notion, which extends all the way from a stone representing a man to a novel representing the day in the life of several Dubliners\".\nThe term 'representation' carries a range of meanings and interpretations. In literary theory, 'representation' is commonly defined in three ways. \n\nRepresentation began with early literary theory in the ideas of Plato and Aristotle, and has evolved into a significant component of language, Saussurian and communication studies.\n\nTo represent is \"to bring to mind by description,\" also \"to symbolize, to be the embodiment of;\" from O.Fr. representer (12c.), from L. repraesentare, from re-, intensive prefix, + praesentare \"to present,\" lit. \"to place before\".\n\nA representation is a type of recording in which the sensory information about a physical object is described in a medium. The degree to which an artistic representation \"resembles\" the object it represents is a function of resolution and does not bear on the denotation of the word. For example, both the Mona Lisa and a child's crayon drawing of Lisa del Giocondo would be considered representational, and any preference for one over the other would need to be understood as a matter of aesthetics.\n\nSince ancient times representation has played a central role in understanding literature, aesthetics and semiotics. Plato and Aristotle are key figures in early literary theory who considered literature as simply one form of representation. Aristotle for instance, considered each mode of representation, verbal, visual or musical, as being natural to human beings. Therefore, what distinguishes humans from other animals is their ability to create and manipulate signs. Aristotle deemed mimesis as natural to man, therefore considered representations as necessary for people's learning and being in the world. Plato, in contrast, looked upon representation with more caution. He recognised that literature is a representation of life, yet also believed that representations create worlds of illusion leading one away from the \"real things\". For Plato, representation, like contemporary media, intervenes between the viewer and the real, creating illusions that lead one away from \"real things\". Plato believed that representation needs therefore, to be controlled and monitored due to the possible dangers resulting in its ability to foster antisocial emotions or encourage the imitation of evil.\n\nAristotle went on to say it was a definitively human activity.\nFrom childhood man has an instinct for representation, and in this respect man differs from the other animals that he is far more imitative and learns his first lessons though imitating things.\nAristotle discusses representation in three ways—\nThe means of literary representation is language. An important part of representation is the relationship between what the material and what it represents. The questions arising from this are, \"A stone may represent a man but how? And by what and by what agreement, does this understanding of the representation occur?\"\n\nOne apprehends reality only through representations of reality, through texts, discourses, images: there is no such thing as direct or unmediated access to reality. But because one can see reality only through representation it does not follow that one does not see reality at all… Reality is always more extensive and complicated than any system of representation can comprehend, and we always sense that this is so-representation never \"gets\" reality, which is why human history has produced so many and changing ways of trying to get it.\n\nConsequently, throughout the history of human culture, people have become dissatisfied with language's ability to express reality and as a result have developed new modes of representation. It is necessary to construct new ways of seeing reality, as people only know reality through representation. From this arises the contrasting and alternate theories and representational modes of abstraction, realism and modernism, to name a few.\n\nIt is from Plato’s caution that in the modern era many are aware of political and ideological issues and the influences of representations. It is impossible to divorce representations from culture and the society that produces them. In the contemporary world there exist restrictions on subject matter, limiting the kinds of representational signs allowed to be employed, as well as boundaries that limit the audience or viewers of particular representations. In motion picture rating systems, M and R rated films are an example of such restrictions, highlighting also society’s attempt to restrict and modify representations to promote a certain set of ideologies and values. Despite these restrictions, representations still have the ability to take on a life of their own once in the public sphere, and can not be given a definitive or concrete meaning; as there will always be a gap between intention and realization, original and copy.\n\nConsequently, for each of the above definitions there exists a process of communication and message sending and receiving. In such a system of communication and representations it is inevitable that potential problems may arise; misunderstandings, errors, and falsehoods. The accuracy of the representations can by no means be guaranteed, as they operate in a system of signs that can never work in isolation from other signs or cultural factors. For instance, the interpretation and reading of representations function in the context of a body of rules for interpreting, and within a society many of these codes or conventions are informally agreed upon and have been established over a number of years. Such understandings however, are not set in stone and may alter between times, places, peoples and contexts. How though, does this ‘agreement’ or understanding of representation occur? It has generally been agreed by semioticians that representational relationships can be categorised into three distinct headings: icon, symbol and index.\n\nFor instance objects and people do not have a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans in the context of their culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something. Viewing representation in such a way focuses on understanding how language and systems of knowledge production work to create and circulate meanings. Representation is simply the process in which such meanings are constructed. In much the same way as the post-structuralists, this approach to representation considers it as something larger than any one single representation. A similar perspective is viewing representation as part of a larger field, as Mitchell, saying, \"…representation (in memory, in verbal descriptions, in images) not only 'mediates' our knowledge (of slavery and of many other things), but obstructs, fragments, and negates that knowledge\" and proposes a move away from the perspective that representations are merely \"objects representing\", towards a focus on the relationships and processes through which representations are produced, valued, viewed and exchanged.\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) was an innovative and accomplished logician, mathematician, and scientist, and founded philosophical pragmatism. Peirce's central ideas were focused on logic and representation.\n\nPeirce distinguished philosophical logic as logic \"per se\" from mathematics of logic. He regarded logic (\"per se\") as part of philosophy, as a normative field following esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics, and as the art of devising methods of research. He argued that, more generally, as inference, \"logic is rooted in the social principle\", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.\n\nPeirce held that logic is formal semiotic, the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. He held that \"all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs\", along with their representational and inferential relations, interpretable by mind or \"quasi-mind\" (whatever works like a mind despite perhaps not actually being one); the focus here is on sign action in general, not psychology, linguistics, or social studies).\n\nHe argued that, since all thought takes time, \"all thought is in signs\" and sign processes (\"semiosis\") and that the three irreducible elements of semiosis are (1) the \"sign\" (or representamen), (2) the (semiotic) \"object\", the sign's subject matter, which the sign represents and which can be anything thinkable—quality, brute fact, or law—and even fictional (Prince Hamlet), and (3) the \"interpretant\" (or interpretant sign), which is the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect that is a further sign, for example, a translation. Even when a sign represents by a resemblance or factual connection independent of interpretation, the sign is a sign because it is at least potentially interpretable. A sign depends on its object in a way that enables (and, in a sense, determines) interpretation, forming an interpretant which, in turn, depends on the sign and on the object \"as the sign depends on the object\" and is thus a further sign, enabling and determining still further interpretation, further interpretants. That essentially triadic process is logically structured to perpetuate itself and is what defines sign, object, and interpretant.\n\nAn object either (1) is \"immediate\" to a sign, and that is the object as represented in the sign, or (2) is a \"dynamic\" object, which is the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded. Usually, an object in question, such as Hamlet or the planet Neptune, is a special or partial object. A sign's total object is the object's universe of discourse, the totality of things in that world to which one attributes the object. An interpretant is either (1) \"immediate\" to a sign, for example a word's usual meaning, a kind of interpretive quality or possibility present in the sign, or (2) \"dyanamic\", an actual interpretant, for example a state of agitation, or (3) \"final\" or \"normal\", a question's true settlement, which \"would\" be reached if thought or inquiry were pushed far enough, a kind of norm or ideal end with which any actual interpretant may, at most, coincide.\n\nPeirce said that, in order to know to what a sign refers, the mind needs some sort of experience of the sign's object, experience outside, and collateral to, the given sign or sign system. In that context he spoke of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms. For example, art work can exploit both the richness and the limits of the audience's experience; a novelist, in disguising a \"roman à clef\", counts on the typical reader's lack of personal experience with the actual individual people portrayed. Then the reader refers the signs and interpretants in a general way to an object or objects of the kind that is represented (intentionally or otherwise) by the novel. In all cases, the object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience with the object, collateral experience in which the object is newly found or from which it is recalled, even if it is experience with an object of imagination as called into being by the sign, as can happen not only in fiction but in theories and mathematics, all of which can involve mental experimentation with the object under specifiable rules and constraints. Through collateral experience even a sign that consists in a chance semblance of an absent object is determined by that object.\n\nPeirce held that logic has three main parts:\n\n1. Speculative Grammar. By this, Peirce means discovering relations among questions of how signs can be meaningful and of what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others. Within this broad area, Peirce developed three interlocked universal trichotomies of signs, depending respectively on (1) the sign itself, (2) how the sign stands for its object, and (3) how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Each trichotomy is divided according to the phenomenological category involved: \"Firstness\" (quality of feeling, essentially monadic), \"secondness\" (reaction or resistance, essentially dyadic), or \"thirdness\" (representation or mediation, essentially triadic).\nSome (not all) sign classes from different trichotomies intersect each other. For example, a qualisign is always an icon, and is never an index or a symbol. He held that there were only ten classes of signs logically definable through those three universal trichotomies. He thought that there were further such universal trichotomies as well. Also, some signs need other signs in order to be embodied. For example, a legisign (also called a type), such as the word \"the,\" needs to be embodied in a sinsign (also called a token), for example an individual instance of the word \"the\", in order to be expressed. Another form of combination is attachment or incorporation: an index may be attached to, or incorporated by, an icon or a symbol.\n\nPeirce called an icon apart from a label, legend, or other index attached to it, a \"hypoicon\", and divided the hypoicon into three classes: (a) the \"image\", which depends on a simple quality; (b) the \"diagram\", whose internal relations, mainly dyadic or so taken, represent by analogy the relations in something; and (c) the \"metaphor\", which represents the representative character of a sign by representing a parallelism in something else. A diagram can be geometric, or can consist in an array of algebraic expressions, or even in the common form \"All __ is ___\" which is subjectable, like any diagram, to logical or mathematical transformations.\n\n2. Logical critic or Logic Proper. That is how Peirce refers to logic in the everyday sense. Its main objective, for Peirce, is to classify arguments and determine the validity and force of each kind. He sees three main modes: abductive inference (guessing, inference to a hypothetical explanation); deduction; and induction. A work of art may embody an inference process and be an argument without being an explicit argumentation. That is the difference, for example, between most of \"War and Peace\" and its final section.\n\n3. Speculative rhetoric or methodeutic. For Peirce this is the theory of effective use of signs in investigations, expositions, and applications of truth. Here Peirce coincides with Morris’s notion of pragmatics, in his interpretation of this term. He also called it \"methodeutic\", in that it is the analysis of the methods used in inquiry.\n\nPeirce concluded that there are three ways in which signs represent objects. They underlie his most widely known trichotomy of signs:\n\nThis term refers to signs that represent by resemblance, such as portraits and some paintings though they can also be natural or mathematical. Iconicity is independent of actual connection, even if it occurs because of actual connection. An icon is or embodies a possibility, insofar as its object need not actually exist. A photograph is regarded as an icon because of its resemblance to its object, but is regarded as an index (with icon attached) because of its actual connection to its object. Likewise, with a portrait painted from life. An icon's resemblance is objective and independent of interpretation, but is relative to some mode of apprehension such as sight. An icon need not be sensory; anything can serve as an icon, for example a streamlined argument (itself a complex symbol) is often used as an icon for an argument (another symbol) bristling with particulars.\n\nPeirce explains that an index is a sign that compels attention through a connection of fact, often through cause and effect. For example, if we see smoke we conclude that it is the effect of a cause – fire. It is an index if the connection is factual regardless of resemblance or interpretation. Peirce usually considered personal names and demonstratives such as the word \"this\" to be indices, for although as words they depend on interpretation, they are indices in depending on the requisite factual relation to their individual objects. A personal name has an actual historical connection, often recorded on a birth certificate, to its named object; the word \"this\" is like the pointing of a finger.\n\nPeirce treats symbols as habits or norms of reference and meaning. Symbols can be natural, cultural, or abstract and logical. They depend as signs on how they \"will\" be interpreted, and lack or have lost dependence on resemblance and actual, indexical connection to their represented objects, though the symbol's individual embodiment is an index to your experience of its represented object. Symbols are instantiated by specialized indexical sinsigns. A proposition, considered apart from its expression in a particular language, is already a symbol, but many symbols draw from what is socially accepted and culturally agreed upon. Conventional symbols such as \"horse\" and \"caballo\", which prescribe qualities of sound or appearance for their instances (for example, individual instances of the word \"horse\" on the page) are based on what amounts to arbitrary stipulation. Such a symbol uses what is already known and accepted within our society to give meaning. This can be both in spoken and written language.\n\nFor example, we can call a large metal object with four wheels, four doors, an engine and seats a \"car\" because such a term is agreed upon within our culture and it allows us to communicate. In much the same way, as a society with a common set of understandings regarding language and signs, we can also write the word \"car\" and in the context of Australia and other English speaking nations, know what it symbolises and is trying to represent.\n\nSwiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) played a major role in the development of semiotics with his argument that language is a system of signs that needs to be understood in order to fully understand the process of linguistics. The study of semiotics examines the signs and types of representation that humans use to express feelings, ideas, thoughts and ideologies. Although semiotics is often used in the form of textual analysis it also involves the study of representation and the processes involved with representation.\n\nThe process of representation is characterised by using signs that we recall mentally or phonetically to comprehend the world. Saussure says before a human can use the word \"tree\" she or he has to envision the mental concept of a tree.\n\nTwo things are fundamental to the study of signs:\nThe signifier is the word or sound; the signified is the representation.\nSaussure points out that signs:\n\nSaussure suggests that the meaning of a sign is arbitrary, in effect; there is no link between the signifier and the signified. The signifier is the word or the sound of the word and the signified is the representation of the word or sound. For example, when referring to the term \"sister\" (signifier) a person from an English speaking country such as Australia, may associate that term as representing someone in their family who is female and born to the same parents (signified). An Aboriginal Australian may associate the term \"sister\" to represent a close friend that they have a bond with. This means that the representation of a signifier depends completely upon a person’s cultural, linguistic and social background. Saussure argues that if words or sounds were simply labels for existing things in the world, translation from one language or culture to another would be easy, it is the fact that this can be extremely difficult that suggests that words trigger a representation of an object or thought depending on the person that is representing the signifier. The signified triggered from the representation of a signifier in one particular language do not necessarily represent the same signified in another language. Even within one particular language many words refer to the same thing but represent different people's interpretations of it. A person may refer to a particular place as their \"work\" whereas someone else represents the same signifier as their \"favorite restaurant\". This can also be subject to historical changes in both the signifier and the way objects are signified.\n\nSaussure claims that an imperative function of all written languages and alphabetic systems is to \"represent\" spoken language. Most languages do not have writing systems that represent the phonemic sounds they make. For example, in English the written letter \"a\" represents different phonetic sounds depending on which word it is written in. The letter \"a\" has a different sound in the word in each of the following words, \"apple\", \"gate\", \"margarine\" and \"beat\", therefore, how is a person unaware of the phonemic sounds, able to pronounce the word properly by simply looking at alphabetic spelling. The way the word is represented on paper is not always the way the word would be represented phonetically. This leads to common misrepresentations of the phonemic sounds of speech and suggests that the writing system does not properly represent the true nature of the pronunciation of words.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The scop, however, was typically attached to a court on a relatively permanent basis. There, he most likely received rich gifts for his performances. The performances often featured the recitation of recognisable texts such as the \"old pagan legends of the Germanic tribes.\" However, the scop's duties also included \"composing\" his own poetry in different situations, the eulogizing of his master. While some scops moved from court to court, they were (generally speaking) less nomadic than the gleemen and had positions of greater security.\n\nOld English ' and its cognate Old High German ' (glossing ' and '; also ') may be related to the verb \"scapan\" \"to create, form\" (Old Norse \"skapa\", Old High German \"scaffan\"; Modern English \"shape\"), from Proto-Germanic ' \"form, order\" (from a PIE ' \"cut, hack\"), perfectly parallel to the notion of craftsmanship expressed by the Greek ' itself; Köbler (1993, p. 220) suggests that the West Germanic word may indeed be a calque of Latin \"\".\n\nWhile ' became English \"scoff\", the Old Norse ' lives on in a Modern English word of a similarly deprecating meaning, \"scold\". There is a homonymous Old High German ' meaning \"abuse, derision\" (Old Norse ', meaning \"mocking, scolding\", whence \"scoff\"), a third meaning \"tuft of hair\", and yet another meaning \"barn\" (cognate to English \"shop\"). They may all derive from a Proto-Germanic \"\".\n\nThe association with jesting or mocking was, however, strong in Old High German. There was a ' glossing both ' and ' and a ' glossing ' and '. ', on the other hand, is of a higher register, glossing '. The words involving jesting are derived from another root, Proto-Indo-European \"*skeub-\" \"push, thrust\", related to English \"shove, shuffle\", and the Oxford English Dictionary favours association of \"\" with that root. The question cannot be decided formally since the Proto-Germanic forms coincided in zero grade, and by the time of the surviving sources (from the late 8th century), the association with both roots may have influenced the word for several centuries.\n\nIt is characteristic of the Germanic tradition of poetry that the sacred or heroic cannot be separated from the ecstatic or drunken state and so crude jesting (compare the \"Lokasenna\", where the poet humorously depicts the gods themselves as quarrelsome and malicious), qualities summed up in the concept of ', the namegiving attribute of the god of poetry, '.\n\nProfessor of Literature at University of California San Diego, Seth Lerer suggests, \"What we have come to think of as the inherently 'oral' quality of Old English Poetry... [may] be a literary fiction of its own.\" Early English scholars have different opinions on whether or not the Anglo-Saxon oral poet ever really existed. Much of the poetry that survives does have an oral quality to it, but some scholars argue that it is a trait carried over from an earlier Germanic period. If, as some critics believe, the idea of the Anglo-Saxon oral poet is based on the Old Norse Skald, it can be seen as a link to the heroic past of the Germanic peoples. There is no proof that the \"scop\" existed, and it could be a literary device allowing poetry to give an impression of orality and performance. This poet figure recurs throughout the literature of the period, whether real or not. Examples are the poems Widsith and Deor, in the Exeter Book, which draw on the idea of the mead-hall poet of the heroic age and, along with the anonymous heroic poem, Beowulf express some of the strongest poetic connections to oral culture in the literature of the period.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25445767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25445767", "title": "Shadowgraphy (performing art)", "text": "Shadowgraphy (performing art)\n\nShadowgraphy or ombromanie is the art of performing a story or show using images made by hand shadows. It can be called \"cinema in silhouette\". Performers are titled as a shadowgraphist or shadowgrapher.\n\nThe art has declined since the late 19th century when electricity became available to homes because light bulbs and electric lamps do not give off good shadows and because cinema and television were becoming a new form of entertainment. Shadows are greatly defined by candlelight; therefore hand shadows were common in earlier centuries.\n\nThe modern art of hand shadows was made popular by the French entertainer Félicien Trewey in the 19th century. He popularized the art by making silhouettes of famous personalities.\n\nSince shadows have existed since the existence of objects obstructing light, it is hard to say when the art was first used by humans for entertainment. It could have been practiced by ancient or later humans, but it probably originated in the Far East. The French entertainer Félicien Trewey was interested in the art of Chinese shadow puppetry called Ombres Chinoises, which means \"Chinese shadows\". He popularized the art of hand shadows when he developed shadows of famous silhouettes. It then became popular in Europe in the 19th century.\n\nAlthough the art is popular amongst different kinds of entertainers it seems prominent amongst magicians, because it was popularized by a magician who inspired many other magicians. Félicien Trewey perfected the widely known elephant, bird, and cat hand shadows and created some of his own such as The Volunteer, Robinson Crusoe, The Jockey, The Rope Dancer and more. In 1889, Trewey joined with Alexander Herrmann who most likely learned it from him. David Tobias Bamberg most likely learned it from Alexander who then passed it down to his son Okito (Tobias Leendert Bamberg) who then passed it down to \"his\" son Fu Manchu (David Theodore Bamberg). Fu Manchu passed his skill to Marcelo Contento, one of his apprentices, who became famous worldwide for it. Contento died before he could pass it on to his son.\n\nOther magicians who used hand shadows in their act include David Devant, Edward Victor, and the duo Holden and Graham in which Holden was famous for his \"Monkey in the Belfry\" shadow.\n\nThe hands and fingers are exercised and different finger positions are practiced to help aid in forming shadows.\n\nThe light source to be used should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light proceeding from the smallest possible point. Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, \"Modern Conjuring For Amateurs\", that the best source of light is the electric arc, which Almoznino agrees to the small arc lamp, and the second best being the limelight (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists is the use of acetylene gas (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or carbide lamp). Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.\n\nAlbert Almoznino suggests to use a white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of muslin or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a rear projection screen, but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.\n\nThe performer sits or stands between the light source and the blank surface, while having the option to perform in front of the performance surface or behind it, with each having different advantages. The performer has another option to perform from the left or the right of the light source. The farther the hands are from the light, the smaller the shadows will be, while the closer the hands are to the light, the larger the shadows will be. Also, the closer the hands are to the blank surface, the sharper the shadows will be. Trewey suggests that the most convenient distance for the light from the hands is four feet while the hands from the performance surface should be about six feet. The performer should always watch their shadows instead of their hands.\n\nMovement helps give the shadows character and brings them to life. Some shadows are performed with accessories attached to the hands or fingers to achieve movements or images not applicable to hands alone.\n\n\n"}

Created by John Hix, \"Strange as It Seems\" was distinguished for its adherence to Hix's standard that every published fact be verified by a minimum of three sources. In Hix's words, \"Strange as It Seems\" is a library of \n\nThe \"Strange as It Seems\" syndicated comic strips were printed daily in newspapers from 1928 to 1970. They were originally created by John Hix. \"Strange as It Seems\" was distinguished for its adherence to Hix's standard that every published fact be verified by a minimum of three sources.\n\nIt was syndicated domestically by McClure Newspaper Syndicate and internationally by United Press International. At its peak the strip was printed in 1,300 newspapers. The cartoons competed in newspapers with \"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\" cartoons. Other similar strips at the time included Ralph Graczak's \"Our Own Oddities\" and \"It Happened in Canada\" by Gordon Johnston.\n\nBy 1953, the strip's syndication was down to 175 newspapers. The demise of multiple newspapers in cities and the changing taste of readers led to the strip ending in 1970.\n\nThe cartoon strip was written and drawn by John Hix from 1928 until his health began to deteriorate in the early 1940s and Dick Kirby began drawing the strip, although Hix continued to oversee and approve all content.\n\nJohn Hix died of myocarditis on June 6, 1944 (which was also D-Day). His brother, Ernest Hix, took over producing the feature. The cartoons were drawn by Dick Kirby from 1944 to 1946, then by Doug Heyes from 1946 to 1948. After Ernest Hix's death in the crash of a private plane on September 18, 1948, in Los Angeles, the writing of the strip was taken over by his wife Elsie Huber Hix. Ms. Hix had two young children at the time, Ernest Harmon Hix Jr. and Dixie Ann Hix. Dick Kirby returned to draw the strip from 1948 until 1949, then George Jahns took over and continued as the feature's artist until 1970 when the strip was discontinued. Ms. Hix continued to write the stories for the comics until 1963, when she turned the work over to her son, Ernest Hix, Jr. He wrote and produced the strip with his wife Phyllis until 1970 when the feature went out of syndication.\n\n\"Strange as It Seems\" was a radio program of strange and unusual tales about fantastic people and events, based on the daily syndicated newspaper cartoon panels of John Hix of the same name. \"Strange as It Seems\" began as a 15-minute radio program on March 22, 1935. It was broadcast over the Columbia – Don Lee Coast radio network. The schedule was 3 nights a week - Sunday, Wednesday and Friday at 7:45 PM (6:45 during summer daylight saving time). The sponsor was Ex‐Lax. In late September 1935 the show changed to two shows per week, dropping the Sunday show. In late September 1936 the schedule changed again to Tuesday and Friday nights. A 1936 booklet of the \"Strange as It Seems\" stories was sponsored by Ex-Lax and given away as a free promotion of the radio program by writing to the station. The show was hosted by Gayne Whitman, produced and directed by Cyril Armbrister and the music was composed and directed by Felix Mills. Whitman had been the announcer on the \"Strange as It Seems\" movie shorts from 1930–1934. The programs included two or three segments of dramatized events in mini plays with dramatic, fanfare music interspersed in the show between segments. After the opening line, an Ex-Lax commercial would follow. Then two or three strange stories would be presented. The show would conclude with a preview of the next show's stories, an Ex-Lax commercial, a strange fact of trivia, such as \"butterflies smell with their feet\" and finally a short musical ending. There were occasionally live interviews with unusual personalities, such as the World's Fastest Talker. Many of the programs were distributed on 16\" 33 RPM records with one 15 minute show on each side. Many sources list at least 39 of these records with a total of 78 programs recorded. This run of the shows concluded at the end of January 1937, after over 210 shows. The show began again in January 1938 as a 15-minute once a week program, airing on Sunday afternoons at 3:00 (2:00 during daylight saving time). The show ended at the end of December 1938, with 53 shows in this run.\n\nThe \"Strange as It Seems\" radio program was picked up as a 30-minute network program on the Columbia Broadcasting System from August 17, 1939 to December 26, 1940 on Thursdays at 8:30 P.M. (7:30 P.M. during the summer daylight saving time). There were 72 broadcasts of these 1⁄2 hour broadcasts. The sponsor was Palmolive Shave Cream and the host was Alois Havrilla. Havrilla was the announcer on the \"Stranger Than Fiction\" movie shorts beginning in 1934 and continuing in that role until the shorts were ended in 1942. \"Stranger Than Fiction\" was the successor to the \"Strange as It Seems\" movie shorts that ran from 1930 until 1934.\n\nThe program had one final run in its original 15 minute format from Nov. 10, 1946 to April 13, 1947, airing at 7:30 PM on Sunday nights. There were 22 episodes aired in this run. In the newspaper story about the death of John Hix on June 6, 1944, Ernest Hix stated there were over 600 radio programs produced, indicating there were other shows than those so far identified.\n\nAlfred Vosburgh was born March 19, 1890 in Chicago, Illinois. He first used the stage name of Alfred Whitman when he began acting in silent films in 1917. He later used the stage name Gayne Whitman, beginning in 1925. He was an American radio and film actor. On radio, he played the title role in Chandu the Magician and was an announcer on other programs. He appeared in 213 films between 1904 and 1957. His wife was the former Estelle Allen. Whitman died on August 31, 1958 in Los Angeles, CA of a heart attack.\n\nGordon 'Felix' Mills was born on July 28, 1901 in Fort Collins, Colorado. He was a highly successful composer-arranger-conductor during the Golden Age of Radio in the 1930s and 1940s. He was the musical director for \"The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air\", a Disney radio show of the 1930s. Mills created a \"gadget band\" with wild instruments for Donald Duck to direct on some episodes.\n\nHe was also the musical director for CBS Radio's \"Silver Theater\" from 1937 to 1947. Choosing to retire rather than fire a few band members during the Red Inquisition, he built a home in Morro Bay, California to pursue his favorite hobbies, sailing and slide photography. Mills died on April 5, 1987 at Morro Bay, California.\n\nCyril Edward Armbrister was born on Cat Island, Bahamas on August 24, 1896. His ancestors had been British loyalists during the Revolutionary War and immigrated to the Bahamas in the late 1700s. His father, William Armbrister, married for a second time at the age of 76 to Eugenie Bode and Cyril was born of this marriage. His father died when Cyril was 12 and he and his mother moved to Canada. Cyril was educated in England and was a captain in the Canadian Militia during World War I. He later moved to Hollywood and became a director. He directed \"Chandu the Magician\", \"Terry and the Pirates\", and \"Land of the Lost\", among other radio programs. He married the actress Frances Fintel and they split their time between California and the family plantation on Cat Island, Bahamas. Cyril's son Tony developed the family plantation into the resort, Fernandez Bay. Cyril died on September 18, 1966 in Nassau, Bahamas.\n\nAlois Havrilla was born June 7, 1891 in Presov, Slovakia. He arrived in the United States as a small child, speaking no English. He worked hard to perfect his English. He began his radio career as a baritone singer. In 1921, he recorded, \"Tancuj, Tancuj,\" a well-known Slovak folk song. He then worked as an announcer on the \"Palmolive Hour\" on NBC from 1927 to 1931. He also worked as an announcer on several other radio programs, including \"The Jack Benny Program\" in 1934–1935 and the Paul Whiteman radio program. In 1935, he received an award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the prestigious Medal for Good Diction and was named as the country's best radio announcer. He also worked as a narrator for Universal, Paramount Pictorial and Pathe Motion Picture Studios. Havrilla worked at a number of New York-area radio stations as a news commentator, announcer, narrator, and host of musical programs. He died on December 7, 1952 in Englewood, New Jersey.\n\nWarner Brothers released a series of short films beginning in May 1930 based on Robert Ripley's \"Ripley's Believe it or Not!\" cartoon series. Universal Studios responded by signing John Hix to a contract to create short films based on his cartoon strip \"Strange as It Seems\". There were 39 short subjects released between August 22, 1930 and May 5, 1934, coming out on average about once per month. The films were produced by Jerry Fairbanks & Manny Nathan, scripted by John Hix and narrated by Gayne Whitman. The first 21 released in 1930 were produced in Multicolor. Beginning in September, 1932, the remaining 17 shorts were filmed in Black & White. The shorts played in over 6,000 movie theaters. When Jerry Fairbanks left Universal for rival Paramount, (starting their \"Popular Science (film)\" films, his \"Strange as It Seems\" series was taken over by the Universal Studios newsreel staff with Thomas Mead and Joseph O'Brien in charge and renamed \"Stranger Than Fiction\". The first of these films was released on June 28, 1934 and came out about every 2 to 3 weeks. They were also filmed in black and white and were directed by Charles E. Ford and narrated by Alois Havrilla & James Wallington. Beginning on Sept. 18, 1940, the films were directed by Henry Clay Bate and narrated by Alois Havrilla. The last of the \"Stranger Than Fiction\" short films was released on August 31, 1942, for a total of 110 \"Stranger Than Fiction\" short films and a total of 149 short films, including the \"Stranger than Fiction\" series. Columbia Studios brought back the \"Strange as It Seems\" shorts in 1937. CBS bundled 8 of these shorts in a package to their television affiliates in 1949.\n\nThe first \"Strange as It Seems\" book was published in 1931 and reprinted many of the cartoons from the three-year run of the newspaper feature. In December 1936, Eastern Color Printing published the \"John Hix Scrapbook\". In 1937, Eastern released a second volume.\n\nThere was also a hardback written by Elsie Huber Hix in 1945 and a follow-up paperback. Each sold over 500,000 copies. She published two more paperbacks, with the final one published in 1962.\n\nComic books were a natural medium for these cartoons. The first of these comic books appeared in 1932. Promotional comic books were created for Ex-Lax (as a promotional giveaway on the radio program they sponsored) and United Airlines (as a handout for passengers to read on the flights). A series of comics began in 1939, with issues 2 – 9 being published.\n\nThe California Pacific International Exposition in San Diego opened in May 1935. But by that fall, the promoters knew they needed to make changes. Areas like Gold Gulch (a replica of an 1849 Gold Rush town) and the Zoro Garden Nudist Colony were getting out of hand and generating bad publicity while the \"Ripley's Believe It Or Not!\" exhibit was deemed to be too gruesome, so the exhibitors contacted Ernest and John Hix about opening their own exhibit to replace Ripley's in the 1936 season of the fair. Their exhibit opened in February 1936 and was very popular. John Hix drew from his large collection of oddities for the Exhibition in the large building in the center of the Fun Zone. Then in 1939, the Hix brothers aced out Robert Ripley for an exhibition at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Ripley responded with his own exhibition near the Fair and named it \"Ripley's Believe It Or Not Odditorrium\". A series of the Odditoriums would eventually be created around the world. A 1938 newspaper article described the groundbreaking of the exhibit at the World's Fair \"61 Year old Shovel. Auspiciously performing groundbreaking ceremonies for the John Hix \"Strange as It Seems\" show at the New York World's Fairground on December 30, 1938, Grover Whalen, President of the Fair, used a shovel invented 61 years before – on April 16, 1878 – by G. B. DeForest, embodying construction principles still in use. Betty Broadbent was one of the persons at the Hix's attraction. Her body was covered almost entirely with over 450 tattoos.\n\nThe \"Strange as It Seems\" archives are maintained by Jeff Hix, grandnephew of John Hix and the son of Ernest Harmon Hix, Jr. and are currently being digitized by HistoriVision, LLC. to be made available to the public for reference as well as for use in the \"Strange as It Seems\" productions currently published on their website and YouTube channel. According to the \"Strange as It Seems\" website, the archives are a \"40 year treasure trove of fascinating letters and photos from the world over confirming the strange and unusual stories in sports, science, popular culture, history and nature delivered daily to its faithful readership throughout the 1930's, 40's, 50's & 60's.\"\n\nRobert Ripley of \"Ripley's Believe It Or Not!\" and John Hix of \"Strange as It Seems\" competed on many media fronts in acquiring and accumulating the most original and strange facts for their projects. There was always a friendly rivalry between Ripley and Hix in their various media offerings: \n\nThey also competed in book and comic book publishing as well.\n\nJohn McCary Hix was born on June 17, 1907 in Huntsville, Alabama, to John Harmon Hix and Viola Ann McCary Hix. His brother Ernest Harmon Hix was born on September 13, 1902. Before World War I, the family first located to Nashville, Tennessee, then Spartanburg, South Carolina. John Harmon Hix was a traveling salesman and moved his family to Greenville, South Carolina, where their third child, a daughter, Elizabeth Jane, was born in August 1918.\n\nAt an early age, John McCary Hix had a strong urge to draw. He drew unflattering caricatures of his teachers which often got him into trouble. Eventually his cartooning paid off and his drawings appeared in the \"Nautilus\", the Greenville High School newspaper. While in school, John took a job with the \"Greenville Daily News\" as a staff artist for $5 a week.\nHe was also a delivery boy on his bicycle, which earned him $7 a week. His dog Pal, a shaggy black and white half-collie and half-Water spaniel, followed him everywhere on his deliveries. John trained Pal to drop papers on the doorsteps of one side of street while he delivered the other. He got up every morning at 3:00 AM and was at the newspaper office by 4:00 AM. He was also the local agent for several magazines, selling them as well. \n\nHe studied cartooning through a correspondence course, since there were no art schools nearby. When his father died on March 5, 1926 of heart failure, John was in his senior year of school. After graduation from Greenville High School in May 1926 (he has a plaque on the Greenville High School Wall of Fame), John decided he wanted bigger things and applied to the \"Washington Herald\" newspaper as an editorial cartoonist. He got the job and moved to Washington, D.C., where he was paid $15 a week. While in Washington D.C., he attended a few classes at the Corcoran School of Art. \n\nHe also started a daily one-column comic strip called \"Hicks by Hix\", featuring various wise-cracking hick characters. It was syndicated by King Features Syndicate. The strip did very well and was syndicated to several newspapers. This success lead to a job with McClure Newspapers in New York City. He illustrated a new strip called \"Young Frank Merriwell\", written by Gilbert Patten. It debuted on March 26, 1928 and ran for 6 months (the comic strip was resurrected in July 1931 as \"Frank Merriwell's Schooldays\" and ran for three years, this time illustrated by Jack Wilhelm). He also created a strip called \"O. Henry's Short Stories\". During this time he attended a few classes at the National Academy of Design in New York. His dream was to attend the Yale School of Art where several of his art school classmates were attending, but there was not the money for that so most of John's art training was learned on the job.\n\n\"Ripley's Believe it or Not!\", drawn by Robert Ripley began syndication in 1918. It contained many fantastic claims, which were not always verified. In 1927, John conceived the idea of \"Strange as It Seems\" and in December of that year, he signed a contract with The McClure Newspaper Syndicate in New York City, making him the nation's youngest nationally syndicated artist at only 20 years old. The cartoon was announced for syndication by McClure in February 1928 and debuted on March 28, 1928 in about 50 newspapers, the same day \"Young Frank Merriwell\" debuted. The cartoon was one panel with several illustrations of strange and unusual people, places and events. The feature required much more than just drawing as countless hours of research were required for the ideas and to verify their authenticity. Hix advertised widely that all of his claims were verified by at least three sources. He even included a notation on his cartoons, \"If you doubt this, write for proof to the author.\" In the May 20, 1929 issue of \"Time\" magazine, it was erroneously reported that the comic had debuted the previous week. A letter to the editor three weeks later from Harold Matson, Managing Editor of the syndicate, corrected the timing of the cartoons publication dates. \"Time\" compared Hix to Ripley with this observation: \"Cartoonist Hix does not seem quite so able with his pencil as Cartoonist Ripley. Astounder Ripley, after nine years, does not seem quite so astounding as fresh Astounder Hix.\"\n\nIn the January 4, 1930 edition of \"Editor & Publisher\" magazine, Hix announced that in early February 1930, \"Strange as It Seems\" would be expanded to include a full page Sunday color edition. The comic was being carried in over 80 newspapers by this time. John was now drawing a daily panel plus a Sunday color panel, a full 365 cartoons a year. As the cartoon grew in popularity and distribution spread into more papers, fans began mailing John ideas for the feature. To verify the story ideas, John would correspond with educators, scientists, civic workers and historians from around the world for photographs and documentation of authenticity. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that Hix rarely traveled for his ideas, but relied on correspondence for verification and had built a repository of 50,000–60,000 usable ideas ready to be incorporated into his cartoons. The claim that drew the most requests for proof of authenticity was that George Washington was the eighth president of the United States and that he was born on February 11, not February 22. The cartoons were often accompanied by several paragraphs of explanation in an article next to the cartoon.\n\nJohn Hix continued to live in Washington D.C. and is listed in the 1930 U.S. Census as living on New Hampshire Avenue, a couple of houses down from the rest of his family.\n\"Strange as It Seems\" became immensely popular and there were many opportunities for expanding the feature. John's brother Ernest Hix became his business manager and together they recognized the possibilities of turning the \"Strange as It Seems\" cartoons into a multi-media empire, especially after Ripley's \"Believe It Or Not!\" cartoons were transformed into live action movie shorts for Paramount Studios beginning in May 1930. \n\nUniversal Studios offered John Hix an opportunity to create movie shorts for their studio and the first \"Strange as It Seems\" short was released on August 22, 1930. The shorts would eventually play in over 6,000 movie theaters across the country. Like the Disney brothers a decade before them, the Hix brothers relocated their feature to Hollywood, California, in 1931. In 1931, a hardback book of the cartoon stories was released. The first of many comic books with the cartoons in them appeared in 1932. In May 1932, the cartoon was in over 150 newspapers. By November 1932, the cartoons were appearing in England, China and Japan.\n\nIn the spring of 1935, John Hix turned his cartoons into a successful 15-minute radio program on the Columbia – Don Lee network. Beginning on Sept. 13, 1936, \"The John Hix Scrapbook\" was released as half of the syndicated Sunday Color full page cartoon. In September 1939, the radio show became a 30-minute program broadcast weekly over the CBS network for 72 weeks. Over 600 radio programs were eventually created. The California Pacific International Exposition in San Diego opened in May 1935 with an exhibit of \"Ripley's Believe It Or Not!\". But by the end of that year, exhibit was deemed to be too gruesome. So the exhibitors contacted Ernest and John Hix about opening their own exhibit to replace Ripley's in the 1936 season of the fair. Their exhibit opened in February 1936 and was immensely popular. In 1939, the Hix brothers outmaneuvered Ripley for an exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair. \n\nIn its heyday, it was reported that the \"Strange as It Seems\" comic strip was syndicated in over 1,300 newspapers. John Hix enjoyed people questioning the authenticity of his stories and continued to invite them to write for proof in each cartoon, a feature that became the centerpiece for many of his promotional newspaper articles. During World War II, John worked with the Office of Emergency Management to incorporate 70 ideas they supplied into his comics to help the war effort.\n\nJohn's health began failing in the early 1940s and Dick Kirby took over the drawing of \"Strange as It Seems\", but Hix still reviewed all of the cartoons prior to publication.\n\nOn Monday evening, June 5, 1944, John Hix collapsed against a car, gashing his head in front of a hotel on Ivar Ave. He was taken to his home by his physician and died the following morning, June 6, 1944 (D-Day). The cause of death was a heart attack caused by myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle due to a viral infection). He was only 11 days shy of his 37th birthday. On June 8, 1944, the \"Los Angeles Times\" announced that there would be a private service coordinated by Forest Lawn Mortuary. John was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, CA. His plot is in The Great Mausoleum, Memorial Terrace, Hall of Memory, Columbarium of Memory, Niche 19608. He had no wife or children.\n\nErnest Harmon Hix, Sr. was born September 13, 1902 in Huntsville, Alabama. After he moved to Washington D.C. with his family in the 1920s, he met and married Elsie Huber in 1932. Ernest became the business manager of the \"Strange as It Seems\" business and helped to create a multi-media empire of cartoons, movies shorts, books, comics, radio programs and exhibitions. He relocated with his brother, mother, sister and wife to Los Angeles in the 1930s. In 1942, he shared an office with his brother, John, at 6362 Haywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA and his residence was on Canyon Drive, Los Angeles, CA. Ernest took over the \"Strange as It Seems\" creative business after John Hix died suddenly in 1944. Besides continuing to write the daily syndicated cartoon, Ernest revived the radio show, as a transcribed 15 minute program in 1947. The program ran until his death on September 18, 1948 in a private plane crash, shortly after take-off from the Newhall Airport north of Los Angeles.\n\nThe plane's owner, Eugene Joseff, had been warned not to take off until a fog lifted, but he took off anyway. The plane crashed and burst into flames after circling the field. Beside Ernest Hix and Eugene Joseff, there were two other persons killed in the plane crash: John M. Lacey, the pilot and Wilmer F. Pemberton, a designer.\nJoseff was the maker and supplier of about 90% of the ornate jewelry used in motion pictures at the time. After his death, Hix's wife Elsie took over the \"Strange as It Seems\" work.\n\nElsie Elizabeth Huber was born Nov. 11, 1902 in Allentown, PA. Her parents were John and Anna Lowe Huber, both born in Germany. They immigrated separately to the United States in their twenties and were married in Pennsylvania in 1894. Elsie Huber graduated from Cedar Crest College in 1928. From 1928 to 1930, she taught secretarial courses at Virginia Intermont College in Bristol, VA. In 1930, she became the Office Business Manager of Remington Rand Co. in Washington, D.C. She held this position until her marriage in 1932 to Ernest Harmon Hix, Sr. After the family moved to Los Angeles in the 1930s, from 1939 until 1964, she was the Executive Secretary to George E. Kinsey, a Los Angeles real estate investor, philanthropist and former president of the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission. After the death of her husband in 1948 in a private plane crash, she took over the work of \"Strange as It Seems\". She was the writer of the comic strip for 15 years until 1963, when she turned it over to her son, Ernest Harmon Hix, Jr. In 1964, she married Donald Lee Chamberlin. They were married until his death in 1976. From 1985 she lived in Glendora, CA. She died on December 9, 1995 in Glendale, CA and is buried in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park cemetery in Glendale.\n\nErnest Harmon Hix, Jr. is the son of Ernest Harmon Hix Sr. and Elsie Elizabeth Huber Hix. He wrote and produced the \"Strange as It Seems\" comic strip with his wife Phyllis from 1963 until the feature ceased production in 1970.\n\nJeffrey David Hix is the son of Ernest Harmon Hix Jr. and Phyllis Hix and is curator of the \"Strange as It Seems\" archives. Hix is reviving the \"Strange as It Seems\" brand for the digital age.\n\n"}

The first anime series was licensed by Geneon Entertainment in English, but the license expired in 2011. Sentai Filmworks has since re-licensed and re-released the first series and released the other three series in North America. A manga version drawn by Nana Mochizuki was serialized in Media Factory's manga magazine \"Monthly Comic Alive\" between August 2006 and October 2009. The manga was released by Seven Seas Entertainment in North America. Three additional spin-off manga were also created, as were three visual novels.\n\nLouise is a noble girl who is terrible at magic, as her attempts usually result in an explosion. She is nicknamed \"Louise the Zero\" by her classmates, due to the inability to use any of the four magic elements. Early in the school year at the Tristain Academy of Magic, the second year students perform a special ritual where they summon their familiar, which serves as their eternal protector and partner, and is usually some sort of magical creature. But Louise summons Saito Hiraga, an ordinary teenage boy from Japan, leaving her totally humiliated.\n\nDue to the sacredness of the ritual, Louise reluctantly accepts Saito as her familiar, but proceeds to treat Saito as any other familiar, only worse, making him wash her clothes, sleep on a bed of hay, and whipping him with a riding crop when he upsets her. \"The Familiar of Zero\" follows the adventures of Louise and Saito as they help their classmates and friends, while occasionally blundering into situations where they risk their lives to save one another. Saito tries to find a way to get back to Japan, but he also has a mysterious power that allows him to wield swords and other weapons to perform heroic feats. They also eventually learn the truth behind Louise's magic inabilities. As Saito's and Louise's friendship grows and they start to work together, they ultimately fall in love with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Familiar of Zero\" began as a series of light novels written by Noboru Yamaguchi and illustrated by Eiji Usatsuka under the original title \"Zero no Tsukaima\". Media Factory published 20 volumes in Japan between June 25, 2004 and February 25, 2011. Further publication was threatened by Yamaguchi's advanced cancer, which he succumbed to on April 4, 2013, leaving the series unfinished. Yamaguchi had planned the series to end with 22 volumes. However, it was later decided by the publisher to continue the series in the author's absence, due in part to calls from fans to continue the series, as well as Yamaguchi's family wanting to see it completed. Yamaguchi had dictated the remaining plot of the series, including its ending, and entrusted it to the editors. Media Factory released volume 21 on February 25, 2016 and the final volume 22 on February 24, 2017. Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the series in 2007 under the title \"Zero's Familiar\", but later cancelled the release of the novels.\n\nA side-story, \"Zero no Tsukaima Gaiden: Tabatha no Bōken\", initially available as a mobile phone online serial, was released in three volumes between October 25, 2006 and March 25, 2009. It centers on the adventures of the character Tabitha, Louise's classmate. Another side story, \"Kaze no Kishihime\", was released in two volumes on October 23, 2009 and March 25, 2010. It is a prequel about Louise's mother youth. A companion volume, \"Zero no Tsukaima Memorial Book\", was released on June 24, 2017. It collected various short stories and illustrations previously unpublished in book format, as well as character designs and other information, such as outlines for volumes 21 and 22 left behind by Yamaguchi. It also revealed that the last two volumes of the series were written by Yū Shimizu, author of \"Bladedance of Elementalers\", using Yamaguchi's notes.\n\n\"The Familiar of Zero\" has been adapted into an anime series running for four seasons by the animation studio J.C.Staff. The first season aired in Japan between July 3 and September 25, 2006, and contained thirteen episodes. In April 2007 at Anime Boston, Geneon announced that they had picked up the English dubbing rights of the first season of the anime series under the title \"The Familiar of Zero\". In July 2008, Geneon Entertainment and Funimation Entertainment announced an agreement to distribute select titles in North America. While Geneon Entertainment still retained the license, Funimation Entertainment assumed exclusive rights to the manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of select titles. \"The Familiar of Zero\" was one of several titles involved in the deal.

{"id": "1572108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1572108", "title": "The Red Balloon", "text": "The Red Balloon\n\nThe Red Balloon () is a 1956 French fantasy comedy-drama featurette written, produced, and directed by Albert Lamorisse. The thirty-five-minute short, which follows the adventures of a young boy who one day finds a sentient, mute, red balloon, was filmed in the Ménilmontant neighbourhood of Paris.\n\nLamorisse used his children as actors in the film. His son, Pascal, plays himself in the main role, and his daughter, Sabine, portrays a little girl.\n\nThe film won numerous awards, including an Oscar for Lamorisse for writing the Best Original Screenplay in 1956 and the Palme d'Or for short films at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. It also became popular with children and educators. It is the only short film to win the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and to receive a nomination for anything besides Best Live Action Short Film.\n\nThe film follows Pascal (Pascal Lamorisse), a young boy who, on his way to school one morning, discovers a large helium-filled red balloon. As he plays with it, he realizes it has a mind and will of its own. It begins to follow him wherever he goes, never straying far from him, and at times floating outside his bedroom window, as his mother will not allow it in their apartment.\n\nThe balloon follows Pascal through the streets of Paris, and they draw a lot of attention and envy from other children as they wander the streets. At one point the balloon enters his classroom, causing an uproar from his classmates. The noise alerts the principal, who locks Pascal up in his office. Later, after being set free, Pascal and the balloon encounter a little girl (Sabine Lamorisse) with a blue balloon that also seems to have a mind of its own, just like the red one.\nOne Sunday, the balloon is told to stay home while Pascal and his mother go to church. However, it follows them through the open window and into the church, and they are led out by a scolding beadle.\n\nIn their wanderings around the neighborhood, Pascal and the balloon encounter a gang of older boys, who are envious of the balloon and attempt to steal it while Pascal is inside a bakery; however, he manages to retrieve it. Following a chase through narrow alleyways, the boys finally catch the balloon, throw stones at it, and bring it down with sling shots before one of the boys finish it off by stomping on it.\n\nThe film ends as all the other balloons in Paris come to Pascal's aid and take him on a cluster balloon ride over the city.\n\nAs the film was filmed in Paris after World War II, its mise-en-scene is quite dark and grey and therefore gives a depressing quality to the setting and mood. In contrast, the balloon's bright colour acts as a symbol of hope and light within the film. The cluster balloon ride in the closing scene could also be said to represent a religious or spiritual analogy. For example, when the balloon is destroyed, its \"spirit\" lives on as it is transferred to all the other balloons in the city, which is said to be a metaphor for Christ. Themes of self-realisation and loneliness are also present in the film.\nThe theme of innocence is persistent and is one of the main focuses of the film. Through a child’s gaze, a cynical world is transformed into an almost magical one, highlighting the power of the innocence and imagination of children.\n\nIn addition, authors such as Myles P. Breen have identified the film as having thematic/stylistic qualities that are reflective of the poetic medium. This perspective is rationalised by Breen through quoting film theorist Christian Metz, who states, “in a poem there is no story line, and nothing intrudes between the author and the reader”. The film, therefore, is categorised by Breen as being a filmic poem, partially due to its loose, non-narrative structure.\n\nThe film serves as a color record of the Belleville area of Paris, which had fallen into decay by the 1960s, prompting the Parisian government to demolish it as a slum-clearance effort. Part of the site was built up with housing projects; the remainder was left as wasteland for 20 years. Some of what is seen in the film no longer exists: one of the bakeries, the famous shaped staircase situated just beyond the equally famous café \"Au Repos de la Montagne\", the steep steps of the passage Julien Lacroix where Pascal finds the balloon, and the empty lot where all the battles take place. Instead stands the Parc de Belleville. Only the church still stands.\n\nAlbert Lamorrise was a former auditor at the Institut des hautes études cinématographiques (IDHEC), and the crew that he used for the making of the film was entirely composed of IDHEC graduates.\n\nThe film premiered and opened nationwide in France on 19 October 1956; it was released in the United Kingdom on 23 December 1956 (as the supporting film to the 1956 Royal Performance Film \"The Battle of the River Plate\", which ensured it a wide distribution) and in the United States on 11 March 1957.\n\nIt has been featured in many festivals over the years, including the Wisconsin International Children's Film Festival; the Los Angeles Outfest Gay and Lesbian Film Festival; the Wisconsin Film Festival; and others.\n\nThe film, in its American television premiere, was introduced by then-actor Ronald Reagan as an episode of the CBS anthology series \"General Electric Theater\" on 2 April 1961.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, the film was popular in elementary classrooms throughout the United States and Canada. A four-minute clip is on the rotating list of programming on Classic Arts Showcase.\n\nSince its first release in 1956, the film has generally received overwhelmingly favorable reviews from critics. The film critic for \"the New York Times\", Bosley Crowther, hailed the simple tale and praised director Lamorisse, writing that \"Yet with the sensitive cooperation of his own beguiling son and with the gray-blue atmosphere of an old Paris quarter as the background for the shiny balloon, he has got here a tender, humorous drama of the ingenuousness of a child and, indeed, a poignant symbolization of dreams and the cruelty of those who puncture them.\"\n\nWhen the film was re-released in the United States in late 2006 by Janus Films, \"Entertainment Weekly\" magazine film critic Owen Gleiberman praised its direction and simple story line that reminded him of his youth, and wrote, \"More than any other children's film, \"The Red Balloon\" turns me into a kid again whenever I see it...[to] see \"The Red Balloon\" is to laugh, and cry, at the impossible joy of being a child again.\"\n\nFilm critic Brian Gibson wrote, \"So far, this seems a post-Occupation France happy to forget the blood and death of Hitler's war a decade earlier. But soon people’s occasional, playful efforts to grab the floating, carefree balloon become grasping and destructive. In a gorgeous sequence, light streaming down alleys as children's shoes clack and clatter on the cobblestones, the balloon bouncing between the walls, Pascal is hunted down for his floating pet. Its ballooning sense of hope and freedom is deflated by a fierce, squabbling mass. Then, fortunately, it floats off, with the breeze of magic-realism, into a feeling of escape and peace, \"The Red Balloon\" taking hold of Pascal, lifting him out of this rigid, petty, earthbound life.\"\n\nIn a review in \"The Washington Post,\" critic Philip Kennicott had a cynical view: \"[The film takes] place in a world of lies. Innocent lies? Not necessarily. \"The Red Balloon\" may be the most seamless fusion of capitalism and Christianity ever put on film. A young boy invests in a red balloon the love of which places him on the outside of society. The balloon is hunted down and killed on a barren hilltop–-think Calvary–-by a mob of cruel boys. The ending, a bizarre emotional sucker punch, is straight out of the New Testament. Thus is investment rewarded-–with Christian transcendence or, at least, an old-fashioned Assumption. This might be sweet. Or it might be a very cynical reduction of the primary impulse to religious faith.\"\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 95% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on twenty reviews.\n\n\nIn 1960, Lamorisse released a second film, \"Stowaway in the Sky\", which also starred Pascal and was a spiritual successor to \"The Red Balloon\".\n\nA stage adaptation by Anthony Clark was performed at the Royal National Theatre in 1996.\n\nDon Hertzfeld's 1997 short film \"Billy's Balloon\", which also showed at Cannes, is a parody of \"The Red Balloon\".\n\nThe music video for \"Son of Sam\" by Elliott Smith, from his 2000 album Figure 8, is a direct homage to \"The Red Balloon\".\n\nHou Hsiao-hsien's 2007 film \"Flight of the Red Balloon\" is a direct homage to the film.\n\nA boy with a bright red balloon is featured in the epilogue of Damien Chazelle's 2016 musical film \"La La Land\".\n\nThe film was first released on VHS by Embassy Home Entertainment in 1984. A laserdisc of it was later released by The Criterion Collection in 1986, and was produced by Criterion, Janus Films, and Voyager Press. Included in it was Lamorisse's award-winning short \"White Mane\" (1953). A DVD version became available in 2008, and a Blu-Ray version was released in the United Kingdom on January 18, 2010; it has now been confirmed as region-free.\n\nA tie-in book was first published by Doubleday Books, (now Penguin Random House), in 1957, using black and white and color stills from the film, with added prose. The book was highly acclaimed and went on to win 'A New York Times Best Illustrated Children’s Book of the Year.' Albert Lamorisse was credited as the book's sole author. \n\nA soundtrack, featuring music adapted from the film by Lamorisse, was released on the Nonesuch Records label.\n\n"}

{"id": "759763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=759763", "title": "Tickle Me Elmo", "text": "Tickle Me Elmo\n\nTickle Me Elmo is a children's plush toy from Tyco Preschool, a division of Tyco Toys, of the Muppet character Elmo from the children's television show, Sesame Street. When squeezed, Elmo shakes, vibrates, and recites his trademark giggle, \"Uh-ha-ha-ha-hee-hee!\".\n\nThe toy was first produced in the United States in 1996 and slowly became a fad toy. Some instances of violence were reported over the limited supply amidst heavy consumer demand. \"People\" reported that the toy which retailed for $28.99 according to its MSRP, had been advertised in newspapers and on the Internet, with sellers asking up to $1,500 by the end of 1997.\n\n\"Tickles The Chimp\", the precursor to Tickle Me Elmo, was invented by Greg Hyman and Ron Dubren, who were known in the toy indusry for having had invented Alphie the Robot (a children's learning computer) several years prior. In 1995 it was presented to Tyco Preschool as \"Tickles The Chimp,\" which was a toy monkey with a computer chip which laughed when tickled. At the time Tyco didn't have rights to make \"Sesame Street\" plush, but did have \"Looney Tunes\" plush rights so it was worked on for several months as Tickle Me Tasmanian Devil, they also made Tickle Me versions of baby Bugs Bunny and Tweety, they successfully sold it at WB Studio Store in California. They are on Ebay and Amazon too. A short time later, Tyco lost rights to do \"Looney Tunes\" but gained the rights to \"Sesame Street,\" thus starting Tickle Me Elmo. The invention was originally introduced under Cabbage Patch at Hasbro Industries.\n\nNeil Friedman, who was then president of Tyco Preschool, recalled years later that, \"When you played with [Tickle Me Elmo] for the first time, it brought a smile to everyone's face. It was a magical surprise.\"\n\nTickle Me Elmo was released in July 1996, with a supply of 400,000 units. The dolls sold well and remained widely available in stores until the day after Thanksgiving, when they suddenly sold out. With the Christmas shopping season approaching, Tyco Preschool ordered 600,000 more dolls from their suppliers. Promotion was helped by Rosie O'Donnell, who had shown the toy on her popular TV show in early October. O'Donnell's \"surprise plug\" created unexpected demand for Elmo, resulting in shortages in the stores that sold it.\n\nThe scarcity of the new toy provoked a \"shopping frenzy\". Two women were arrested in Chicago for fighting over the doll, while in New York some people ran after delivery trucks hoping to get their hands on Elmo before it reached stores. Someone allegedly purchased a Tickle Me Elmo for $7,100 in Denver. A clerk working at a Wal-Mart store in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada was among those injured by \"Elmo-mania\". During a Midnight Madness sale on December 14, a crowd of 300 stampeded down the aisle after spotting him being handed a box of the toys by another employee. Trampled, he suffered \"a pulled hamstring, injuries to his back, jaw and knee, a broken rib and a concussion\".\n\nBy the end of December, the entire stock of one million \"Tickle Me Elmo\" toys had been sold.\n\nIn early 1997, Tyco released new \"Tickle Me\" toys based on other characters from \"Sesame Street\" – first \"Tickle Me Ernie\" and \"Tickle Me Big Bird\", then \"Tickle Me Cookie Monster\" – but despite good sales, none of these toys achieved as much fame as Tickle Me Elmo. With the re-release of Tickle Me Elmo, \"Mini Tickle Me Cookie Monster\" and \"Mini Tickle Me Ernie\" were also put on the market.\n\nThe \"Surprise Edition\" of Tickle Me Elmo, issued fall 2001, was an elaborate contest. Five of the \"Surprise Edition\" Elmos stopped laughing on January 9, 2002, and instead announced to the people squeezing them that they had won a prize. The grand prize was $200,000.\n\nIn 2006 for the tenth anniversary of Tickle Me Elmo, Fisher-Price released a new Elmo doll called \"TMX\", meaning \"Tickle Me (Elmo) Ten\" or \"Tickle Me eXtreme\". The toy, which was designed by Bruce Lund of Lund and Co. Invention (River Forest, Illinois), was first announced at the American International Toy Fair. Rather than simply vibrating like the original, the TMX rolls around on the floor, laughing and smashing his fist on the ground, begging for the tickler to stop.\n\nThe full look of the doll was not revealed until it debuted live on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" and arrived on store shelves on September 19, 2006. Toy experts said that the delay was unprecedented, with only a few people in the media allowed to preview the product, and only after signing confidentiality agreements. The packaging was designed so that the doll could not be seen without purchasing it. The box includes a preview flap, but upon opening, only the doll's eyes are visible. It requires six AA batteries, and costs approximately $40. In a promotional clip, Jim Silver, co-publisher of \"Toy Wishes\" magazine said, \"The first reaction I had was, 'Where are the wires?' Because I didn't think anything like that could move on its own.\".\nToy analyst Chris Byrne told \"USA Today\", \"This is a quantum leap forward, another breakthrough in the preschool plush category.\" Byrne believed sales would be high, but the reaction would not be as unprecedented. \"The culture has moved beyond that, the whole hot-toy phenomenon.\" He cited the fact there has not been such a craze since Furby in 1998. However, some members of the media expected a large response. Toys \"R\" Us stores and Amazon had a pre-sale program for the doll, the first included elaborate in-store displays with a digital countdown to the doll's launch. Amazon took more presale orders than it could fulfill. As with the original Tickle Me Elmo doll, demand for the new toy gave rise to some extreme acts. One person in Tampa, Florida was allegedly threatened with a gun to hand over a TMX toy. This was parodied on \"Saturday Night Live\", which said the man \"was subdued by the new 'Gimmie a Reason Bert'\".\n\nTMX and other toys helped Mattel's earnings for the third quarter of the 2006 financial year to grow by six percent and beat the expectations of financial analysts. TMX also helped increase sales of other Elmo toys.\n\nIn January 2007, Mattel announced it would release \"TMX Friends\", featuring Elmo, Ernie and Cookie Monster.\n\nFor the Christmas 2007 season, Fisher-Price released a version with hidden surprises. Mattel has provided a website with rhyming clues that can help find the special messages.\n\nPlayskool released the toy again as \"LOL Elmo\". Not a single image of the toy was revealed until the American International Toy Fair 2012; in the Hasbro showroom's Sesame Street section, there is a sign printed \"Laughter Unleashed! Fall 2012\". Above it was a video of kids giggling. The toy was released in September. It is also known as Tickle Time Elmo.\n\nPlayskool made a new version of this toy once again but they made it part of their Playskool Friends lineup. Its behavior is like the 1996 version but has more phrases like \"Elmo is one ticklish monster\". This toy released in August 2017. It can be found at Walmart, Books A Million, Best Buy, Target, Toys R Us before it closed and more. It can still be found\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8948747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8948747", "title": "Timbaland plagiarism controversy", "text": "Timbaland plagiarism controversy\n\nThe 2007 dance-pop song \"Do It\" performed by Canadian singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado features elements plagiarized from \"Acidjazzed Evening\", a chiptune-style track composed by the Finnish demoscene artist Janne Suni. Timbaland, the song's producer, admitted to \"sampling\" Suni's work, but did not believe his usage constituted \"stealing\", calling the allegations \"ridiculous\". Although users had noted the similarities between the two tracks on Finnish demoscene forums in July 2006, the Timbaland plagiarism controversy attracted mainstream attention in January 2007, when internet users posted videos to YouTube alleging Timbaland had plagiarised Suni's work. Soon afterwards, the controversy attracted the attention of the Finnish news portal eDome, and the MTV and Rolling Stone websites, who all published articles detailing the events of the controversy. \n\"Do It\" was released as the fifth North American single from \"Loose\" on July 24, 2007.\n\nThe original track, titled \"Acidjazzed Evening\", is a chiptune-style, 4-channel Amiga module composed by Finnish demoscener Janne Suni (a.k.a. Tempest). The song won first place in the Oldskool Music competition at Assembly 2000, a demoparty held in Helsinki, Finland, in 2000. According to Scene.org, the song was uploaded to their servers the same year, long before the release of the song by Furtado. The song was later remixed (with Suni's permission) by Norwegian Glenn Rune Gallefoss (a.k.a. GRG) for the Commodore 64 in SID format - this is the version which was later used for \"Do It\". It was added to the High Voltage SID Collection on December 21, 2002.\n\nA video which claims to show proof of the theft was posted to YouTube on January 12, 2007. Another video was posted to YouTube on January 14, 2007, claiming Timbaland also stole the tune a year earlier for the ringtone \"Block Party\", one of several that were sold in the United States in 2005.\n\nJanne Suni posted the following comment regarding the copyright status of \"Acidjazzed Evening\" on January 15, 2007:\nOn February 16, 2007, he added the following note:\n\nOn September 9, 2007, his webpage was updated with the following information:\nThe C64 news portal C64.sk published the following comment from Glenn R. Gallefoss on January 15, 2007:\n\nOn February 3, Gallefoss published the following comment on his personal web page:\n\nHannu Sormunen, a Finnish representative of Universal, which represents Nelly Furtado in Finland, commented the controversy as follows in the January 15, 2007 issue of \"Iltalehti\":\n\nThe first legal action against Universal Finland was officially filed with Helsinki District Court in mid-August 2007, on behalf of Glenn R. Gallefoss.\n\nOn February 2, 2007, Timbaland responded to the plagiarism accusations in an interview by the radio show \"Elliot in the Morning\". In this interview, Timbaland admits to what he calls \"sampling\", but he also claims that sampling is \"not stealing\", because \"everybody samples from everybody every day\". Timbaland also says that the sample is \"from a video game\" and mentions the Commodore 64. He also says that he has no time for research and that it is sometimes impossible to \"know what's public domain and what's not\". Timbaland also calls the issue \"ridiculous\" but mentions that he is \"in legal discussions\" and therefore was not able to say much about it. He did, however, call Janne Suni an \"idiot\" and a \"freakin' jerk\" on the show. He consistently talked about the incident as sampling, failing to address the claims with regards to the melody.\n\nOn February 9, 2007, Timbaland commented on the issue as follows in an MTV interview:\nA device in Timbaland's studio, as seen in video clips from the MTV show \"Timbaland's Diary\", has been identified as an Elektron SidStation. This device is a MIDI-controlled synthesizer based on the SID chip of the Commodore 64, and it is capable of playing back .sid files the way they would have sounded on the original hardware. It has been speculated that Timbaland downloaded Gallefoss' version of the song from the High Voltage SID Collection and used the SidStation for running it to the studio system.\n\nChris Abbott, maintainer of the website C64Audio.com, posted an in-depth analysis on the topic and summarizes it in his on-line article. Abbott has commercially released Commodore 64 music, most notably the \"Back in Time\" CD series. Abbott writes:\nAbbott also notes that although the evidence seems to be conclusive, the eventual outcome is not.\n\nIn August 2007, an action for infringement was filed in the District Court of Helsinki against Universal Music, Ltd alleging Nelly Furtado's song \"Do It\" infringed \"Acidjazzed Evening\". In January 2009, after a trial that included multiple expert and technical witnesses, a three judge panel unanimously dismissed the plaintiff's case.\n\nOn December 17, 2008, Abbott also testified as a witness of prosecution in the Helsinki court in Gallefoss' case against Universal Music Finland. The Finnish court reportedly threw out the case after ruling in only one aspects of the three claims (sampling, performance rights, producer rights), and the case remains in appellate court, as of January 2010.\n\nOn June 12, 2009, Mikko Välimäki, who is one of the legal counsels of Kernel Records, the owner of the sound recording rights, reported that the case had been filed in Florida. On June 7, 2011, the case of \"Kernel Records Oy v. Mosley\" ended with the court deciding that Kernel Records had failed to register for copyright in the United States.\n\nEarlier examples of unauthorized commercial use of SID music have been brought up by sources covering the Timbaland plagiarism controversy.\n\nAn often-mentioned example is Zombie Nation's 1999 hit \"Kernkraft 400\", which was a remake of David Whittaker's song for the 1984 Commodore 64 game \"Lazy Jones\". Legal action is pending. Another example is the Dutch hit \"You've Got My Love\", for which the artist Bas \"Bastian\" Bron sampled the drums from Jeroen Tel's and Reyn Ouwehand's song made for the Rubicon game. Both of the cases were won by the original authors in court.\n\nThe Fitts for Fight case also involved copied chipmusic.\n\nIn April 2008, a similar case was revealed about self-proclaimed \"chiptune maestro\" Laromlab, who released his self-titled album on Mushpot Records; shortly after it was discovered that the entire album is in fact the work of a chiptune collective called the YM Rockerz. Mushpot responded by dropping Laromlab immediately from the label, and Laromlab himself has issued an apology, stating the \"project was a hoax, a complete fallacy\".\n\nThe earliest internet forum posts suggesting that \"Do It\" was based on \"Acidjazzed Evening\" date back to July 2006, and according to the Finnish news portal eDome, \"Suni and other demoscene hobbyists\" already knew about it at this time.\n\nOne of the first large media to react to the on-line controversy was the Finnish Broadcasting Company, which published a news item on the topic on January 14, 2007.\n\nThe electronic music magazine Side-Line put a complete news round-up up on its website. Finnish tabloids Ilta-Sanomat, Iltalehti, and newspapers ITviikko, and DigiToday also published articles about the suspected plagiarism on January 15, 2007.\n\nOn January 16, Finnish news portal eDome published an article about the case saying in the English summary that:\n\nThe article also covered similar cases from the past and notified that both the competition and the prize ceremony \"were witnessed by the 4000-5000 people at the event. The competition and the ceremony were also shown in Helsinki area cable TV\". The same day, the news reached Norwegian media, including Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and Dagbladet, both of which interviewed Gallefoss.\n\nOn January 17, the case was reported on briefly by the \"Rolling Stone\" website, \"XXL Magazine\",\nand the popular German IT news portal Heise online. Heise's story suggests that Timbaland downloaded Gallefoss's SID arrangement from the High Voltage SID Collection.\n\nOn January 18, \"Rolling Stone\" put the controversy as top news of the day with a more detailed article. Later that day the \"San Jose Mercury News\" covered the story in their blog\n\nOn January 22, MTV took notice of the issue with a longer article and according video-news. It is not clear if this video news was actually broadcast or merely posted online. MTV-owned sister station VH-1 also published the MTV news story. MTV had apparently tried to reach Timbaland's representatives via phone and e-mail, but they \"had not responded at press time\".\n\n\n"}

Takara Tomy previously produced \"Madan Senki Ryukendo\", but \"Ryukendo\" was not based on a pre-existing set of toys for the company. However, it made reference to the Earth Federation which the UFDA is a branch of, its main cast making a cameo in the \"Rescue Force\" movie. Although airing on different days, the Tomica Hero Series served as competition to TV Asahi and Toei Company's Super Sentai and Kamen Rider Series and Tsuburaya Productions' Ultra Series. Only two series were made with the Tomica Hero story, which concluded with a stage show featuring members of the \"Rescue Force\" cast.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2222324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2222324", "title": "Visual gag", "text": "Visual gag\n\nIn comedy, a visual gag or sight gag is anything which conveys its humour visually, often without words being used at all. The gag may involve a physical impossibility or an unexpected occurrence. The humor is caused by alternative interpretations of the goings-on. Visual gags are used in magic, plays, and acting on television or movies.\n\nThe most common type of visual gag is based on multiple interpretations of a series of events. This type is used in the 1935 Alfred Hitchcock film \"The 39 Steps\". Lead actor Robert Donat was kidnapping actress Madeleine Carroll and they were handcuffed. When they checked into an inn, the innkeeper assumed that they were passionate lovers because of the handcuffs. The film used dialogue that could be interpreted both ways.\n\nAnother visual gag is a switched image, often at the beginning of a film. A subsequent view of the scene shows something not viewed before. Switched movement may be the gag, such as Charlie Chaplin in \"The Pawnshop\". Chaplin fights with his coworker and punches at him once. Their boss walks in mid-swing and Chaplin changes the motion to act like he was dropping to his knees to scrub the floor. \n\nNoel Carroll established the most influential taxonomy of sight gags, breaking down the varieties into six types, two of which are enumerated below.\n\nMutual Interference: The audience is fully aware of the on-screen situation, but a character comically misunderstands\n\nMimed Metaphor: A variety of virtual simile an object may be treated as if it is a different object or be used in an unconventional way, such as acting like a doughnut is a barbell or using a tuba as an umbrella holder.\n\nThere are numerous examples in cinema history of directors who based most of the humor in their films on visual gags, even to the point of using no or minimal dialogue. Visual gags began in live theater. The first known use of a visual gag in a film was in the Lumière brothers' 1895 short, \"L'Arroseur Arrosé\" (\"The Waterer Watered\"), in which a gardener watering his plants becomes the subject of a boy's prank. An early pioneer in visual gags was Georges Méliès. The filmmaker experimented with techniques in the then-new film media creating techniques to trick viewers.\n\nVaudeville actors often used gags in their routines. A classic vaudeville visual gag was for two actors to mirror each other's actions around a prop. Visual gags were continued into silent films and are considered a hallmark of the genre. In silent films, the actors in the mirror bit performed in silence with no music playing. Comedians including Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and the Marx Brothers often used visual humour because the technology used to record voices in film (and play it back in a synchronized presentation) did not yet exist. Often the differences between people are part of the comic duos, especially thin and fat actors are used such as Abbott and Costello and Laurel and Hardy.\n\n\"The New York Times\" cites the fourth \"Gilligan's Island\" episode, \"Goodnight, Sweet Skipper\", as a classic American sight gag. The castaways were trying to contact civilization with a radio. In the episode, Skipper can recall only how he converted the radio into a transmitter in World War II when he was sleepwalking. After Skipper was unsuccessful, Gilligan got it to work by pounding on the radio; he used it to briefly contact a pilot flying overhead. Gilligan retrieved Skipper and demonstrated how he pounded on the radio, causing the guts of the radio to fall out. Their rescue was foiled.\n\n"}

For example, costumes, sets and musical accompaniment may be excluded, or may be included in a simpler form.\n\nOne common purpose of a workshop production is to provide a preview staging of a new work in order to gauge audience and critical reaction, following which some parts of the work may be adjusted or rewritten before the work's official premiere. Because a workshop production generally pays less for the rights to perform the play, workshop productions also provide an opportunity for smaller theatres to generate increased publicity by staging a popular or highly anticipated work for which a full production might be too costly. Some theatre companies, in fact, specialize exclusively in workshop productions; amateur and youth theatre companies, for example, are commonly structured on the workshop production model.\n\nSome fictional works, including the musical \"A Chorus Line\" and the television series \"Smash\", depict the audition and workshop processes of developmental theatrical productions.\n"}
