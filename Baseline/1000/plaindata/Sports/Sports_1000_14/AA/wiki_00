{"id": "950082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=950082", "title": "Athletic director", "text": "Athletic director\n\nAn athletic director (commonly \"athletics director\" or \"AD\") is an administrator at many clubs or institutions, like colleges and universities, as well as in larger high schools and middle schools, who oversees the work of coaches and related staff involved in athletic programs.\n\nModern athletic directors are often in a precarious position, especially at the larger institutions. Although technically in charge of all of the coaches, they are often far less well-compensated and also less famous, with few having their own television and radio programs as many coaches now do. In attempting to deal with misconduct by coaches, they often find their efforts trumped by a coach's powerful connections, particularly if he is an established figure with a long-term winning record. However, in the case of severe coaching misconduct being proven, often the athletic director will be terminated along with the offending coach.\n\nOver the last several years, the role of an athletic director has changed dramatically. Before, the athletic department was overseen by one of the school's head coaches. Now, the position attracts executives inside and outside the sports industry. Athletic directors can negotiate multimillion-dollar media deals and can manage powerful coaches who are usually the highest paid employees in the state. Based on the division and the school's athletic needs, athletic directors can also be in charge of scheduling games and events, monitoring a team's players and making sure coaches, players and anyone who is heavily involved with the department are complying with all of the sports agency's regulations. A bachelor's degree is required for all divisions and a masters degree is preferred by larger schools. These degrees normally consist of sports management, psychology, physical education and business management. The top athletic directors in high school have an average salary ranging from $58,400 to $87,000. In 2013, the highest paid athletic director at the NCAA Division I level was David Williams of Vanderbilt who was paid $3,239,678. However, Williams' salary is not directly comparable to that of other Division I athletic directors because of Vanderbilt's unique administrative structure for varsity athletics. Unlike all other Division I schools, Vanderbilt athletics are not administered by a separate athletic department, but instead are governed directly by the university (specifically within its Division for Student Life). Effectively, Vanderbilt athletics are treated as any other student organization. Williams' athletic duties are part of his position as Vanderbilt's vice president for student life.\n\nFormerly, especially at major football-playing institutions, particularly in the South, the head football coach was also the \"AD\". Among the coaches to hold simultaneously hold the AD position were Bear Bryant (Texas A&M and Alabama), Ray Perkins (Alabama), Frank Broyles (Arkansas), Pat Dye (Auburn), Ray Graves (Florida), Wally Butts (Georgia), Vince Dooley (Georgia), Charles Shira (Mississippi State), Bud Wilkinson (Oklahoma), Robert Neyland (Tennessee), Darrell Royal (Texas) and Emory Bellard (Texas A&M).\n\nBroyles retired as Arkansas football coach in 1976, but remained as Razorbacks athletic director through 2007. Dooley retired as Georgia football coach in 1988, but remained as athletic director well into the 2000s.\n\nLSU was one of the exceptions to the rule in the south. Football coach Charles McClendon nearly bolted for Texas A&M when he was offered the combined position of football coach and athletic director by the Aggies in January 1972, but remained in Baton Rouge after successful lobbying by LSU athletic director Carl Maddox and Louisiana Governor John McKeithen.\n\nKentucky always kept its coaching and athletic director positions separate, even during the period (1946–53) when Bear Bryant coached football and Adolph Rupp coached men's basketball. Even though Bryant and Rupp were technically equals under athletic director Bernie Shively, Bryant chafed under the impression he was far less powerful and far less revered than Rupp, a main factor in his departure from Lexington.\n\nThis was usually done in a nominal sense, giving the coach additional prestige, additional pay, and the knowledge that the only supervision that he was under was that of the college president or chancellor and perhaps an athletics committee, and such supervision was often token. An associate athletics director actually performed the functions of athletic director on a daily basis in the name of the coach. At a few institutions where basketball was the predominant sport the head men's basketball coach was treated similarly. In recent decades, this system has been almost entirely abandoned; collegiate sports, especially in its compliance aspects, has become far too complicated an undertaking to be run on a part-time basis. The last football coach to hold both positions at a major university was Derek Dooley at Louisiana Tech before leaving to become head coach at Tennessee after the 2009 season.\n\nPaul Dietzel (LSU) and Tom Osborne (Nebraska) coached the football teams at their respective schools to national championships and later came back as athletic director after working elsewhere. Dietzel left LSU following the 1961 football season and coached at Army and South Carolina before returning to LSU as AD in 1978. Osborne served three terms in the United States House of Representatives after coaching the Cornhuskers from 1973 through 1997; he returned to Nebraska as AD in 2007.\n\nJohnny Vaught, who coached Ole Miss to a share of the 1960 national championship, was not the Rebels' athletic director during his original 24-year tenure (1947-70) as football coach, but was re-hired as coach and also given the duties of athletic director three games into the 1973 season. Vaught stepped down as football coach at the end of the 1973 season, but remained as athletic director until 1978. \n\nAdditionally, most of the old-line coaches who demanded such total control as a condition of employment have since either retired (or in Dooley's case, forced out) or died (Bryant died four weeks after coaching his final football game at Alabama), leaving in place a new generation who are not desirous of such an arrangement, if it were to be made available, and additionally have developed other sources of income, such as shoe contracts and radio and television appearance fees and endorsement contracts, that make the income which might come from the additional duty of athletic director unnecessary.\n\nIncreasingly, college athletic directors are less likely to be retired or active coaches with physical education or sports administration degrees and more likely to be persons who majored in business administration or a related field. The budget for a major athletic department of a large American university is now routinely at the level of tens of millions of dollars; such enterprises demand professional management. Athletic directors have their own professional organization in the U.S., the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics.\n\nOther individuals may be referred to as athletic directors. As mentioned above, many U.S. high schools have someone who performs this duty at least on a part-time basis, usually in conjunction with another coaching or administrative position; some school districts have a full-time director of athletics. Additionally, corporations which sponsor recreational or competitive sports may employ an athletic director.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "968099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=968099", "title": "Baseball field", "text": "Baseball field\n\nA baseball field, also called a ball field, sandlot or a baseball diamond, is the field upon which the game of baseball is played. The term can also be used as a metonym for a baseball park.\n\nThe starting point for much of the action on the field is home plate (officially \"home base\"), which is a five-sided slab of whitened rubber, square with two of the corners removed so that one edge is 17 inches long, two adjacent sides are and the remaining two sides are and set at an angle to make a point. The plate is set into the ground such that its surface is level with the surrounding ground. Adjacent to each of the two parallel 8.5-inch sides is a batter's box. The point of home plate where the two 12-inch sides meet at right angles is at one corner of a square. The other three corners of the square, in counterclockwise order from home plate, are called first, second, and third base. Three canvas or rubber bases square and in thickness made of soft material mark the three bases.\n\nNear the center of the square is an artificial hill known as the pitcher's mound, atop which is a white rubber slab known as the pitcher's plate, colloquially the \"rubber.\" The specifications for the pitcher's mound are described below.\n\nAll the bases, including home plate, lie entirely within fair territory. Thus, any batted ball that touches those bases must necessarily be in fair territory. While the first and third base bags are placed so that they lie inside the 90-foot square formed by the bases, the second base bag is placed so that its center (unlike first, third and home) coincides exactly with the \"point\" of the ninety-foot square. Thus, although the \"points\" of the bases are 90 feet apart, the physical distance between each successive pair of base markers is closer to .\n\nThe lines from home plate to first and third bases extend to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction and are called the foul lines. The portion of the playing field between (and including) the foul lines is fair territory; the rest is \"foul territory.\" The area within the square formed by the bases is officially called the infield, though colloquially this term also includes fair territory in the vicinity of the square; fair territory outside the infield is known as the outfield. Most baseball fields are enclosed with a fence that marks the outer edge of the outfield. The fence is usually set at a distance ranging from from home plate. Most professional and college baseball fields have a right and left foul pole. These poles are at the intersection of the foul lines and the respective ends of the outfield fence and, unless otherwise specified within the ground rules, lie in fair territory. Thus, a batted ball that passes over the outfield wall in flight and touches the foul pole is a fair ball and the batter is awarded a home run.\n\nFirst base is the first of four bases that must be touched by a player on the batting team in order to score a run. Unlike when an offensive player reaches second or third base, it is permissible for a batter-runner to overrun first base without being in jeopardy of being put out. After contact is made with the base, the batter-runner may slow down and return to first base at his leisure, so long as he makes no move or attempt to advance to second base.\n\nThe first baseman is the defensive player responsible for the area near first base. A professional first baseman is often a slow runner and tall. A tall first baseman presents a large target to which other fielders can throw, and his height gives him a larger range in reaching and catching errant throws. Players who are left-handed are marginally preferable for first base because: first, it is easier for a left-handed fielder to catch a pick-off throw from the pitcher and tag the baserunner; and, second, it is easier for a left handed thrower to make the throw to second base to start a 3–6–3, 3–6–4, or a 3–6–1 double play. Also, a right-handed first baseman must, when setting himself up to receive a throw from an infielder, execute a half-pivot near the base; this is a move that a left-hander need not make (this advantage is very marginal, however). There are three infield positions that can only effectively be occupied by right-handed players: 2nd base, 3rd base, and shortstop. This is because of the time it takes to pivot and set to throw. It takes a left-handed thrower more time to make that pivot and in the fast-paced major league game, that time is critical. As a result, there are fewer positions a left-handed player can occupy, and if that player is not fast, the outfield may not be a good fit.\n\nIn the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.\n\nSecond base is the second of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a base runner in order to score a run for that player's team. Second base is typically defended by the second baseman and the shortstop. Second base is also known as the keystone sack. A runner on second base is said to be in \"scoring position,\" owing to the high likelihood of reaching home plate and scoring a run from second base on most base hits. Since second is the farthest base from home plate, it is the most common target of base stealing.\n\nIdeally, the second baseman and shortstop possess quick hands and feet and the ability to release the ball rapidly and with accuracy. One will usually cover second base when the other attempts to field the ball. Both players must communicate well to be able to make a double play. Particular agility is required of the second baseman in double play situations, which usually forces the player to throw towards first while his momentum carries him in the opposite direction. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4, and the shortstop 6.\n\nThird base is the third of four bases a base runner must touch in a counterclockwise succession in order to score a run. Many batted balls that result in the batter being put out (such as a sacrifice fly) may nevertheless allow a runner to reach home plate and score a run from third base, provided that the third and final out is not recorded before he can do so. A runner on third base is therefore particularly valuable to the batting team when fewer than two outs have been recorded.\n\nThe third baseman is the defensive player whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base. A third baseman ideally possesses quick reaction to batted balls and a strong arm to make the long throw to first base. The distance from 3rd to 1st is about . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number 5.\n\nHome plate, formally designated home base in the rules, is the final base that a player must touch to score. Unlike the other bases, home plate is a five-sided slab of whitened rubber that is set at ground level. The use of rubber was developed by Robert Keating, who pitched one game for the 1887 Baltimore Orioles. Previously the plate was made of stone, iron, or wood.\n\nThe dimensions of home plate are across the front, down each side, with a triangular rear of two sides of . The rear edges are at 45 degrees to the sides, making a point at the back. The plate is white and surrounded by a black strip in width. The plate sits entirely in \"fair\" territory, with the two rear edges aligned with the right and left field foul lines. The length and angle requirements for home plate mandate that it is not a regular pentagon; it is a 17 by 8.5 inches rectangle with an isosceles triangle of base 17 inches and equal sides of 12 inches attached to the back.\n\nThe batter's box is the place where the batter stands when ready to receive a pitch from the pitcher. It is usually drawn in chalk on the dirt surrounding home plate, and the insides of the boxes are watered down before each game.\n\nThe chalk lines delineating the two foul lines are rarely extended through the batter's boxes. However, those lines exist conceptually for the purpose of judging a batted ball fair or foul. In addition, inside edges of the batter's boxes are often not laid-in with chalk. Similarly, though not marked, those lines continue to exist for the purpose of the rules pertaining to the batter's box and the batter's position relative thereto.\n\nThere are two batter's boxes, one on each side of home plate. The batter's boxes are wide and long. The batter's boxes are centered lengthwise at the center of home plate with the inside line of each batter's box from the near edge of home plate. A right-handed batter would stand in the batter's box on the left side of home plate from the perspective of the catcher and umpire. A left-handed batter would stand in the batter's box to their right. A batter may only occupy one batter's box at a time and may not legally leave the batter's box after the pitcher has come set or has started his windup. Should the batter wish to leave the batter's box once the pitcher has engaged the rubber, he must first ask the umpire for time-out. Time will not be granted if the pitcher has already started his pitching motion. For playing rules relating to the batter's box, see Rules 6.05 and 6.06 of the Official Baseball Rules.\n\nFoul poles, if present, help umpires judge whether a fly ball hit above the fence line is foul (out of play) or fair (a home run). The poles are a vertical extension of the foul lines at the edge of the field of play. The outer edge of the foul lines and foul poles define foul territory. Both the lines and the poles are in fair territory, in contrast to American football and basketball, where the lines marking the playing boundaries are out of bounds. The minimum distance to hit a home run (along either foul line) is set by baseball rules, generally at .\n\nBefore 1920, the foul lines extended indefinitely; a batter was awarded a home run only if a fly ball out of the field was fair where it landed, or \"when last seen\" by the umpire. Now, a batted ball that leaves the field in flight is judged fair or foul at the point it leaves the field. Thus, such a fly ball passing on the fair side of a foul pole, or hitting a foul pole, is a home run regardless of where the ball goes thereafter.\n\nFoul poles are typically much higher than the top of the outfield fence or wall, and often have a narrow screen running along the fair side of the pole. This further aids the umpires' judgment, as a ball that bounces off this screen is a home run. It can still be a difficult call, especially in ballparks with no outfield stands behind the poles to provide perspective. Wrigley Field is notorious for arguments over long, curving flies down a foul line (most notably in left field) that sail higher than the foul pole.\n\nAt Major League Baseball fields, foul poles are usually yellow. Those at Citi Field are orange. At the Rogers Centre, there are no foul poles, but large nets suspended from the roof that serve the same purpose. At Petco Park, there is no foul pole in left field; the pole's function is served by a yellow metal strip along the corner of the Western Metal Supply Co. building.\n\nIn roughly the middle of the square, equidistant between first and third base, and a few feet closer to home plate than to second base, is a low artificial hill called the pitcher's mound. This is where the pitcher stands when throwing the pitch. Atop the mound is a white rubber slab, called the pitcher's plate or pitcher's rubber. It measures front-to-back and across, the front of which is exactly from the rear point of home plate. This peculiar distance was set by the rule makers in 1893, not due to a clerical or surveying error as popular myth has it, but intentionally (further details under \"History\").\n\nIn Major League Baseball, a regulation mound is in diameter, with the center from the rear point of home plate, on the line between home plate and second base. The front edge of the \"pitcher's plate\" or \"rubber\" is behind the center of the mound, making the front edge's midpoint 60 feet 6 inches from the rear point of home plate. Six inches (15 cm) in front of the pitcher's rubber the mound begins to slope downward. The top of the rubber is to be no higher than ten inches (25 cm) above home plate. From 1903 through 1968, this height limit was set at , but was often slightly higher, sometimes as high as , especially for teams that emphasized pitching, such as the Los Angeles Dodgers, who were reputed to have the highest mound in the majors.\n\nA pitcher will push off the rubber with his foot in order to gain velocity toward home plate when pitching. In addition, a higher mound generally favors the pitcher. With the height advantage, the pitcher gains more leverage and can put more downward velocity on the ball, making it more difficult for the batter to strike the ball squarely with the bat. The lowering of the mound in 1969 was intended to \"increase the batting\" once again, as pitching had become increasingly dominant, reaching its peak the prior year; 1968 is known among baseball historians as \"The Year of the Pitcher.\" This restrictive rule apparently did its job, contributing to the hitting surge of modern baseball.\n\nA pitcher's mound is difficult for groundskeepers to maintain. Usually before every game it is watered down to keep the dust from spreading. On youth and amateur baseball fields, the mound may be much different from the rule book definition due to erosion and repair attempts. Even in the major leagues, each mound gains its own character, as pitchers are allowed to kick away pieces of dirt in their way, thereby sculpting the mound a bit to their preference.\n\nThe pitcher may keep a rosin bag on the rear of the mound to dry off his hands. Major League Baseball teams are also permitted cleat cleaners on the back of the mound. This may be a flat grate-style plate, or simply a hand tool such as a piece of wood used to remove mud and dirt from cleats. These items are allowed to remain on the backside of the mound at the discretion of the umpire, thus reducing the probability that they will affect a live play.\n\nA baseline is the straight line between two adjacent bases. Baselines are not drawn on the field, although the foul lines serve to mark the baseline between home plate and first base, and between third base and home.\n\nGenerally, base runners are not required to follow the baseline. A base runner seeking to advance more than one base typically \"rounds\" the base, following a more circular path. However, a base runner's left-right motion is constrained when the defense tries to tag him. At the moment the defense begins the attempt, the baserunner's running baseline is established as a direct line from his current position to the base he is trying for. A runner straying more than away from this baseline to avoid a tag may be called out.\n\nBeginning halfway between home and first base, and ending at first base, there is a second chalk line to the right of the foul line. This second line and the part of the foul line it runs parallel to, form the running lane that defines the path in which a batter-runner must run as he is advancing to first base. Rule 6.05(k) of the Official Baseball Rules states that, if a batter-runner running to first base runs outside the running lane, and \"in doing so\" interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first, then the batter-runner is automatically out. First base itself is not located in the running lane, but Rule 6.05 lets the batter-runner leave the running lane \"by means of a step, stride or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base\" to step on first base.\n\n The grass line, where the dirt of the infield ends and the grass of the outfield begins, has no special significance to the rules of the game, but it can influence the outcome of a game. Dirt running paths between the bases (and, at one time and still in some parks, between the pitcher and the catcher) have existed since the beginning of the game, although they were not mentioned in the rule books until around 1950, and their specifications are flexible. In addition to providing a running path, the grass lines act as a visual aid so that players, umpires and fans may better judge distance from the center of the diamond. Occasionally the ball may take a tricky bounce off the dirt area or the edge between the dirt and the grass. Multiple World Series championships (including 1924, 1960 and 1986) have been decided or heavily influenced by erratic hops of ground balls.\n\nIn artificial turf stadiums, infield dirt was originally only placed around the bases and around the pitcher's and batting areas, which are referred to as \"sliding pits.\" In this configuration, the \"grass line\" is usually designated with a white arc. Among Major League Baseball fields, Rogers Centre was the last stadium to maintain this type of configuration and was reconfigured with a full dirt infield starting in the 2016 MLB season.\n\nIn some college baseball parks with artificial turf fields, the entire field (along with possibly the pitcher's mound) is made up of turf, with parts of the field mainly containing dirt instead merely being clay-colored turf.\n\nThe outfield is made from thick grass or artificial turf. It is where the outfielders play. The positions to play in the outfield are right, center, and left field (named in relation to the batter's position; thus left field is beyond third base and right field is beyond first base). Outfields vary in size and shape depending on the overall size and shape of the playing field. The outfield stretches from the infield to the outfield wall and it contains the warning track. Outfields especially vary from Little League to Major League fields. Little League outfields vary more in size than Major League outfields. Outfields often differ from infields in the specific type of grass used, but most Major League outfields are grass.\n\nThe warning track is the strip of dirt at the edges of the baseball field (especially in front of the home run fence and along the left and right sides of a field). Because the warning track's color and feel differ from the grass field, a fielder can remain focused on a fly ball near the fence and measure his proximity to the fence while attempting to catch the ball safely.\n\nA warning track's width is not specified in the rules. It is generally designed to give about three steps of warning to the highest-level players using the field. Typical widths run from about six feet for Little League fields to about for college- or professional-level play. A warning track this wide also lets groundskeepers avoid driving maintenance vehicles on the grass.\n\nThe track can be composed of finely ground rock particles such as cinders, which is why announcer Bob Wolff called it the \"cinder path\" rather than the \"warning track.\"\n\nThe idea of a warning track originated in Yankee Stadium, where an actual running track was built for use in track and field events. When ballpark designers saw how the track helped fielders, it soon became a feature of every ballpark.\n\nSingle-minded fielders often crash into a wall trying to make a catch despite the warning track. For this reason, outfield walls are typically padded for extra safety. Wrigley Field's brick wall is covered only by ivy, which is not especially soft. However, there are pads on the walls of the tight left and right field corners in foul ground.\n\n\"Warning-track power\" is a derogatory term for a batter who seems to have just enough power to hit the ball to the warning track for an out, but not enough to hit a home run. The term more generally refers to someone or something that is almost but not quite good enough for something.\n\nThe outfield wall or outfield fence is the wall or fence that marks the outer boundary of the outfield. A ball passing over the wall is dead; if it passes over the wall in fair territory while in flight, it is a home run. The official rules do not specify the shape, height, or composition of the wall, or a specific mandatory distance from home plate (though Major League Baseball mandates a minimum distance of and recommends a minimum distance of at the foul poles and at center field). As a result, baseball fields can vary greatly along those lines. The wall has numbers affixed or painted on it that denote the distance from that point on the wall to home plate. In most modern major league ballparks, the wall is made of some hard material (e.g., concrete, plywood, sheet metal) with padding on the field side to protect players who may collide with the wall at high speed while trying to make a play. Chain link fencing may also be incorporated into the wall in areas where the wall needs to be transparent, e.g., an outfield bullpen, a spectator area behind the wall, or to protect a scoreboard incorporated into the wall. Many ballparks feature a yellow line denoting the top of the wall to aid umpires in judging whether the ball passed over the wall or if the ball is fair or foul.\n\nThe bullpen (sometimes referred to as simply \"the 'pen\") is the area where pitchers warm up before entering a game. Depending on the ballpark, it may be situated in foul territory along the baselines or just beyond the outfield fence. Relief pitchers usually wait in the bullpen when they have yet to play in a game, rather than in the dugout with the rest of the team. The starting pitcher also makes his final pregame warmups in the bullpen. Managers can call coaches in the bullpen on an in-house telephone from the dugout to tell a certain pitcher to begin his warmup tosses.\n\"Bullpen\" is also used metonymically to describe a team's collection of relief pitchers.\n\nThere are two on-deck circles in the field, one for each team, positioned in foul ground between home plate and the respective teams' benches. They are technically known as next-batter's boxes. The on-deck circle is where the next scheduled batter, or \"on-deck\" batter, warms up while waiting for the current batter to finish his turn. The on-deck circle is either an area composed of bare dirt; a plain circle painted onto artificial turf; or often, especially at the professional level, a mat made from artificial material, with the team or league logo painted onto it.\n\nThe coach's boxes, located behind first and third base, are where the first and third base coaches are supposed to stand, although coaches often stand outside the box. This is permissible as long as the coach does not interfere with play and the opposing team does not object (in which case the umpire shall ensure that all coaches on both teams must abide by the boundaries of the coach's boxes). The coach's boxes are marked with chalk or paint. In the early days of baseball, the term \"coacher's box\" was used, as \"coach\" was taken to be a verb. As the term \"coach\" evolved into a noun, the name of the box also changed.\n\nThe basic layout of the diamond has been little changed since the original Knickerbocker Rules of the 1840s. The distance between bases was already established as , which it remains. Through trial and error, 90 feet had been settled upon as the optimal distance. 100 feet would have given too much advantage to the defense, and 80 feet too much to the offense.\n\nThe original Knickerbocker Rules did not specify the pitching distance explicitly. By the time major league baseball began in the 1870s, the pitcher was compelled to pitch from within a \"box\" whose front edge was from the \"point\" of home plate. Although he had to release the ball before crossing the line, as with bowlers in cricket, he also had to start his delivery from within the box; he could not run in from the field as bowlers do. Furthermore, the pitcher had to throw underhand. By the 1880s, pitchers had mastered the underhand delivery—in fact, in 1880, there were two perfect games within a week of each other.\n\nIn an attempt to \"increase the batting,\" the front edge of the pitcher's box was moved back 5 feet in 1881, to from home plate. The size of the box was altered over the following few years. Pitchers were allowed to throw overhand starting in 1884, and that tilted the balance of power again. In 1887, the box was set at wide and deep, with the front edge still 50 feet from the plate. However, the pitcher was compelled to deliver the ball with his back foot at the line of the box, thus somewhat restricting his ability to \"power\" the ball with his overhand delivery.\n\nIn 1893, the box was replaced by the pitcher's plate, although \"the box\" is still used today as a slang term for the pitcher's location on the field. Exactly 5 feet was added to the point the pitcher had to toe, again \"to increase the batting\" (and hopefully to increase attendance, as fan interest had flagged somewhat), resulting in the seemingly peculiar pitching distance of .\n\nMany sources suggest that the pitching distance evolved from 45 to 50 to 60.5 feet. However, the first two were the \"release point\" and the third is the \"pushoff point,\" so the 1893 increase was not quite as dramatic as is often implied; that is, the 1893 rule change added only 5 feet to the release point, not 10.5 feet.\n\nOriginally the pitcher threw from flat ground, but over time the raised mound was developed, somewhat returning the advantage to the pitchers. Before the mid-20th century, it was common for baseball fields to include a dirt pathway between the pitcher's mound and home plate. This feature is sometimes known as the \"keyhole\" due to the shape that it makes together with the mound. The keyhole was once as wide as the pitcher's box and resembled a cricket pitch. Sometimes this path extended through the batting area and all the way to the backstop. Once the rounded pitcher's mound was developed, the path became more ornamental than practical, and was gradually thinned before being largely abandoned by the 1950s. In recent years some ballparks, such as Comerica Park and Chase Field in the major leagues, have revived the feature for nostalgic reasons.\n\nThe Sports Turf Managers Association (STMA) presents various awards each year. Starting in 2001, its Sports Turf Manager of the Year Awards have been presented annually in the Triple-A, Double-A, Class A, and Short-Season/Rookie divisions of Minor League Baseball and are chosen from the 16 league winners. STMA also presents the Baseball Field of the Year Award, which includes Schools and Parks, College/University and Professional categories.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "679837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=679837", "title": "Basketball court", "text": "Basketball court\n\nBasketball courts come in different sizes. In the National Basketball Association (NBA), the court is . Under International Basketball Federation (FIBA) rules, the court is minutely smaller, measuring exactly . In amateur basketball, court sizes vary widely. The baskets are always above the floor (except possibly in youth competition). Basketball courts have a three-point arc at both baskets. A basket made from behind this arc is worth three points; a basket made from within this line, or with a player's foot touching the line, is worth 2 points. The free-throw line, where one stands while taking a foul shot, is located within the three-point arc at 15 feet from the basket. A foul shot is worth 1 point, but if a shot is made from the foul line while in play it is still worth 2 points.\n\n† The FIBA three-point line is 2.95 ft (0.90 m) from the sideline in a zone starting at the baseline and ending when it crosses the 22.1 ft (6.75 m) arc. The 21.65 ft (6.60 m) distance exists only at the points on the three-point line that are directly to the left and right of the basket center.\n\nThe only two players permitted to enter this area prior to the tipoff are the players contesting the jump ball (usually but not always centers). Both players jump when the referee throws the ball in the air, each attempting to tap the ball into the hands of a player of their own team.\n\nThe three-point line is the line that separates the two-point area from the three-point area; any shot converted beyond this line counts as three points. If the shooting player steps on the line, it is counted as two points. Any foul made in the act of shooting beyond the three-point line would give the player three free throws if the shot does not go in, and one if it does.\n\nThe distance to the three-point line from the center of the basket varies depending on the level or league, and has changed several times. These are the current distances, with the league or level using each distance:\n\n\nThe NBA adopted the three-point line at the start of the 1979–80 season. This is of variable distance, ranging from in the corners to behind the top of the key. During the 1994–95, 1995–96 and 1996–97 seasons, the NBA attempted to address decreased scoring by shortening the overall distance of the line to a uniform around the basket. It was moved back to its original distance after the 1996–97 season. FIBA and the NCAA both adopted the three-point line in 1985.\n\nIn most high school associations in the United States, the distance is 19.75 feet. This was formerly the distance for college basketball as well. On May 26, 2007, the NCAA playing rules committee agreed to move the three-point line back one foot to 20.75 feet for the men. This rule went into effect for the 2008–2009 season. The three-point line for women (NCAA) moved back one foot to 20.75 feet at the start of the 2011–2012 season.\n\nThe international distance, used in most countries outside the United States and in FIBA and WNBA competition, is currently 6.6 m (21.65 ft) to 6.75 m (22.15 ft).\n\nThe perimeter is defined as the areas outside the free throw lane and inside the three-point line. Shots converted (successfully made) from this area are called \"perimeter shots\" or \"medium-range shots.\"\nIf a player's foot is on the three-point line, the shot is considered a perimeter shot.\n\nThe low post is defined as the areas that are closest to the basket but outside of the free throw lane. This area is fundamental to strategy in basketball. Skilled low post players can score many points per game without ever taking a jump shot.\n\nThe key, free throw lane or shaded lane refers to the usually painted area beneath the basket; for the NBA it is wide, for the NCAA it is wide; for both instances it extends from the backboard. At the top of the rectangle is the free throw line, behind which players shoot uncontested shots when they're fouled. A circle is drawn around the free-throw line with a radius; this is used for jump ball instances, as is done at the center circle. Two 6-inch hash lines, 3 ft from the free throw lane line and 5 ft 8 in from the free throw line, show the lower defensive box linked to the restricted area.\n\nFor FIBA tournaments, since October 2010 the key has been a rectangle 4.9 m wide and 5.8 m long. Previously it was a trapezoid 3.7 meters (12 ft) wide at the free-throw line and 6 meters (19 feet and 6.25 inches) at the end line.\n\nThe key is primarily used to prevent players from staying beneath the basket of the opponents' team for long periods (maximum three seconds).\n\nThe restricted area arc is a semi-circular arc drawn around the area directly underneath the basket. With some exceptions, members of the defending team cannot draw charging fouls in this area.\nThe restricted arc in all North American rule sets above high school level (NCAA men's and women's, NBA, and WNBA) has a radius 4 feet (1.22 m) from below the center of the basket. The restricted area arc rule first appeared at any level of basketball in the NBA in the 1997-98 season. The NCAA restricted area arc was originally established for the 2011–12 men's and women's seasons at a radius from below the center of the basket, and was extended to match the (W)NBA radius for the 2015–16 season and beyond.\n\nOn NBA floors, two hash marks are drawn at the end lines near the key to mark the area known as the lower defensive box. A defensive player is allowed to draw a charging foul within the restricted arc if the offensive player receives the ball and/or starts his drive within this area.\n\nAlso, two lines are drawn on each of the sidelines, 28 feet from each of the endlines, which designates the extent of the coaching box and bench. This line marks the farthest extent a coach (aside from the sidelines) can stand. Directly behind this area is the team bench.\n\nOn the half-court line of NBA floors two lines extend outside the playing court, designating the place where substitutes wait before they can enter the playing court; directly behind this area are the various off-court officials such as the timekeeper and reserve referee.\n\nOn April 26, 2008, FIBA announced several major rules changes involving the court markings. These changes took effect for major international competitions on October 1, 2010, after that year's World Championships for men and women, and became mandatory for other competitions on October 1, 2012 (although national federations could adopt the new markings before 2012). The changes were as follows.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36807165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36807165", "title": "Boosting (doping)", "text": "Boosting (doping)\n\nBoosting is a method of inducing autonomic dysreflexia with the intention of enhancing performance in sport. It can be used by an athlete with a spinal cord injury to increase their blood pressure and is performed by causing a painful stimulus in the lower part of the body. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) banned the practice in 1994, but many competitors with spinal injuries are still thought to be using it as a performance enhancer.\n\nAthletes with spinal injuries can have difficulties with autonomic functions and their bodies may be unable to control blood pressure and heart rate. Because of this their bodies do not adapt to the increased demand of physical activity. Without these changes the athlete can become fatigued and suffer from a lower level of endurance. Boosting works by tricking the body into a state of high blood pressure and heart rate, with an increased utilization of oxygen improving the athlete's performance.\n\nAthletes who perform boosting before or during an event will often self-harm with some taking extreme measures to achieve the desired boost level. Techniques include:\n\nBoosting has been shown in simulated races to give noticeable improvements in the performance of wheelchair marathon athletes. In the 1994 study the athletes attained an average 9.7 percent improvement after their bladder had been over-distended or after sitting in the racing chair for 1–2 hours prior to competing. It is believed to be capable of enhancing performance by up to 15 percent.\n\nThere are many possible side effects of boosting, including the occurrence of a cerebrovascular or cardiovascular event such as a stroke or heart attack. Other complications include:\n\nThe IPC conducted a survey during the 2008 Games with 99 responses. 16.7 percent of the participants indicated that they had tried boosting in training or during a competition, with more than half of them being competitors in wheelchair rugby. The use of boosting continues in athletes but is very difficult to detect. During the Games 20 athletes were tested just before their event for evidence of boosting but there were no positive results.\n\nThe IPC made boosting illegal in 1994. Their handbook states in Chapter 4.3:\nAn athlete with a systolic blood pressure of 180mm Hg or above will be re-examined approximately ten minutes after the first examination. If on the second examination the systolic blood pressure remains above 180mm Hg the person in charge of the examination shall inform the Technical Delegate to withdraw the athlete from the particular competition in question.\n\nAny deliberate attempt to induce Autonomic Dysreflexia is forbidden and will be reported to the Technical Delegate. The athlete will be disqualified from the particular competition regardless of the systolic blood pressure.\n\n"}

The fanfare consists of six notes followed by rooters shouting, \"Charge!\" Occasionally, the fanfare is repeated one or more times in the same key or in successively higher keys, or is preceded by a lead-in vamp.\n\nIn 1958 the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles and in the spring of 1959 the Dodgers put on sale, at $1.50 apiece, 20,000 toy trumpets capable of playing the six notes of the \"Charge\" fanfare. The fanfare was heard in NBC broadcasts of games 3, 4 and 5 of the 1959 World Series between the Dodgers and the Chicago White Sox.\n\nIt also appeared in the original \"The Flintstones\" 1960s television cartoon series (episode dates uncertain), followed by \"Charge!\" or \"Charge it!\", shouted by characters (typically Wilma Flintstone and Betty Rubble) on the way to a shopping spree. Scrappy-Doo, a character that appeared in the 1980s incarnations of the \"Scooby-Doo\" franchise, also regularly used the fanfare as a lead-in to his catchphrase, \"puppy power!\" The fanfare was incorporated into the jingles used on \"Scott Shannon's Rockin American Top 30 Countdown\" which ran from 1984 through 1992. In the first person shooter video game \"Overwatch\", the character Bastion makes a noise similar to this fanfare when it uses its ultimate ability.\n\nBobby Kent, former musical director of the San Diego Chargers, has claimed he invented the \"Charge\" fanfare in 1978 while working for the Chargers. Kent filed suit against ASCAP for negotiating licenses with MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL, NCAA and NASCAR while failing to secure his consent. The Los Angeles Lakers settled with Kent for $3,000. Kent's claim can be disproven by the fact that Frank Leahy, the Chargers' first general manager in 1960, chose the name \"Chargers\" after the already existing fanfare.\n\n"}

{"id": "1655074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1655074", "title": "Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)", "text": "Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)\n\nThe Code of Points is a rulebook that defines the scoring system for each level of competition in gymnastics. There is not a universal international \"Code of Points\", and every oversight organization — such as the FIG (Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique), NCAA Gymnastics, and most national gymnastics federations — designs and employs its own unique \"Code of Points\". \n\nGymnasts competing at lower levels or outside the FIG's jurisdiction (e.g., NCAA gymnastics and local club teams) may not be scored according to the FIG code.\n\nIn 2006, the \"Code of Points\" and the entire gymnastics scoring system were completely overhauled. The change stemmed from the judging controversy at 2004 Olympics in Athens, which brought the reliability and objectivity of the scoring system into question, and arguments that execution had been sacrificed for difficulty in artistic gymnastics. It follows a similarly radical scoring change in figure skating that also was prompted by irregularities in judging at major events.\n\nSince its inception in major events in 2006, the \"Code\" has faced strong opposition from many prominent coaches, athletes and judges. Proponents of the new system believe it is a necessary step in advancing gymnastics, promoting difficult skills and increasing judging objective. Opponents feel that people outside the gymnastics community will not understand the scoring and will lose interest in the sport, and that, without emphasising artistry, the essence of gymnastics will change. Many opponents of the new scoring system feel that this system, in essence, chooses the winners before competition ever begins. Competitors no longer compete on the same level. Each contestant begins with a unique start value; therefore, contestants assigned a lower start value or difficulty rating are knocked out of the winner's circle before the competition begins. They may compete, but they cannot win. A competitor with a higher difficulty rating will begin competition with a higher combined base score. There has been dissent over the fact that the new \"Code\" effectively abolishes the \"perfect 10\" score, for many years one of the hallmarks of gymnastics. There has also been concern that the new \"Code\" strongly favors extreme difficulty over form, execution and consistency. At the 2006 World Championships, for instance, Vanessa Ferrari of Italy was able to controversially win the women's all-around title despite a fall on the balance beam, in part by picking up extra points from performing more high-difficulty skills on floor exercise. The 2006 report of the FIG's Athletes' Commission, drafted after a review and discussion of the year's events noted several areas of concern including numerous inconsistencies in judging and evaluation of skills and routines.\n\nHowever, the leadership of the FIG remains committed to the new \"Code.\" While small revisions have been made to the \"Code,\" there is currently no indication that it will be significantly altered or that there will be a return to the old \"Code\" or 10.0 scoring system. \n\nThe current \"Code of Points\" covers the years 2017 to 2020. Following past editions, there is no top score of 10.0, nor is there an upper limit of the difficulty score. Official men's skills are rated from A to H and women's skills from A to I. \n\nThe \"Table of Elements\" is the section of the \"Code of Points\" which is used to identify, classify and assign value to gymnastics elements. Every acrobatic and dance skill is listed, illustrated and assigned a specific difficulty rating. Currently, difficulty ratings for both the women's and men's code range from A (with assigned numerical value of 0.10; easiest) to I (with assigned numerical value of 0.90; most difficult) for all apparatus except vault. Currently, every vault is assigned a specific points value which range from 2.0 to 7.2. The \"Table of Elements\" is the one aspect of the \"Code\" that did not undergo major changes in the 2006 \"Code\" overhaul.\n\nAs other aspects of the \"Code,\" the \"Table of Elements\" is frequently re-evaluated. Skills listed in the \"Table\" may have their difficulty ratings raised or lowered after evaluation by the FIG Technical Committee. In addition, skills that are determined to be too dangerous to the athletes may be banned outright. The Technical Committee may also give specific hazardous skills artificially low difficulty ratings to deter gymnasts from trying to compete them.\n\nMany of the skills in the \"Table of Elements\" are named after gymnasts. An original element is named after an athlete when he or she is the first person to successfully perform it at a World Championships or Olympics. Gymnasts and their coaches must submit their original skill to the FIG before the meet for evaluation and possible inclusion in the \"Table of Elements\".\n\nTwo panels of judges score every single routine, evaluating different aspects of the performance. The final mark is the combined total of these two scores.\n\nThe D-score (or difficulty score) evaluates the content of the exercise on three criteria: difficulty value (DV), composition requirements (CR) and connection value (CV).\n\n\nAlthough the A judging panel does not take deductions, they may decide not to give gymnasts DV or CR points for elements that are performed with falls. A gymnast may also lose CV credit if there are extra steps or pauses between skills that are meant to be connected.\n\nThe D-score is open-ended; in theory a gymnast could obtain unlimited points by performing connected skills although this was made harder in the 2009-2012 revision of the code when the number of elements that counted towards the D-score was lowered.\n\nThe E-score (or Execution score) evaluates the performance: the execution and artistry of the routine.\n\n\nThe D-score and E-score are added together for the gymnast's final mark.\n\nThis judging system applies to all WAG and MAG events except vault. Vault scoring is somewhat different:\n\n\nAs with other apparatus, the D-score and E-score are added together for the gymnast's final mark.\n\nThere are several acts that completely invalidate the vault and result in a score of 0. These include receiving spotting (assistance) from a coach, going before the signal and not using the U-shaped safety mat for Yurchenko-style vaults.\n\nSkills: Every acrobatic and dance element was awarded a specific difficulty rating, ranging from A (easiest) to I (hardest) in the \"Table of Elements\". Gymnast earned bonus points by performing difficult skills alone or in combination.\n\nRequired elements: Routine composition was decided by the gymnast and his or her coaches, however, on every apparatus except vault there was a list of required elements (similar to the EGR in the new \"Code\") that had to be performed during the routine. Examples of required elements included 360 degree turns on balance beam and a backwards salto (somersault) on floor exercise.\n\nBase score: The base score was the default Start Value of the routine, provided the gymnast fulfilled all required elements. This changed over the years and tended to lower as the codes went on. For instance, for the 1992-1996 code, a base score of 9.4 was awarded if all of the basic elements were fulfilled. For the 1996-2000 code, the base score was a 9.0. Finally, a base score of 8.8 was awarded for the 2000-2004 Olympic years. Before the new code, the base score again dropped to an 8.6 but this was not adopted for a very long time (only 2005-2006).\n\nStart Value: The Start Value (SV) of each routine was determined by adding the base score to the bonus points earned from performing difficult elements and combinations. Ideally, a gymnast wanted to have an SV as close to 10.0 as possible.\n\nOn vault, every vault was assigned a specific Start Value in the \"Code\".\n\nThe score was determined by subtracting any deductions for poor form, execution, steps, falls or other infractions from the SV.\n\n"}

In many combat sports, a contestant wins by scoring more points than the opponent or by disabling the opponent. Common combat sports include mixed martial arts, boxing, wrestling, fencing, savate, kickboxing, Muay Thai, Sanda, Tae Kwon Do, Capoeira, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, HMB, Sambo, Kyokushin, and Kūdō.\n\nTradition styles of wrestling exist in most cultures; wrestling can be considered a cultural universal. Boxing contests date back to ancient Sumer in the 3rd millennium BCE and ancient Egypt \"circa\" 1350 BCE. The ancient Olympic Games included several combat-related sports: armored foot races, boxing, wrestling, and pankration, which was introduced in the Olympic Games of 648 BCE.\n\nIn ancient China, combat sport appeared in the form of lei tai. It was a no-holds barred combat sport that combined boxing and wrestling. There is evidence of similar combat sports in ancient Egypt, India and Japan.\n\nThrough the Middle ages and Renaissance, the tournament was popular. Tournaments were competitions that featured several mock combat events, with jousting as a main event. While the tournament was popular among aristocrats, combat sports were practiced by all levels of society. The German school of late medieval martial arts distinguished sportive combat (\"schimpf\") from serious combat (\"ernst\"). In the German Renaissance, sportive combat competitions were known as Fechtschulen, corresponding to the Prize Playing in Tudor England. Out of these Prize Playing events developed the English boxing (or \"prizefighting\") of the 18th century, which evolved into modern boxing with the introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry rules in 1867.\n\nAmateur boxing has been part of the modern Olympic Games since their introduction in 1904. Professional boxing became popular in the United States in the 1920s and experienced a \"golden age\" after World War II.\n\nThe creation of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is attributed to the Gracie family of Brazil in 1925 after Asian martial arts were introduced to Brazil. Vale-tudo, wrestling, muay thai kickboxing and luta livre gained popularity.\nModern Muay Thai was developed in the 1920s to 1930s. Sambo was introduced in the Soviet Union. Modern Taekwondo also emerged after the Japanese occupation of Korea and became an Olympic sport in 2000. Sanshou as part of modern wushu was developed in the People's Republic of China since the 1950s. Kickboxing and full contact karate were developed in the 1960s and became popular in Japan and the West during the 1980s and 1990s. Modern Mixed Martial Arts developed out of the interconnected subcultures of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and shoot wrestling. It was introduced in Japan in the form of Shooto in 1985, and in the United States as Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in 1993. The Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were introduced in 2000, and the sport experienced peak popularity in the 2000s. During this period, multiple brands and promotions were established. The most well-known promotion for MMA is UFC.\n\nCombat sports are generally more popular among men, both as athletes and as spectators. For many years, participation in combat sports was practically exclusive to men; USA Boxing had a ban on women's boxing until 1993. A study conducted by Greenwell, Hancock, Simmons and Thorn in 2015 revealed that combat sports had a largely male audience. Combat sport promotions such as UFC or Bellator MMA are generally advertised to men.\n\nCombat athletes usually fight one-on-one. Different sports involve different skill sets and moves. For example, boxing only allows punches, taekwondo largely involves kicks, and both Muay Thai and Burmese boxing allow the use of elbows and knees. There are also combat sports based on grappling, such as both freestyle and Collegiate wrestling. Modern MMA is similar to the ancient Greek Olympic sport of pankration; Both allow a wide range of both striking and grappling techniques.\n\nSome combat sports involve the use of weapons and armor, such as fencing, kendo, and the new sport SCA Heavy Combat; In Gatka and Modern Arnis, sticks are used.\n\n\n\nHybrid martial arts, combining striking and grappling elements:\n\n\n\nThe techniques used can be categorized into three domains: striking, grappling, and weapon usage, with some hybrid rule-sets combining striking and grappling. In combat sports the use of these various techniques are highly regulated to minimize permanent or severe physical damage to each participant though means of organized officiating by a single or multiple referees that can distribute penalties or interrupt the actions of the competitors during the competition. In weapon based sports, the weapons used are made to be non-lethal by means of modifying the striking portions of the weapon and requiring participants to wear protective clothing/armor.\n\n\nIn combat sports, victory is obtained from blows, punches or attacks to the head to a point of physical injury that the opponent is unable to continue. Different forms of combat sport have different rules and regulations into the equipment competitors have to wear. In Amateur boxing seen at the Olympics, competitors are permitted to wear head guards and correctly weighted padded gloves, mouth guards are optional and the canvas floor protection from a hard fall. In sports such as Taekwondo, competitors are permitted to wear a trunk protector, head guard, gloves, groin guard and shin and forearm pads. Professional boxing and UFC are two of the most dangerous combat sports in the world due to the lack of protective gear worn. Competitors in these two sports have the option to wear a mouthguard and must wear suitable gloves. The lack of protective clothing makes competitors vulnerable to concussion and further traumatic head injuries. A scientific experiment, conducted last year by Dr Andrew McIntosh of ACRISP at the Federation University of Australia, tested the impact of 7 different head guards in combat sport. The results of the experiment revealed the benefits of the combination of a glove and headguard in maximising the impact energy attenuation. A study conducted by Lystad showed that combat sports with little to no protective gear such as MMA or boxing has an injury incidence rate range of 85.1-280.7 per 1000 athletes in comparison to another striking combat sport like Taekwondo which has a large amount of protective gear such as pads, headgear, mouth guard and gloves, has an injury incidence rate range of 19.1-138.8 per 1000 athletes. This means that injury rates are drastically lowered when protective gear is used.\n\nList of Protective Gear/Clothing\n\n\n"}

The goal is improving overall performance. It takes advantage of the particular effectiveness of one training method to negate the shortcomings of another.\n\nCross-training in sports and fitness involves combining exercises to work various parts of the body. Often one particular activity works certain muscle groups, but not others; cross-training aims to eliminate this imbalance.\n\nIn Korea and Saudi Arabia, cross-training refers to training in multiple martial arts or fighting systems to become proficient in all the phases of unarmed combat. This training is meant to overcome the shortcomings of one style by practicing another style which is strong in the appropriate area. A typical combination involves a striking-based art such as Muay Thai, combined with a grappling-based art such as wrestling and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Many hybrid martial arts can be considered derivatives of such cross-training - most notably Dan Inosanto's Jeet Kune Do concepts, a hybrid of Filipino martial arts, wing chun and savate, Apolaki Krav Maga & Dirty Boxing, a hybrid martial-art blending Krav Maga, Filipino martial arts, silat and Brazilian jiu-jitsu and kajukenbo, an American hybrid art consisting of karate, tang soo do, jujutsu, kenpo, and boxing.\n\nModern mixed martial-arts training generally involves cross-training in the different aspects and ranges of fighting.\n\nIn water sports, cross-training often involves doing exercises and training on land. This is often referred to as \"dryland\". For swimming, cross-training frequently includes running, stretching, and other resistance and agility training. Diving dryland exercises include various unique exercises such as on-land landing biomechanics training. \n\n"}

{"id": "37686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37686", "title": "Disabled sports", "text": "Disabled sports\n\nDisabled sports, also adaptive sports or parasports, are sports played by persons with a disability, including physical and intellectual disabilities. As many disabled sports are based on existing able bodied sports, modified to meet the needs of persons with a disability, they are sometimes referred to as \"adapted sports\". However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no equivalent in non-disabled sports. Disability exists in four categories: physical, mental, permanent and temporary.\n\nOrganized sport for athletes with a disability is generally divided into three broad disability groups: the deaf, people with physical disabilities, and people with intellectual disabilities. Each group has a distinct history, organization, competition program, and approach to sport.\n\nFormal international competition in deaf sport began with the 1924 Paris \"Silent Games\", organized by the Comité International des Sports des Sourds, CISS (The International Committee of Sports for the Deaf). These games evolved into the modern Deaflympics, governed by the CISS. The CISS maintains separate games for deaf athletes based on their numbers, their special communication needs on the sports field, and the social interaction that is a vital part of sports.\n\nOrganized sport for persons with physical disabilities existed as early as 1911, when the \"Cripples Olympiad\" was held in the U.S.A. One of the successful athletes was Walter William Francis, a Welshman, who won both the running and wrestling championships. Later, events often developed out of rehabilitation programs. Following the Second World War, in response to the needs of large numbers of injured ex-service members and civilians, sport was introduced as a key part of rehabilitation. Sport for rehabilitation grew into recreational sport and then into competitive sport. The pioneer of this approach was Sir Ludwig Guttmann of the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in England. In 1948, while the Olympic Games were being held in London, he organized a sports competition for wheelchair athletes at Stoke Mandeville. This was the origin of the Stoke Mandeville Games, from which evolved both the IWAS World Games and the Paralympic Games. The first official Paralympic Games, which were simultaneously the 9th International Stoke Mandeville Games ('international' having been added when Dutch service personal first took part in the Games in 1952), were held in Rome in 1960. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Paralympic Games were simultaneously the 13th, 17th and 21st international Stoke Mandeville Games.\n\nIn 1975, the Paralympic Games expanded to include those with limb amputations and visual impairments. Individuals with cerebral palsy were allowed to compete beginning in 1980.\n\nCurrently, Paralympic sport is governed by the International Paralympic Committee, in conjunction with a wide range of other international sport organizations. Today, there are numerous sport opportunities throughout the United States for injured service members, including cycling, wheelchair tennis, shooting, wheelchair basketball, track and field, adapted water sports, and snow skiing. One such program is the Army Wounded Warrior Program, which offers sitting volleyball to injured service members. Some organizations also offer sport opportunities to family and friends of injured service members in addition to the members themselves.\n\nSport for persons with intellectual disabilities began to be organized in the 1960s through the Special Olympics movement. This grew out of a series of summer camps organized by Eunice Kennedy Shriver, beginning in 1962. In 1968 the first international Special Olympics were held, in Chicago. Today, Special Olympics provides training and competition in a variety of sports for persons with intellectual disabilities.\n\nSport for persons with physical disabilities began to be organized in the US in the late 1960s through Disabled Sports USA. Disabled Sports USA was established in 1967 by disabled military veterans, including Jim Winthers, to help rehabilitate the injured soldiers returning from Vietnam and originally named the National Amputee Skiers Association. In 1970, Hal O'Leary founded the National Sports Center for the Disabled (NSCD) at Winter Park in Colorado. Today, NSCD has 19 certified instructors and more than 1,000 volunteers. Disabled Sports USA has become one of the largest national multi-sport, multi-disability organizations in the United States, serving more than 60,000 wounded warriors, youth and adults annually.\n\nIn 1986, the International Sports Federation for Persons with Intellectual Disability (INAS-FID) was formed to support elite competition for athletes with intellectual disabilities. This was established in contrast to the more participative, \"sport for all\" approach of Special Olympics. For a time, athletes with intellectual disabilities were included in the Paralympic Games. After a cheating scandal at the 2000 Summer Paralympics, where a number of athletes participating in intellectual disability events were revealed to not be disabled, INAS-FID athletes were banned from Paralympic competition, but the ban on intellectually disabled athletes has since been lifted.\n\nIn 2006, the Extremity Games were formed for people with limb loss or limb difference to compete in extreme sports. College Park Industries, a manufacturer of prosthetic feet, organized this event to give amputee athletes a venue to compete in this increasingly popular sports genre also referred to as action sports. This annual event held in the summer in Orlando, FL includes competitions in skateboarding, wakeboarding, rock climbing, mountain biking, surfing, moto-x and kayaking. Various organizations, such as Paradox Sports, have arisen to help empower and inspire disabled people through equipping and welcoming them into the extreme sports community.\n\nAlso in 2006, The Federation de Internationale Powerchair Football Association and The United States Power Soccer Association were formed to standardize the rules of play and promote one of the few competitive team sports for motorized wheelchair users. Powerchair football (or power soccer).\n\nIn 2007, a group of San Diego, California-based athletes, coaches, volunteers, and parents split from Special Olympics Southern California to gain local control over disabled athletics programs. This group – SPORTS for Exceptional Athletes (S4EA) – serves people with developmental disabilities within the age range of 5 years old through adults. By combining people with and without disabilities, S4EA hopes that participating athletes will interact and form lasting bonds of friendship through shared sports and recreational activities in S4EA's served communities. Although the organization's focus is primarily San Diego County, S4EA has grown from this base to satellite programs in Ventura and Temecula, California.\n\nSince 1988, the International Olympic Committee has chosen to validate Disabled Sports (physical disabilities) and incorporate it as a part of the Games: the staging of the Paralympic Games immediately follows the Olympic Games. This scheduling helps to foster greater interest in disabled sports. An investigation published on a Swiss website has /shown that more and more International Sports Federations list disabled athletes than any other sportsmen or sportswomen.\n\nTwo Paralympic-style multi-sport events exist exclusively for wounded, injured or sick armed services personnel and veterans. These are the Warrior Games in the United States and the Invictus Games which originated in the United Kingdom.\n\nAdapted sports help society learn about disability. They also can help remove some of the stigma associated with having a disability.\n\nA wide range of sports have been adapted to be played by people with various disabilities, as well as several that are unique just to disabled athletes. Within each movement, different sports are practised at different levels; for example, not all sports in the Paralympic movement are part of the Paralympic Games. In addition, many sports are practiced by persons with a disability outside the formal sports movements.\n\nThere is evidence to support that the use of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) as a training intervention can be implemented to increase the aerobic fitness, respiratory function, and overall quality of life in this population of athletes. Long term physiological adaptations through prolonged training demonstrated within athletes with disabilities include increased respiratory volume, improved executive functions and increased reaction time among other benefits in relation to non athletes in the same age group.\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s, work began within several countries and organizations to include athletes with disabilities in the non-disabled sport system. This included adding events for athletes with disabilities to major games such as the Olympic Games and the Commonwealth Games, and integration of these athletes into non-disabled sports organizations.\nSince 1984, the Olympics have included exhibition events for Paralympic athletes. However, integration of full medal events has not taken place, and the status of athletes with a disability in the Olympic movement remains controversial.\nWithin the Commonwealth Games, athletes with a disability were first included in 1990 Auckland Commonwealth Games, then at the exhibition events in 1994, and at the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games they were included as full members of their national teams, making these the first fully inclusive international multi-sport games. This policy has continued with the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games, where Canadian Chantal Petitclerc became the first athlete with a disability to carry her country's flag in the Opening Ceremonies of an integrated games.\nIndividual athletes such as swimmer Natalie du Toit and track athlete Oscar Pistorius have competed as equals against able bodied athletes at various events including the Olympic Games.\n\n2013 the FIFA decided that Austrian footballer Martin Hofbauer can continue to play competitive football with prosthetics after he lost his right lower leg due to cancer.\n\nThe self-determination theory has been one of the most proven theories on how athletes participate in competitions of this level. Studies have supported this theory especially in intellectually or developmentally disabled athletes. Studies have continued to question the motivation for joining such competitions like the Special Olympics as well as the Paralympic Games. The Motivations for joining the Special Olympics uncover themes among individuals and families for their participation or abstention from these Olympic programs.\n\nThere are specific strategies that may be employed to increase inclusion of people with disabilities in sports. This includes modifying rules or adapting activities for a particular individual. As well, maintaining a non-competitive focus helps to increase the inclusion of participants with disabilities.\n\nIncluding children with intellectual disabilities in sports programs in which they play with non-disabled athletes results in these children becoming more involved in mainstream sports, incorporating more physical activity in their daily lives and it increases their interactions with children who are not disabled. It is important for children with disabilities to get different types of support while participating in sports programs, for example, direct support from coaches and other athletes, indirect support from parents and non-human support from therapy dogs. Activities should be modified to suit different types of children's abilities and inclusivity is easier when activities are non-competitive.\n\n\"Unified sports\" involve teams made up of athletes with and without disabilities. Since the 1990s, Special Olympics Unified Sports have been promoting social inclusion through shared sports training and competition. This initiative has expanded globally and now involves more than 700,000 players in 127 countries worldwide. The principle behind Unified Sports is simple: training together and playing together is a quick path to friendship and understanding.\n\nThe NBA has been a major supporter of Unified Sports, sponsoring the annual NBA Cares Special Olympics Unified Basketball Game during the NBA All-Star Weekend. The Walt Disney Company, ESPN and Special Olympics are also working on a two-year global initiative that will leverage the power of sports to promote an environment of social inclusion and acceptance.\n\nDisabled drivers have competed in motorsport versus fully abled drivers, for example Alex Zanardi, Albert Llovera, Clay Regazzoni and Jason Watt.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1531458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1531458", "title": "Drought (sport)", "text": "Drought (sport)\n\nIn sports, a drought refers to instances in which an individual or team has gone through a lengthy period of time without accomplishing some goal. For a team, this usually refers to an extended period of time without making the playoffs or winning a championship. Droughts occur for a variety of reasons, from chronic mismanagement to bad luck. Some droughts are also popularly attributed to a curse.\n\n\n\n\nSeveral North American cities are considered to have championship droughts among their “Big Four” pro sports teams:\nThose who believe in the \"Buffalo Curse\" cite as examples the four consecutive Super Bowl losses by the Buffalo Bills from 1990 to 1993, as well as the failure of the Buffalo Sabres to ever win the Stanley Cup. Wide Right, No Goal, and The Music City Miracle also contribute to the belief in the Buffalo Curse. Hearts were broken once again in 2006, when the Sabres lost to the Carolina Hurricanes in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals, as four of their top six defensemen were lost to injury along with Tim Connolly, the leading scorer of the playoffs at the time of his injury. Even though the Sabres made it back to the conference finals the next year, they lost again, this time to the division rival Ottawa Senators. It is notable that the Buffalo Bills won the AFL championship in 1964 and 1965. The alleged “curse”, however, has not extended to the city’s fringe or minor league teams—the Buffalo Bandits of the NLL have won 4 league championships (1992, 1993, 1996, 2008) and six division Championships (1992, 1993, 1994, 2004, 2006, 2008), and the Western New York Flash of the National Women's Soccer League, based in Buffalo but playing home games in Rochester, won the 2016 NWSL Championship. The Flash also won league titles in the two competitions that directly preceded the NWSL—Women's Professional Soccer in 2011 and WPSL Elite in 2012. The Flash also won the NWSL Shield, awarded to the team with the best regular-season record, in that league's inaugural 2013 season, but lost the championship final to Portland Thorns FC. The Buffalo Beauts of the National Women's Hockey League won their first Isobel Cup in the 2016–17 season.\n\nThe San Diego Padres have never won a World Series, believed to stem from the \"San Diego Sports Curse\". San Diego’s former NFL team, the Chargers and its former NBA teams, the Rockets and Clippers, never won a Super Bowl or an NBA championship when located within the city. The Padres are tied with the Texas Rangers for the most World Series appearances (two) of the seven teams without a World Series championship. The Chargers won the 1963 AFL championship and only appeared in one Super Bowl (Super Bowl XXIX, which they lost to the San Francisco 49ers, 49–26).\n\nSome cities with at least three teams have shorter yet notable droughts. Minneapolis–Saint Paul has not reached a championship series or Super Bowl since the Twins won the 1991 World Series. This drought, like the one in Buffalo, has not extended to the market’s fringe or minor league teams—two such teams, the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx and the Minnesota Stars of the current North American Soccer League, won league championships in 2011, and the Lynx claimed another league title in 2013 and 2015.\n\nSince the founding of Major League Soccer in 1996, both Columbus, Ohio and Washington, D.C. have won all three major U.S. soccer trophies (MLS Supporters' Shield, MLS Cup and U.S. Open Cup) during their “Big Four” droughts. Toronto won all three major Canadian soccer trophies (MLS Supporters' Shield, MLS Cup and Voyageurs Cup) in the 2017 MLS season, during its current \"Big Four\" drought. San Jose has won the MLS Supporters' Shield and MLS Cup during its \"Big Four\" drought while Portland and Salt Lake City have won the MLS Cup (but no MLS Supporters’ Shields or U.S. Open Cups) during their \"Big Four\" droughts.\n\nAll of the Canadian cities listed above have won multiple Grey Cups during their \"Big Four\" droughts listed above.\n\nNotable former droughts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the VFL/AFL (1897–present), the longest premiership drought was that of South Melbourne/Sydney, who won their third premiership in 1933, but did not win another premiership until 2005, 72 years later. The second-longest drought in the league was that of St Kilda (69 years) who won their first and only senior premiership in 1966.\nMelbourne Demons currently hold the longest active drought having not won a premiership since 1964.\n\n\n\n\nThe Parramatta Eels hold the longest active drought in the NRL totalling thirty-three years, having not won a premiership since 1986. For reference, Parramatta's first premiership came in its 35th season in 1981. The next longest active drought is twenty-five years held by the Canberra Raiders who have not won a premiership (nor appeared in a Grand Final) since 1994.\n\nThe North Sydney Bears held the longest premiership drought in the NSWRL/NRL with a total of seventy-seven years. This lasted between their second premiership in 1922 up until the end of 1999 when they began a short-lived merger with Manly-Warringah known as the Northern Eagles. North Sydney also had the longest drought waiting for the next grand final appearance which stood at fifty six years. Their last grand final appearance was against Newtown in 1943. This merger was dissolved after three seasons resulting in North Sydney being expelled from the league. As of 2018 they are still applying for re-entry.\n\nThe Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks won their first premiership in 2016 after 50 seasons of NSWRL/ARL/Super League/NRL competition – the longest wait for a first title that any club has endured. Prior to this, the Sharks had played in four Grand Finals (including a replay in 1978) for one draw and three losses.\n\nThe South Sydney Rabbitohs won 20 premierships in the NSWRL from the league's inception in 1908 until 1971, but had to wait to win their 21st title (their 1st in the NRL era) until 2014, a drought lasting 41 years (the Rabbitohs were inactive in 2000-01).\n\nThe Gold Coast itself as a city has suffered a premiership drought of sorts. The original Gold Coast side was founded in 1988 as The Gold Coast-Tweed Giants and then were rebranded three times. First as The Gold Coast Seagulls, then Gold Coast Gladiators and then The Gold Coast Chargers. In 2006, The Gold Coast Titans entered the competition. Since 1988, no Gold Coast team has made a grand final or won a premiership. The best season for any of the franchises was in 2010, when Gold Coast Titans made the preliminary final . \n\nHull F.C. lost seven consecutive Challenge Cup Final appearances at Wembley Stadium between 1959 and 2008. The team won two Challenge Cups during that time, but the final victories were at Elland Road (1982 replay) and the Millennium Stadium (2005, while Wembley was being rebuilt).\n\nWarrington Wolves were founded in 1876 and have won three premierships in their history with the last being in 1955. Out of all the current teams in The English Super League they have waited longer than any other team to win their next premiership. As of 2018, it has been 63 years since Warrington had won the premiership.\n\nThe Castleford Tigers currently hold the record for the longest time to win a premiership in either The Super League or The NRL. Founded in 1926, Castleford have only played in three grand finals (1938,1969 & 2017) and for the first time in their 92-year history they finished first in The 2017 Super League season to claim their first ever league leaders shield. Castleford's drought of 92 years to wait for a first title eclipses The Cronulla Sutherland Sharks record in The NRL of 49 years who had the longest drought of any professional rugby league team in Australia to wait for a first title.\n\nIn France, ASM Clermont Auvergne had a championship history arguably as tortured as the most \"cursed\" teams in North America or Australia. From their formation in 1911 through 2009, they had never won a national title despite making the championship final 10 times, and had come within a converted try in six of those games.\n\nThe drought culminated in three consecutive title-game losses in 2007 through 2009, and \"Les Jaunards\" finally broke through in 2010 to win their first title after 91 years of competition (they did not play in 1915–1919 or 1940–1942 due to World War I and World War II).\n\nQueensland won the Sheffield Shield in 1994/95, its 63rd season of competition, having finished second on 11 occasions in that time. In 46 of those years, only five teams competed for the Shield, as Tasmania were admitted in 1977/78 (winning the Shield in 2007/08, after 30 years).\n\nSomerset have not yet won the English County Championship since they were admitted to the competition in 1891. Gloucestershire have not won the Championship since it was constituted in 1890, but won three unofficial \"Champion County\" titles in the 1870s, the last in 1874.\n\nNorthamptonshire have not yet won the Championship since being admitted to the competition in 1905, after the club was granted first class status.\n\nThe England cricket team has never won a 50 over ICC world cup, even though England founded the game of cricket.\n\n"}

Handicap races are common in clubs which encourage all levels of participants, such as swimming or in cycling clubs and sailing clubs, or which allow participants with a variety of standards of equipment. Often races, contests or tournaments where this practice is competitively employed are known as \"Handicaps\".\n\nHandicapping also refers to the various methods by which spectators can predict and quantify the results of a sporting match. The term is applied to the practice of predicting the result of a competition, such as for purposes of betting against the point spread. A favored team that wins by less than the point spread still wins the game, but bets on that team lose.\n\nIn either case the handicapper is the person who sets the handicaps for the activity. \n\nThe term \"handicap\" derives from hand-in-cap, referring to a system wherein players placed bets or money into the cap of a neutral arbiter to reach an agreement as to the relative values of items sought to be traded.\n\nIn a 'result adjustment' style handicap event, the outcome may be adjusted by some factor determined by the handicap. Some forms of car or yacht racing. In this case, the winner, on elapsed time, may differ from the fastest competitor when the times have been adjusted for the different competitors' handicaps.\n\nIn a 'pursuit' style handicap race, all participants are clocked in a time trial before the race. When this takes place at the same event as the main race, it is known as the handicap. In the race itself, the participants do not all start at the same \"Go\"; the starts are staggered, based on the handicaps. The slowest swimmer, or cyclist, for example, starts first and the fastest starts last, making the end of the race (hopefully) close. An ideal handicap race is one in which all participants finish at the same time. The winner is the person who beats his or her own time.\n\nSimilarly, physically staggered starting positions can be used, for example, in greyhound racing a handicap race is where greyhounds (based on their ability) start from different starting traps set at different measurements from the finish line, and in human foot racing, for example, the Stawell Gift.\n\nSome motorsport events, especially in sports car racing, demand teams to stop the vehicle in the pitbox a fixed period of time depending on the drivers' classification, thus giving advantage to less skilled drivers. An example of a championship using this system is the International GT Open. The advantage of this system over ballast weight systems is that vehicles have the normal performance on track, so better drivers will be able to recover time and overtake slower drivers.\n\nContrarily, horse race handicaping is implemented using extra weight.\n\nA handicap race in horse racing is a race in which horses carry different weights, allocated by the handicapper. A better horse will carry a heavier weight, to give him or her a disadvantage when racing against slower horses. The handicapper's goal in assigning handicap weights is to enable all the horses to finish together (in a dead heat).\n\nThe skill in betting on a handicap horse race is in determining which horse can overcome its handicap.\n\nHandicapping in the game of golf is by manipulating the golfer's score (number of strokes).\n\nTypes of chess handicaps include:\n\nHandicapping in go includes the weaker player being given an advantage by placing a number of stones before the stronger player commences, and by final points adjustment.\n\nHandicapping in shogi is achieved by removing one or more pieces from the stronger player's side. Shogi (Japanese chess) and many of its variants have handicaps.\n\nThe polo handicap is an estimation of the player's worth to his or her team. It is an overall rating of a player's horsemanship, team play, knowledge of the game, strategy and horses. The difference between the total of the polo handicaps for the players on each team is then used to determine the minimum score difference for the better team to score to enable them to win.\n\nHandicaps for sailing vessels in sailing races have varied throughout history, and they also vary by country, and by sailing organisation. Sailing handicap standards exist internationally, nationally, and within individual sailing clubs.\n\nSailing race handicaps may be based on vessel capability and-or crew experience, and today typically adjust the time a vessel takes to reach the finish point of the race.\n\nCalculated Match Average is a handicap calculated for every motorcycle speedway rider.\n\nThere are strategies that involve differences in the lines on the same event at different books. One bet is called a \"middle\", which when a player finds two books that offer different point spreads for the same event. They will bet the more favorable spread at both books, and if the final score falls between the two, the bettor will win both bets. On the other hand, if the total falls outside the range of the \"middle\" the bettor only loses a small percentage of a bet (the \"juice\" or \"vig\" taken by the house).\n\nFor example, Book 1 has Team A as a 3-point favorite, and Book 2 has team B as a 3-point favorite. If a player bets Team B at Book 1, and Team A at Book 2, he will win both bets if either side wins by 2 or less points, and will win one bet and lose the other (known as a \"side\") if either team wins by 3 points.\n\nAnother strategy, known as arbitrage, or an \"arb\" or \"scalp\", involves finding different moneylines for the same event. In this case, the bettor will bet the more favorable line at both books, and have a guaranteed profit. For example, if Book 1 considers Team A to be worth +200 (2 to 1 underdog), and Book 2 considers Team B to be worth +200, a bettor can bet Team A at Book 1, and Team B at Book 2, and guarantee a 100% profit. This is a no-risk bet, as the player is guaranteed a profit no matter the result of the game.\n\nThe first very well known sports handicapper in American culture was Jimmy \"The Greek\" Snyder. During his career he worked for CBS on their Sunday morning show, \"The NFL Today\". Because sports betting had a social taboo at the time, Snyder was not allowed to mention betting on games specifically. Instead, he would predict the score. Over the years the attitude towards sports betting, and handicapping in general, has changed. Billy Walters was profiled by \"60 Minutes\" because of his handicapping abilities. Billy Walters, and other unknown members of the Computer Group, developed a system for handicapping games and beating Las Vegas sportsbooks. \"The Huffington Post\" covered Jon Price a reclusive sports bettor that hires Ph.D's and works off of algorithmic information for his predictions. ESPN wrote an article on Haralabos Voulgaris naming him as the one of the premier NBA handicappers in the world. He claims to have developed a system that uses advanced statistical analysis to predict the outcomes of games. In the past, very few people did any mathematical calculations when handicapping sporting events. Predictions were usually made from hunches or information not readily available to the public. However, with the advancement of technology computers powerful enough to run advanced simulation models now frequent homes and offices. Advanced statistics such as DVOA, Win Shares and Points per Possession are talked about in mainstream media. Brian Burke, author of The Fifth Down blog featured in the \"New York Times\", wrote a formula using advanced statistical techniques that has shown consistency correctly predicting NFL winners. Handicapping, as a profession, is very similar to being a stock analyst. Like Wall Street did in the 1970s, the sports handicapping industry is undergoing a quantitative revolution. Many successful handicappers also use money management systems similar to financial investment professionals. The most popular, and mathematically superior, system is the Kelly criterion. It is a formula for maximizing profits and minimizing losses based on payout odds and win probability of the underlying asset.\n\n\n"}

Named after Kinesiology, this technique is used to get more flexibility, range of motion and strength at the same time with the view of attaining new range of flexibility functional and applicable to leg lifts, kicks, split jumps, dance, gymnastic, yoga, cheerleading, ballet, martial art techniques etc. This neuromuscular technique is widely used to minimize the risk of muscle injuries during stretching done to attain muscle flexibility.\n\nKinesiological stretching isolates muscles' actions one by one. It concentrates mainly on the muscles which are tighter than the others. This stretching method goes deeper and also helps in acquiring flexibility and strength faster than other methods of stretching.\n\nThe basic use of this technique is to train and stretch a particular muscle, whereas the traditional methods like dynamic stretching, static stretching, PNF stretching etc. are mostly concerned with more than just one muscle simultaneously.\n\nKinesiological stretching is used to train particular muscles to attain motion beyond the normal range. Generally there are various limiting factors for different muscles to attain a range of motion beyond the normal range, and these limiting factors are known as passive limiting factors. Kinesiological stretching eliminates these passive limiting factors.\n\nKinesiological stretching is used to avoid the stretch reflex, while increasing the range of motion of a specific muscle. This is strikingly different from previously known stretching techniques, which look to increase the ROM (or Range of motion) in a specific degree of freedom of a joint or group of joints. The stretching method is also used in the treatment of abnormal scapulothoracic joint combined with the patient's awareness of his/her postural faults.\n\nJust like other types of stretching exercises, Kinesiological stretching can lead to injuries especially when performed in a hurry. Engaging in the stretching method without completing the required motion properly can lead to muscle strains or tears.\n\n"}

{"id": "50173642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50173642", "title": "On the bubble", "text": "On the bubble\n\nTo be considered \"on the bubble\", you must be waiting to find out if a player or team has made the final spots in a tournament or on any given sports team roster. On the bubble is most commonly associated with the Men's college basketball or Women's college basketball for the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. When you are considered to be on the bubble in the NBA or NFL it means you are being considered for one of the last few positions on the roster. For those NCAA tournament the teams that are on the bubble, their names are usually released by ESPN College Basketball; with the list being updated every few days. The table that ESPN releases consists of eight teams with four of them being in the Last Four In and the First Four teams out of the tournament. Many College Basketball teams pay very close attention to the Bubble in late February and early March right before the NCAA tournament begins.\n\nOn the bubble is most popular when talking about the Men's and Women's end of the season tournament. When it comes down to Selection Sunday at the end of the season there are about five to six teams that are on the bubble of getting in the tournament each and every season. When a team is on the bubble, and they do get into the tournament they are most commonly placed as the 11th seed and will often play another team that was on the bubble in the first game of the tournament as a Play-in game. If a team that is considered to be on the bubble they are almost always one of the top seeds in the National Invitation Tournament which consists of all the teams that just were not quite good enough to be in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nTo be considered on the bubble, there are quite a few different things that have to play out during the season. First of all, you must have to have a record that is respectable. What the Selection Committee looks at when deciding between the five or six bubble teams each year is Strength of schedule, top 50 wins, and top 100 wins. What hurts the bubble teams that are trying to get into the tournament is a bad loss to a team that is below 150. Each and every year there is at least one or two bubble teams that do not make it into the NCAA tournament that were expected to by college basketball analyst. During the tournament it is very rare to see bubble teams make a deep run in the tournament, but there have been a few Cinderella teams.\n\nAlmost every season there are two or three really big Upsets, with at least one of them coming from a team that was considered to be on the Bubble. Listed below are many of the teams that were listed on the bubble, but made a run in the NCAA Tournament.\nMany bubble teams have done some damage in the tournament, but have not quite been able to win the National Championship yet.\n\nThe roster bubble deals with rosters from numerous leagues, such as Major League Baseball (MLB), National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), and National Hockey League (NHL). Each of these leagues have a certain number of players that are allowed on the roster, which means there are always a few players that do not make the cut. From the four leagues listed above, the one that is talked about the most for being difficult to make the roster is Major League Baseball.\n\nMLB has by far the largest number of people that are considered to be on the roster bubble. Each baseball roster can have a maximum of twenty-five players being distributed to nine different positions. There is such a large number of players on the bubble for MLB, because there are so many players on each baseball team. The majority of players on the bubble are in the minor leagues. Coaches use spring training to figure out which twenty-five players will make the roster. Players that are on the bubble may start the season in Minor League Baseball in hopes of making the MLB team in the future.\n\nThe NFL has a few players that are considered to be on the bubble, but not as many as other professional sports. The reason for this is because each NFL roster consists of fifty-three players, which makes the coaches' decision often fairly easy. If bubble players do not make the roster, they will oftentimes be signed to the team's practice squad or may be picked up by a different NFL team if they are talented enough.\n\nThe NBA has by far the fewest people that are considered to be on the bubble; this is because each team only has thirteen players on the roster. Most players that are on the roster bubble will make the NBA team because there are so few players that are actually in the league. The last few men that make the team typically do not get any playing time unless the game is out of hand. If a bubble player does not make the team, they may be sent down to the D-League in hopes of one day being called up to the professional level.\n\nThe NHL has anywhere from zero to three or four players that are considered to be on the roster bubble in the fall training camp every year. One NHL roster consists of twenty players that are eighteen skaters and two goaltenders. If bubble players do not make the team, they may start out in the American Hockey League, which is similar to the minor leagues in baseball. Hockey has a little bit bigger of a roster compared to other professional sports, which makes it hard to have so many players on the bubble.\n\n"}
{"id": "45390377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45390377", "title": "Pacing strategies in track and field", "text": "Pacing strategies in track and field\n\nPacing strategies in track and field are the varied strategies which runners use to distribute their energy throughout a race. Optimal strategies exist and have been studied for the different events of track and field. These optimal strategies differ for runners in sprint events, such as the 100 metres, runners in middle-distance events, such as the 800 meters or the mile run, and runners in long-distance events, such as the 5000m or marathon. Additionally, pacing typically differs between different styles of races. For instance, in a time trial, where the goal of a racer is simply to run the fastest time, participants will typically employ the aforementioned optimal pacing strategy. However, in a championship race, where the goal of the racer is to win, the pace is typically slow in the beginning of the race and gradually speeds up for a sprint finish, often meaning the race is run with a negative split. Typically, to run a world record, the runner must employ a near-optimal pacing strategy.\n\nTrack and field racers have a variety of options in the ways they can choose to pace their races.\n\nEven-splitting is a strategy in which the racer attempts to hit the same split in every lap of the race. The racer tries to run an \"even\" pace during the entire race. In long-distance events, this can often be an optimal strategy.\n\nPositive-splitting is a racing strategy that involves completing the first half of a race faster than the second half. Typically, the runner goes out at a pace faster than he or she can maintain for the entire race, leading to a slower end of the race. Positive-splitting can be employed as a tactic, or can simply be a byproduct of an overambitious early pace.\n\nNegative-splitting is a racing strategy that involves completing the second half of a race faster than the first half. The racer runs slow in the beginning, and gradually runs faster as the race progresses. This is typically seen as a conservative racing strategy, but in distance events, many world records have been run with a slight negative split.\n\nSit-and-kick, a related strategy to negative-splitting, is one in which the racer typically sits in the pack of the race, not taking the lead or going very fast, and then attempts to \"kick\" or sprint by the other racers during the last laps of the race. The sit-and-kick can be employed by individual runners or, in the case of many championship races, the entire field may attempt to sit-and-kick, thus leading to drastically slow times for the first few laps and faster than normal times for the last laps.\n\nWhile all of the above strategies can be employed, certain pacing strategies, for physiological reasons, will yield the fastest times.\n\nFor the 100m and 200m events, pacing is not a factor. Because the race is so short, racers simply run at their top speed for the duration of the race. However, for the 400m at the elite level, the event is almost uniformly run with a positive-split strategy. Runners run the first 200m faster than the final 200m.\n\nIn the 800 meters, the fastest times have almost always been achieved with a positive-split strategy. A study of 26 world-record 800m races from 1912 to 1997 showed that in 92% of the fastest 800m races, the first half of the race has been run faster than the second half. This implies that the optimal strategy for the 800m is to positive-split.\n\nIn the 5000 meters and 10000 meters, the optimal strategy shifts to even-splitting. An analysis of world-record performances in these events shows a clear pattern: relatively even pacing throughout most of the race, and a slight increase in speed in the last 1000m of both the 5000m and 10000m. While one could interpret this concluding increase in speed as evidence of a sit-and-kick strategy, the increase in speed observed in these performances is not nearly as dramatic and pronounced as what is typically observed in a sit-and-kick type race.\n"}
{"id": "18425178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18425178", "title": "Red Sport International", "text": "Red Sport International\n\nThe International Association of Red Sports and Gymnastics Associations, commonly known as Red Sport International (RSI) or Sportintern was a Comintern-supported international sports organization established in July 1921. The RSI was established in an effort to form a rival organization to already existing \"bourgeois\" and social democratic international sporting groups. The RSI was part of a physical culture movement in Soviet Russia linked to the physical training of young people prior to their enlistment in the military. The RSI held 3 summer games and 1 winter games called \"Spartakiad\" in competition with the Olympic games of the International Olympic Committee before being dissolved in 1937.\n\nThe notion of a separate working class national athletic federation emerged first in Germany during the decade of the 1890s, when a Workers Gymnastics Association was established by activists in the socialist movement in opposition to the nationalist German Gymnastics Society \"(Turnen).\" Other \"proletarian\" sports organizations emerged soon thereafter in that country, including the Solidarity Worker Cycling Club, the Friends of Nature Rambling Association, the Worker Swimming Association, the Free Sailing Association, and the Worker Track and Field Athletics Association, among others. By the time of World War I, the German proletarian sports movement included more than 350,000 participants.\n\nFollowing the bloodbath of World War I, the German workers' sports movement began to reemerge, with a new competitive orientation beginning to take the place of individualistic club activities. The international social democratic movement also experienced a rebirth after its connections had been severed by war. In 1920 the social democrats established an International Association for Sports and Physical Culture, echoing its efforts in the pre-war period. This organization was rechristened as the Socialist Workers' Sport International (SWSI) in 1925.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917 the international socialist movement divided into two antagonistic camps, socialist and communist — a division exacerbated with the establishment of the Communist International (Comintern) in 1919. Parallel political organizations sprung up in every country and a state of bitter enmity prevailed.\n\nThe idea of a rival Red Sport International (RSI) was the inspiration of Nikolai Podvoisky, who at the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern in the summer of 1920 discussed with a number of delegates from around the world the idea of establishing an organization to coordinate the physical training of youth. Podvoisky, a military specialist in charge of Soviet Russia's military training organization, believed systematic physical training to be beneficial for the needs of the Red Army for healthy and fit youth in its ranks. An international sports organization was also seen as a potential ideological counterweight to the Olympic games of the \"bourgeois\" International Olympic Committee as well as the activities of the rival International Association for Sports and Physical Culture of the socialists.\n\nPodvoisky gathered interested delegates who were already in Moscow for the Comintern Congress and the group constituted itself a founding conference for an international sports organization. It is worthy of emphasis that the Comintern did not itself directly found the Red Sport International, the group being established through independent initiative and the Comintern being preoccupied with other affairs. The group issued a public manifesto declaring the establishment of a Red Sport International and elected a governing Executive Committee, consisting of representatives from Soviet Russia, Germany, Czechoslovakia, France, Sweden, Italy, and Alsace-Lorraine. Podvoisky was elected President of the new organization.\n\nThe establishment of an international sports organization in Soviet Russia in 1921 was not without its utopian elements, since no official Soviet sport organizations existed in famine stricken post-civil war Soviet Russia at that time. Germany, on the other hand, had a well-developed workers' sport movement at this time. Consequently, Sportintern from its outset maintained a strong German flavor and it was there in the city of Berlin that the 2nd Conference of the organization was held in July 1922. The only national \"proletarian\" sports organization to join the German group at that early date was the Czechoslovak Federation of Workers' Gymnastic Leagues, said to represent 100,000 athletes.\n\nThe Comintern moved closer to the fledgling Sportintern in November 1922 when, in conjunction with the 4th World Congress, the governing Executive Committee of the Communist International decided to name a representative to the \"independent\" proletarian sport organization. The Communist International of Youth (KIM) did not take action until the meeting of its governing Bureau in Moscow in July 1923, when it issued a general recommendation of support for the Sportintern and the national sports organizations affiliated to it as a useful \"proletarian class instrument.\" It did not, however, delve into the contentious issue of in what manner and to what extent these two international bodies should be related.\n\nThe governing Executive Committee of Sportintern met in Moscow in February 1923 and decided to establish a satellite bureau of the organization in Berlin, with a view to increasing participation among Western European workers' sports organizations. The maneuver proved successful in helping to build the organization, triggering a split of the French Workers Sports Federation later that year and the affiliation of 80% of its membership with the Red Sport International. The RSI's increased place in the public eye motivated the governing body of the rival international socialist sports authority, meeting in Zurich in August 1923, to discuss issuing an invitation to Sportintern to help organize a joint \"Workers' Olympiad\" — a proposal which was narrowly defeated, despite indications that a majority of individual members of the socialist organization favored joint participation.\n\nIn October 1924 the Red Sport International held its 3rd Congress in Moscow. At this time the organization decided to enlarge its governing Executive Committee to include four members of the Executive Committee of the Communist International of Youth — an organization which saw the national affiliates of Sportintern as comprised overwhelmingly of young workers and sought to insert its influence in the organization. As the membership of Sportintern was formally \"open to all proletarian elements which recognize the class struggle\" it was not an explicitly communist organization, a situation which the KIM saw as a significant shortcoming.\n\nThe RSI was a large and growing organization in this interval, with some 2 million affiliated members in the Soviet Union, joined by others sections in Germany, Czechoslovakia, France, Norway, Italy, Finland, Switzerland, the United States, Estonia, Bulgaria, and Uruguay. As the size of the organization grew, so, too, did pressure to bring the organization's ideological character under tighter centralized Communist Party control.\n\nNikolai Podvoisky was himself a voice for such an insertion of such ideological hegemony, declaring in a lengthy speech to the 5th Enlarged Plenum of the Comintern, held in the spring of 1925, that Sportintern should henceforth adopt as its motto:\n\"Convert sport and gymnastics into a weapon of the class revolutionary struggle, concentrate the attention of workers and peasants on sport and gymnastics as one of the best instruments, methods, and weapons for their class organization and struggle.\"\n\nAt the same time the international communist movement moved to further politicize the RSI, efforts were made to make political hay over the refusal of the Socialist Workers' Sport International to conduct joint activities, such as its decision to bar the Red Sport International from participation at the July 1925 \"Workers' Olympiad\" held in Frankfurt under its auspices.\n\nIt was in this period, 1924 to 1925, that the Red Sport International effectively became an auxiliary of the Communist International. This control was effected by the subordinate youth section of the Comintern, the Communist International of Youth, although the Comintern reserved for itself ultimate authority to decide issues of great importance. As the Comintern was itself in the process of being absorbed as an instrument of Soviet foreign policy in this interval, the RSI likewise gradually lost its ability to function independently as an international entity.\n\nIn the words of French sports historian André Gounot:\n\"...The RSI's dependence on the Comintern was accompanied, almost inevitably, by the Soviet section's dominance within the RSI. The interests of the Soviet Union and Soviet sport were decisive factors in the RSI's decisions and actions — even if, as was frequently the case, they were incompatible with those of European worker sport.\" \n\nThe last International Congress of the Red Sport International came in 1928 and was marked by no serious discussion of contemporary sporting issues. Instead the 1928 gathering consisted of a mechanical attempt to apply the Comintern's ultra-radical Third Period slogan of \"Class versus Class\" and its corollary theory of social fascism to world sport — splitting the fissure between the two camps of the European workers' sport movement wider than ever.\n\nMembership of the various national sections of the Red Sport International was by no means monolithic. According to the RSI's own study of the issue, members of the organizations were predominantly male, but hailed from a variety of communist, socialist, syndicalist, and anarchist tendencies, including many of whom who were members of no party. Although many of these were of the working class, also included were white collar employees, students, and government workers. Membership records of the French section, for example, indicate that approximately 80% of participants were from the working class, with the remaining 20% members of other social groups.\n\nNo details exist for the exact Communist Party membership of any national section of the RSI, although in the considered opinion of a leading historian on the topic, \"it is safe to assume that this group represented a minority of the whole membership of each section.\" The Czechoslovakian federation, thought to include the largest Communist Party contingent from outside the USSR, is believed to have included something in the range of 20 to 30% who were members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe fact that members of other parties or no parties participated in the national sections of the Red Sport International is testimony to the limited impact that RSI programmatic rhetoric had upon grassroots participants. It was rather the fun and excitement of training and competition that bound together local groups and their national units more than ideological proclivities. The difference in perception of the organization between its rank-and-file participants and the Moscow dominated leadership of the organization has led one scholar to conclude that the RSI was a \"split organization, living in two universes,\" bureaucratic in political discourse but remaining well within the less intense social democratic workers' sports tradition at the individual club level. In this view politics was merely a piece of a broader participatory sports movement.\n\nThe international workers' sports organizations of the socialist and communist movements did not necessarily object to some of the most noble goals of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), but they did each share fundamental reservations about the modern Olympic games that were the inspiration of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a hereditary French nobleman. First and foremost, the Olympics of the IOC stressed competition between nations — regarded by the radicals as a manifestation of national chauvinism. Rather than the accentuation of national rivalry and patriotic feeling, international competition should focus on the actual athletic effort in a setting designed to build the ethic of internationalism, both the socialists and communists agreed.\n\nThe IOC games also were based upon rigid entrance standards, while the international festivals of the worker athletic movement instead attempted to build mass participation through pageantry, artistic and cultural activities, and unifying political presentations. Moreover, the sort of athletes dominating the IOC games were objectionable to the radicals on the basis of social class, dominated as they were by the privileged children of the rural aristocracy and the bourgeoisie. Such international competitions should be open to the participation of less privileged national and social groups, without distinction to race or creed, in the view of the radical sports organizations.\n\nTherefore, the Red Sport International and its socialist rival, the organization emerging as the Socialist Workers' Sport International, conducted a series of their own workers' sports festivals in distinction to and competition with the Olympiads of the IOC. Four such events (called Spartakiads in honor of the heroic slave leader, Spartacus) were sponsored by the RSI. Two of these were held in 1928, and one each in 1931 and 1937.\n\nWhile a major national workers' sport festival had already been held in Czechoslovakia in 1921, it was the socialist organization in 1925 that conducted the first pair of Workers' Olympics events — Summer Games in Frankfurt attracting 150,000 spectators and competitors from 19 country, and Winter Games in Schreiberhau (today's Szklarska Poręba, Poland), attended by athletes from 12 countries. No national flags or anthems graced the closing or opening ceremonies, replaced instead by universal use of the red flag and singing of \"The Internationale.\" \"Soviet and other communist athletes were excluded from these games, however, and there was therefore little actual unity of the workers' sports movement for all the universalist pageantry employed.\n\nFrom the middle 1930s the political line of the world communist movement changed. The so-called Popular Front against the threat of fascism rendered cooperation with socialists and others through unified workers' athletic festivals not only a possibility but the tactical order of the day. Plans were laid for a so-called 3rd Workers' Olympiad to be held in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain in June 1936, under joint auspices of the RSI and the SWSI. The time and place proved inauspicious, however, coinciding with outbreak of hostilities in the Spanish Civil War. This forced postponement of the event, which was rescheduled for the next summer in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nThe 3rd Workers' Olympiad proved to be less successful than previous endeavors, but it still managed to attract 27,000 participating athletes, and put 50,000 people in the stadium for the final day of competition. An estimated 200,000 people turned out for the traditional closing parade through the city.\n\nWith the Soviet Union becoming immersed in the first months of 1937 in a massive and xenophobic secret police campaign against perceived underground espionage networks remembered as the Great Terror, the Red Sport International was summarily dissolved by the Comintern in April of that year.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11072011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11072011", "title": "Sinclair Coefficients", "text": "Sinclair Coefficients\n\nThe Sinclair Coefficients are a method to compare different weight classes in olympic weightlifting. It replaced Hoffman's formula, which was the first statistical analysis of this type.\n\nThe method provides the answer to the question \"What would be the total of an athlete weighing \"x\" kg if he/she\nwere an athlete in the heaviest class of the same level of ability?\", given by the formula:\nACTUAL TOTAL × SINCLAIR COEFFICIENT = SINCLAIR TOTAL.\n\nThere are eight bodyweight categories for men: 56 kg, 62 kg, 69 kg, 77 kg, 85 kg, 94 kg, 105 kg and +105 kg, and eight for women: 48 kg, 53 kg, 58 kg, 63 kg, 69 kg, 75 kg, 90 kg and +90 kg.\n\nThere are two types of lifts: snatch, and clean and jerk. However, at most championships, medals are presented for both lifts and the total (the combined result of the best snatch and the best clean and jerk).\n\nTo compare and rank the results, especially between bodyweight categories, the International Weightlifting Federation uses the Sinclair Coefficients which are derived statistically and calculated for one Olympic cycle (for four years, starting in the Spring of each Olympic year).\n\nThe total for each bodyweight category is a projection of the Total for that weightlifter if he/she were a competitor in the heaviest bodyweight category with the same level of ability.\n\nThe Sinclair Coefficient is formula_1 if \"x\"<\"b\" where \"x\" is the weightlifter's bodyweight, \"b\" is the world record holder's bodyweight (in the heaviest category) and \"A\" is the coefficient for this Olympic cycle, or 1.0 if \"x\"≥\"b\".\n\nThen, the Sinclair Total is simply the obtained total multiplied by the Sinclair Coefficient.\n\nFor example, from 2017 to 2020, a calculation of the Sinclair Coefficient is as follows, given A=0.751945030 and b=175.508 kg for men, with A=0.783497476 and b=153.655 kg for women.\n\nAssume that we are assessing a male weightlifter weighing 61.9 kg with a total of 320 kg.\n\nTo understand the whole idea, here is the chart with the men's bodyweight categories (in kg) and its world record Totals, Sinclair Coefficients, and Sinclair Total. By looking at the Sinclair Total we can determine the RANK.\n\nNaim Süleymanoğlu achieved a Sinclair Total of 500.705 at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, an all-time world record.\n\nYurik Vardanyan set a 489.643 Sinclair Total in 1984 in Varna, Bulgaria.\n\nYury Zakharevich set a 489.232 Sinclair Total at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nThe highest women's Sinclair total is 352.622, set by Natalia Zabolotnaya at the 2011 President's Cup in Belgrod, Russia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29663719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29663719", "title": "Sockgate", "text": "Sockgate\n\nThe contested judgment of taekwondo of 2010 Asian Games, also called \"Sockgate\", is a dispute at the 2010 Asian Games on November 17. Taiwanese taekwondo athlete Yang Shu-chun was disqualified with twelve seconds remaining in the first round due to \"unauthorized\" (disputed) sensors on her socks.\n\nYang was facing Vietnamese opponent Vu Thi Hau in the first round of the flyweight division (under 49 kilogram) of the Asian Games taekwondo competition in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China on November 17, 2010, when she was accused of using the \"unauthorized\" sensors. During the pre-match testing of equipment, the referee discovered that Yang had two extra sensors on the heels of each sock, which she was asked to remove. She fought without the two additional sensors on her socks.\n\nHowever, with twelve seconds remaining in the first round of the bout, when Yang was leading at an advantage of 9–0, Asian Taekwondo Union vice-president Zhao Lei () of China instructed Filipino referee Fernandez S. Estanislaoto to call Yang over to the side and inspected her heels. Finding nothing, the referee then called for the match referee to bring over the two sensors that had already been removed and kept under the chair that Yang's coach was sitting on. Following that, Zhao and the referee had a brief discussion, and the match referee disqualified Yang and awarded Vu a 12–0 victory.\n\nChinese Taipei representatives at the taekwondo venue immediately pointed out that the equipment was certified and that both fighters passed a pre-match inspection. Following the disqualification, Yang and her coach both protested on the mat for about an hour. The World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) authorities then gave the ultimatum for them to leave, or they would suspend every Chinese Taipei taekwondo member in the Game. The WTF Secretary-General Yang Jin-suk initially did not reveal the reason why Yang was disqualified and told the press that it was for the protection of the athlete's personal privacy, but later it was revealed the reason was for the sensors on her socks. Secretary-General later said, \"It was clearly a manipulative move with the intent of cheating, and that's the reason why the individual was disqualified.\"\n\nAccording to the Secretary-General of the WTF, there are two sorts of sensor socks for taekwondo. It is specified that only the newer type is allowed to be used in the 2010 Asian Games, because the older type of sensors are fixed by velcro, which allows athletes to easily add new sensors themselves. The sensors on the newer type are fixed by stitching and have no possibility to be altered by illegal methods, but the newer type have no sensors on the heel.\n\nYang's coach, Liu Tsung-da (), said the inspector for the match asked Yang to change her socks due to poor signal response before the match. Yang put on another set of older velcro socks and passed the equipment inspection. During the match, the sensors on the heel area had already been removed, which should not affect the scoring record. Right after the judgment, Liu asked for the testimony of the inspector and the surveillance video as evidence, but the demands were all rejected.\n\nThe equipment supplier of the Chinese Taipei team said they had never received an official notification from the WTF about suspending the velcro type socks before the Asian Games. There were many of the older type being used in other matches of different weight classes, but those athletes didn't suffer any punishment before or after their matches. According to the WTF official instruction for taekwondo athletes, the former type is still legal in any international games until London Olympics in 2012. The two \"unauthorized\" extra sensors proclaimed to be found by the Game officials belong to the original design of the older type by a Korean equipment manufacturer, which is the only manufacturer authorized by the WTF officials for the 2010 Asian Games.\n\nPolitical reaction in the Republic of China (Taiwan) came swiftly, with politicians on both sides of the political spectrum rushing to Yang's defense. The Kuomintang legislator Huang Chih-hsiung (), himself an Olympic taekwondo silver medalist at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, stated \"the decision was inconceivable and ridiculous.\" Premier Wu Den-yih () is cited as saying, \"From the current information we have, our athlete Yang Shu-chun was wronged. If it is proven that the ruling was unfair, the Asian Games Organizing Committee has to shoulder the biggest responsibility.\" The Sports Affairs Council demanded an explanation from the Asian Taekwondo Union regarding the disqualification.\n\nThe Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator Pan Men-an () claimed at a press conference that the accusation by the Game officials that Yang had cheated was an \"insult to everybody around the country,\" and charged that, \"the responsibility should fall on the people that conducted the equipment checks.\"\n\nHowever, not all was completely peaceful between the two political sides, as the DPP leaders accused the government of a slow response. The DPP Legislator Chiu Yi-ying () complained that: \"A large number of officials attended the Games, but all they have done so far is to show up at and take part in the awarding ceremonies when our athletes win. When Yang was disqualified, what did they do? Nothing.\"\n\nTsai Ing-wen (), then-current chairperson of the DPP and a candidate for mayor of New Taipei City in 2010, released a statement saying: \"This government has always deferred to China and hasn't emphasized our attitudes enough, especially on sovereignty issues.\" She further stated, \"As a result, we think that it is regrettable that frontline officials haven't been protesting strongly enough about this incident.\"\n\nShortly after the disqualification, Taiwanese netizens voiced their dissatisfaction with the judgment. Soon, several Facebook groups in support of Yang were posted, some with hundreds of thousands of followers. On the pages, outcry toward both South Korea and China was rampant, with many conjecturing a conspiracy, as Yang was regarded as the primary rival to China's gold medal favorite, Wu Jingyu (), the eventual winner of the gold. The conspiracy theorized that Zhao Le (), Wu Jingyu's long-time mentor, was the invisible hand that deliberately forced Yang's ouster to pave the way for Wu's gold medal.\n\nThe 2006 Asian Games gold medalist Su Li-wen () came out in support of Yang in her blog, saying that she has never heard of such a ridiculous accusation and pointed out that eight of Yang's nine points were manually scored without the benefit of the foot sensors.\n\nYang's father, Yang Chin-hsing (), remarked, \"The whole thing is utterly unacceptable\", and told the press that Yang had spent ten months preparing for this competition and that he suspected that China was behind this incident.\n\nThe Asian Taekwondo Union published a misleading article titled \"Shocking Act of Deception by Chinese Taipei\" on its website, attempting to deflect South Korea of blame of the incident. The homepage of the website was then hacked by Taiwanese hackers who added hostile criticism. Later, the homepage was restored, and the misleading article was removed. The Union has reportedly blocked Taiwanese IPs from accessing its website.\n\nSince this is not the first time that Taiwanese athletes have faced controversial judgments in international games, netizens rallied to boycott Korean merchandise. A legislator candidate even led the congregation to protest and burn the flag of South Korea. One Taipei citizen threw eggs at a Korean immigration school as a protest. A few restaurants and taxi drivers announced, \"No Service to Koreans.\"\n\nOn December 21, 2010, Yang was given a three months' suspension for protesting her disqualification during the 2010 Asian Games by the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF). Her coach, Liu Tsung-ta was given a 20 months' suspension while Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA) was fined US$50,000 for \"negligence and wrongdoing\".\n\n"}
{"id": "4532299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4532299", "title": "Sports club", "text": "Sports club\n\nA sports club or sporting club, sometimes athletics club or sports society or sports association, is a group of people formed for the purpose of playing sports.\n\nSports clubs range from organisations whose members play together, unpaid, and may play other similar clubs on occasion, watched mostly by family and friends, to large commercial organisations with professional players which have teams which regularly compete against those of other clubs and attract sometimes very large crowds of paying spectators. Clubs may be dedicated to a single sport or to several (multi-sport club).\n\nThe term \"athletics club\" is sometimes used for a general sports club, rather than one dedicated to athletics proper.\n\nLarger sports clubs are characterized by having professional and amateur departments in various sports such as bike polo, football, basketball, futsal, cricket, volleyball, handball, rink hockey, bowling, water polo, rugby, track and field athletics, boxing, baseball, cycling, tennis, rowing, gymnastics and others, including less traditional sports such as airsoft, billiards, orienteering, paintball or roller derby. The teams and athletes belonging to a sports club may compete in several different leagues, championships and tournaments wearing the same club colors and using the same club name, sharing also the same club fan base, supporters and facilities. \n\nMany professional sports clubs have an associate system where the affiliated supporters pay an annuity fee. In those cases, supporters become eligible to attend the club's home matches and exhibitions across the entire season, and have the right to practice almost every kind of sport at the club's facilities. Registered associate member fees, attendance receipts, sponsoring contracts, team merchandising, TV rights, and athlete/player transfer fees, are usually the primary sources of sports club financing. In addition, there are sports clubs, or its teams, which are publicly traded and listed on a stock exchange - several professional European football clubs belonging to a larger multistports club are examples of this (namely, Portuguese SADs (Sociedade Anónima Desportiva) such as Sport Lisboa e Benfica and Sporting Clube de Portugal, or Spanish SADs (Sociedad Anónima Deportiva) Real Zaragoza, S.A.D. and Real Betis Balompié S.A.D., as well as Italian clubs like Società Sportiva Lazio S.p.A.).\n\nSome sports teams are owned and financed by a single non-sports company, for example the several sports teams owned by Red Bull GmbH and collectively known as Red Bulls. Other examples of this are the several sports teams owned by Bayer AG and Philips corporations through the TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen and PSV Eindhoven respectively, that originally were works teams, the teams owned by the Samsung Group, and the teams owned by the Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG). They may compete in several different sports and leagues, being headquartered in some cases across several countries.\n\nIn many regions of the world like Europe, North Africa, Middle East, Indian subcontinent or Latin America, sports clubs with several sports departments (multisports clubs) or branches, including highly competitive professional teams, are very popular and have developed into some of the most powerful and representative sports institutions in those places. In general, student sports can be described as composed by multisports clubs, each one representing its educational institution and competing in several sport disciplines.\n\nIn the United States major institutions like The New York Athletic Club and Los Angeles Athletic Club serve as athletic clubs that participate in multiple sports. Examples also abound of sports clubs that are in effect one sports team. Each team from the NFL (American football), CFL (Canadian football), NBA (basketball), MLB (baseball), NHL (ice hockey) or MLS (association football) North American sports leagues, can be called sports clubs, but in practice, they focus solely on a single sport. There are some exceptions, especially when multiple such teams are under one ownership structure, in which case the club may be referred to as a \"sports and entertainment\" company; see, for example, the One Buffalo sports club, which fields an NFL team (the Buffalo Bills), two hockey teams (Buffalo Sabres and Rochester Americans), professional lacrosse (Buffalo Bandits), and general athletics and fitness (Impact Sports and Performance). On the other hand, American varsity teams are generally organized into a structure forming a true multi-sport club belonging to an educational institution, but varsity collegiate athletics are almost never referred to as clubs; \"club sports\" in American colleges and universities refer to sports that are not directly sponsored by the colleges but by student organizations (see National Club Football Association and American Collegiate Hockey Association for two leagues consisting entirely of college \"club\" teams in North American football and ice hockey, respectively).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, almost all major sports organizations are dedicated to a single sport, with a few minor multisport clubs such as Catford Wanderers. In addition, like in several other countries, many universities and colleges develop a wide range of student sport activities including at a professional or semi-professional level. Fulham F.C. once ran a professional rugby league team and rowing club, which other football clubs have emulated since. Many football clubs originate from cricket teams. Today, most major cities have separate clubs for each sport (e.g. Manchester United football club and Lancashire County Cricket Club are based in Manchester).\n\nMany clubs internationally describe themselves as football clubs (\"FC\", \"Football Club\" in British English and \"Fußball-Club\" in German; \"CF\", \"Clube de Futebol\" in Portuguese and \"Club de Fútbol\" in Spanish). Generally, British football clubs field only football teams. Their counterparts in several other countries tend to be full multi-sport clubs, even when called football clubs (Futebol Clube do Porto; Fußball-Club Bayern München; Futbol Club Barcelona). The equivalent abbreviation \"SC\" (for \"Soccer Club\") is occasionally used in North American English (for example, the Chicago Fire S.C.), but a general reluctance to North Americanize the sport means that most North American teams, somewhat ambiguously (and perhaps erroneously, as \"football\" in North American English refers to North American gridiron-style football) still use \"F.C.\" in their name instead (e.g. FC Dallas or Toronto FC).\n\n"}
{"id": "558219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=558219", "title": "Sports journalism", "text": "Sports journalism\n\nSports journalism is a form of writing that reports on sporting topics and competitions. \n\nSports journalism is the essential element of many news media organizations. While the sports department (along with entertainment news) within some newspapers has been mockingly called the \"toy department\", because sports journalists do not concern themselves with the 'serious' topics covered by the news desk, sports coverage has grown in importance as sport has grown in wealth, power, and influence.\n\nAlso, some media organizations are devoted entirely to sports reporting — newspapers and magazines such as \"L'Equipe\" in France, \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" in Italy, \"Marca\" in Spain, the defunct \"Sporting Life\" in Britain, and American \"Sports Illustrated\" and \"Sporting News\"; television networks such as \"Eurosport\", \"Fox Sports\", \"ESPN\"; sports radio stations such as \"BBC Radio 5 Live\", \"ESPN Radio\", \"Fox Sports Radio\" and \"TSN Radio\"; and \"The Sports Network (TSN)\"; and websites such as ESPN.com, Foxsports.com, and Yahoo! Sports.\n\nMajor League Baseball gave print journalists a special role in its games. They were named official scorers and kept statistics that were considered part of the official record of league. Active sportswriters were removed from this role in 1980. Although their statistical judgment calls could not affect the outcome of a game in progress, the awarding of errors and wins/saves were seen as powerful influences on pitching staff selections and play lists when coach decisions seemed unusual. The removal of writers, who could benefit fiscally from sensational sports stories, was done to remove this perception of a conflict of interest, and to increase statistics volume, consistency, and accuracy.\n\nSports stories occasionally transcend the games themselves and take on socio-political significance: Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier in baseball is an example of this. Modern controversies regarding the hyper-compensation of top athletes, the use of anabolic steroids and other, banned performance-enhancing drugs, and the cost to local and national governments to build sports venues and related infrastructure, especially for Olympic Games, also demonstrates how sports can intrude on to the news pages.\n\nSportswriters regularly face more deadline pressure than other reporters because sporting events tend to occur late in the day and closer to the deadlines many organizations must observe. Yet they are expected to use the same tools as news journalists, and to uphold the same professional and ethical standards. They must take care not to show bias for any team.\n\nThe tradition of sports reporting attracting some of the finest writers in journalism can be traced to the coverage of sport in Victorian England, where several modern sports – such as association football, cricket, athletics and rugby – were first organized and codified into something resembling what we would recognize today.\n\nAndrew Warwick has suggested that The Boat Race provided the first mass spectator event for journalistic coverage. The Race, an annual rowing event between the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford, has been held annually from 1856.\n\nCricket, possibly because of its esteemed place in society, has regularly attracted the most elegant of writers. The \"Manchester Guardian\", in the first half of the 20th century, employed Neville Cardus as its cricket correspondent as well as its music critic. Cardus was later knighted for his services to journalism. One of his successors, John Arlott, who became a worldwide favorite because of his radio commentaries on the BBC, was also known for his poetry.\n\nThe first London Olympic Games in 1908 attracted such widespread public interest that many newspapers assigned their very best-known writers to the event. The \"Daily Mail\" even had Sir Arthur Conan Doyle at the White City Stadium to cover the finish of the Marathon.\n\nSuch was the drama of that race, in which Dorando Pietri collapsed within sight of the finishing line when leading, that Conan Doyle led a public subscription campaign to see the gallant Italian, having been denied the gold medal through his disqualification, awarded a special silver cup, which was presented by Queen Alexandra. And the public imagination was so well caught by the event that annual races in Boston, Massachusetts, and London, and at future Olympics, were henceforward staged over exactly the same, 26-mile, 385-yard distance used for the 1908 Olympic Marathon, and the official length of the event worldwide to this day.\n\nThe London race, called the Polytechnic Marathon and originally staged over the 1908 Olympic route from outside the royal residence at Windsor Castle to White City, was first sponsored by the \"Sporting Life\", which in those Edwardian times was a daily newspaper which sought to cover all sporting events, rather than just a betting paper for horse racing and greyhounds that it became in the years after the Second World War.\n\nThe rise of the radio made sports journalism more focused on the live coverage of the sporting events. The first sports reporter in Great Britain, and one of the first sports reporters in the World, was an English writer Edgar Wallace, who made a report on The Derby on June 6, 1923 for the British Broadcasting Company.\n\nIn France, \"L'Auto\", the predecessor of \"L'Equipe\", had already played an equally influential part in the sporting fabric of society when it announced in 1903 that it would stage an annual bicycle race around the country. The Tour de France was born, and sports journalism's role in its foundation is still reflected today in the leading rider wearing a yellow jersey - the color of the paper on which \"L'Auto\" was published (in Italy, the Giro d'Italia established a similar tradition, with the leading rider wearing a jersey the same pink color as the sponsoring newspaper, \"La Gazzetta\").\n\nAfter the Second World War, the sports sections of British national daily and Sunday newspapers continued to expand, to the point where many papers now have separate standalone sports sections; some Sunday tabloids even have sections, additional to the sports pages, devoted solely to the previous day's football reports. In some respects, this has replaced the earlier practice of many regional newspapers which - until overtaken by the pace of modern electronic media - would produce special results editions rushed out on Saturday evenings.\n\nSome newspapers, such as \"The Sunday Times\", with 1924 Olympic 100 metres champion Harold Abrahams, or the London \"Evening News\" using former England cricket captain Sir Leonard Hutton, began to adopt the policy of hiring former sports stars to pen columns, which were often ghost written. Some such ghosted columns, however, did little to further the reputation of sports journalism, which is increasingly becoming the subject of academic scrutiny of its standards.\n\nMany \"ghosted\" columns were often run by independent sports agencies, based in Fleet Street or in the provinces, who had signed up the sports star to a contract and then syndicated their material among various titles. These agencies included Pardons, or the Cricket Reporting Agency, which routinely provided the editors of the Wisden cricket almanac, and Hayters.\n\nSportswriting in Britain has attracted some of the finest journalistic talents. The \"Daily Mirror\"'s Peter Wilson, Hugh McIlvanney, first at \"The Observer\" and lately at the \"Sunday Times\", Ian Wooldridge of the \"Daily Mail\" and soccer writer Brian Glanville, best known at the \"Sunday Times\", and columnist Patrick Collins, of the \"Mail on Sunday\", five times the winner of the Sports Writer of the Year Award.\n\nMany became household names in the late 20th century through their trenchant reporting of often earth-shattering events that have transcended the back pages and been reported on the front pages: the Massacre at the Munich Olympics in 1972; Muhammad Ali's fight career, including his 1974 title bout against George Foreman; the Heysel Stadium disaster; and the career highs and lows of the likes of Tiger Woods, George Best, David Beckham, Lester Piggott and other high-profile stars.\n\nMcIlvanney and Wooldridge, who died in March 2007, aged 75, both enjoyed careers that saw them frequently work in television. During his career, Wooldridge became so famous that, like the sports stars he reported upon, he hired the services of IMG, the agency founded by the American businessman, Mark McCormack, to manage his affairs. Glanville wrote several books, including novels, as well as scripting the memorable official film to the 1966 World Cup staged in England.\n\nSince the 1990s, the growing importance of sport, its impact as a global business and the huge amounts of money involved in the staging of events such as the Olympic Games and football World Cups, has also attracted the attention of investigative journalists. The sensitive nature of the relationships between sports journalists and the subjects of their reporting, as well as declining budgets experienced by most Fleet Street newspapers, has meant that such long-term projects have often emanated from television documentary makers.\n\nTom Bower, with his 2003 sports book of the year \"Broken Dreams\", which analyzed British football, followed in the tradition established a decade earlier by Andrew Jennings and Vyv Simson with their controversial investigation of corruption within the International Olympic Committee. Jennings and Simson's \"The Lords of the Rings\" in many ways predicted the scandals that were to emerge around the staging of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City; Jennings would follow-up with two further books on the Olympics and one on FIFA, the world football body.\n\nLikewise, award-winning writers Duncan Mackay, of \"The Guardian\", and Steven Downes unravelled many scandals involving doping, fixed races and bribery in international athletics in their 1996 book, \"Running Scared\", which offered an account of the threats by a senior track official that led to the suicide of their sports journalist colleague, Cliff Temple.\n\nBut the writing of such exposes - referred to as \"spitting in the soup\" by Paul Kimmage, the former Tour de France professional cyclist, now an award-winning writer for the \"Sunday Times\" – often requires the view of an outsider who is not compromised by the need of day-to-day dealings with sportsmen and officials, as required by \"beat\" correspondents.\nThe stakes can be high when upsetting sport's powers: in 2007, England's FA opted to switch its multimillion-pound contract for UK coverage rights of the FA Cup and England international matches from the BBC to rival broadcasters ITV. One of the reasons cited was that the BBC had been too critical of the performances of the England football team.\n\nIncreasingly, sports journalists have turned to long-form writing, producing popular books on a range of sporting topics, including biographies, history and investigations. Dan Topolski was the first recipient of the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award in 1989, which has continued to reward authors for their excellence in sports literature.\n\nMost countries have their own national association of sports journalists. Many sports also have their own clubs and associations for specified journalists. These organizations attempt to maintain the standard of press provision at sports venues, to oversee fair accreditation procedures and to celebrate high standards of sports journalism.\n\nThe International Sports Press Association, AIPS, was founded in 1924 during the Olympic Games in Paris, at the headquarters of the Sporting Club de France, by Frantz Reichel, the press chief of the Paris Games, and the Belgian Victor Boin. AIPS operates through a system of continental sub-associations and national associations, and liaises closely with some of the world's biggest sports federations, including the International Olympic Committee, football's world governing body FIFA, and the IAAF, the international track and field body. The first statutes of AIPS mentioned these objectives:\n\nFor horse racing the Horserace Writers and Photographers’ Association was founded in 1927, was revived in 1967, and represents the interests of racing journalists in every branch of the media.\n\nIn Britain, the Sports Journalists' Association was founded in 1948. It stages two awards events, an annual Sports Awards ceremony which recognizes outstanding performances by British sportsmen and women during the previous year, and the British Sports Journalism Awards, the industry's \"Oscars\", sponsored by UK Sport and presented each March. Founded as the Sports Writers' Association, following a merger with the Professional Sports Photographers' Association in 2002, the organization changed its title to the more inclusive SJA. Its president is the veteran broadcaster and columnist Sir Michael Parkinson. The SJA represents the British sports media on the British Olympic Association's press advisory committee and acts as a consultant to organizers of major events who need guidance on media requirements as well as seeking to represent its members' interests in a range of activities. In March 2008, Martin Samuel, then the chief football correspondent of \"The Times\", was named British Sportswriter of the Year, the first time any journalist had won the award three years in succession. At the same awards, Jeff Stelling, of Sky Sports, was named Sports Broadcaster of the Year for the third time, a prize determined by a ballot of SJA members. Stelling won the vote again the following year, when the \"Sunday Times\"'s Paul Kimmage won the interviewer of the year prize for a fifth time.\n\nIn the United States, the Indianapolis-based National Sports Journalism Center monitors trends and strategy within the sports media industry. The center is also home to the Associated Press Sports Editors, the largest group of sports media professionals in the country.\n\nIn more recent years, sports journalism has turned its attention to online news and press release media and provided services to Associated Press and other major news syndication services. This has become even more apparent with the increase in online social engagement. This has led to an increasing number of freelance journalism in the sports industry and an explosion of sports related news and industry websites.\n\nThrough the 1970s and '80s, a rise in \"citizen journalism\" in Europe was witnessed in the rapid growth in popularity of soccer \"fanzines\" - cheaply printed magazines written by fans for fans that bypassed often stilted official club match programs and traditional media. Many continue today and thrive.\n\nSome authors, such as Jim Munro, have been adopted by their clubs. Once an editor of the West Ham United fanzine \"Fortune's Always Dreaming\", Munro was hired by the club to write for its matchday magazine and is now sports editor of \"The Sun\" Online. Other titles, such as the irreverent monthly soccer magazine \"When Saturday Comes\", have effectively gone mainstream.\n\nThe advent of the internet has seen much of this fan-generated energy directed into sports blogs. Ranging from team-centric blogs to those that cover the sports media itself, Bleacher Report, Deadspin.com, ProFootballTalk.com, BaseballEssential.com, Tireball Sports, AOL Fanhouse, Masshole Sports, the blogs in the Yardbarker Network, and others have garnered massive followings.\n\nBlogging has also been taken up by former athletes such as Curt Schilling, Paula Radcliffe, Greg Oden, Donovan McNabb, and Chris Cooley.\n\nSince the beginning of smartphones and the use of applications, sports media has taken off and has become accessible from almost anywhere at any time. Not only can fans check the scores on different apps such as ESPN and Global Sports Media, but people can use social media apps as well to find out different scores. These apps give score updates, rosters, game schedules, injury updates, and much more right when it happens. People can get real time results right from their phone. They do not need to be at the game, or right by their television, to see how their favorite team is doing. Now people can stream games right from their phone.\n\nThis type of fast, easy information is very important to sports fans. As stated in a Time magazine, “Enthusiastic fans are eager for updates on their favorite teams and the opportunity to rant about what went wrong in the playoffs or why their coach should be fired”. Many people want to discuss matters about sports, teams and games, and this article shows that with the sports apps, the news can be found at a moment’s notice.\n\nThanks to the smartphone, a fan no longer has to wait for scores or search the web for information on players. All the information is available at the palm of their hand. Sports apps do not always have to be about giving scores, as some applications include workout helpers, rule books, and even games. The workout apps can show how the professionals’ workout and can give inspiration to do the same workout. The rule books are important, because it spreads the knowledge about the game, and it can get people interested in new games. The games apps are a good way of teaching people how the game is played, and can give players a bigger interest in a specific sport. All of these different apps are a part of sports media in the form of using smartphones and apps. This helps spread information about sports to anyone who wants it.\n\nSmartphones can not only be used just for scores, they can also help athletes become known and recruited. These days most everything is caught on camera, and that includes great plays made by athletes. Once a video is taken it will be spread through the social media sites in no time.\n\nThe number of women in the sports journalism industry is rapidly growing, and this has caused a lot of controversy in recent years. Many traditionalists believe that the sporting industry should be predominately for men, and female journalists have endured a lot of criticism for breaking the mold.\n\nThere has been an ongoing debate as to whether or not female reporters should be allowed in the locker rooms after games. If they are denied access, this gives male reporters a competitive advantage in the field, as they can interview players in the locker room after games. If locker room access is denied to all reporters - male and female - because of this controversy, male journalists would likely resent female reporters for having their access taken away.\n\nSome breakthrough female reporters include Adeline Daley (whom some consider the \"Jackie Robinson of female sportswriters\"), Anita Martini, Tracy Dodds, Mary Garber, Lesley Visser and Sally Jenkins.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41657493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41657493", "title": "Sweatpants", "text": "Sweatpants\n\nSweatpants are a casual variety of soft trousers intended for comfort or athletic purposes, although they are now worn in many different situations. In the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa they are known as tracksuit bottoms or joggers. In Australia, they are also commonly known as trackpants, trackies or tracky daks.\n\nThe first pair of sweatpants was introduced in the 1920s by Émile Camuset, the founder of Le Coq Sportif. The sweatpants were simple knitted gray jersey pants that allowed athletes to stretch and run comfortably.\n\nSweatpants are usually made from cotton or polyester, often of a heavy knit. They often have elastic in the waistband, drawstrings, and may or may not have pockets. Some sweatpants can also feature elasticized cuffs at the hem of the leg. Sweatpants are traditionally ash gray in color but are now available in most colors. Traditionally quite \"baggy\" and loose, sweatpants are now also available in more form-fitting shapes; moreover they have flexibility and comfort. In addition, this design traps less heat than most conventional, lightweight trousers, which may be a disadvantage in some conditions such as cold temperatures and an advantage in others such as body heat–increasing aerobic activities. Warmer varieties can be made from polar fleece.\n\nOnce these practical pants were only worn for sporting events and at home. Now, they are available in many fashionable styles and are worn in a variety of public situations. Because of their comfort and fashion, they have become a popular choice of clothing. The sweatpant may come from many different materials and in many forms including thick and thin. The sweatpant is sometimes associated with certain lifestyles such as gym culture or hip-hop culture. This niche-specific perception of the sweatpant since the 1980s has at times resulted in extensive dress code regulations with some outlets outright banning the wearing of sweatpants on their premises; including some German cafes and a substantial amount of nightclubs worldwide.\n\nThere are many variations on the sweatpant design that have evolved to define their own categories of athletic pants. These variations include fashion pants, windpants, tearaway pants, and muscle pants.\n\nFashion pants typically refers to fashion conscious sportswear. These pants are often made from a variety of materials, like velvet or satin, and in many color combinations or patterns. One distinguishing characteristic is that fashion pants generally lack the elastic band at the ankles.\n\nWindpants are similar to sweatpants but are lighter and shield the wearer from cold wind rather than insulate. Windpants are typically made of polyester or nylon, with a liner made of cotton or polyester. The nylon material's natural friction against both itself and human legs makes \"swooshing\" sounds during walking. Windpants often have zippers on each ankle, letting athletes unzip the end of each leg, allowing the pants to be pulled over their footwear.\nTearaway pants, also known as \"breakaway pants\", \"rip-off pants\", or \"popper pants\" are closely related to windpants. Tearaway pants are windpants with snap fasteners running the length of both legs. The snaps allow athletes to remove their tearaway pants in a timely manner to compete in some sports. Basketball and track and field are the two sports most commonly associated with tearaway pants.\n\n"}
{"id": "31240382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31240382", "title": "Technology doping", "text": "Technology doping\n\nTechnology doping is a new term that has been becoming more popular recently in sports. Technology doping is the practice of gaining a competitive advantage using sports equipment. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) considers prohibiting technologies if they are \"performance-enhancing\" or \"being against the spirit of the sport\". In 2006, WADA initiated a consultation on technology doping which is now officially recognised as a threat, whilst the decision to allow or ban a new technology, specifically relating to sports equipment, is the responsibility of each sport’s own governing body.\n\nSince most sports require equipment of some sort, it can be tricky to determine what is technology doping and what is not. The governing authorities of different sports usually make judgment calls about the technological advances in their sport’s equipment. Technological advancements are often allowed unless the governing authorities feel they threaten the integrity of the sport. \nA report released immediately before the 2012 Summer Olympics quotes an extensive public survey that shows that people fear that sports engineering could: overshadow the triumph of human spirit and effort, make certain sports easier, create unfairness so the \"best athletes\" might not win, and ensure that rich athletes and countries have an advantage over the poor ones.\n\nThe LZR Racer has been one of the most discussed technologies accused of being technology doping. The LZR Racer bodysuit by Speedo is a high-performance swimsuit. It is made with a material that was designed to mimic shark skin. The suit allows for better oxygen flow to the muscles, holds the body in a more hydrodynamic position, and traps air which adds buoyancy.\n\nAt the 2008 Beijing Olympics, this suit was worn by many swimmers. In fact, some swimmers wore two or more of these suits at once to increase buoyancy. In total, 23 out of the 25 swimming world records broken at the Beijing Olympics were broken by swimmers wearing this suit.\n\nSome people thought these suits might be so technologically advanced that using them in competition was essentially technology doping. After the Beijing Olympics and subsequent swimming events, at which many world records were broken by swimmers wearing the LZR suit, FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) banned all body-length swimsuits. Men's suits could only maximally cover from the waist to the knee. Women's suits could only cover from shoulder to knee. They also stipulated that the fabric used to make the suits must be a “textile” and the suit could not have fastening devices, such as zippers. These new rules took effect in January 2010.\n\nA New Zealand firm has created “IonX shirts” which are made of a material that claims to contain a negatively charged electromagnetic field. It further claims that the shirt helps increase blood flow, which in turn helps deliver more oxygen to the muscles and remove lactic acid from the muscles more quickly. For the moment, this technology is still legal. The World Anti-Doping Agency has ruled that since there is no scientific publication that confirms the material actually changes the body’s ion charges or enhances performance and also the material does not contain prohibited substances, this technology is not banned as of now.\n\nResearchers at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, an Australian science agency, created a garment that can monitor movement and give feedback. For example, a basketball player can wear the material in the form of a sleeve. Then sensors in the material send information to a computer when the player takes shots and responds with audible tones. The material essentially gives the athlete real-time feedback on their movements. Athletes can learn patterns of tones that indicate successful or unsuccessful movements and use these to make improvements. The material helps correct the athlete’s movement and helps the athlete gain muscle memory so they can continue to perform well once the material is taken away.\n\nIn cycling, mechanical doping is the use of a secret motor to propel the bicycle. It is banned by the Union Cycliste Internationale. One of the first allegations of mechanical doping was in the 2010 Tour of Flanders. The first confirmed use of mechanical doping was at the 2016 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. Bike inspections have become commonplace in road racing since the 2015 season. Riders found guilty of mechanical doping are subject to a fine ranging from 20,000 to 200,000 Swiss Francs and a suspension of at least six months. In the 2016 Tour de France, French officials utilized thermal cameras to enforce their policy against mechanical doping.\n\nAmputees can compete in the Paralympic Games using artificial limbs. There has been significant debate on whether the artificial limbs confer an advantage over able-bodied athletes and whether athletes using them can participate in the Olympic Games. There has also been debate on the effect of the length of the artificial limbs in the Paralympic Games.\n\nMany sports set standards for equipment, to prevent unfair advantages between competitors. This often involves the types of materials the equipment is made from or dimensions/sizes. For example, tennis racquets must not exceed the maximum length and width limits. Soccer balls must not exceed weight limits. Golf clubs must fit shape regulations.\n\n\n"}

He holds Permanent residency in Canada, and his ancestors are the Shizoku in Tosa Province, Japan as well as a distant relative of Roy Kiyooka.\n\nKiyooka firmly believed that the Japan national football team needed players who had experiences playing for clubs in European leagues to develop the national team. In 2006, he passed the FIFA Players' Agent exam and registered with The Football Association (England), the Royal Dutch Football Association (Netherlands) and the Japan Football Association as an official agent. After that, he represented top Japanese players such as Keisuke Honda, Maya Yoshida and led them to the football clubs in European leagues.\n\nIn 2009, Kiyooka was designated as a chief operating officer of the Japan Pro-Footballers Association (JPFA) by Toshiya Fujita, a chairman of the board. He repealed the unfair transfer regulations between the clubs of J.League and the professional players in 2009 and formed the organization as a trade union in 2011. Also, he represented the players of the Japan national football team to protect their rights and payments.\n\nIn 2005, Kiyooka collaborated with NTT Communications to create the football site called Nippon World Soccer on the mobile internet services (i-mode, EZweb) in Japan. The mobile football site acquired over one million users a month in 2006 and became the biggest football mobile site in Japan at that time.\n\n"}

Athletes, singers, actors and others warm up before stressing their muscles. It prepares the muscles for vigorous actions.\n\nA warm up generally consists of a gradual increase in intensity in physical activity (a \"pulse raiser\"), joint mobility exercise, and stretching, followed by the activity. For example, before running or playing an intensive sport, the athlete might slowly jog to warm their muscles and increase their heart rate. It is important that warm ups be specific to the activity, so that the muscles to be used are activated. The risks and benefits of combining stretching with warming up are disputable, although it is generally believed that warming up prepares the athlete both mentally and physically. In a meta-study of 32 high quality studies, about 4/5 ths of the studies showed improvements in performance.\n\nWarm-up programs can improve the strength of the knee muscle, which, in turn, may decrease injuries.\nA comprehensive warm-up program did not significantly decrease injuries in football compared to a control group.\n\nIn baseball, warm up swings using a standard weight bat are effective in increasing batting speed. \n\nStretching is part of some warm up routines, although a study in 2013 indicates that it weakens muscles in that situation. There are 3 types of stretches: ballistic stretching, dynamic, and static stretching:\n\n\nIn Germany, Switzerland and Austria they use this noun in a second context: psychologists and similar professionals are working with \"warming ups\" in therapeutical or learning sessions before starting or after a break; those warming ups are various interaction games, role playing, moving in the class room and so on. \n\n"}

It can be applied to teams in team sports, and individuals in individual sports. In sports where teams or individuals represent groups such as countries or regions, those groups can also be said to have 'winning streaks' if their representatives win consecutive games or competitions, even if the competitors are different. Streaks can also be applied to specific competitions: for example a competitor who wins an event in three consecutive Olympic Games has an Olympic winning streak, even if they have lost other competitions during the period.\n\nThe longest recorded winning streak in any professional sports is Pakistan's Jahangir Khan's 555 consecutive wins in squash from 1981 to 1986. In 2013, the Dutch wheelchair tennis player Esther Vergeer retired with an active 10-year-long winning streak of 470 matches, including a streak of 250 consecutive sets won.\n\n3 consecutive titles at FAI World Aerobatic Championships — Russia\n\n3 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games — Klaus Dibiasi\n\n7 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games — United States\n\n11 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games — United States\n\n3 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games — China\n\n7 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games — United States\n\n8 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games — United States\n\n4 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games — China\n\n3 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games — China\n\n5 consecutive gold medals at World Championships — China\n\n3 consecutive gold medals at World Championships\n\n6 consecutive gold medals at World Championships — United States\n\n3 consecutive gold medals at World Championships — Greg Louganis\n\n5 consecutive gold medals at World Championships — China\n\n3 consecutive gold medals at World Championships — United States\n\n5 consecutive gold medals at World Championships — Guo Jingjing\n\n7 consecutive gold medals at World Championships — China\n\n3 consecutive gold medals at World Championships — China\n\n7 consecutive titles at World Championships — China\n\n7 consecutive titles at World Championships — China\n\nWeissmuller never lost a swimming race during his entire amateur career, including three individual Olympic gold medals.

He later reclaimed the record).\n\nMatthes was undefeated in the 100 and 200 meter backstroke races from 1968-1974, though he lost the world record in races he did not compete in during that span. He later lost both records for good at the end of his career when he earned a bronze in the 100m backstroke behind John Naber, who also set the world record in the 200m backstroke.\n\nSalnikov won all 61 of his 1500m freestyle races from 1977 to 1986.

schedule overhaul, NASCAR will differentiate records from pre-1972 and post-1972. The primary schedule overhaul eliminated midweek races, thus cutting the schedule from 48 to around 30 races (36 currently), and a minimum race distance (first , later shortened to ). Since many pre-1972 races were under 100 miles (such as 62.5 mile races held in Islip, New York, and the current non-championship Budweiser Duel then being a championship race at 100 miles until 1967), some NASCAR records are differentiated that way, similar to the NBA differentiating \"fewest points\" records with pre and post-1954 records, when the 24-second shot clock was introduced.\n\n4 wins (tie) (length of shortest race, in miles, in brackets):\n\nNote: In seven of the eight instances, at least one of the wins was in a 500-mile race. Mark Martin's 1993 streak ended at Darlington, where the Mountain Dew Southern 500 was stopped 16 laps early because of darkness.\n\n\n64 games — 1936-1972 United States\n\n7 Consecutive Men's titles at Olympic Games — United States\n\n6 Consecutive Women's titles at Olympic Games — United States\n\n33 games — 1971–72 Los Angeles Lakers\n\n111 games — Connecticut\n\nNote: The Wayland Baptist College women's basketball team achieved a winning streak of 131 games which started November 7, 1953 and ended March 20, 1958 (defeated 46–42 by Nashville Business School). However, a national organizing structure for women's intercollegiate basketball did not exist until the AIAW was established in 1971; the NCAA did not begin organizing women's sports until 1981. Wayland Baptist instead played in competitions sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union.\n\nBy NCAA convention, the \"regular season\" does not include games in conference tournaments or in any national postseason tournament.\n\n86 games — Connecticut\n\n56 games and counting— Ashland University\n88 games — Washington (MO)\n\n88 games — Winnipeg (MB)\nThe Lady Wesmen would go on to a record 118-1 in the span from 1992-1995, including 3 CIS (now U Sports) national basketball championships and beating several NCAA Women's Division I programs in North American tournaments.\n\n88 games — UCLA\n\nBy NCAA convention, the \"regular season\" does not include games in conference tournaments or in any national postseason tournament.\n\n74 games — UCLA\n\n129 games — Kentucky\n\n57 games — Winona State University\n\n60 games — SUNY Potsdam\n\n105 games — Athinaikos\n\n80 games — Aris Thessaloniki\n\n2 consecutive titles — Japan\n\n9 consecutive titles — Cuba\n\n26 games — New York Giants\n\nNote: The Giants tied the Pirates in the second game of a doubleheader 1–1 on September 18, 1916. Major League Baseball excludes all games which end in ties from their official statistics.\n\nThe longest winning streak in Major League Baseball that does not include a tie is 22 games, achieved by the Cleveland Indians in 2017, which is also the longest winning streak in the American League. The National League record for consecutive wins without a tie is 21 games, by the 1935 Chicago Cubs.\n\n24 consecutive winning decisions — Carl Hubbell, New York Giants\n\nNote: Hubbell's streak was achieved in 27 games as he also pitched three no-decisions.

Brazil's loss at the 1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup was by the under-23 (Olympic) team, but is officially counted as a loss of the national team. Otherwise the Brazil national team wouldn't lose until 30 May 1997 (2:4 vs Norway), thus extending it to 45 games.\n\nJuly 22, 1995 was the 1995 Copa América Final and the 27th match of their Unbeaten streak, even though Brazil lost the Final and thus the Match on Penalties, the Official record only counts it as a Draw since in normal time it finished at 1-1.\n\n\n51 games — 1920–1923 AC Sparta Prague\n32 games — 2001–2003 Al-Faisaly\n\n29 games — 1971–1973 S.L.
