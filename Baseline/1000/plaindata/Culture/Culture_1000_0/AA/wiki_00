{"id": "17312062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17312062", "title": "Anorexia mirabilis", "text": "Anorexia mirabilis\n\nAnorexia mirabilis, also known as holy anorexia or inedia prodigiosa, is an eating disorder, similar to that of anorexia nervosa, that was common in the Middle Ages in Europe, largely affecting Catholic nuns. Sufferers claim they're motivated to restrict their food intake in order to achieve a holier state and would often engage in rituals designed to cause themselves pain and suffering.\n\nAnorexia mirabilis is primarily characterized by the refusal to eat, resulting in starvation, malnutrition, and oftentimes, death, but differs from anorexia nervosa in that the disease is associated with religion as opposed to personal aesthetics. Though anorexia mirabilis is, by definition, connected to religion, particularly Catholicism, sufferers have been known to defy the orders of their religious superior to cease fasting and their refusal to eat sometimes preceded their involvement in religious activities. Additionally, sufferers engaged in worrisome and bizarre behaviors designed to cause them pain, so that they might be reminded of Jesus Christ's suffering, and desired to appear unattractive in hopes of avoiding marriage and sexual contact.\n\nThe earliest reported sufferer of anorexia mirabilis is St. Wilgefortis, a legendary princess who reportedly lived sometime between the 8th century and 10th century in Galicia, who starved herself and took a vow of chastity to avoid an arranged marriage. She asked for God to make her ugly and she subsequently grew excessive facial and body hair, which is a common symptom of malnutrition in women. Her suitor rejected her based on her appearance and so, as punishment for sabotaging the union, her father, the king of Portugal, had her crucified. For her suffering, she was venerated in the Catholic Church.\n\nThough the disease was most prominent during the Middle Ages, modern cases do exist. Notably, in 2014, medical researchers published an article about the case of an unidentified woman in her sixties, born in Chicago, Illinois, who'd suffered from anorexia mirabilis. The woman entered a convent at the age of 13 and began to restrict her eating in hopes of achieving sainthood.\n\n\n\"Anorexia mirabilis\" has in many ways, both similarities to and clear distinctions from the more modern, well-known \"anorexia nervosa\".\n\nIn anorexia nervosa, people usually starve themselves to attain a level of thinness, as the disease is associated with body image distortion. In contrast, \"anorexia mirabilis\" was frequently coupled with other ascetic practices, such as lifelong virginity, flagellant behavior, the donning of hairshirts, sleeping on beds of thorns, and other assorted penitential practices. It was largely a practice of Catholic women, who were often known as \"miraculous maids\".\n\nThe anorexia nervosa of the 20th century has historical correlates in the religiously inspired cases of \"anorexia mirabilis\" in female saints, such as Catherine of Siena (1347–1380) in whom fasting denoted female holiness or humility and underscored purity. The investigation of anorexia nervosa in the 20th century has focused on the psychological, physiological, and various other factors.\n\nFor Caroline Walker Bynum (\"Holy Feast and Holy Fast\"), \"anorexia mirabilis\", rather than misdiagnosed anorexia, was a legitimate form of self-expression with motives set in contrast to the modern disease paradigm. She considers cases such as that of Julian of Norwich and other Christian anchorites, as using fasting as a legitimate means for communing with Christ.\n\nJoan Jacobs Brumberg (\"Fasting Girls: The History of Anorexia Nervosa\") suggests that \"anorexia mirabilis\" no longer exists not because the motives of those who starve themselves have changed, but because the paradigms for coding these behaviors have shifted. If a young woman were to make the decision to self-starve as a means to communicate with Christ, healthcare professionals would code her as anorexia nervosa regardless of her motives.\n\nWhether or not there is historical continuity between \"anorexia mirabilis\" and anorexia nervosa is a subject of debate with both medieval historiographers and the psychiatric community. Some have argued that there is historical continuity between the two conditions, while others maintain that \"anorexia mirabilis\" should be comprehended as a distinct medieval form of female religious piety within the historical context of such societies.\n\nAnorexia mirabilis was frequently accompanied by behaviors most medical professionals today would find worrisome and dangerous. Angela of Foligno was known to eat the scabs of the poor and Catherine of Siena was known to drain the pus from of sick individuals into a cup to drink.\n\nMany women notoriously refused all food except for the holy Eucharist, signifying not only their devotion to God and Jesus, but also demonstrating, to them, the separation of body and spirit. That the body could exist for extended periods without nourishment gave people of the time a clear picture of how much stronger, and therefore how much more important, the spirit was. It mattered not in popular opinion that the reported periods of female fasting were impossibly long (from months to many years) and simply added to the allure of this very specifically female achievement.\nBoth Angela of Foligno (1248–1309) and Catherine of Siena (1347–1380) were reportedly \"anorexia mirabilis\" sufferers. They both refused food, but drank the pus from the sores of the sick. Angela of Foligno is reported to have said it was as \"sweet as the Eucharist\", and also to have eaten the scabs and lice from those same patients, though precious little else.\n\nIn the time of Catherine of Siena, celibacy and fasting were held in high regard. Ritualistic fasting was both a means to avoid gluttony (one of the seven deadly sins), and to atone for past sins. Catherine initially fasted as a teenager to protest an arranged marriage to her late sister Bonaventura's husband. Bonaventura herself had taught this technique to Catherine, refusing to eat until her husband showed better manners. Fasting then was a means of exercising some control, taking power back for the individual and as such it is similar to one of the underlying factors in anorexia nervosa today. This, women could gain more freedom and respect remaining virgins than they would becoming wives. Catherine managed to pursue her interests in theology and papal politics, opportunities less likely available to a wife and mother. \n\nAny additional food she was forced to eat she would expel through vomiting induced by pushing a twig or small branch down her throat.\n\nMarie of Oignies (1167–1213) reportedly lived as a hermit, wore only white, cut off pieces of her body to expunge her desire, and both she and Beatrice of Nazareth claimed that not only did the smell of meat make them vomit, but also that the slightest whiff of food would cause their throats to close up entirely.\n\nA gang of would-be rapists got as far as removing the clothing of Columba of Rieti (1467–1501), but they retreated as she had mutilated her breasts and hips so thoroughly with spiked whipping chains that they were unable or unwilling to continue. Columba did eventually starve herself to death.\n\nAuthor Giles Tremlett has suggested that Catherine of Aragon was anorexic.\n\nMany of these women claimed that they possessed at least some measure of spiritual enlightenment from their asceticism. They variously claimed to feel \"inebriation\" with the sacramental wine, \"hunger\" for God, and conversely, that they sat at the \"delicious banquet of God\".\n\nMargaret of Cortona (1247–1297) believed she had extended communications with God himself. Columba of Rieti believed her spirit \"toured the holy land\" in visions, and virtually every one of these women was apparently possessed of some level of psychic prowess. These women's exercises in self-denial and suffering did yield them a measure of fame and notoriety. They were said to alternately be able to make a feast out of crumbs, exude oil from their fingertips, heal with their saliva, fill barrels with drink out of thin air, lactate even though virginal and malnourished, and perform other miracles of note.\n\nThe practice of \"anorexia mirabilis\" faded out during the Renaissance, when it began to be seen by the Church as heretical, socially dangerous, or possibly even Satanically inspired. It managed to survive in practice until nearly the 20th century, when it was overtaken by its more popularly known counterpart, \"anorexia nervosa\".\n\nContemporary accounts of \"anorexia mirabilis\" do exist, most notably that of a fundamentalist Christian girl in Colombia, as reported by medical anthropologist Carlos Alberto Uribe.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5398628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5398628", "title": "Bread and salt", "text": "Bread and salt\n\nBread and salt is a welcome greeting ceremony in several Slavic and other European cultures and in Middle Eastern cultures. The tradition, known by local Slavic names: Belarusian: \"Хлеб і соль\"; ; ; ; / \"Hleb i so\"; ; ; ; ; , was also adopted by three non-Slavic nations — Lithuanians, Latvians (both Baltic) and Romanians (Latin) — all three of which are culturally and historically close to their Slavic neighbours (. and ). It is also common in Albania (), Armenia (, \"agh u hats\"), the Jewish diaspora, and the Middle East. This tradition has also been observed in spaceflight.\n\nBread, salt and heart () is a traditional Albanian way of honoring guests, it dates back from the Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini Chapter 18 - para.608: \"The Guest shall be welcomed with Bread, salt and heart\". Heart in the context is related with hospitality, the concept is based on giving the most expensive thing of that time which was salt to the awaited guest. Nowadays it is not commonly practiced during daily life.\n\nWhen important, respected, or admired guests arrive, they are presented with a loaf of bread (usually a korovai) placed on a \"rushnyk\" (embroidered ritual cloth). A salt holder or a salt cellar is placed on top of the bread loaf or secured in a hole on the top of the loaf. On official occasions, the \"bread and salt\" is usually presented by young women dressed in national costumes (e.g., sarafan and kokoshnik).\n\nThe tradition gave rise to the Russian word that expresses a person's hospitality: \"khlebosolny\" (literally: \"bready-salty\"). In general, the word \"bread\" is associated in Russian culture with hospitality, bread being the most respected food, whereas salt is associated with long friendship, as expressed in a Russian saying \"to eat a pood of salt (together with someone)\". Also historically the Russian Empire had a high salt tax that made salt a very expensive and prized commodity (see also the Moscow uprising of 1648).\nThere also is a traditional Russian greeting \"Khleb da sol!\" (\"Хлеб да соль!\" \"Bread and salt!\"). The phrase is to be uttered by an arriving guest as an expression of good wish towards the host's household. It was often used by beggars as an implicit hint to be fed, therefore a mocking rhymed response is known: \"Khleb da sol!\" — \"Yem da svoy!\" (\"Хлеб да соль\" — \"ем да свой!\" \"Bread and salt!\" — \"I am eating and it is my own!\").\nIn the Russian Orthodox Church, it is customary to greet the bishop at the steps of the church when he arrives for a pastoral visit to a church or monastery with bread and salt.\n\nBread and salt (, transliterated \"hlyab i sol\") is a traditional Bulgarian custom expressing hospitality, showing that the guest is welcomed. The bread and salt is commonly presented to guests by a woman. Bulgarians usually make a certain type of bread for this occasion called \"pogacha\", which is flat, fancy, and decorated. Regular bread is not usually used, although it may have been historically, but \"pogacha\" is much more common in this custom.\n\nUsually, guests are presented with the \"pogacha\", and the guest is supposed to take a small piece, dip into the salt and eat it. This custom is common for official visits regardless of whether the guest is foreign or Bulgarian. One notable example of this custom is when the Russians came to liberate Bulgaria from the Ottomans at the end of the 19th century. A common scene from that period was of a Bulgarian village woman welcoming Russian soldiers with bread and salt as a sign of gratitude.\n\nThis tradition is still practiced in the Czech Republic (\"chléb a sůl\") and Slovakia (\"chlieb a soľ\") for special occasions, for example, when presidents from other countries are visiting. It is not commonly practiced during daily life.\n\nIn Poland, welcoming with bread and salt (\"\"chlebem i solą\") is often associated with the traditional hospitality (\"staropolska gościnność\"\") of the Polish nobility (\"szlachta\"), who prided themselves on their hospitality. A 17th-century Polish poet, Wespazjan Kochowski, wrote in 1674: \"O good bread, when it is given to guests with salt and good will!\" Another poet who mentioned the custom was Wacław Potocki. The custom was, however, not limited to the nobility, as Polish people of all classes observed this tradition, reflected in old Polish proverbs. Nowadays, the tradition is mainly observed on wedding days, when newlyweds are greeted with bread and salt by their parents on returning from the church wedding.\n\nIn the Republic of Macedonia, this tradition still is practiced occasionally as a custom expressing hospitality. A certain type of bread, similar to that in Bulgaria and also by the same name — \"pogača\" (from Latin \"panis focacius\") is prepared.\n\nThe famous Macedonian and ex-Yugoslav ethno-jazz-rock group of even more famous world music guitarist, Vlatko Stefanovski, had the name \"Leb i Sol\", which means \"bread and salt\" and speaks itself about this term of hospitality as something basic and traditional.\n\nAs in Slavic countries, bread and salt is a traditional Romanian custom expressing hospitality, showing that the guest is welcomed.\n\nBread and salt (\"hleb i so\") is a traditional welcoming of guests, being customary to offer it before anything else, with bread having an important place in Serbian tradition, used in rituals. The traditional bread, \"pogača\", is a symbol of family unity and goodness, and salt prosperity and security for the guest. It is part of the state protocol, in use since the Principality of Serbia, often used when welcoming foreign representatives.\n\nIn Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, bread and salt were traditionally given as a symbol of blessing for a new home. Instead of white bread, dark fiber-rich rye bread was used.\n\nBread and salt are given away for different reasons:\n\nIn northern Germany and Bohemia (Czech Republic) bread and salt are traditionally put into the diaper of a newborn. In Transylvania bread and salt are served to protect against weather demons.\n\nArab culture also have a concept of \"bread and salt\" (خبز وملح or عيش وملح) but not in the context of welcoming, but as an expression of alliance by eating together, symbolizing the rapprochement between two persons. Eating bread and salt with a friend is considered to create a moral obligation which requires gratitude. This attitude is also expressed by Arab phrases such as \"there are bread and salt between us\" (بيننا خبز وملح or بيننا عيش وملح), and \"salt between them\" (بينهما ملح) which are terms of alliance.\n\nThe practice exists also among Jews in the Diaspora and in Israel. The ceremony of Kiddush includes dipping a piece of Challah in salt. Bread and salt are also used in welcoming ceremonies and given to the welcomed persons. It is common in Israel for a landlord or real estate agent to leave bread and salt in the home to welcome new tenants, as these should be the first things brought into a new home.\n\nIt is an important part of the culture. It is given on all good occasions: during weddings, house warming parties, and childbirth.\n\nIn Northern England and Scotland the tradition is observed on New Year's Day, where the first individual to enter a house may be required by tradition to bring bread, salt and coal.\n\nWith the advent of the Soviet space program, this tradition has spread into space, where appropriately small packages of bread and salt are used nowadays. It was observed at the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project and the Salyut programme, when crackers and salt tablets were used in the spaceship. Bread chunks and salt were a welcome at the Mir space station, a tradition that was extended on the International Space Station. Bread and salt are also a welcome for cosmonauts returning to Earth.\n\nThe custom of serving bread and salt to guests is a recurring reference in George R. R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" novels, where the welcome ritual serves as not only as a Westerosi tradition of hospitality but also a formal assurance of \"guest right\", a sacred bond of trust and honor guaranteeing that nobody in attendance, hosts and guests alike, shall be harmed. Violating the guest right is widely considered among the highest moral crimes, an affront worthy of the worst damnation, rivaled only by kinslaying. Game of Thrones, the associated television series, prominently features the tradition in season three, episode 9, \"The Rains of Castamere.\" Rival noble houses Stark and Frey are meeting to discuss a marriage alliance. The Starks fear betrayal by the Freys, but their worries are assuaged when the most important members of each house eat bread and salt from the same platter, establishing guest right, although the Freys eventually break the oath by murdering most of the Starks present at the wedding.\n\nIn Season 2, Episode 4 of Peaky Blinders, Alfie Solomons offers Charles Sabini bread and salt as Sabini offers a white flag of truce. \n\nRudyard Kipling referenced bread and salt in a number of works. In \"The Ballad of East and West\", leavened bread and salt is mentioned as binding an oath of blood brothership. At the beginning of \"Puck of Pook's Hill\" Puck establishes his credentials with the child protagonists by asking them to sprinkle plenty of salt on their shared meal. \"\"That'll show you the sort of person I am.\"\n\nIn Rosemary Sutcliff's historical novel Outcast, bread and salt is referred to as a sign of belonging to a tribe: \"You are my people, my own people, by hearth fire and bread and salt\".\n\nIn the \"Count of Monte Cristo\" by Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 72 is titled \"Bread and Salt.\" The character Mercedes attempts to coax the main character into eating fruit, as part of an Arabian custom to ensure that those who have shared food and drink together under one roof would be eternal friends. \n\nIn D.R. Merrill's 2014 science fiction novel \"Lamikorda\" the Alplai greet the leaders of the Terran colony vessel with a ritual meal of foods representing their major cultures, including bread from the Saakh; one of the Terrans then presents a small container of sea salt, which is graciously accepted and added as a symbol of their friendship.\n\nBread and salt are given as a housewarming gift in one scene of the 1946 film \"It's A Wonderful Life\".\n\n"}
{"id": "4097096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4097096", "title": "Captivity (animal)", "text": "Captivity (animal)\n\nAnimals that are held by humans and prevented from escaping are said to be in captivity. The term is usually applied to wild animals that are held in confinement, but may also be used generally to describe the keeping of domesticated animals such as livestock or pets. This may include, for example, animals in farms, private homes, zoos and laboratories. Animal captivity may be categorized according to the particular motives, objectives and conditions of the confinement.\n\nThroughout history not only domestic animals as pets and livestock were kept in captivity and under human care, but also wild animals. Some were failed domestication attempts. Also, in past times, primarily the wealthy, aristocrats and kings collected wild animals for various reasons. Contrary to domestication, the ferociousness and natural behaviour of the wild animals were preserved and exhibited. Today's zoos claim other reasons for keeping animals under human care: conservation, education and science.\n\nCaptive animals, especially those not domesticated, sometimes develop abnormal behaviours.\n\nOne type of abnormal behaviour is \"stereotypical behaviors\", i.e. repetitive and apparently purposeless motor behaviors. Examples of stereotypical behaviours include pacing, self-injury, route tracing and excessive self-grooming. These behaviors are associated with stress and lack of stimulation. Many who keep animals in captivity attempt to prevent or decrease stereotypical behavior by introducing stimuli, a process known as environmental enrichment.\n\nA type of abnormal behavior shown in captive animals is self-injurious behavior (SIB). Self-injurious behavior indicates any activity that involves biting, scratching, hitting, hair plucking, or eye poke that may result in injuring oneself. Although its reported incidence is low, self-injurious behavior is observed across a range of primate species, especially when they experience social isolation in infancy. Self-bite involves biting one’s own body—typically the arms, legs, shoulders, or genitals. Threat bite involves biting one’s own body—typically the hand, wrist, or forearm—while staring at the observer, conspecific, or mirror in a threatening manner. Self-hit involves striking oneself on any part of the body. Eye poking is a behavior (widely observed in primates) that presses the knuckle or finger into the orbital space above the eye socket. Hair plucking is a jerking motion applied to one’s own hair with hands or teeth, resulting in its excessive removal.\n\nThe proximal causes of self-injurious behavior have been widely studied in captive primates; either social or nonsocial factors can trigger this type of behavior. Social factors include changes in group composition, stress, separation from the group, approaches by or aggression from members of other groups, conspecific male individuals nearby, separation from females, and removal from the group. Social isolation, particularly disruptions of early mother-rearing experiences, is an important risk factor. Studies have suggested that, although mother-reared rhesus macaques still exhibit some self-injurious behaviors, nursery-reared rhesus macaques are much more likely to self-abuse than mother-reared ones. Nonsocial factors include the presence of a small cut, a wound or irritant, cold weather, human contact, and frequent zoo visitors. For example, a study has shown that zoo visitor density positively correlates with the number of gorillas banging on the barrier, and that low zoo visitor density caused gorillas to behave in a more relaxed way. Captive animals often cannot escape the attention and disruption caused by the general public, and the stress resulting from this lack of environmental control may lead to an increased rate of self-injurious behaviors.\n\nOn top of self inflicted harm, some animals exhibit harm towards others and internal psychological harm. This can be exhibited in various forma, such as Orca whales, which never have killed a human in the wild, killing two of its own trainers. Psychological tics can also be identified, ranging from swaying to head bobbing to pacing. Continuous inbreeding is also bringing out mental disadvantages, such as crossed eyes and infertility.\n\nStudies suggest that many abnormal captive behaviors, including self-injurious behavior, can be successfully treated by pair housing. Pair housing provides a previously single-housed animal with a same-sex social partner; this method is especially effective with primates, which are widely known to be social animals. Social companionship provided by pair housing encourages social interaction, thus reducing abnormal and anxiety-related behavior in captive animals as well as increasing their locomotion.\n\nAnimal husbandry\nPet keeping\n\nAnimal welfare \n\nWild animal keeping\n\n"}

It is culturally accepted in parts of the Balkans, the Middle East, the Central Asian region of Afghanistan, and the South Asian region of Pakistan. In regions such as Puerto Rico and continental areas of the United States it is practiced illegally, especially on holidays like New Year's Eve.\n\nCommon occasions for celebratory gunfire include New Year's Day as well as religious holidays such as Eid. The practice may result in random death and injury from stray bullets. Property damage is sometimes another result of celebratory gunfire; shattered windows and damaged roofs are often found after such celebrations.\n\nBullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall.\n\nA study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that 80% of celebratory gunfire-related injuries are to the head, feet, and shoulders. In Puerto Rico, about two people die and about 25 more are injured each year from celebratory gunfire on New Year's Eve, the CDC says. Between the years 1985 and 1992, doctors at the King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, treated some 118 people for random falling-bullet injuries. Thirty-eight of them died.\n\nFirearms expert Julian Hatcher studied falling bullets in the 1920s and calculated that .30 caliber rounds reach terminal velocities of 90 m/s (300 feet per second or 186 miles per hour).\nA bullet traveling at only 61 m/s (200 feet per second) to 100 m/s (330 feet per second) can penetrate human skin.\n\nIn 2005, the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA) ran education campaigns on the dangers of celebratory gunfire in Serbia and Montenegro.\nIn Serbia, the campaign slogan was \"every bullet that is fired up, must come down.\"\n\nBullets often lodge in roofs, causing minor damage that requires repair in most cases. Normally, the bullet will penetrate the roof surface through to the roof deck, leaving a hole where water may run into the building and cause a leak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe non-fiction U.S. cable television program \"MythBusters\" on the Discovery Channel covered this topic in Episode 50: \"Bullets Fired Up\" (original airdate: April 19, 2006). Special-effects experts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman conducted a series of experiments to answer the question: \"Can celebratory gunfire kill when the bullets fall back to earth?\"\n\nUsing pig carcasses, they worked out the terminal velocity of a falling bullet and had a mixed result, answering the question with all three of the show's possible outcomes: Confirmed, Plausible and Busted. They tested falling bullets by firing them from both a handgun and a rifle, by firing them from an air gun designed to propel them at terminal velocity, and by dropping them in the desert from an instrumented balloon.\n\nThey found that while bullets traveling on a perfectly vertical trajectory tumble on the way down, creating turbulence that reduces terminal velocity below that which would kill, it was very difficult to fire a bullet in a near-ideal vertical trajectory. In practice, bullets were likely to remain spin-stabilized on a ballistic trajectory and fall at a potentially lethal terminal velocity. They also verified cases of actual deaths from falling bullets.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "596663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=596663", "title": "Clinical lycanthropy", "text": "Clinical lycanthropy\n\nClinical lycanthropy is defined as a rare psychiatric syndrome that involves a delusion that the affected person can transform into, has transformed into, or is a non-human animal. Its name is associated with the mythical condition of lycanthropy, a supernatural affliction in which humans are said to physically shapeshift into wolves. It is purported to be a rare disorder.\n\nAffected individuals believe that they are in the process of transforming into an animal or have already transformed into an animal. It has been associated with the altered states of mind that accompany psychosis (the mental state that typically involves delusions and hallucinations) with the transformation only seeming to happen in the mind and behavior of the affected person.\n\nA study on lycanthropy from the McLean Hospital reported on a series of cases and proposed some diagnostic criteria by which lycanthropy could be recognised:\n\n\nAccording to these criteria, either a delusional belief in current or past transformation or behavior that suggests a person thinks of themselves as transformed is considered evidence of clinical lycanthropy. The authors note that, although the condition seems to be an expression of psychosis, there is no specific diagnosis of mental or neurological illness associated with its behavioral consequences.\n\nIt also seems that lycanthropy is not specific to an experience of human-to-wolf transformation; a wide variety of creatures have been reported as part of the shape-shifting experience. A review of the medical literature from early 2004 lists over thirty published cases of lycanthropy, only the minority of which have wolf or dog themes. Canines are certainly not uncommon, although the experience of being transformed into a hyena, cat, horse, bird or tiger has been reported on more than one occasion. Transformation into frogs, and even bees, has been reported in some instances. In Japan, transformation into foxes and dogs was usual (, ). A 1989 case study described how one individual reported a serial transformation, experiencing a change from human to dog, to horse, and then finally cat, before returning to the reality of human existence after treatment. There are also reports of people who experienced transformation into an animal only listed as \"unspecified\".\n\nThere is a case study of a psychiatric patient who had both clinical lycanthropy and Cotard delusion. The term \"ophidianthropy\" refers to the delusion that one has been transformed into a snake. Two case studies have been reported.\n\nClinical lycanthropy is a rare condition and is largely considered to be an idiosyncratic expression of a psychotic episode caused by another condition such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or clinical depression.\n\nHowever, there are suggestions that certain neurological conditions and cultural influences may result in the expression of the human-animal transformation theme that defines the condition.\n\nOne important factor may be differences or changes in parts of the brain known to be involved in representing body shape (e.g., see proprioception and body image). A neuroimaging study of two people diagnosed with clinical lycanthropy showed that these areas display unusual activation, suggesting that when people report their bodies are changing shape, they may be genuinely perceiving those feelings.\n\nIn rare cases, individuals may believe that other people have transformed into animals. This has been termed \"lycanthropic intermetamorphosis\" and \"lycanthropy spectrum\". A 2009 study reported that, after the consumption of the drug MDMA (Ecstasy), a man displayed symptoms of paranoid psychosis by claiming that his relatives had changed into various animals such as a boar, a donkey and a horse.\n\nCatherine Clark Kroeger has written that several parts of the Bible refer to King Nebuchadnezzar's behavior in the book of Daniel 4 as a being manifestation of clinical lycanthropy. Neurologist Andrew J. Larner has written that the fate of Odysseus's crew due to the magic of Circe may be one of the earliest examples of clinical lycanthropy.\n\nAlso, it is believed that the king of Armenia Tiridates III also suffered from this disorder. He was cured by Gregory the Illuminator. As a sign of gratitude, Tiridates proclaimed Christianity as the state religion during 301, thus making Armenia the first Christian state.\n\nAccording to Persian tradition, the Buyid prince Majd ad-Dawla was suffering from an illusion that he was a cow. He was cured by Avicenna.\n\nNotions that lycanthropy was due to a medical condition go back to the seventh century, when the Alexandrian physician Paulus Aegineta attributed lycanthropy to Melancholia or an \"excess of black bile\". During 1563, a Lutheran physician named Johann Weyer wrote that werewolves suffered from an imbalance in their melancholic humour and exhibited the physical symptoms of paleness, \"a dry tongue and a great thirst\" as well as sunken, dim and dry eyes. Even King James VI and I in his 1597 treatise \"Daemonologie\" does not blame werewolf behaviour on delusions created by the Devil but \"an excess of melancholy as the culprit which causes some men to believe that they are wolves and to 'counterfeit' the actions of these animals\". The perception of an association between mental illness and animalistic behaviour can be traced throughout the history of folklore from many different countries.\n\n"}

{"id": "50693529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50693529", "title": "Critical consumerism", "text": "Critical consumerism\n\nCritical consumption is the conscious choice of buying or not buying a specific product according to ethical and political beliefs. The critical consumer recognizes the importance of considering some characteristics of the product and its realization, such as environmental sustainability and respect of workers’ rights. Indeed, critical consumers take full responsibility for the environmental, social and political effects of their choices. The critical consumer can sympathize with certain social movement goals and contributes towards them through modifying their consumption behavior.\n\nWork on critical consumption has differed in the terms used to refer to boycotting and buycotting actions. The more prominent include ethical consumption and political consumerism, while sustainable consumption, more linked with policy, has also increased in usage.\n\nOften consumer and citizen are considered as different because consumers only show self-interest, whereas citizens denote expanded self-interest. The general idea is that, consumers ‘buy what they want—or what they have been persuaded to want—within the limits of what they can get. Citizenship, on the other hand, carries duties or responsibilities along with various rights. Since consumers are seen also as citizens they have to behave in a community-oriented, moral and political way, rather than as a self-interested one.\n\nA specificity of critical consumption is the political use of consumption, which is the consumers’ choice of “\"producers and products with the aim of changing ethically or politically objectionable institutional or market practices\"”. Their choices depend on different factors as non economic issues that concern personal and family well-being, issue of fairness, justice, ethical or political assessment. Main forms and tools of political use of consumption are boycotting, \"buycotting\" (anti-boycotting) and also culture jamming or adbusting.\n\nPolitical consumerism can be considered as an alternative form of political engagement, especially for young generations. In addition, market-based political strategies of young citizens go beyond boycotting and “buycotting”; they also started to participate in internet campaigns becoming active consumers. Their individual choices become political movements able to challenge political and economic powers. Therefore, as a political actor, the consumer “is seen as directly responsible not only for him or herself but also for the world”. The phenomenon of political consumerism takes into account social transformations like globalization, the ever-increasing role of the market and individualization.\n\nStudies from the UK (Harrison et al. 2005, Varul and Wilson-Kovacs 2008, Zaccai 2007), Germany (Baringhorst et al. 2007; Lamla and Neckel 2006), Italy (Forno 2006, Tosi 2006, Sassatelli 2010), France (Chessel and Cochoy 2004, Dubuisson-Queller 2009), North America (Johnston et al. 2011, Johnston and Bauman 2009, Johnston 2008) and Scandinavia (Micheletti et al. 2004) argued that consumes are becoming increasingly politicized according to the boycott and buycott principles. In particular, Scandinavian people seems to be more committed in political consumerism, for example Sweden increased his average of boycotting episodes from 15 percent in 1987 to 29 percent in 1997.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to consider that even if a growing number of citizens are turning to the market to express their political and moral concerns, it is difficult to assess whether political consumerism can also be considered as a meaningful or effective form of political participation.\n\nThe chase for a fair consumption has deep roots in consumption history, starting for example with the American Revolution. Sympathizers of the American cause, in those years, refused to buy English goods, to support colons rebellion. This act of conscious choice can be seen as the beginning of both critical and political consumption. Traces of these two concepts can be found at the turn of the nineteenth century, in the United States, where the National Consumer League promoted the so-called “Whitelists”, in which all the companies that treated fairly their employees were listed.\n\nAt the end of the century, also the first forms of political activism in consumption took place in the United States and Europe, like the “Dont Buy Jewish” boycotts. Several organizations were born in those times and in the following centuries, asking the consumers to join the mobilizations as active subjects.\n\nA variety of discourses about the “duty” and the “responsibilities” of social actors arose after the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle. People were explicitly asked to think that to shop is to vote.\n\nBoycotting and \"buycotting\" (Anti-boycott), as a particularly self-conscious form of consumption, are expressions of an individual’s political, ethical or environmental stance. Both boycotting and \"buycotting\" are discrete acts of critical consumption and they are mutually contingent. In fact, if the use-value or utility of a product is important, then it is difficult to view them as separate actions.\n\nBoycotting refers to abstaining from buying, avoiding specific products or brands to punish companies for undesirable policies or business practices. \"Buycotting\" is a term coined by Friedman (1996); it refers to “positive buying” that aims to foster corporations that represent values – fair trade, environmentalism, sustainable development – that consumers choose to support.\n\nWhen one boycotts a product or service, it does not mean that he abstains from consuming at all, but that he may select an alternative product or service. Equally, a choice to \"buycott\" could be understood as including a rejection or boycott of the non-ethical alternative. This interdependence is useful to explain the traditional pairing of boycotting and \"buycotting\" in much analysis of consumer politics.\n\nOne of the rising types of boycotting is the ad hoc one, which underlines the importance of consumers as political subjects. These initiatives show that critical consumption is really impacting in special occasions, gaining much more visibility than everyday boycotts. An example of this type of events is the Buy Nothing Day (BND).\n\nThe notion of sustainability has both a temporal dimension demonstrated by the trade-off between present and future generations, and a justice dimension which considers the different distribution of harm and benefit. Under the term sustainability, notions of sustainable resource consumption by recycling, environmental protection, animal welfare, social justice, and climate responsibilities are gathered.\n\nAlthough the \"good\" purposes of critical consumerism there are some critics and pitfalls connected to this practice of consumption: \n\n\nThere are many examples of critical consumerism:\n\n\n\n"}

The changes are often unexpected, unexplained or not understandable due to various types of cultural dynamics.\n\nStudies into cultural dissonance take on a wide socio-cultural scope of analysis that inquire into economics, politics, values, learning styles, cultural factors, such as language, tradition, ethnicity, cultural heritage, cultural history, educational formats, classroom design, and even socio-cultural issues such as ethnocentricism, racism and their respective historical legacies in the cultures.\n\nResearch topics in cultural dissonance tend to be interdisciplinary drawing from a wide range of disciplines and applying the findings to equally diverse fields and industries.\n\nEdward J. Hedican wrote an article in the Department of Sociology & Anthropology at the University of Guelph, Ontario. In it he noted the possibility of alleviating acculturative pressures, and their disruptive effects on the sense of aboriginal sense of worth and identity.

Previous research suggests that a link exists between the officers' depth of feeling of spirituality & the officers' attitude toward the effectiveness traditional methods of social control; however, this research goes a step further & examines the impact of cultural dissonance on the stressors faced by Navajo police officers. The enforcement behavior of the Navajo officers was used as a proxy for the intensity of their feelings concerning the usefulness of traditional vs European-based forces of social control; the underlying assumption being tested is that self-determination is not only a state of law but a state of psychological being. A snowball method of sample development was used to select officers for intensive interviews. The findings suggest that the officers' feeling of spiritual connectedness to his/her culture is inversely related to the strictness of the enforcement of European-based laws. In other words, the more spiritual the officer, the less likely the officer is to rely solely on European-based laws, & the greater the reliance on other methods of problems solving. The finding also suggest that in addition to the stressors normally encounter by all police officers, Navajo officers faced additional stressors that are specific to indigenous officers policing in indigenous communities. 1 Table, 41 References.

Although experiences of explicit exclusion or racial discrimination were virtually nonreported, some women felt a strong sense of cultural conformity to Anglo-centric expectations of behavior. The women's stories & experiences suggest that women from culturally diverse backgrounds have found few opportunities to express their cultural distinctiveness through mainstream Australian sports such as netball.

{"id": "3100304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3100304", "title": "Dark tourism", "text": "Dark tourism\n\nDark tourism (also black tourism or grief tourism) has been defined as tourism involving travel to places historically associated with death and tragedy. More recently, it was suggested that the concept should also include reasons tourists visit that site, since the site's attributes alone may not make a visitor a \"dark tourist\". Thanatourism, derived from the ancient Greek word \"thanatos\" for the personification of death, refers more specifically to peaceful death; it is used in fewer contexts than the terms \"dark tourism\" and \"grief tourism\". The main attraction to dark locations is their historical value rather than their associations with death and suffering.\n\nWhile there is a long tradition of people visiting recent and ancient settings of death, such as travel to gladiator games in the Roman colosseum, attending public executions by decapitation, and visiting the catacombs, this practice has been studied academically only relatively recently.\nTravel writers were the first to describe their tourism to deadly places. P. J. O'Rourke called his travel to Warsaw, Managua, and Belfast in 1988 'holidays in hell', or Chris Rojek talking about 'black-spot' tourism in 1993 or the 'milking the macabre'.\n\nAcademic attention to the subject originated in Glasgow, Scotland: The term 'dark tourism' was coined in 1996 by Lennon and Foley, two faculty members of the Department of Hospitality, Tourism & Leisure Management at Glasgow Caledonian University, and the term 'thanatourism' was first mentioned by A. V. Seaton in 1996, then Professor of Tourism Marketing at the University of Strathclyde.\n\nAs of 2014, there have been many studies on definitions, labels, and subcategorizations, such as Holocaust tourism and slavery-heritage tourism, and the term continues to be molded outside academia by authors of travel literature. There is very little empirical research on the perspective of the dark tourist. \nDark tourism has been formally studied from three main perspectives by a variety of different disciplines:\n\nScholars in this interdisciplinary field have examined many different aspects. Lennon and Foley expanded their original idea in their first book, deploring that \"tact and taste do not prevail over economic considerations” and that the \"blame for transgressions cannot lie solely on the shoulders of the proprietors, but also upon those of the tourists, for without their demand there would be no need to supply.\"\n\nPhilip Stone and Richard Sharpley from the Department of Tourism and Leisure Management of the Lancashire Business School at the University of Central Lancashire, UK have looked through the lens of the market place at dark tourism; they have coined the term 'product of dark tourism', and discuss its supply, demand, and consumption by the 'dark tourist'. Stone and Sharpley have published prolifically in this area, although not conducted empirical research, and founded an Institute for Dark Tourism. \nIn 2005 Stone suggested that \"within contemporary society people regularly consume death and suffering in touristic form, seemingly in the guise of education and/or entertainment\", and sounded a call for research on \"Dark Tourism Consumption\" to \"establish consumer behavior models that incorporate contemporary socio-cultural aspects of death and dying.\" In a 2006 paper Stone discussed \"the dark tourism product range\", arguing that \"certain suppliers [of dark tourism] may [...] share particular product features, perceptions and characteristics, which can then be loosely translated into various 'shades of darkness'.\" His typology of death-related tourist sites consists of seven different types, ordered from light to dark: dark fun factories, dark exhibitions, dark dungeons, dark resting places, dark shrines, dark conflict sites and dark camps of genocide.\n\nIn 2008 Stone and Sharpley hypothesized, that coming together in places associated with grief and death in dark tourism represents immorality, so that morality may be communicated.\n\nWhether a tourist attraction is educational or exploitative is defined by both its operators and its visitors. Tourism operators motivated by greed can \"milk the macabre\" or reexamine tragedies for a learning experience. Tourists consuming dark tourism products may desecrate a place and case studies are needed to probe who gains and loses.\n\nThanatourism and slum-tourism have been described as re-interpreting the pastime according to the needs of financial elite.\n\nChris Hedges described the \"Alcatraz narrative as presented by the National Park Service\" as \"whitewashing\", because it \"...ignores the savagery and injustice of America's system of mass incarceration\". By omitting challenging details, the park service furthers a \"Disneyfication\", per Hedges.\n\nDestinations of dark tourism include: castles and battlefields such as Culloden in Scotland and Bran Castle and Poienari Castle in Romania; former prisons such as Beaumaris Prison in Anglesey, Wales and the Jack the Ripper exhibition in the London Dungeon; sites of natural disasters or man made disasters, such as Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Japan, Chernobyl in Ukraine and the commercial activity at Ground Zero in New York one year after September 11, 2001. It also includes sites of human atrocities and genocide, such as the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall in China, the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum in Cambodia; the sites of the Jeju Uprising in South Korea and the Spirit Lake Internment Camp Centre near La Ferme, Quebec as an example of Canada's internment operations of 1914–1920.\n\nIn Bali \"death and funeral rites have become commodified for tourism ..., where enterprising businesses begin arranging tourist vans and sell tickets as soon as they hear someone is dying.\" In the US, visitors can tour the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C. \"with an identity card which matches their age and gender with that of a name and photo of a real holocaust victim. Against a backdrop of video interpretation portraying killing squads in action, the pseudo holocaust victim enters a personal ID into monitors as they wander around the attraction to discover how their real-life counterpart is faring.\"\n\nIn late 2017, the online journal \"Current Issues in Dark Tourism Research\" was launched. The aim of the online journal is to bring affordable 'dark tourism' scholarship direct to students, researchers, and the media. The journal is unique in that it pays royalty fees to authors and, as a result, is a new model for contemporary academic publishing. Authors and scholars may submit their own related research for publication in the journal. A broad range of 'dark tourism and difficult heritage' research will be available in the journal, in the form of articles, case studies, and commentaries. The editor of the journal is Dr Philip Stone.\n\n\n"}

Others include Le Corbusier's \"Vers une architecture\", and Victor Papanek's \"Design for the real world\" (1972).\n\nIn a 'principles' approach to design theory, the De Stijl movement promoted a geometrical abstract, \"ascetic\" form of purism that was limited to functionality. This modernist attitude underpinned the Bauhaus movement. Principles were drawn up for design that were applicable to all areas of modern aesthetics.\n\nFor an introduction to the philosophy of design see the article by Per Galle at the Royal Danish Academy.\n\nAn example of early design science was Altshuller's \"Theory of inventive problem solving\", known as TRIZ, from Russia in the 1940s. Herbert Simon's 1969 \"The sciences of the artificial\" began a more scientific basis to the study of design.

Author Alan Lance Andersen created \"Elfland Catacombs\" as a children's fantasy adventure, using the Commodore BASIC computer language. The plot involved the reader visiting an aunt in the border country of Scotland and becoming lost after crossing into Elfland with the help of an elf named Jennings.

Major journals in the field are \"Poetics: Journal of Empirical Research on Culture, the Media and the Arts\", \"\", and \"Scientific Study of Literature\".\n\nThe empirical study of literature attracts scholarship particularly in the areas of reception and audience studies and in cognitive psychology when it is concerned with questions of reading. In these two areas research and studies based on the framework are steadily growing. Further fields where the framework in various revised and expanded versions attracts scholarship is (comparative) cultural studies and pedagogy. One of several dictionary definitions of the field is as follows:\n\n“Movement within the study of literature concerned with the study of literature as a social system of [inter]actions. The main question is what happens to literature: it is written, published, distributed, read, censored, imitated, etc. The empirical study of literature originated as a reaction to, and an attempt at, solving the basic problem of hermeneutics; that is, how the validation of literary interpretation can be demonstrated. From reception theory it had already become clear that interpretations are not only tied to the text, but also, and even to a great extent, to the reader — both in terms of the individual and of social conventions. This led to the theory of radical (cognitive) constructivism, based on the thesis that the subject largely construes its empirical world itself. The logical consequence of all this, to be seen in the work of Siegfried J. Schmidt, is the separation of interpretation and the strictly scientific study of literature based on radical constructivism. The literary system of actions is observed from the outside — not experienced — and roughly characterized as depending on two conventions (hypotheses) that are tested continually. These conventions are the aesthetic convention (as opposed to the convention of facts in the daily language of reference) and the polyvalence convention (as opposed to the monovalency in the daily empirical world). Thus, the object of study of the empirical study of literature is not only the text in itself, but the roles of action within the literary system, namely, production, distribution, reception, and the processing of texts. The methods used are primarily taken from the social sciences, reception theory, cognitive science, psychology, etc. In general the steps to be taken in empirical research are the formation of a hypothesis, putting it into practice, testing, and evaluation. More concretely, for the study of reader response a wide array of techniques are used, ranging from protocol techniques and thinking aloud protocol to pre-structured techniques, such as the semantic seven point scale (C. Osgood) and the classification technique (card sorting), and forms of content analysis, discourse analysis, association techniques, etc. Some objections often raised to the empirical study of literature are the triviality of many of its research results such as confirmation of what was already known or suspected or its reductionism (artificiality of the framework and set-up, and limitation to reader response instead of the study of the text). It is clear, however, that the empirical study of literature by its specific approach of the object and its focus on methodology is an outstanding way to explore the socio-cultural aspects of the literary system. It makes an irreplaceable contribution to the development of a more rational, scientific, and socially relevant study of literature.” \n\n\n"}

Literary epiphanies are, \"puzzled but privileged moments, sudden gifts of vision, when one’s feeling of aliveness intensifies and the senses quicken.” The term epiphany as a literary device was not given that term until the author James Joyce gave it that term to the short stories he wrote between 1898 and 1904 which was central to his early work. Joyce derived the word from the Greek word 'epiphany' that means the manifestation of a deity or a sudden realisation. The term epiphany as a literary device has become popular among English speakers.\n\nEpiphany as a word is derived from the ancient Greek word \"epiphaneia\" \"manifestation, striking appearance, festival held in commemoration of the appearance of a god at some particular place.\" It also has religious connotations in the early fourteenth century meaning \"festival of the manifestation of Christ to the gentiles\" and in the New Testament meaning an \"advent manifestation of Christ.\" Christians denoted from epiphany the meaning of a \"visible manifestation of a hidden divinity either in the form of a personal appearance, or by some deed of power by which its presence may be known.\" As a verb the word means \"to display or show forth\" and when used in the passive voice it translates to \"shine forth.\" \n\nThe novel, \"Dubliners\" by James Joyce is a collection of short stories published on June 1914. The short stories capture some of Joyce's most unhappiest moments in life that he connects to the physical place of Dublin. Dublin, to Joyce seemed to him to be the centre of paralysis in which he explains in a letter to Grant Richards, who was the publisher of \"Dubliners\" Joyce explains his purpose and intention behind writing the novel:\"My intention was to write a chapter of the moral history of my country and I chose Dublin for the scene because that city seemed to me the centre of paralysis. I have tried to present it to the indifferent public under four of its aspects: childhood, adolescence, maturity and public life. The stories are arranged in this order. I have written it for the most part in a style of scrupulous meanness and with the conviction that he is a very bold man who dares to alter in the presentment, still more to deform, whatever he has seen and heard.\"Epiphanies are a main literary device employed within the fifteen short stories in \"Dubliners\" and tend to circulate around moments of realisation of despair and disillusionment. Epiphanies employed by Joyce are often described as \"a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mind — the manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly logical relevance of whatever produces it.\" The epiphanies in \"Dubliners\" in particular follow a common theme of loss and regret that are intertwined with death and despair that emerge from Joyce's very own childhood in Ireland. Epiphanies as a structural tool in \"Dubliners\" helps bring the narrative to a climax as the epiphany is formed throughout the story through the protagonists pain and reflection upon their experiences.\n\nAraby is the third short story in \"Dubliners\" that centres around the narrator recollecting on an experience of when he was a young boy where he experienced a moment of epiphanic disillusionment. The story narrates in first person a young boy who is infatuated with a girl who remains unnamed and is referred to as, \"Mangan's sister.\" The narrator is infatuated with her even though he has never truly spoken to her, yet he claims that her name was, \"like a summons to all my foolish blood.\" When the narrator learns of how Mangan's sister wishes to go to Araby, which is a bazaar that she cannot go to due to other religious obligations the narrator believes that if he can bring her back a gift that she would return his feelings. However, when the time came to go to the bazaar the narrator is delayed because he needs his uncle to lend him some money although the uncle forgot about it and so the narrator heads out late to the bazaar.\n\nUpon arrival to the bazaar, most of the stalls are closed as he is late. The narrator is confronted by what he is seeing in front of him and he turns away from Araby after his vision and expectations of it are destroyed with the banal reality of it that is presented to him. In turn, he becomes disillusioned with his idealisation of Mangan's sister as well. In the last sentence this notion is captured: \"Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger\" where his realisation becomes an epiphanic moment. He now views the world differently as he now realises his own vanity and stupidity as he now has more self-awareness of himself.\n\nEveline centres around the character of the same name who has been given a chance to escape her life with a man called Frank who is in love with her, however, Eveline's family is the cause of her paralysis. Her mother and brother have died, one of her brothers is always away and her father is an abusive drunkard. It could be assumed that her father's nature would provide greater reason for her to leave but when the opportunity arises for her to escape she simply cannot as she states that \"it was impossible\" as she realises her situation. Eveline feels with Frank that, \"all the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her into them: he would drown her. She gripped with both hands at the iron railing...No! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy. Amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish.\" This is Eveline's epiphany that she cannot escape even though she wanted to she cannot leave behind her familial ties.\n\nA Little Cloud is a part of the Dubliners short story collection centring around the protagonist, Little Chandler who reunites with an old friend, Ignatius Gallaher who is a more worldly man than himself. Little Chandler wishes to change his life, but the harsh reality of Dublin intrudes upon his hopes and in his moment of epiphany when he realises that it is useless to try to change his reality. Little Chandler's first epiphany begins when he reunites with Gallaher who is successful in the world after he left Dublin. During this conversation between the two men is when Little Chandler realises and starts to believe that the only way to be successful in life is to leave Dublin. Little Chandler then returns home to a house full of hate and regret where he his wife controls him and he does not love her and who made him give up what he does love - poetry.\n\nUpon his return home, he looks into a photograph of his wife as he looks, \"coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they answered coldly,\" back to him. He feels a deep rush of despair and regret for marrying his wife as he realises that, \"\"dull resentment against his life awoke within him\".\" His child begins to cry and wail whilst Little Chandler was pondering his life and he finds he does not know what to do to make the child stop. The wife eventually rushes in and scolds Little Chandler: \"\"'What have you done to him?'\" This is when the final epiphany starts to form itself as he looks into her eyes and his \"heart closed together\"\" upon gazing into her cold eyes. The last sentence capsulises the epiphany as, \"Little Chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of the lamplight. He listened while the paroxysm of the child's sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes.\" The tears of remorse that begin to fill up his eyes are symbolic of his emotion of regret for his life and the uselessness his feels in never being able to change the trajectory of his life in the way that he wants.\n\nThe short story \"The Dead\" express the paralysis of the epiphany Joyce’s character Gabriel experiences in discovering his wife’s grief over her first love. The line \"\"It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life,\"” provides a tonal shift from Gabriel lusting after his wife to being dumbstruck by the realisation that he may not be enough for his wife. When Gretta (wife) listens to D’Arcy singing \"The Lass of Aughrim\", she is reminded of her first love’s death. Gabriel realises that while he has been lusting after her she has been comparing him to another man. This section of the story is influenced by Joyce’s love of Irish music.\n\nWilliam Wordsworth was a Romantic poet in the 1800s. He became a renowned poet with his collaboration with Samual Taylor Coleridge when they wrote the collection of poems together, the \"Lyrical Ballads\". In Wordsworth's time, epiphanies had not yet been given that term and were referred to by Wordsworth as \"spots of time.\" There is an agreement that the modern term for the literature device \"epiphany\" began with Romanticism and in particular with the works of William Wordsworth. Wordsworth's innovation of \"spots of time\" in his poems have affected modern fiction and the modern short story.\n\nThe main plot points of \"The Prelude\" centre around the exploration of epiphany through what Wordsworth is trying to express as being vital to the history of his imagination. Two central themes to \"The Prelude\" are of childhood and memory and the adventures that Wordsworth has had as a child in the Lake District. These memories are how he recollects on these moments of his childhood in his adult life is where his 'spots of time' or epiphanies as they are more commonly referred to, arise from.\n\nIn the twelfth book of \"The Prelude\", Wordsworth in his poem elaborates on the experience of the rejuvenating virtue that is given to him through his epiphanic moments that he recalls from childhood experience. \"There are in our existence spots of time,/ That with distinct pre-eminence retain,/ A renovating virtue, whence--depressed/ By false opinion and contentious thought,/ Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight,/ In trivial occupations, and the round/ Of ordinary intercourse--our minds/ Are nourished and invisibly repaired;/ A virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced,/ That penetrates, enables us to mount,/ When high, more high, and lifts us up when fallen./ This efficacious spirit chiefly lurks/ Among those passages of life that give/ Profoundest knowledge to what point, and how,/ The mind is lord and master--outward sense/ The obedient servant of her will. Such moments/ Are scattered everywhere, taking their date/ From our first childhood.\"The language Wordsworth uses within this excerpt suggests that he has had many 'spots of time' that he could draw upon from his memory that could give him strength as they release to him a sense of epiphany in his new realisation of seeing the world in a recollection of youth.\n\nThe use of epiphanies as a stylistic and structural device in narrative and poetry came to prominence in the Romantic era. It was a popular literary device of the modern author.\n\n"}
{"id": "9928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9928", "title": "Ethnology", "text": "Ethnology\n\nEthnology (from the Greek \"ἔθνος\", \"ethnos\" meaning \"nation\") is the branch of anthropology that compares and analyzes the characteristics of different peoples and the relationships between them (cf. cultural, social, or sociocultural anthropology).\n\nCompared to ethnography, the study of single groups through direct contact with the culture, ethnology takes the research that ethnographers have compiled and then compares and contrasts different cultures.\nThe term \"ethnologia\" (\"ethnology\") is credited to Adam Franz Kollár (1718-1783) who used and defined it in his \"Historiae ivrisqve pvblici Regni Vngariae amoenitates\" published in Vienna in 1783. as: “the science of nations and peoples, or, that study of learned men in which they inquire into the origins, languages, customs, and institutions of various nations, and finally into the fatherland and ancient seats, in order to be able better to judge the nations and peoples in their own times.” \n\nKollár's interest in linguistic and cultural diversity was aroused by the situation in his native multi-ethnic and multilingual Kingdom of Hungary and his roots among its Slovaks, and by the shifts that began to emerge after the gradual retreat of the Ottoman Empire in the more distant Balkans.\n\nAmong the goals of ethnology have been the reconstruction of human history, and the formulation of cultural invariants, such as the incest taboo and culture change, and the formulation of generalizations about \"human nature\", a concept which has been criticized since the 19th century by various philosophers (Hegel, Marx, structuralism, etc.). In some parts of the world, ethnology has developed along independent paths of investigation and pedagogical doctrine, with \"cultural anthropology\" becoming dominant especially in the United States, and \"social anthropology\" in Great Britain. The distinction between the three terms is increasingly blurry. Ethnology has been considered an academic field since the late 18th century, especially in Europe and is sometimes conceived of as any comparative study of human groups.\nThe 15th-century exploration of America by European explorers had an important role in formulating new notions of the Occident (the Western world), such as the notion of the \"Other\". This term was used in conjunction with \"savages\", which was either seen as a brutal barbarian, or alternatively, as the \"noble savage\". Thus, civilization was opposed in a dualist manner to barbary, a classic opposition constitutive of the even more commonly shared ethnocentrism. The progress of ethnology, for example with Claude Lévi-Strauss's structural anthropology, led to the criticism of conceptions of a linear progress, or the pseudo-opposition between \"societies with histories\" and \"societies without histories\", judged too dependent on a limited view of history as constituted by accumulative growth.\n\nLévi-Strauss often referred to Montaigne's essay on cannibalism as an early example of ethnology. Lévi-Strauss aimed, through a structural method, at discovering universal invariants in human society, chief among which he believed to be the incest taboo. However, the claims of such cultural universalism have been criticized by various 19th- and 20th-century social thinkers, including Marx, Nietzsche, Foucault, Derrida, Althusser, and Deleuze.\n\nThe French school of ethnology was particularly significant for the development of the discipline, since the early 1950s. Important figures in this movement have included Lévi-Strauss, Paul Rivet, Marcel Griaule, Germaine Dieterlen, and Jean Rouch.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4407985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4407985", "title": "Europe and the People Without History", "text": "Europe and the People Without History\n\nEurope and the People Without History is a book by anthropologist Eric Wolf. First published in 1982, it focuses on the expansion of European societies in the Modern Era. \"Europe and the people without history\" is history written on a global scale, tracing the connections between communities, regions, peoples and nations that are usually treated as discrete subjects.\n\nThe book begins in 1400 with a description of the trade routes a world traveller might have encountered, the people and societies they connected, and the civilizational processes trying to incorporate them. From this, Wolf traces the emergence of Europe as a global power, and the reorganization of particular world regions for the production of goods now meant for global consumption. Wolf differs from World Systems theory in that he sees the growth of Europe until the late eighteenth century operating in a tributary framework, and not capitalism. He examines the way that colonial state structures were created to protect tributary populations involved in the silver, fur and slave trades. Whole new \"tribes\" were created as they were incorporated into circuits of mercantile accumulation. The final section of the book deals with the transformation in these global networks as a result of the growth of capitalism with the industrial revolution. Factory production of textiles in England, for example transformed cotton production in the American south and Egypt, and eliminated textile production in India. All these transformations are connected in a single structural change. Each of the world's regions are examined in terms of the goods they produced in the global division of labour, as well as the mobilization and migration of whole populations (such as African slaves) to produce these goods. Wolf uses labor market segmentation to provide a historical account of the creation of ethnic segmentation. Where World Systems theory had little to say about the periphery, Wolf's emphasis is on the people \"without history\" (i.e. not given a voice in western histories) and on how they were active participants in the creation of new cultural and social forms emerging in the context of commercial empire.\n\nWolf distinguishes between three modes of production: capitalist, kin-ordered, and tributary. Wolf does not view them as an evolutionary sequence. He begins with capitalism because he argues our understanding of kin-ordered and tributary modes is coloured by our understanding of capitalism. He argues they are not evolutionary precursors of capitalism, but the product of the encounter between the West and the Rest. In the tributary mode, direct producers possess their own means of production, but their surplus production is taken from them through extra economic means. This appropriation is usually by some form of strong or weak state. In the kin-ordered mode of production, social labour is mobilized through kin relations (such as lineages), although his description makes its exact relations with tributary and capitalist modes unclear. The kin mode was further theorized by French structuralist Marxists in terms of 'articulated modes of production.' The kin-ordered mode is distinct again from Sahlins' formulation of the domestic mode of production.\n"}
{"id": "65974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65974", "title": "First-person narrative", "text": "First-person narrative\n\nA first-person narrative is a mode of storytelling in which a narrator relays events from their own point of view using the first person It may be narrated by a first person protagonist (or other focal character), first person re-teller, first person witness, or first person peripheral (also called a peripheral narrator). A classic example of a first person protagonist narrator is Charlotte Brontë's \"Jane Eyre\" (1847), in which the title character is also the narrator telling her own story, \"I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me\".\n\nThis device allows the audience to see the narrator's mind's eye view of the fictional universe, but it is limited to the narrator's experiences and awareness of the true state of affairs. In some stories, first-person narrators may relay dialogue with other characters or refer to information they heard from the other characters, in order to try to deliver a larger point of view. Other stories may switch the narrator to different characters to introduce a broader perspective. An unreliable narrator is one that has completely lost credibility due to ignorance, poor insight, personal biases, mistakes, dishonesty, etc., which challenges the reader's initial assumptions.\n\nThe telling of a story in the grammatical first person, i.e. from the perspective of \"I.\" An example would be Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick\", which begins \"Call me Ishmael.\"\n\nFirst-person narration often includes an embedded listener or reader, who serves as the audience for the tale. First-person narrations may be told by a person directly undergoing the events in the story without being aware of conveying that experience to readers; alternatively, the narrator may be conscious of telling the story to a given audience, perhaps at a given place and time, for a given reason.\n\nA story written in the first person can be told by the main character, a less important character witnessing events, or a person retelling a story they were told by someone else. This point of view is often effective in giving a sense of closeness to the character.\n\nFirst-person narration presents the narrative through the perspective of a particular character. The reader or audience becomes aware of the events and characters of the story through the narrator's views and knowledge. As a participant in events, the conscious narrator, is an imperfect witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. In some cases, the narrator may give or withhold information based on his own experience.\n\nCharacter weaknesses and faults, such as tardiness, cowardice, or vice, may leave the narrator unintentionally absent or unreliable for certain key events. Specific events may further be colored or obscured by a narrator's background, since non-omniscient characters must by definition be laypersons and foreigners to some circles, and limitations such as poor eyesight and illiteracy may also leave important blanks. Another consideration is how much time has elapsed between when the character experienced the events of the story and when they decided to tell them. If only a few days have passed, the story could be related very differently than if the character was reflecting on events of the distant past. The character's motivation is also relevant. Are they just trying to clear up events for their own peace of mind? Make a confession about a wrong they did? Or tell a good adventure tale to their beer-guzzling friends? The reason why a story is told will also affect how it is written. Why is this narrator telling the story in this way, why now, and is he to be trusted? Unstable or malevolent narrators can also lie to the reader. Unreliable narrators are not uncommon.\n\nIn the first-person-plural point of view, narrators tell the story using \"we\". That is, no individual speaker is identified; the narrator is a member of a group that acts as a unit. The first-person-plural point of view occurs rarely but can be used effectively, sometimes as a means to increase the concentration on the character or characters the story is about. Examples include:\n\n\nOther examples include \"Twenty-Six Men and a Girl\" by Maxim Gorky, \"The Treatment of Bibi Haldar\" by Jhumpa Lahiri, \"During the Reign of the Queen of Persia\" by Joan Chase, \"Our Kind\" by Kate Walbert, \"I, Robot\" by Isaac Asimov, and \"We Didn't\" by Stuart Dybek. \n\nFirst-person narrators can also be multiple, as in Ryūnosuke Akutagawa's \"In a Grove\" (the source for the movie \"Rashomon\") and Faulkner's novel \"The Sound and the Fury\". Each of these sources provides different accounts of the same event, from the point of view of various first-person narrators.\n\nThere can also be multiple co-principal characters as narrator, such as in Robert A. Heinlein's \"The Number of the Beast\". The first chapter introduces four characters, including the initial narrator, who is named at the beginning of the chapter. The narrative continues in subsequent chapters with a different character explicitly identified as the narrator for that chapter. Other characters later introduced in the book also have their \"own\" chapters where they narrate the story for that chapter. The story proceeds in linear fashion, and no event occurs more than once, i.e. no two narrators speak \"live\" about the same event.\n\nThe first-person narrator may be the principal character or one who closely observes the principal character (see Emily Brontë's \"Wuthering Heights\" or F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\", each narrated by a minor character). These can be distinguished as \"first person major\" or \"first person minor\" points of view.\n\nThe narrator can be the protagonist (e.g., Gulliver in \"Gulliver's Travels\"), someone very close to him who is privy to his thoughts and actions (Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes stories), or an ancillary character who has little to do with the action of the story (such as Nick Carraway in \"The Great Gatsby\"). Narrators can report others' narratives at one or more removes. These are called \"frame narrators\": examples are Mr. Lockwood, the narrator in \"Wuthering Heights\" by Emily Brontë; and the unnamed narrator in \"Heart of Darkness\" by Joseph Conrad. Skilled writers choose to skew narratives, in keeping with the narrator's character, to an arbitrary degree, from ever so slight to extreme. For example, the aforementioned Mr. Lockwood is quite naive, of which fact he appears unaware, simultaneously rather pompous, and recounting a combination of stories, experiences, and servants' gossip. As such, his character is an unintentionally very unreliable narrator, and serves mainly to mystify, confuse, and ultimately leave the events of Wuthering Heights open to a great range of interpretations.\n\nA rare form of first person is the first person omniscient, in which the narrator is a character in the story, but also knows the thoughts and feelings of all the other characters. It can seem like third person omniscient at times. A reasonable explanation fitting the mechanics of the story's world is generally provided or inferred, unless its glaring absence is a major plot point. Two notable examples are \"The Book Thief\" by Markus Zusak, where the narrator is Death, and \"The Lovely Bones\" by Alice Sebold, where a young girl, having been killed, observes, from some post-mortem, extracorporeal viewpoint, her family struggling to cope with her disappearance. Typically, however, the narrator restricts the events relayed in the narrative to those that could reasonably be known. Novice writers may make the mistake of allowing elements of omniscience into a first-person narrative unintentionally and at random, forgetting the inherent human limitations of a witness or participant of the events.\n\nIn autobiographical fiction, the first person narrator is the character of the author (with varying degrees of historical accuracy). The narrator is still distinct from the author and must behave like any other character and any other first person narrator. Examples of this kind of narrator include Jim Carroll in \"The Basketball Diaries\" and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. in \"Timequake\" (in this case, the first-person narrator is also the author). In some cases, the narrator is writing a book—\"the book in your hands\"—and therefore he has most of the powers and knowledge of the author. Examples include \"The Name of the Rose\" by Umberto Eco, and \"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\" by Mark Haddon. Another example is a fictional \"Autobiography of James T. Kirk\" which was \"Edited\" by David A. Goodman who was the actual writer of that book and playing the part of James Kirk (Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek) as he wrote the novel.\n\nSince the narrator is within the story, he or she may not have knowledge of all the events. For this reason, first-person narrative is often used for detective fiction, so that the reader and narrator uncover the case together. One traditional approach in this form of fiction is for the main detective's principal assistant, the \"Watson\", to be the narrator: this derives from the character of Dr Watson in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.\n\nFirst-person narratives can appear in several forms; interior monologue, as in Fyodor Dostoevsky's \"Notes from Underground\"; dramatic monologue, also in Albert Camus' \"The Fall\"; or explicitly, as Mark Twain's \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\"\n\nOther forms include temporary first-person narration as a story within a story, wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character.\n\nWith a first person narrative it is important to consider how the story is being told, i.e., is the character writing it down, telling it out loud, thinking it to themselves? And if they are writing it down, is it something meant to be read by the public, a private diary, or a story meant for one other person? The way the first person narrator is relating the story will affect the language used, the length of sentences, the tone of voice and many other things. A story presented as a secret diary could be interpreted much differently than a public statement.\n\nFirst-person narratives can tend towards a stream of consciousness and Interior monologue, as in Marcel Proust's \"In Search of Lost Time\". The whole of the narrative can itself be presented as a false document, such as a diary, in which the narrator makes explicit reference to the fact that he is writing or telling a story. This is the case in Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\". As a story unfolds, narrators may be aware that they are telling a story and of their reasons for telling it. The audience that they believe they are addressing can vary. In some cases, a frame story presents the narrator as a character in an outside story who begins to tell his own story, as in Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\".\n\nFirst-person narrators are often unreliable narrators since a narrator might be impaired (such as both Quentin and Benjy in Faulkner's \"The Sound and the Fury\"), lie (as in \"The Quiet American\" by Graham Greene, or \"The Book of the New Sun\" series by Gene Wolfe), or manipulate their own memories intentionally or not (as in \"The Remains of the Day\" by Kazuo Ishiguro, or in Ken Kesey's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\"). Henry James discusses his concerns about \"the romantic privilege of the 'first person'\" in his preface to \"The Ambassadors\", calling it \"the darkest abyss of romance.\"\n\nOne example of a multi-level narrative structure is Joseph Conrad's novella \"Heart of Darkness\", which has a double framework: an unidentified \"I\" (first person singular) narrator relates a boating trip during which another character, Marlow, uses first person to tell a story that comprises the majority of the work. Within this nested story, it is mentioned that another character, Kurtz, told Marlow a lengthy story; however, its content is not revealed to readers. Thus, there is an \"I\" narrator introducing a storyteller as \"he\" (Marlow), who talks about himself as \"I\" and introduces another storyteller as \"he\" (Kurtz), who in turn presumably told his story from the perspective of \"I\".\n\nFirst person narration is more difficult to achieve in film; however, voice-over narration can create the same structure.\n"}
{"id": "8341465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8341465", "title": "Focal character", "text": "Focal character\n\nIn any narrative, the focal character is the character on whom the audience is meant to place the majority of their interest and attention. They are almost always also the protagonist of the story; however, in cases where the \"focal character\" and \"protagonist\" are separate, the focal character's emotions and ambitions are not meant to be empathized with by the audience to as high an extent as the protagonist (this is the main difference between the two character terms). The focal character is mostly created to simply be the \"excitement\" of the story, though not necessarily the main character about whom the audience is emotionally concerned. The focal character is, more than anyone else, \"the person on whom the spotlight focuses; the center of attention; the man whose reactions dominate the screen.\"\n\nFor example, in Gaston Leroux's \"The Phantom of the Opera\", the protagonist is Christine Daaé (the audience is concerned mostly with her emotions, aims, and well-being), while the focal character is the \"Phantom\" (the audience is concerned mostly with the allure of his actions and reactions—though to some degree, later on, his emotions as well). In another example, in \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" by Edgar Allan Poe, the protagonist of the story is unnamed and does not have a great effect on the story, though he is present. He does not show much emotion throughout the story, and the reader is not as interested in him. The focal character of the story is Roderick Usher, whom the reader cares for more greatly and follows his condition and emotions more.\n\nThe focal character is also not necessarily the same thing as the viewpoint character, through whose perspective the story is seen. In Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works of Sherlock Holmes, Watson is the viewpoint character, but the story revolves around Holmes, making him the focal character.\n"}

{"id": "1396834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1396834", "title": "High culture", "text": "High culture\n\nHigh culture encompasses the cultural products of aesthetic value, which a society collectively esteem as exemplary art. It may also include intellectual works considered to be of supreme philosophical, historical, or literary value, as well as the education which cultivates such aesthetic and intellectual pursuits. In popular usage, the term \"high culture\" identifies the culture of an upper class (an aristocracy) or of a status class (the intelligentsia); and also identifies a society’s common repository of broad-range knowledge and tradition (e.g. folk culture) that transcends the social-class system of the society. Sociologically, the term \"high culture\" is contrasted with the term \"low culture\", the forms of popular culture characteristic of the less-educated social classes, such as the barbarians, the Philistines, and \"hoi polloi\" (the masses).\n\nIn European history, high culture was understood as a cultural concept common to the humanities, until the mid-19th century, when Matthew Arnold introduced the term \"high culture\" in the book \"Culture and Anarchy\" (1869). The Preface defines culture as \"the disinterested endeavour after man’s perfection\" pursued, obtained, and achieved by effort to \"know the best that has been said and thought in the world.\" Such a literary definition of high culture also comprehends philosophy. Moreover, the philosophy of aesthetics proposed in high culture is a force for moral and political good. Critically, the term \"high culture\" is contrasted with the terms \"popular culture\" and \"mass culture\".\n\nIn \"Notes Towards the Definition of Culture\" (1948), T. S. Eliot said that high culture and popular culture are necessary and complementary parts of the culture of a society. In \"The Uses of Literacy\" (1957), Richard Hoggart presents the sociologic experience of the working-class man and woman in acquiring the cultural literacy, at university, which facilitates social upward mobility. In the U.S., Harold Bloom and F. R. Leavis pursued the definition of high culture, by way of the Western canon of literature.\nMedia theorist Steven Johnson writes that, unlike popular culture, \"the classics—and soon to be classics—are\" in their own right descriptions and explanations of the cultural systems that produced them.\" He says that \"a crucial way in which mass culture differs from high art\" is that individual works of mass culture are less interesting than the broader cultural trends which produced them.\n\nHistory of high culture in the West\n\nThe high culture of the West originated in the classical-world traditions of intellectual and aesthetic life in Ancient Greece (from c. 8th century BC – AD 147) and Ancient Rome (753 BC – AD 476). In the classical Greco-Roman tradition, the ideal mode of language was published and preserved in works of elevated style (correct grammar, syntax, and diction). Certain forms of language used by authors in valorized epochs were held up in antiquity and the Renaissance as eternal valid models and normative standards of excellence; e.g. the Attic dialect of ancient Greek spoken and written by the playwrights and philosophers of Periclean Athens (fifth century BC); and the form of classical Latin used in the \"Golden Age\" of Roman culture (c. 70 B.C. - AD 18) represented by such figures as Cicero and Virgil.This form of education was known to the Greeks as παιδεία, which was translated by the Romans into Latin as \"humanitas\" 'since it reflected a form of education aiming at the refinement of human nature, rather than the acquisition of technical or vocational skills. Indeed, the Greco-Roman world tended to see such manual, commercial, and technical labor as subordinate to purely intellectual activities. From the idea of the \"free\" man with sufficient leisure to pursue such intellectual and aesthetic refinement, arose the classical distinction between the \"liberal\" arts which are intellectual and done for their own sake, as against the \"servile\"or \"mechanical\" arts which were associated with manual labor and done to earn a living.\nThis implied an association between high culture and the upper classes whose inherited wealth provided such time for intellectual cultivation. The leisured gentleman not weighed down by the necessity of earning a living, was free to devote himself to activities proper to such a \"free man\" – those deemed to involve true excellence and nobility as opposed to mere utility.\nDuring the Renaissance, the classical intellectual values of the fully rediscovered Græco–Roman culture were the cultural capital of the upper classes(and the aspiring), and aimed at the complete development of human intellectual, aesthetic, and moral faculties. This ideal associated with humanism (a later term derived from the humanities or \"studia humanitatis\"), was communicated in Renaissance Italy through institutions such as the Renaissance court schools. Renaissance humanism soon spread through Europe becoming much of the basis of upper class education for centuries. For the socially ambitious man and woman who means to rise in society, \"The Book of the Courtier\" (1528), by Baldasare Castiglione, instructs the reader to acquire and possess knowledge of the Græco–Roman Classics, being education integral to the social-persona of the aristocrat. A key contribution of the Renaissance was the elevation of painting and sculpture to a status equal to the liberal arts (hence the visual arts lost for elites any lingering negative association with manual artisanship.) The early Renaissance treatises of Leon Battista Alberti were instrumental in this regard.\n\nThe evolution of the concept of high culture initially was defined in educational terms largely as critical study and knowledge of the Græco–Roman arts and humanities which furnished much of the foundation for European cultures and societies. However, aristocratic patronage through most of the modern era was also pivotal to the support and creation of new works of high culture across the range of arts, music, and literature. The subsequent prodigious development of the modern European languages and cultures meant that the modern definition of the term \"high culture\" embraces not only Greek and Latin texts, but a much broader canon of select literary, philosophical, historical, and scientific books in both ancient and modern languages. Of comparable importance are those works of art and music considered to be of the highest excellence and broadest influence (e.g. the Parthenon, the painting and sculpture of Michelangelo, the music of Mozart, etc). Together these texts and art works constitute the exemplary artifacts representing the high culture of the Western world. \nIn the Western and some East Asian traditions, art that demonstrates the imagination of the artist is accorded the status of high art. In the West this tradition began in Ancient Greece, was reinforced in the Renaissance, and by Romanticism, which eliminated the hierarchy of genres within the fine arts, which was established in the Renaissance. In China there was a distinction between the literati painting by the scholar-officials and the work produced by common artists, working in largely different styles, or the decorative arts such as Chinese porcelain which were produced by unknown craftsmen working in large factories. In both China and the West the distinction was especially clear in landscape painting, where for centuries imaginary views, produced from the imagination of the artist, were considered superior works.\n\nIn socially-stratified Europe and the Americas, a first-hand immersion to the high culture of the West, the Grand Tour of Europe, was a rite of passage that complemented and completed the book education of a gentleman, from the nobility, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie, with a worldly perspective of society and civilisation. The post-university tour of the cultural centres of Europe was a social-class benefit of the cultural capital transmitted through the high-status institutions (schools, academies, universities) meant to produce the ideal gentleman of that society. \n\nThe European concept of high culture included cultivation of refined etiquette and manners; the education of taste in the fine arts such as sculpture and painting; an appreciation of classical music and opera in its diverse history and myriad forms; knowledge of the humane letters (\"literae humaniores\") represented by the best Greek and Latin authors, and more broadly of the liberal arts traditions (e.g. philosophy, history, drama, rhetoric, and poetry) of Western civilisation, as well as a general acquaintance with important concepts in theology, science, and political thought.\n\nMuch of high culture consists of the appreciation of what is sometimes called \"high art\". This term is rather broader than Arnold's definition and besides literature includes music, visual arts (especially painting), and traditional forms of the performing arts (including some cinema). The decorative arts would not generally be considered high art.\n\nThe cultural products most often regarded as forming part of high culture are most likely to have been produced during periods of high civilization, for which a large, sophisticated, and wealthy urban-based society provides a coherent and conscious aesthetic framework, and a large-scale milieu of training, and, for the visual arts, sourcing materials and financing work. Such an environment enables artists, as near as possible, to realize their creative potential with as few as possible practical and technical constraints. Although the Western concept of high culture naturally concentrates on the Greco-Roman tradition, and its resumption from the Renaissance onwards, such conditions existed in other places at other times.\n\nArt music (or serious music or erudite music) is an umbrella term used to refer to musical traditions implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition. The notion of art music is a frequent and well-defined musicological distinction – musicologist Philip Tagg, for example, refers to art music as one of an \"axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics\". He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria, with high cultural music often performed to an audience whilst folk music would traditionally be more participatory. In this regard, \"art music\" frequently occurs as a contrasting term to \"popular music\" and to \"traditional\" or \"folk music\".\n\nArt film is the result of filmmaking which is typically a serious, independent film aimed at a niche market rather than a mass market audience. Film critics and film studies scholars typically define an \"art film\" using a \"...canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films\", which includes, among other elements: a social realism style; an emphasis on the authorial expressivity of the director or writer; and a focus on the thoughts and dreams of characters, rather than presenting a clear, goal-driven story. According to the film scholar David Bordwell, \"art cinema itself is a film genre, with its own distinct conventions.\"\n\nThe term has always been susceptible to attack for elitism, and, in response, many proponents of the concept devoted great efforts to promoting high culture among a wider public than the highly educated bourgeoisie whose natural territory it was supposed to be. There was a drive, beginning in the 19th century, to open museums and concert halls to give the general public access to high culture. Figures such as John Ruskin and Lord Reith of the BBC in Britain, Leon Trotsky and others in Communist Russia, and many others in America and throughout the western world have worked to widen the appeal of elements of high culture such as classical music, art by old masters and the literary classics.\n\nWith the widening of access to university education, the effort spread there, and all aspects of high culture became the objects of academic study, which with the exception of the classics had not often been the case until the late 19th century. University liberal arts courses still play an important role in the promotion of the concept of high culture, though often now avoiding the term itself.\n\nEspecially in Europe, governments have been prepared to subsidize high culture through the funding of museums, opera and ballet companies, orchestras, cinema, public broadcasting stations such as BBC Radio 3, ARTE, and in other ways. Organizations such as the Arts Council of Great Britain, and in most European countries, whole ministries administer these programs. This includes the subsidy of new works by composers, writers and artists. There are also many private philanthropic sources of funding, which are especially important in the US, where the federally funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting also funds broadcasting. These may be seen as part of the broader concept of official culture, although often a mass audience is not the intended market.\n\nThe relations between high culture and mass culture are concerns of cultural studies, media studies, and critical theory, sociology, Postmodernism and Marxist philosophy. In the essay \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\" (1936), Walter Benjamin explored the relations of value of the arts (high and mass) when subjected to industrial reproduction. The critical theoreticians Theodor W. Adorno and Antonio Gramsci interpreted the high-art and mass-art cultural relations as an instrument of social control, with which the ruling class maintain their cultural hegemony upon society.\n\nFor the Orientalist Ernest Renan and for the rationalist philosopher Ernest Gellner, high culture was conceptually integral to the politics and ideology of nationalism, as a requisite part of a healthy national identity. Gellner expanded the conceptual scope of the phrase in \"Nations and Nationalism\" (1983) stating that high art is \"a literate, codified culture, which permits context-free communication\" among cultures.\n\nIn \"Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste\" (1979), the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu proposed that æsthetic taste (cultural judgement), derived from social class, in establishing definitions of high art by the practice of human activities such as social etiquette, gastronomy, oenology, military service. That in such activities of aesthetic judgement, the ruling-class person uses social codes unknown to middle- and the lower-class persons in the pursuit and practice activities of taste.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41520090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41520090", "title": "Impalement in myth and art", "text": "Impalement in myth and art\n\nThe use of impalement in myth, art, and literature includes mythical representations of it as a method of execution and other uses in paintings, sculptures, and the like, folklore and other tales in which impalement is related to magical or supernatural properties, and the use of simulated impalement for the purposes of entertainment.\n\nThe idea that the vampire \"can \"only\" be slain with a stake driven through its heart\" has been pervasive in European fiction. Examples such as Bram Stoker's Dracula and the more recent Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Twilight series' all incorporate that idea. In classic European folklore, it was believed that one method, \"among several\", to \"kill\" a vampire, or prevent a corpse from rising as a vampire, was to drive a wooden stake through the heart before interment. In one story, an Istrian peasant named Jure Grando died and was buried in 1656. It was believed that he returned as a vampire, and at least one villager tried to drive a stake through his heart, but failed in the attempt. Finally, in 1672, the corpse was decapitated, and the vampire terror was put to rest. Although the Eastern European, in particular Slavic (but also Roumanian), conception of the vampire as an undead creature in which impaling it was central to either destroying it, or at least immobilizing it, is the most well-known European tradition, such traditions can also be found elsewhere in Europe. In Greece, the troublesome undead were usually called a vrykolakas. The archaeologist Susan-Marie Cronkite describes an odd grave found at Mytilene, at Lesbos, a find the archeologists connected with the vrykolakas superstition.\n\nThe Norse draugr, or haugbui (mound-dweller), was a type of undead typically (but not exclusively) associated with those put (supposedly) to rest in burial mounds/tumuli. The approved methods of killing a draugr are \"to sever his head from his body and set the same beneath his rump, or impale his body with a stake or burn it to ashes\".\n\nAlthough in modern vampiric lore, the stake is regarded as a very effective tool against the undead, people in pre-modern Europe could have their doubts. Edward Payson Evans tells the following story, from the city Kadaň:\n\nA graphic description of the vertical impalement of a Serbian rebel by Ottoman authorities can be found in Ivo Andrić's novel \"The Bridge on the Drina\". Andrić was later awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for the whole of his literary contribution, though this novel was the \"magnum opus\".\n\nSome anecdotes of the behavior and fates of the impaled remain which, if true, would be unique in the history of impalement. The first was narrated as a proof of the efficacy of praying to Saint Barbara. In the woods of Bohemia around 1552, there was a robber band roaming, plundering and murdering innocent travelers. A manhunt was organized, and the robber chief was apprehended and sentenced to be impaled. While one of his associates, likewise impaled, swiftly expired, the chief was not so lucky.\nAll day long, he writhed on his stake, begging to be killed, but all in vain. That night, in his despair, he prayed to St. Barbara that he was truly sorry for all his evil doings in life and that all he hoped for was to reconcile with God and to be graced with a good death. Seemingly in response, the man's stake broke, and with great effort and pain, he managed to \"de-impale\" himself. Crawling along, he came to a house, and his cries of help were heard. He was helped into a bed, and a priest was sent for. The former robber chief then gave his death bed confession, grieving over his misspent life, but properly grateful to God and St. Barbara. He then died in peace, his hands folded over his chest.\n\nAnother incident, which was, allegedly, partially witnessed by the editor of a \"Ladies' Journal\", is said to have occurred in Wallachia in the 1770s. He had been present in Arad when 27 robbers had been impaled. It was strictly forbidden to give the impaled persons any water, but one woman took mercy on one of the robbers, and fetched water for him in a kettle. As she was glancing anxiously about to check if anyone took notice of her forbidden act of mercy, the robber smashed her head in with the kettle, killing her on the spot. The editor avers he was present when the robber was asked why he had done such a thing, and he merely replied he had done it on a whim, and just had felt like killing her then and there.\n\nIn British Columbia, a folk tale from the Lillooet People is preserved in which impalement occurs as a central element. A man became suspicious of his wife because she went out each day to gather roots and cedar-bark but hardly ever brought anything home. One day, he spied on her, and discovered that she was cavorting with Lynx, rather than doing her wifely duties. The next day, he asked to accompany her, and they went out in the forest, and came at last to a very tall tree. The man climbed to the top of it, the wife following. The jealous man then sharpened the top of the tree with his knife, and impaled his wife on it. On his way down, he removed the bark of the tree, so it became slick. The woman cried out her pain and her brothers heard her. They and animals they called to help them tried to rescue her, but the stem was too slick for them to climb up to reach her. Then Snail offered to help her, and slowly crawled up the tree. But alas, Snail moved too slowly, and by the time it took him to reach the top of the tree, the woman was dead.\n\nAmong tribes living around the Titicaca, tales circulated in the sixteenth century that prior to the Incas, a mysterious group of white men lived there, and their banishment was somehow connected with the birth of the Sun. A sixteenth century tale collected by a Spanish missionary tells of such an individual, called Tanupa or Taapac, who was impaled by other Indians around the Titicaca, and a shrine was set up there to commemorate the events.\n\nThe renowned Sufi mystic was in AD 922 to be impaled for blasphemy in Baghdad, for having said such things as \"I am God\". However, the executioners were unable to do so, because al-Hallaj floated in the air just above their reach. Then, al-Hallaj's spirit ascended to Heaven, and conversed with Muhammed, the Prophet of Islam, and al-Hallaj asked the Prophet if he should let himself be impaled. The Prophet acknowledged that al-Hallaj's spiritual state was so heightened that his utterance \"I am God\" was both just and true, but that for the sake of ordinary people, he should let himself be impaled, because their spiritual state was such that they would be mislead from practical religion if they were to believe in such sayings like \"I am God\". And thus, for the sake of preserving the religion of ordinary people, al-Hallaj let himself be impaled at last.\n\nTales and anecdotes concerning how dreadfully swift and harsh Ottoman justice was for comparatively trivial offenses abound. Dimitrie Cantemir, a Moldavian noble living in Constantinople at the end of the 17th century, and often engaged in pleas of cases towards Ottoman authorities, narrates a tale from the building of a great mosque there in 1461. The Greek architect was amply rewarded by the sultan, so that a whole street was privileged to the Greek populace in recognition of his efforts. However, some asked the architect if he could even build a greater and more beautiful mosque than the one completed. Incautiously, the architect said sure enough, if I were given the materials. The sultan, upon hearing this, was so fearful that his successors might create an even more beautiful mosque than his own, that just in case, he chose to impale the architect to deprive successors of that genius, commemorating the event by erecting a huge iron spike in the middle of the mosque. Not even bothering to refute this tale of impalement, Cantemir says that he \"does\", however, believe in the grand gift of the street, because he had used the original charter from the sultan to protect the Greek interest when somebody wanted to deprive the Greeks of the privilege. Cantemir won his case. In 1632, under Murad IV (r.1623–40), a hapless interpreter in a fierce dispute between the French ambassador and Ottoman authorities was impaled alive for faithfully translating the insolent words of the ambassador. Furthermore, Murad IV sought to ban the use of tobacco, and reportedly impaled alive a man and a woman for breaking the law, the one for selling tobacco, the other for using it. Another such anecdote, is said to have occurred in 1695 under Mustafa II: The Grand Vizier prevented access to the sultan to a poor shoemaker who had a petition for his sovereign. Once the sultan learnt of it, he promptly ordered the Grand Vizier to be impaled, although the Grand Vizier was the son of the sultan's favourite concubine.\n\nIn the Hindu Draupadi cult, impalement of animals, demons, and humans is a recurring motif within legends and symbolic re-enactments during holidays/festivals.\n\nAccording to a Shaivite story from India, under the old Pandyan Dynasty, ruling from 500 BC-1500 CE, the 7th century King Koon Pandiyan had 8000 Jains impaled in Madurai. Some historians regard the story as a legend rather than historically accurate, and that it might have been created by the Shaivites to prove their superiority over the Jains. This act, legendary or not, is still commemorated in \"lurid mural representations\" in several Hindu temples in Tamil Nadu. An example of such depictions in temples can be found in the Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai, around the holy tank enclosure to the shrine of Meenakshi. There, a long line of impaled Jaines are depicted, with dogs at their feet, licking up the blood, and crows flying around to pick out their eyes.\n\nIn Bengal, tales existed about a foolish king in the Pala Empire, Bhava Chandra, and his equally foolish minister. They are a pair not unlike the Wise Men of Gotham, bereft of common sense as a result of a curse laid upon them. In their last judgment, they had condemned two robbers to be impaled, but when the robbers began quarreling about who should get impaled on the longest pole, Bhava Chandra and his minister became deeply intrigued. The robbers told them that whoever died on the longest pole would be reincarnated as the ruler of the Earth, while the other would become his minister. Thinking it unseemly that two mere robbers should gain such a high position in their next life, Bhava Chandra chose to impale himself on the longest pole, while his minister happily chose to die on the shorter.\n\nThe remains of persons impaled have, occasionally, been thought imbued with certain magical properties. For example, the Arthashastra states that if one wishes to make a fire at one place, and prevent any other fire to be lit there, one could make that fire \"by the friction of a black-and-white bamboo stick on the rib bone of the left side of a man who has been slain with a sword, or impaled\". Virginia Saunders also mentions from the same text how to become invisible:\nThe ascetic Mandavya, when he was five years old, had amused himself with sticking a reed into a living locust. Lord Yama, the god of death, bided his time to exact what he thought was a proper punishment. As an old man, Mandavya was sitting outside his cave in deep meditation, oblivious to some thieves placing their stolen goods there. Wrongfully believing Mandavya had stolen the goods, the authorities placed Mandavya on trial. He could not answer the judge on how the goods had come to be in his hermitage, so the king declared he was to be impaled. Mandavya seemed unperturbed by the whole affair, and when he was still alive, in deep contemplation, on the stake after 4 years, the king declared Mandavya had to be innocent, and ordered him pulled down. However, the stake broke inside Mandavya's body, and the excruciating pain destroyed Mandavya's trance. In deep bitterness, he asked the gods how he had deserved such a fate, and Yama answered it was because of the locust he had tortured as a young boy. Mandavya became infuriated at Yama and pointed out how disproportionate the punishment had been. He then cursed Yama to be born as a human being, namely as Vidura, the son of a mere serving maid.\n\nA tale from Kashmir of reincarnation after death on the stake concerns the sage Samdhimati. Samdhimati was minister under King Jayendra, when a mysterious prophecy spread through the populace: \"To Samdhimati will belong the kingdom\". Jayendra, on hearing of this, threw Samdhimati in prison for 10 years. When the king was on his death bed, he was unwilling to let Samdhimati have the prophecy fulfilled, so he ordered Samdhimati impaled. When Samdhimati's guru Isana heard of this, he went to the cemetery where Samhimati was impaled in order to perform the proper funeral rites. The wolves had devoured all the flesh of the body, and Isana was amazed that the prophecy was inscribed on Samdhimati's skull that he was to inherit the kingdom. Keeping watch, one night Isana saw the graveyard was filled with Yoginis (female mystics/witches). The Yoginis were drunk and \"lustful for a man\", and provided the skeleton with flesh (not the least, a penis) from their own bodies. They then captured Samdhimati's spirit, which was still hovering around, within the fleshed skeleton, and \"spent the rest of the night sporting with him\". As dawn approached, Isana, afraid that Samdhimati's new body should be dissolved by the witches, rushed out from his hiding place, and chased them away. In his new body and life, Samdhimati became known as Aryaraja, and was, indeed, crowned as King of Kashmir, thereby fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nIn the Buddhist conception of the eight Hells, as John Bowring relates from Siam, those consigned for the Sixth Hell are impaled on spits and roasted. When well roasted, enormous dogs with iron teeth devour them. But, the damned are reborn, and must relive this punishment for 16000 years, over and over again ... Another tale popular in Siam was about Devadatta, a wily antagonist to Buddha seeking to undermine Gautama's position among his followers. For this crime, Devadatta was sent off into the very deepest Hell, the Avici, being impaled on three great iron spears in a sea of flames.\n\nThe 1980 Italian film, \"Cannibal Holocaust\", directed by Ruggero Deodato, graphically depicts impalement. The story follows a rescue party searching for a missing documentary film crew in the Amazon Rainforest. The film's depiction of indigenous tribes, death of animals on set, and the graphic violence (notably the impalement scene) brought on a great deal of controversy, legal investigations, boycotts and protests by concerned social groups, bans in many countries (some of which are still in effect), and heavy censorship in countries where it has not been banned. The impalement scene was so realistic, that Deodato was charged with murder at one point. Deodato had to produce evidence that the \"impaled\" actress was alive in the aftermath of the scene, and had to further explain how the special effect was done: the actress sat on a bicycle seat mounted to a pole while she looked up and held a short stake of balsa wood in her mouth. The charges were dropped.\n\nIn stage magic, the \"illusion of impalement\" is a popular feat of magic that appears to be an act of impalement. Impaling tricks are not, however, a modern European invention, and some dervish orders performed such acts already in the 18th century. Carsten Niebuhr, traveling the Middle East 1761–67 on a Danish funded expedition, saw such a display at Basra: \n\n"}
{"id": "4665199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4665199", "title": "Intercultural competence", "text": "Intercultural competence\n\nIntercultural competence is a range of cognitive, affective, and behavioural skills that lead to effective and appropriate\ncommunication with people of other cultures. Effective intercultural communication relates to behaviors that culminate with the accomplishment of the desired goals of the interaction and all parties involved in the situation. Appropriate intercultural communication includes behaviors that suit the expectations of a specific culture, the characteristics of the situation, and the level of the relationship between the parties involved in the situation.\n\nIt's very important for someone to be culturally competent at work and at school. Individuals that are effective and appropriate in intercultural situations display high levels of cultural self-awareness and understand the influence of culture on behavior, values, and beliefs. Intercultural competence is achieved through a set of skills that includes cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes.\n\nFirst, cognitive processes imply the understanding of situational and environmental aspects of intercultural interactions and the application of intercultural awareness, which is affected by the understanding of the self and own culture. Self-awareness in intercultural situations refers to the ability of self-monitoring in such interactions to censor anything not acceptable to another culture. On the other hand, cultural awareness leads the individual to an understanding of how his/her own culture determines feelings, thoughts, and personality.\n\nSecondly, affective processes define the emotions that span during intercultural interactions. These emotions are strongly related to self-concept, open-mindedness, non-judgementalism, and social relaxation. In general, positive emotions generate respect for other cultures and their differences.\n\nFinally, behavioral processes refer to how effectively and appropriately the individual directs actions to achieve goals. Actions during intercultural interactions are influenced by the ability to clearly convey a message, proficiency with the foreign language, flexibility and management of behavior, and social skills.\n\nIntercultural competence is determined by the presence of cognitive, affective, and behavioral abilities that directly shape communication across cultures. These essential abilities can be separated into five specific skills that are obtained through education and experience:\n\nThe United States in its earliest history had a culture influenced heavily by its Northern European population, primarily from the British Isles, who originally settled in the original British Colonies. While the indigenous peoples, known as Indians, were the largest population of North America, they were slowly pushed away from the Eastern Seaboard into the interior of North America during the 17th century, 18th century, and 19th century (see Indian Removal Act describing specific actions during early 19th century). During this period, people from the British Isles (England and Scotland primarily) brought the culture and religion of the British Isles with them to the United States and became the dominant political and cultural group along the Eastern Seaboard of North America.\n\nBoth voluntary immigration from other regions as well as the results of the Atlantic slave trade, brought a mix of people to the Americas, including Europeans, Africans, and, to a lesser extent until the 20th century, Asians. Thus began the process of diversifying the population of the Western Hemisphere. While the majority of the U.S. population were white immigrants from northern and western Europe and their descendants, they maintained most of the power, social and economic, of the nation.\n\nIn the U.S. context, immigration from the 1840s onward diversified the ethnic composition of the nation. During the early part of the 20th century, southern and eastern European immigrants and their descendants became a larger percentage of the population, but as recent immigrants concentrated in urban areas were also very often poor and lacking in basic healthy living and working conditions. Descendants of African slaves and immigrants faced a much more difficult challenge due to their skin color and discrimination enforced by legal systems, such as the Jim Crow laws in the United States. Since the 1960s, African Americans as well as other minority groups such as Mexican Americans have gained greater social and economic status and power.\n\nNonetheless, the dominant models of education and social services retained models developed by northern and western European intellectuals, even such well-meaning and important reformers as Jane Addams and Jacob Riis. After the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, though, social workers, activists, and even healthcare providers began to examine their practices to see if they were as effective in African American, Latino, and even Asian American communities in the U.S. The arrival of more than half a million Southeast Asian refugees, from 1975 to 1992, for example, tested the ability of medical and social workers to continue effective practice among speakers of other languages and among those coming from very different understandings of everything from mental health to charity.\n\nWith the larger population of minorities and racial integration during the 1960s and 1970s, the public school system of the United States had to grapple with issues of cultural sensitivity as most teachers in public school system came from white, middle class backgrounds. Most of these teachers were educated, primarily English speaking, and primarily from the Western European cultures. They often had trouble trying to communicate with speakers of limited English proficiency, let alone people of vastly different value systems and normative behaviors from that of Anglo-European culture. The purpose of training educators and others in the area of cultural competence is to provide new teachers the background and skills to work effectively with children of all backgrounds and social classes.\n\nWith the growing diversity of the student body in U.S. public school, it is increasingly imperative that teachers have and continually develop a cultural competence that enables them to connect with, respond to, and interact effectively with their pupils. The achievement gap between cultural minority and majority students suggests a communication disconnect often occurs in minority classrooms because cultural mismatch between teachers and students is common and should not prevent positive, productive for both parties, provided the educator is a culturally competent communicator. Over the last few decades, scholars have increasingly shown interest in the relationship between learning, reading, schema, and culture. People's schema depends on their social location, which, as Anderson (1984) explains, includes a reader's age, sex, race, religion, nationality, and occupation, amongst other factors. Considering schemata determine how people understand, interpret, and analyze everything in their world, it is clear that background and experience really do affect the learning and teaching processes, and how each should be approached in context. \"In short,\" Anderson (1984) says, \"the schema that will be brought to bear on a text depends upon the reader's culture\" (p. 374-375). More simply, Anderson (1984) describes a person's schema as their \"organized knowledge about the world\" (p. 372). In considering the role of schema, one of the educator's principal functions in teaching, particularly with literacy, is to \"‘bridge the gap between what the learner already knows and what he needs to know before he can successfully learn the task at hand'\" (Anderson, 1984, p. 382). This is important because Staton (1989) explains that student learning—i.e. successful communication between instructor and pupil—occurs when teachers and students come to \"shared understandings\" (p. 364). Thus, teachers must remember that they are \"cultural workers, not neutral professionals using skills on a culturally-detached playing field\" (Blanchett, Mumford & Beachum, 2005, p. 306).\n\nTeachers and administrators in the public school systems of the United States come in contact with a wide variety of sub-cultures and are at the forefront of the challenge of bringing diverse groups together within a larger American society. Issues confronting teachers and administrators on a daily basis include student learning disabilities, student behavioral problems, child abuse, drug addiction, mental health, and poverty, most of which are handled differently within different cultures and communities.\n\nExamples of cultural conflicts often seen by teachers in the public school system include:\n\nExamples of sub-groups within the United States: African American, Asian American, Indian American, Irish American, Jewish American, Mexican American, Native Americans or American Indians and refugees.\n\nThe provision of culturally tailored health care can improve patient outcomes. In 2005, California passed Assembly Bill 1195 that requires patient-related continuing medical education courses in California medical school to incorporate cultural and linguistic competence training in order to qualify for certification credits. In 2011, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research implemented the EBAN Experience™ program to reduce health disparities among minority populations, most notably East African immigrants.\n\nThe term \"Hispanic\" is problematic. It is impossible to refer to \"a Hispanic-American perspective\" or to \"a single Latino culture\".(1)(2) The label \"Hispanic\" is controversial because it was coined by the Federal Government to describe a heterogeneous ethnic population whose ancestors come from a Spanish-speaking country. Although these American citizens have Latin American roots, the term \"Latino\" to characterize them is more correct since it is more inclusive of non-Spanish-speaking Latinos. However, the term \"Latino\" does not include individuals from Spanish-speaking countries outside of Latin America (e.g., Spain).\n\nThere is also a lack of adequate research into how race and ethnicity affects members of a group.(3)(4)(5) There are few life histories and phenomenological studies of illness as experienced by people outside the American white, urban, middle class, especially of immigrant and native populations. Race has been used to explain the absence of research. Racial classifications are based on outmoded concepts and dubious assumptions regarding genetic differences. In fact, outside of skin color, race is poorly correlated with biological or cultural phenomena, which sharply diminishes its validity in biomedical or social research. Yet, unlike race or national origin, ethnicity is a sociological construct highly correlated with behavioral and cultural phenomena, particularly language, dress, adornment, food preference, religion, social interaction, marriage and family customs.\n\nFurther research is needed to determine whether race and ethnicity among Latinos are rather driven by mechanisms of discrimination and macrosocial factors or social status. Fortunately, not too long ago, the National Institutes of Health took an important step by insisting that any NIH- supported clinical investigation include, where appropriate, minority populations, women and the aged.(6) However, we must guard against what has been called a new \"tokenism\", that is, having a large aggregate of \"non-whites\", and a few African Americans and Hispanics included. This aggregate will never produce a proper sample. Rigorous attention to sample size, composition and sampling strategies is required to research basic psychosocial processes and clinical responses of minority populations. Accordingly, the heterogeneity of the Hispanic community has to be taken into account. The Hispanic's country of origin, cultural history, migration history, language, family, traditions, religion, educational level, socio-economic status, gender, sexual orientation, age and generation—all need to be explored.\n\nCross-cultural competence (3C) has generated confusing and contradictory definitions because it has been studied by a wide variety of academic approaches and professional fields. One author identified eleven different terms that have some equivalence to 3C: cultural savvy, astuteness, appreciation, literacy or fluency, adaptability, terrain, expertise, competency, awareness, intelligence, and understanding. The United States Army Research Institute, which is currently engaged in a study of 3C has defined it as \"A set of cognitive, behavioral, and affective/motivational components that enable individuals to adapt effectively in intercultural environments\".\n\nOrganizations in academia, business, health care, government security, and developmental aid agencies have all sought to use 3C in one way or another. Poor results have often been obtained due to a lack of rigorous study of 3C and a reliance on \"common sense\" approaches.\n\nCross-cultural competence does not operate in a vacuum, however. One theoretical construct posits that 3C, language proficiency, and regional knowledge are distinct skills that are inextricably linked, but to varying degrees depending on the context in which they are employed. In educational settings, Bloom's affective and cognitive taxonomies serve as an effective framework for describing the overlapping areas among these three disciplines: at the receiving and knowledge levels, 3C can operate with near-independence from language proficiency and regional knowledge. But, as one approaches the internalizing and evaluation levels, the overlapping areas approach totality.\n\nThe development of intercultural competence is mostly based on the individual's experiences while he or she is communicating with different cultures. When interacting with people from other cultures, the individual experiences certain obstacles that are caused by differences in cultural understanding between two people from different cultures. Such experiences may motivate the individual to acquire skills that can help him to communicate his point of view to an audience belonging to a different cultural ethnicity and background.\n\nA salient issue, especially for people living in countries other than their native country, is the issue of which culture they should follow: their native culture or the one in their new surroundings.\n\nInternational students also face this issue: they have a choice of modifying their cultural boundaries and adapting to the culture around them or holding on to their native culture and surrounding themselves with people from their own country. The students who decide to hold on to their native culture are those who experience the most problems in their university life and who encounter frequent culture shocks. But international students who adapt themselves to the culture surrounding them (and who interact more with domestic students) will increase their knowledge of the domestic culture, which may help them to \"blend in\" more. In the article it stated, \"Segmented assimilation theorists argue that students from less affluent and racial and ethnic minority immigrant families face a number of educational hurdles and barriers that often stem from racial, ethnic, and gender biases and discrimination embedded within the U.S. public school system\" (Bondy).\nSuch individuals may be said to have adopted bicultural identities.\n\nAnother issue that stands out in intercultural communication is the attitude stemming from Ethnocentrism. LeVine and Campbell (as cited in Lin and Rancer, 2003) defines ethnocentrism as people's tendency to view their culture or in-group as superior to other groups, and to judge those groups to their standards. With ethnocentric attitudes, those incapable to expand their view of different cultures could create conflict between groups. Ignorance to diversity and cultural groups contributes to prevention of peaceful interaction in a fast-paced globalizing world. The counterpart of ethnocentrism is ethnorelativism: the ability to see multiple values, beliefs, norms etc. in the world as cultural rather than universal; being able to understand and accept different cultures.\n\nCultural characteristics can be measured along several dimensions that were defined by Geert Hofstede in his studies of cultural differences. The ability to perceive them and to cope with them is fundamental for intercultural competence. These characteristics include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"See also:\" Chronemics\n\nThe assessment of cross-cultural competence is another field that is rife with controversy. One survey identified 86 assessment instruments for 3C. A United States Army Research Institute study narrowed the list down to ten quantitative instruments that were suitable for further exploration of their reliability and validity.\n\nThe following characteristics are tested and observed for the assessment of intercultural competence as an existing ability or as the potential to develop it: ambiguity tolerance, openness to contacts, flexibility in behavior, emotional stability, motivation to perform, empathy, metacommunicative competence, and polycentrism.\n\nThree examples of quantitative assessment instruments are:\n\nResearch in the area of 3C assessment, while thin, points to the value of qualitative assessment instruments in concert with quantitative ones. Qualitative instruments, such as scenario-based assessments, are useful for gaining insight into intercultural competence.\n\nIntercultural coaching frameworks, such as the ICCA™ (Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal), do not attempt an assessment; they provide guidance for personal improvement based upon the identification of personal traits, strengths, and weaknesses.\n\nIt is important that cross-cultural competence training and skills does not break down into the application of stereotypes. Although its goal is to promote understanding between groups of individuals that, as a whole, think differently, it may fail to recognize specific differences between individuals of any given group. Such differences can be more significant than the differences between groups, especially in the case of heterogeneous populations and value systems.\n\nMadison (2006) has criticized the tendency of 3C training for its tendency to simplify migration and cross-cultural processes into stages and phases. Madison's article offers an outline of the original research.\n\nSee also a recent article by Witte summarizing objections to cultural theories used in business and social life.\n\n"}

The existence of this linguistic border led to differentiate the Celtic-speaking Lower Brittany (West) from the Romance-speaking Upper Brittany (East).\n\nThe farthest eastern extension of the Breton language was in the ninth century, when the linguistic border was located near Nantes and Rennes. Breton declined inexorably in favor of the Gallo gradually moving westward along a Binic-Guérande line. The border can now be traced along a line from Plouha to Rhuys. The linguistic unification of France, completed after World War II, made somewhat obsolete the linguistic aspect of the distinction between Upper and Lower Brittany, although many people still consider it valid in terms of toponymy, culture and identity.\n\nPlace-names are one form of evidence for the linguistic boundary during the Early Middle Ages, suggesting that it was much farther to the east than it is now, near Nantes and Rennes. For example, Pleugueneuc, in Ille-et-Vilaine, combines the Breton element \"plou\" (parish) with the name 'Guehenoc'.\n\nThe distinction of two Brittanys was made at least as early as the 15th century, when the names used were \"Britannia gallicana\" (Gallic Brittany) and \"Britannia britonizans\" (Brittonic Brittany). At that time, it appears that Lower Brittany had a separate fiscal status. Since then, the boundary between them has changed slowly as a result of the long retreat of the Breton language.\n\nUnder the \"ancien régime\", the boundary between the two was generally in line with the province's division into nine bishoprics, with those of Rennes, Dol, Nantes, St Malo and St Brieuc considered to form Upper Brittany, while Tréguier, Vannes, Quimper and Saint-Pol-de-Léon formed Lower Brittany.\n\nIn 1588, the historian Bertrand d'Argentré defined the boundary as running from the outskirts of Binic southwards to Guérande, leaving the towns of Loudéac, Josselin, and Malestroit in Upper Brittany. In 1886, Paul Sébillot noted that the boundary was deeper into what had been Breton territory, the line then running from Plouha on the north coast to Batz-sur-Mer in the south, on the Bay of Biscay.\n\nThe boundary between 'Upper' and 'Lower' Brittany is now a purely imaginary line and has no administrative or other status. However, having been based on linguistic areas, the boundary does correspond very roughly to administrative borders. The town of Ploërmel is one point where the two meet.\n\nIn area, Upper Brittany now takes in something over half of the 35,000 square kilometres of the whole of Brittany, but it has some 2.5 million people, compared with Lower Brittany's 1.6 million. In the early 20th century, about 60% of the population had lived in the Breton-speaking areas.\n\n"}

The former includes built heritage such as religious buildings, museums, monuments, and archaeological sites, as well as movable heritage such as works of art and manuscripts. Intangible cultural heritage includes customs, music, fashion and other traditions within a particular culture. This article mainly deals with the destruction of built heritage; the destruction of movable collectable heritage is dealt with in art destruction, whilst the destruction of movable industrial heritage remains almost totally ignored.\n\nDeliberate and systematic destruction of cultural heritage, such as that carried out by ISIL, is regarded as a form of cultural genocide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerous Albanian cultural sites in Kosovo were destroyed during the Kosovo conflict (1998–1999) which constituted a war crime violating the Hague and Geneva Conventions. In all 225 out of 600 mosques in Kosovo were damaged, vandalised, or destroyed alongside other Islamic architecture and Islamic libraries and archives with records spanning 500 years. Additionally 500 Albanian owned \"kulla\" dwellings (traditional stone tower houses) and three out of four well preserved Ottoman period urban centres located in Kosovo cities were badly damaged resulting in great loss of traditional architecture. Kosovo's public libraries, in particular 65 out of 183 were completely destroyed with a loss of 900,588 volumes. During the war, Islamic architectural heritage posed for Yugoslav Serb paramilitary and military forces as Albanian patrimony with destruction of non-Serbian architectural heritage being a methodical and planned component of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.\n\nNATO bombing in March–June 1999 resulted in some accidental damages to churches and a mosque. Revenge attacks against Serbian religious sites commenced following the conflict and the return of hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees to their homes. According to the International Center for Transitional Justice, several Serbian cultural objects, including 155 Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries, were destroyed by Kosovo Albanians between June 1999 and March 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting carnage and the aftermath of the Battle of Manila (followed by the Manila massacre) is responsible for the near total obliteration and evisceration of irreplaceable cultural, and historical heritage & treasures of the \"Pearl of the Orient\" (an international melting pot and a living monument of the meeting and confluence of Spanish, American and Asian cultures). Countless government buildings, universities and colleges, convents, monasteries and churches, and their accompanying treasures, all dating back to the 16th century and in a variety of style, were wiped out and ruined by both Japanese and inadvertently the American forces battling for the control of the city.\n\nThe most devastating damage happened at the ancient walled city of Intramuros, as a result of the assault from 23–26 February, until its total liberation on 4 March, Intramuros was a shell of its former glory (except the church of San Agustin, the sole survivor of the carnage). Outside the walls, large areas of the city had been levelled.\n\nAfter the Liberation, as part of rebuilding Manila, most of the buildings damaged during the war were either demolished in the name of \"Progress\", or rebuilt in a manner that bears no resemblance to the original; replacing European architectural styles during the Spanish and early American era with modern American- and imitation-style architecture. Only a few surviving old buildings remain intact, though even those that remain are continuously endangered to deterioration & neglect, political mismanagement brought on by graft and corruption, rapid urbanization & economic redevelopment, low public awareness & ignorance.\n\nSeveral historic buildings were damaged or destroyed during the 2013 Bohol earthquake, including the Loboc Church, the Loon Church, the Maribojoc Church and the Baclayon Church.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is a prize-winning writer of nonfiction, an essayist, feminist, and activist. Her contributions to the field of cultural studies of age include four books, the latest of which is \"Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America\" (2011). Other books of Gullette's that have been influential (in humanistic and cultural gerontology, history, literary and cultural criticism, sociology and anthropology, performance and film studies, life writing and narrative theory, fashion studies, and feminist health activism) include \"Aged by Culture\" (2004), \"Declining to Decline: Cultural Combat and the Politics of the Midlife\" (1997); and \"Safe at Last in the Middle Years: The Invention of the Midlife Progress Novel\" (1988).\n\nMargaret Morganroth was born in Brooklyn, NY, the first child of Betty Morganroth and Martin Morganroth. She was educated through high school at public schools and received scholarships to go to college and graduate school. Morganroth Gullette holds a B.A. magna cum laude Phi Beta Kappa from Radcliffe College, a M.A. from University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University.\n\nBefore becoming a Scholar in the Women's Studies Research Center in 1996, she had previously worked at the Harvard-Danforth Center for Teaching and Learning and had been a visiting scholar at Harvard; the Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe; Northeastern University; Wellesley Center for Research on Women. At the Danforth (now Bok) Center, she edited \"The Art and Craft of Teaching\". She continues to publish in the field of pedagogy and education. [citation needed]\n\nWorking in the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe, Gullette found a lost novel by the late nineteenth-century English feminist, Mona Caird, \"The Daughters of Danaus\", and wrote an introduction for the Feminist Press reissue. Early in the feminist second wave, she published a feminist children's book called \"The Lost Bellybutton\" (1976). [citation needed]\n\nShe was invited to be the George A. Miller Visiting Professor, at the Center for Advanced Studies, University of Illinois (Urbana/ Champaign), in the spring of 2000. She is an Advisory Editor to the new journal, \"Age, Culture, Humanities: An Interdisciplinary Journal\", and on the book series, Aging Studies in Europe (LIT Verlag). She is on the Advisory Committee of the European Network on Aging (ENAS). She was on the Advisory Committee of the \"Journal of Aging, the Humanities, and the Arts\", 2006 2010 and co editor, Age Studies Series, University Press of Virginia, 1993 1999.\n\nMike Hepworth, the late British cultural gerontologist (1957–2012), in a review of Gullette's work through 1999, calls her \"one of America's foremost critics of the concept of ageing as a universal and comprehensive process of decline. She is a formidable critic of biological essentialism, defender of social constructionism, and opponent of 'middle ageism'\" (Hepworth 1999, Abstract), and the author of an \"increasingly influential range of publications on the social construction of ageing\" (Hepworth 1999, 139) and the life course in the United States. Gullette emerged during the 1990s and beyond as \"the primary theorist and practitioner of what she called 'age studies'\" (Cole and Ray 2010, 17). Gullette named the field of \"age studies\" in 1993 (Gullette 1993, 45–46). The term is used by the Modern Language Association and in the humanities in preference to \"aging studies.\"\n\n\"Her principal thesis is that we are aged by culture. What she means is that much of what we experience as we get older is not the ineluctable consequence of biological ageing . . . but is socially and culturally contingent. American society, she contends, has become a rich terrain on which the social and cultural exclusion of people as they age can take place and where the ideology of ageing can flourish\" (Tulle 2006: 127). Age studies tries to understand age and aging as complex, intersectional social and psychological constructions, and also as a set of mediated relationships among people located at different phases of the life course.\n\n\"Age studies sees 'age' and 'aging' in culture as resulting as much from ideologies as from biology\" (Ball 2006, 214). Gullette has said that she offers a radical social constructionism that pushes \"'the natural' out of context after context\" (Gullette 1997 246 n42). \"Neither Featherstone and Hepworth nor Gullette denied the existence of bodily ageing, although their work has at times been interpreted as coming near to doing so, with their emphasis on the cultural constitution of the body. . . . As a result, their work has been criticised by those who see it as endorsing a false dualism of the body and the self.\" (Twigg, 2007)\n\n\"Margaret Morganroth Gullette has documented ways in which the pervasive ageism of Western cultures is often coded into a narrative structure that associates old age with inevitable decline and decay. Although this 'decline ideology' might seem to work against the futurist assumption of redemptive hope, Gullette explains that we are trained to assume the decline of the old in order to make room for the more highly valued young. To counter this tendency, Gullette urges the proliferation of 'progress narratives,' which project 'a moving image of the self through its past and onward to its better future' (Port 2012, 5–6 ) One of her theoretical moves has been to undermine the binary between \"progress narrative,\" automatically applied to children and younger people; and \"decline narrative,\" automatically applied to people who have aged past midlife.\n\nGullette's term \"age autobiography\" is a call for individual authors to write more knowledgeably and critically about the mediated forces that insinuate themselves into our sense of \"aging.\" \"And once we begin to think age, a more mysterious and intangible project emerges: to discover what our own culture is serving up for us, and what each of us has consumed or resisted\" (Gullette 1993, 46). \"The term itself [\"the master narrative of aging\"] was coined by Margaret Morganroth Gullette and is designed to identify a recognizable ensemble of cultural practices. . . \" (Kunow 2011, 26). The \"master narrative of decline\" requires a single self going through a linear trajectory, while \"the portmanteau self\" is \"an active concept of aging as self narrated experience, the conscious, ongoing story of one's age identity\" (Gullette 1997: 220). Fragments of Gullette's own age autobiography appear in many of her nonfiction works. Cynthia Port singles out \"one powerful essay [in which] Gullette argues that the fashion system teaches us to detach ourselves from and then discard clothes and other no longer fashionable commodities as a means of training ourselves for our own obsolescence in old age\": \"The Other End of the Fashion Cycle: Practicing Loss, Learning Decline\" (Port 2012, n26).\n\nGullette has been called \"one of gerontology's few public intellectuals,\" who demonstrates \"how a scholar works to change the minds of general readers about aging and ageism\" (Ray and Cole 2010: 8). \"The whole point, as Gullette (1988, 1993, 1997) has vividly shown in her analyses of fictional representations of ageing, is to discover how our personal ideas about ageing (positive/ negative/ ambiguous) are shaped by our culture and are therefore open to the possibility of change\" (Hepworth 2000, 3). Convinced that our terminology about age is impoverished, she encourages the use of terms like \"aging-past-youth,\" aging-into-the-middle years,\" and \"aging-into-old age\" (Gullette 1998, 3–44). She argues in several books (1997, 2004, 2011) that collective sociopolitical changes are necessary.\n\n\"Staging Age\", edited by Valerie Barnes Lipscomb and Leni Marshall, gives credit to Gullette's work in establishing the field of age studies, and advancing concepts about how age can be considered a performance (Lipscomb and Marshall 2010, 1–3). She invented the term \"middle ageism\" (Gullette 1998, 3–44) to name the cluster of discriminations suffered by people in their middle years, from job discrimination to \"Boomer-bashing\" and decline discourse about sexuality, looks, and intellectual and cognitive competence. Other concepts developed by Gullette—such as \"age ideology,\" \"being aged by culture,\" and the use of \"progress narrative\" as a way out of the binary between \"positive aging\" and \"decline narrative\"—have been adopted by scholars in a range of disciplines.\n\nGullette's concepts and formulations have been disseminated through a number of chapters and essays or excerpts that have appeared in anthologies, including \n\"A Guide to Humanistic Studies in Aging\" (2010), \n\"Narratives of Life: Mediating Age\" (Munich 2009), \n\"Opposing Viewpoints: The Aging Population\" (2009), \n\"Sociology: Exploring the Architecture of Everyday Life.

Gullette's chapter, 'Overcoming the Terror of Forgetfulness,' in \"Agewise\" was called \"the best essay on memory loss that I have read. Based partly on the author's experiences with her mother, it reveals her deep compassion and insight\" (Cruikshank 2011, 26).\n\n\"Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America\" (2011) won a 2012 Eric Hoffer Book Prize. \"Aged by Culture\" (2004), was chosen as a Noteworthy Book of the year by the \"Christian Science Monitor\". It was nominated for a Pulitzer and received an Honorable Mention from the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights. \"Declining to Decline: Cultural Combat and the Politics of the Midlife\" (1997) won the Emily Toth award in 1998 for the best feminist book on American popular culture.\n\nGullette has held fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies. She held a Bunting Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute in 1986–87 while finishing \"Safe at Last in the Middle Years\".\n\nHer essay, \"The Contagion of Euphoria,\" won the Daniel Singer Millennial Prize in 2008. Other essays, frequently cited as notable in \"Best American Essays\", have appeared in many literary and cultural quarterlyes, including \"Kenyon Review\", \"Michigan Quarterly Review\", \"American Scholar\", and \"Yale Review\"; and in scholarly journals like \"Feminist Studies\", \"Representations\", \"New Political Science\", \"Profession\", and the \"Journal of the History of Sexuality\". Quotations from her books appear in \"The Quotable Woman: The First Five Thousand Years\" (2010). She is a long-term member of PEN-America, to which she was nominated by Carolyn Heilbrun and Alix Kates Shulman. In 2005 she won the Virginia Liebeler Biennial Grant for Mature Women in Letters from the National League of American Pen Women.\n\nIn 2012 Gullette won the Marigold \"Ideas for Good\" Prize, which carries an award of $5000, for her work as the co-founder and director of development for The Free High School for Adults, San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua, the sister city of Newton, MA, where she lives. She has been visiting Nicaragua since 1989, finding funding for adult education programs there.\n\nShe married David Gullette, a college classmate, in 1964.

Healy and Catherine Shultz with the museum's stated goal being \"to make people happy to be alive\".\n\nThe museum was originally established in 1995 in San Diego, in a building the owners claimed was the city's first mortuary. It began as a hobby of the founders J. D. Healy and Catherine Shultz. They would write to serial killers they were interested in, and then show off the artwork their pen pals had created once a year at a specialist show. In 1995, after a few years of exhibitions, the collection, and many other materials, were made into a museum.\n\nIn late 1999, the couple attempted to acquire a large amount of materials from the Heaven's Gate cult suicides. Although they had been able to purchase many items prior to the main police auction, their interest in buying enough merchandise to recreate the scene in its entirety, led to enormous press interest and publicity. They were subsequently evicted by their landlord, and moved to Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles.\n\nPrior to the new Los Angeles building becoming a museum, the building was the home of Westbeach Recorders, and prior to that, Producers Studio, where Pink Floyd and others recorded. The walls include deadening agents to help with recordings, which now serve to lend a quiet acoustic setting for the various exhibitions.\n\n, the couple had opened up a new branch of the museum in New Orleans called \"Musee de Mort Orleans\". The new museum branch will have around 12,000 square metres of space, which will allow more of the collection to be displayed. The limited space at the California museum means that only a third of the items available can be shown at one time.\n\nThe museum displays a wide variety of art and artifacts surrounding the subject of death. Baby coffins are in one section, letters and artwork from various serial killers in another. There are films regarding autopsies as well as graphic photographs of crime victims. There is also a room filled exclusively with taxidermy of various types of animals. The museum's recreation of the Heaven's Gate mass suicide includes the original beds. However, the most notable item at the museum is the head of Henri Landru. In 2014 the museum also acquired Thanatron, one of the original suicide machines built by Jack Kevorkian.\n\nOnce a year, the museum holds a Black Dahlia look-alike competition, where contestants have to dress as both pre and post-mortem Dahlia.\n\nA 2001 attempt to procure a real electric chair was unsuccessful.\n"}
{"id": "17186338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17186338", "title": "Mythos (Aristotle)", "text": "Mythos (Aristotle)\n\nMythos is the term used by Aristotle in his \"Poetics\" (c. 335 BCE) for the plot of an Athenian tragedy. It is the first of the six elements of tragedy that he gives.\n\n“In \"Poetics\" 13 and 14, Aristotle turns from the discussion of the three separate parts of the plot to a consideration of the plot as a whole composed of these three parts”. In \"Poetics\" 13, Aristotle states his idea that the purpose of tragedy is the arousal of pity and fear. According to Belfiore, even though Aristotle uses one set of criteria for good plots in \"Poetics\" 13 and a different set in \"Poetics\" 14, “these two accounts are more consistent with one another than is often thought”. Aristotle defines plot in chapter 13 of \"Poetics\" as a variation of two different “change types” and three different “character types”. A tragic plot is a movement or change between the end points of good and bad fortune, because of that there are two possible kinds of change: change that begins in good fortune and ends in bad fortune, and change that begins in bad fortune and ends in good fortune. The three possible “character types” are the characters of “decent” people, people “outstanding in excellence and justice”; “evil people”; and the “in-between man”. Of the six logically possible outcomes, Aristotle lists only four. Aristotle contends in \"Poetics\" 13 that the most desirable plot involves ‘An in-between person who changes from good to bad fortune, due to hamartia, “error.” Additionally, Aristotle states that the plot in which ‘An evil person changes from bad to good fortune,’ is the most untragic of all because it is not philanthropic, pitiable, or fearful.’ \"Poetics\" 13 deals with good and bad combinations of character types and change. Conversely, \"Poetics\" 14 discusses good and bad combinations of a pathos with the knowledge or ignorance of the agent. “Ranked from worst to best, by Aristotle, these are the four logical possibilities of pathos:\n\n1. A pathos is about to occur, with knowledge, but does not occur.\n\n2. A pathos occurs, with knowledge.\n\n3. A pathos occurs, in ignorance.\n\n4. A pathos is about to occur, in ignorance, but does not occur”.\n\nThe emotional effect peculiar to the tragic action is therefore that of promoting the experience of feelings such as pity and terror, which constitute the ultimate end at which the representation of the mythos aims.\n\nAristotle’s notion of mythos in \"Poetics\" differs from the modern interpretation of plot most prominently in its role in drama. According to Elizabeth Belfiore’s \"Tragic Pleasures; Aristotle on Plot and Emotion\", Aristotle believed that “plot is essential to tragedy, ethos [character] is second to plot”. Aristotle believes that “psychological and ethical considerations are secondary to the events themselves”. Aristotle’s view focuses nearly all of his attention on the events of the plot, which, in turn, leaves the characters to become merely conveyors of situations rather than humans with convictions and motives. According to Meir Sternberg, Aristotle “restricts the well-made epic or play to a ‘whole’ (holos) action, with ‘beginning, middle, and end’ linked throughout by necessary or probable sequence, so that nothing will follow its cutoff point”). Aristotle’s definition of plot states that every event portrayed and every action taken is a logical progression from previous events. Aristotle’s focuses on mythos (plot) as opposed to a focus on ethos (character) or “conflict either in the sense of struggle within a person or in the sense of the clashing of opposed principles”. Aristotle explains that tragedy imitates the actions and lives of human beings rather than human beings themselves. Aristotle concerns himself with the universally logical events of a plot, rather than the specific and often illogical conflicts between characters associated with those events.\n\nGerman idealist philosopher G. W. F. Hegel believed that tragedy consists of the conflicts between each character’s ethical justification and the resolution toward a greater rational good. Hegel’s viewpoint places character conflict as the central focus of tragedy, in clear contradiction to Aristotle’s plot-centric theory of tragedy. According to Meir Sternberg, modernist dramatic theory endorses the “open ending, and poststructuralism for preaching endless indeterminacy,” which is most noticeable in the modern absurdist theater. In comparison, Sternberg asserts that Aristotle’s viewpoint directs all complex endings and forms of closure into simple cause-and-effect sequences.\n\nAs well, many of Aristotle’s conclusions directly oppose those of twentieth century narratologists such as Vladimir Propp, who “reverses Aristotle's theory that ‘tragedy is imitation not of human beings but of actions,’ by writing that stories are about characters who act”. Propp also argues that basic story elements, which he defines as functions, “are in fact ethically colored, either in themselves or because they are defined in terms of a character who has specific ethical qualities”. Propp’s viewpoint directly conflicts with that of Aristotle in \"Poetics\" because Aristotle states that drama consists of a logical sequence of events that is not affected by ethical dilemmas.\n\n"}

In post-1871 Germany, but especially during the Third Reich, some German professors of linguistics and literature tried to influence English studies with a politically motivated \"cultural science\", which Ernst Leisi called the \"Nationalpsychologische Methode.\" This paradigm presented a new view of contemporary and past English, on the basis of analogies drawn between specific linguistic traits, practices and constituents of the English (and German) national character. But in reality it amounted to little more than a repetition of preconceived notions of otherness. Around 1900, national psychology had become an accepted topic of study in the social sciences, at universities in Europe and North America.\n\nNational psychology plays a role in politics via the ideology of nationalism. Politicians will appeal e.g. to \"the French people\", \"the American people\", the \"Russian people\", the idea being that members of a nation have a common national identity, are part of a national community, and share common interests (the \"national interest\"). Politicians must try to unify and integrate people to work together for common goals, and appealing to their common national characteristics is often part of that.\n\nClosely related is the idea of the national character which refers to the values, norms and customs which people of a nation typically hold, their typical emotional responses, and what they regard as virtue and vice - all factors which determine how they will habitually respond to situations.\n\nNationalism aims to unite people as members of a nation, and for that purpose, the belief that they really have common national characteristics is obviously useful, even if those common characteristics cannot be proved beyond a shared language and a similar physical appearance. Friendly rivalry between national sports teams is often used to symbolize national identity, or to express patriotism. For example, in South Africa sport is \"the national religion. Transcending race, politics or language group, sport unites the country – and not just the male half of it.\"\n\nNational psychology has sometimes been used to explain why economic development occurred in a different way in different countries, or why a particular turn of political events happened as it did.\n\nReference is sometimes made to the \"national psyche\" or the \"soul\" of a nation, to explain why some public events can trigger a commotion or uproar in a country, or why a particular nation gets particularly enthusiastic or obsessed with a sport or cultural practice.\n\nThe idea is that a nation shares a specific cultural mentality, morality or mindset, embedded in its language and institutions, which causes it to react much more strongly, or much less strongly, to particular situations than people of other nations would, and that people from different nations have different problem-solving strategies.\n\nHowever, the validity of the idea of a \"national psychology\" has been strongly criticized, for political, moral and scientific reasons.\n\nPart of the problem is also that researchers usually interpret another culture from the point of view of the culture they are used to (regarded as \"normal\"). Even if many people in a country share a common psychological or biological characteristic, other people in that country may not share that characteristic at all. The important ways in which people differ may outweigh the common characteristics which they can all be proved to share.\n\nPsychologists have found in research that when subjects are asked to identify the ethnicity or nationality of individuals by observing a line-up of different people, they cannot accurately recognize what their ethnicity or nationality is. Marketing and Media experts have found that at most people can identify a representative stereotype, archetype or caricature which \"symbolises\" a particular ethnic group, or characteristic ways of relating which a nation has.\n\nSome additional complications are, that:\n\n\nBecause of all these difficulties in defining national psychology, often the most insightful portrayals of it are not really \"scientific\", but are found rather in the metaphors of fiction, for example in novels and films. These can gives insight into the \"typical\" emotional and intellectual world of a people, without pretending to apply to all its members.\n\nSome writers argue that in the era of globalisation, national or ethnic differences can less and less explain why people behave as they do. Increasingly, it seems that many people do not identify with being part of a nation, and just want to be recognized as a human being with human rights. They might cherish the place where they were born, without however being particularly patriotic. Other writers note that appeals to a national identity can be revived and used as a xenophobic response to perceptions that a country or region is being \"taken over\" by foreign corporations, or \"overrun\" by foreign immigrants.\n\nEspecially in Europe but also in many other parts of the world, adherence to a religion has strongly declined, and therefore the shared view of morality and human nature which religious authorities previously provided is no longer accepted. Religion has had a very strong influence on the shaping of national identity, and as this influence has declined, it can no longer define a national psychology as it used to. However, in other parts of the world, religions have increased their influence, and then national identity and religious identity may influence each other quite significantly.\n\nIn some strands of postmodernism, nations are no longer viewed as legally enforced territories but as imagined communities in which national identification becomes increasingly vaguer. Thus, for example, Michel Foucault claimed that in the West, \"the project of the science of the subject has \ngravitated, in ever-narrowing circles, around the question of sex\" (Foucault, \"The history of sexuality\", Vol. 1, Vintage, p. 70). This could be understood to mean that people really identify more with sexuality than nationality nowadays.\n\nNevertheless, despite controversy, the concept of a \"national psychology\" still persists, insofar as people can observe practically e.g. through tourism and television that there are definitely differences in the way people live life, and how they think about it, in different countries, quite apart from differences in physical appearance or language. There are nowadays books on the national character of practically every people on earth.\n\nModern scientific studies of national psychology try to avoid the traps of prejudice and discrimination, mainly focusing fairly strictly on what can actually be measured, tested and proved objectively, but also by taking a positive (or at least neutral) view of national culture. The modern emphasis is on whether systematic patterns of national differences can be genuinely \"proved\" to exist, what they are, and how they can be explained. To an important extent, this approach is more successful than the old psychology, because much more attempt is made to verify hypotheses with comprehensive evidence, instead of making speculative guesses, or basing theories on anecdotal evidence. Yet researchers often cannot avoid altogether being drawn into disputes about national sentiments, sometimes making it difficult to stay neutral, detached and objective.\n\n\n\n"}

Founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1924, the college offers more than 60 undergraduate majors and 24 graduate programs. Alumni and locals commonly refer to the school as \"Naz\" for short. \n\nAt the request of Bishop Thomas Francis Hickey of Rochester, five Sisters of St. Joseph founded Nazareth College of Rochester in 1924. The first class was composed of 25 young women who began their studies in a large mansion on Lake Avenue in Rochester, New York. The original mansion that housed the college was known as \"the Glass House.\" At that time, the college offered Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, each with a liberal arts core. In response to increasing enrollment, the college moved to a larger facility in 1928 at 402 Augustine Street.\n\nIn January 1942, the college moved to its present campus on East Avenue in the suburb of Pittsford. In the 1950s, the college responded to the need for graduate study by adding majors and by the 1970s offered programs in teacher education and social work. Study abroad programs and intercollegiate sports were also added in the 1970s. During this time, the college became co-educational and independent of the Roman Catholic Church. \n\nNazareth competed in men’s intercollegiate athletics for the first time in 1977. The official nickname of the sports teams became the Golden Flyers — golden for the Nazareth color, and flyers for the bird-like symbol that is part of the old Nazareth logo. Today, Nazareth supports 25 varsity teams. The most recent sport, added in 2018, is women's ice hockey.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the college purchased adjacent land from the Sisters of St. Joseph, including the former Motherhouse and Infirmary. This acquisition doubled the campus size to its current 150 acres. As a result of support from college benefactors (including Tom Golisano, the founder of Paychex), the Motherhouse became the Golisano Academic Center. The Infirmary became George Hall, a residence hall that also houses a coffeehouse and late night study area. The decade of the 2000s also saw the construction of additional student housing, including Portka Hall, Clock Tower Commons, and the Lyons and Breen apartment buildings.\n\nIn 2003, 30 years after becoming religiously independent, Nazareth College was removed from \"The Official Catholic Directory,\" having been declared no longer a Catholic institution by Rochester Bishop Matthew H. Clark. It was the second time since Pope John Paul II issued Ex Corde Ecclesiae, the apostolic constitution on Catholic universities in 1990, a bishop declared a historically Catholic college or university to be not Catholic.\n\nIn 2012, Nazareth added Peckham Hall, the Integrated Center for Math and Science. Named after lead donors Nancy and Larry Peckham, the $30 million facility supports majors in math and science fields, as well as education programs. It also provides important learning facilities for students in health and human services programs. \nIn 2015, the York Wellness and Rehabilitation Institute opened after an extensive renovation/expansion of Carroll Hall consolidated and doubled the size of the clinics associated with the college's School of Health and Human Services and added collaboration space.\n\nNazareth College is organized into four core schools:\n\nNazareth offers more than 60 four-year undergraduate programs, 20 master's degree programs, a Doctorate of Physical Therapy, and three post-baccalaureate certificate programs. \n\nUndergraduate Majors and Programs\n\nAccounting,\nActing,\nAmerican Studies,\nAnthropology,\nArt Education,\nArt History,\nArt (Studio Art), \nArt (Visual Communication Design),\nBiochemistry,\nBiology,\nBiomedical Sciences,\nBusiness Management,\nChemistry,\nChinese,\nClinical Laboratory Sciences,\nCommunication and Media,\nCommunication Sciences and Disorders (Speech Therapy),\nCommunity Youth Development,\nDance Studies,\nEconomics,\nEducation (Adolescence Education, Early Childhood and Elementary),\nEducation (Special Education),\nEnglish,\nEnvironmental Science and Sustainability,\nFinance,\nFrench,\nGuided Exploration of Majors (for undeclared majors)\nHistory,\nInternational and Global Studies,\nItalian,\nLaw (3+3 with Syracuse U.),\nLegal Studies,\nMarketing,\nMathematics,\nModern Foreign Languages,\nMuseums, Archives, and Public History,\nMusic,\nMusic/Business,\nMusic Composition,\nMusic Education,\nMusic Performance,\nMusic Therapy,\nMusical Theatre,\nNursing,\nNursing Accelerated Weekend R.N. to B.S.,\nOccupational Therapy,\nPeace and Justice,\nPhilosophy,\nPhysical Therapy,\nPolitical Science,\nPsychology,\nPublic Health,\nReligious Studies,\nSocial Science,\nSocial Work,\nSociology,\nSpanish,\nTechnical Production,\nTheatre Arts,\nToxicology,\nUndeclared program,\nWomen and Gender Studies.\n\nGraduate Programs\nAmerican Studies, \nArt Education, \nArt Therapy,\nBusiness Organization and Management, \nEducational Technology Specialist, \nESOL (post-master's certification program),\nHigher Education Student Affairs Administration, \nHuman Resource Development, \nHuman Resource Management, \nInclusive Adolescence Education (to teach grades 7-12), \nInclusive Childhood Education (to teach grades 1-6), \nInclusive Early Childhood Education (to teach birth-grade 2), \nIntegrated Marketing Communications, \nLeadership and Change Management, \nLiteracy Specialist, \nMusic Education, \nMusic Therapy, \nPerformance and Pedagogy, \nPhysical Therapy, \nSocial Work, \nSpeech-Language Pathology, \nTESOL (with and without N.Y. state teaching certification)\n\nCore curriculum\n\nIn 2013, Nazareth College revised its liberal arts core, required for all undergraduates.\n\nFulbright Program at Nazareth\n\nHonors Program\n\nClinton Global Initiative University\n\nIn fall 2013, Nazareth College joined the Clinton Global Initiative University Network (CGI U), a consortium of colleges and universities that support, mentor, and provide seed funding to student leaders who are developing solutions to the world's most pressing challenges. From 2014 to 2017, CGI U selected a total of 26 students from Nazareth College to attend its three-day international conference, based on the strength of the projects they proposed in health, education, youth empowerment, and the environment.\n\n\n\nRenovated in 2009, the Nazareth College Arts Center is a campus venue with spaces including:\n\nThe Nazareth College Arts Center is the home of Bach Children’s Chorus as well as the performance home of Rochester City Ballet and Garth Fagan Dance. The Arts Center houses the Nazareth College departments of Art, Music, and Theatre & Dance.\n\nThe Center for Interfaith Studies and Dialogue (CISD) at Nazareth College was founded in 2005. In 2011, International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) of Herndon, Virginia offered Nazareth a major gift, provided it was matched by local donors. Brian and Jean Hickey matched this gift, resulting in renaming the center the Hickey Center for Interfaith Studies and Dialogue at Nazareth College. The endowed chair of the Center was left to the IIIT, and they selected Dr. Muhammad Shafiq, who was imam of the Islamic Center of Rochester, the Rochester metropolitan area's largest mosque. The Center is part of Nazareth’s College of Arts and Sciences and located in the Golisano Academic Center. Dr. Muhammad Shafiq is the executive director of the Hickey Center for Interfaith Studies and Dialogue and a professor of Islamic and religious studies at the college.\n\nThe Casa Italiana (Italian House) is a center of Italian language, literature, and culture. It serves as a cultural center for the college and the Rochester metropolitan area. Built with the help of the Italian-American community of greater Rochester in 1978, the Casa promotes traditional and contemporary Italian culture, explores the Italian-American experience, and seeks to enhance exchanges between the United States and Italy. The reading room at the Casa provides the college and the community with language and culture resources, and the classroom provides an environment in which students and community members can study the Italian language. Cultural events organized by the Casa include lectures, cooking and language classes, film nights, conferences, concerts, seminars, symposia, bocce tournaments, art shows, and trips to Italy.\nLa Maison Française (French House) is a home converted into a cultural center and residence hall for 13 selected foreign language majors. The French House offers a living environment and resource center for students who wish to immerse themselves in French culture and practice speaking French. La Maison Française also offers a line-up of cultural events throughout the year. Such gatherings, which include French film nights, cultural and historical lectures, reader’s theater showcases, Francophone regional dinners and campus diversity dinners, occur on Thursday evenings and are prepared by the French department and the house residents.\n\nAt the heart of the Spanish program is the Casa Hispana, a lively place where students and community members enjoy films, conversation, art exhibitions, and a variety of events relating to the culture of Spain and the Latin American countries. The Casa also houses the offices of the Spanish program faculty, a library, and classrooms.\n\n\nNazareth's men's and women's athletic teams are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division III. The Golden Flyers are a member of the Empire 8 Athletic Conference (Empire 8). For men's volleyball, Nazareth is a member of the single-sport United Volleyball Conference and for men's ice hockey, a member of the United Collegiate Hockey Conference. Athletic facilities at Nazareth include the Robert A. Kidera Gymnasium (1,200) and Golden Flyer Stadium (2,200).\n\nMen's sports include basketball, cross country, equestrian, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, and volleyball; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, equestrian, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, volleyball, and dance. The College announced plans to add women's hockey in 2018.\n\nThe Nazareth men's lacrosse team is a three-time NCAA Division III National Champion (1992, 1996, and 1997). The team has also appeared in the NCAA postseason tournament nineteen times. In 2011, the Nazareth men's indoor volleyball team achieved a #1 national ranking and won the Molten Division III National Championship, while in 2013 they finished runner-up in the NCAA Division III championship to Springfield.\n\nNazareth College's traditional rival is St. John Fisher College, just a mile to the north. The annual men's basketball game between the schools is known as \"The Battle of the Beaks.\"\n\nMore than 95 percent of students are involved in community service through academic service-learning, student organizations, athletics, and residence life. Nazareth has an on-campus Center for Civic Engagement to serve as a resource for students, staff and faculty who want to learn and serve in the context of the local, regional, national and global communities. The Center is also a point of contact for community members seeking College involvement with local organizations, programs and projects. The school also has a campus ministry program to connect students to various volunteer organizations. In addition, over 60% of alumni are known to participate regularly in community service. In 2007, the college was named to the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll (with distinction). And in 2013, Nazareth was only one of five schools in the country named to the 2013 President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll, the highest honor a college or university can receive, at the federal level, for its commitment to volunteering, service-learning, and civic engagement.\n\nNazareth has more than 33,000 alumni residing in all 50 states and 38 countries around the world.\nNotable Nazareth alumni include:\n\n\nFor more: Annual Events Calendar\n\n"}
{"id": "3699777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3699777", "title": "Persian studies", "text": "Persian studies\n\nPersian studies is the study of the Persian language and its literature specifically. It is differentiated from Iranian studies which is a broader, more interdisciplinary subject that focuses more on the histories and cultures of all Iranian peoples. \n\nThe study of language in Iran reaches back many centuries before Islam. The Avestan alphabet, developed during the Sassanid Empire, was derived from the Pahlavi alphabet and remained one of the most phonologically sophisticated alphabets until the modern period. The Zoroastrian liturgies until that point had been orally transmitted, and the ability to set these ancient texts in writing helped to preserve them. Even earlier than that, however, the invention of the Old Persian syllabary, whose shapes were adapted from preexisting cuneiform systems demonstrates that Iranian peoples could think critically, logically, and imaginatively about their language. \n\nThe coming of Islam announced the end of the world of Antiquity and the replacement of Zoroastrianism with Islam as the most important faith of the Iranian plateau. Iran became part of the great Islamic community, the Ummah, and saw the rise of Arabic as the new language of literature and learning. Iranian-born grammarians, rhetoricians, scientists, philosophers, theologians, contributed to the intellectual vitality of this new and vibrant civilization alongside other Muslims from other nationalities. Among the most prominent are:\n\n\nMany regions of this Arab Empire saw the almost total replacement the indigenous language by Arabic: the pre-Islamic languages of Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and North Africa exist only in isolated communities and have been largely replaced by Arabic. Not so in Iran, where the Persian language continued, albeit with an infusion of Arabic vocabulary, and thrived as the courtly language of the Islamic Orient. In fact it was in the Eastern reaches of the Caliphate, far from the seat of Arab power in Baghdad, where New Persian reemerged as a literary and courtly language.\n\nPersian was the \"lingua franca\" of a wide area, not limited to Iran. The first Europeans to encounter the Persian language were the envoys and diplomats of early modern European nations sent first to Ottoman Turkey and then to other places. The earliest motivation for the study of Persian was to win converts to Christianity.\n\n\nGrammars and dictionaries of the Persian language were first composed in the 17th century during which efforts were made to understand the \"Persian of the people.\" Later on, Persian as it was actually used declined in importance as Classical Persian literature was introduced to the continent.\n\n\nDuring this century, Europeans discovered the rich store of Classical Persian literature, and study of the Persian language meant study of the language as it was used in these works. The first edition of the Gulistan of Sa'di was published in 1654 CE. As British trade with the Indian subcontinent increased, the focus of learning Persian shifted to the \"colonial\" Persian of India.\n\n\nDuring this period of intense interest in the Orient, Persian proved to be one of the most important languages for the incipient field of Comparative Linguistics. Many scholars in prior centuries had commented on the similarities between Germanic and Iranian languages, but in the 19th century, scholars for the first time postulated a common ancestor to languages like Sanskrit, Persian, and European languages which has since come to be called the Proto-Indo-European language. \n\nAs important was the deciphering of Old Persian, the language of dozens of inscriptions which still stand in Iran. Sir Henry Rawlinson first discovered that the language of these inscriptions was an ancient form of the Persian language. Since these inscriptions often included inscriptions in other Cuneiform scripts, this decipherment became like a Rosetta Stone for the languages of ancient Mesopotamia. All that we know of the languages and histories of the empires of Babylonia, Assyria, Sumer, Elam, and so on is indirectly indebted to knowledge of the Persian language.\n\nDuring the Qajar dynasty, Iranians first encountered Europeans in the context of the rise of the West. Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798 CE was the first European intrusion into the Muslim Middle East and prefigured many more disruptions for the peoples of this region, especially Iran. Iran lost territory in several wars with Russia and Britain. Iran's economy suffered greatly as European sea lanes bypassed the legendary Silk Road which had always been a pillar of Iran's economy. New industrial processes of production made traditional ways of living impossible for Iranians. As in many other countries during this time like Japan, China, and Turkey, a nationalist reaction occurred in Iran as Iranians realized the importance of modernizing as quickly as possible to fight off the encroachment of the Western powers. It was at this point that modern educational institutions in Western tradition were first opened in Iran. Iran would never be the same, and the study of language there merged with the tradition in Europe.\n\n\nLibrary guides:\n"}

{"id": "4228181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4228181", "title": "Stateless society", "text": "Stateless society\n\nA stateless society is a society that is not governed by a state, or, especially in common American English, has no government. In stateless societies, there is little concentration of authority; most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in power and are generally not permanently held positions; and social bodies that resolve disputes through predefined rules tend to be small. Stateless societies are highly variable in economic organization and cultural practices.\n\nWhile stateless societies were the norm in human prehistory, few stateless societies exist today; almost the entire global population resides within the jurisdiction of a sovereign state. In some regions nominal state authorities may be very weak and wield little or no actual power. Over the course of history most stateless peoples have been integrated into the state-based societies around them.\n\nSome political philosophies, particularly anarchism, consider the state an unwelcome institution and stateless societies the ideal.\n\nIn archaeology, cultural anthropology and history, a stateless society denotes a less complex human community without a state, such as a tribe, a clan, a band society or a chiefdom. The main criterion of \"complexity\" used is the extent to which a division of labor has occurred such that many people are permanently \"specialized\" in particular forms of production or other activity, and depend on others for goods and services through trade or sophisticated reciprocal obligations governed by custom and laws. An additional criterion is population size. The bigger the population, the more relationships have to be reckoned with.\n\nEvidence of the earliest known city-states has been found in ancient Mesopotamia around 3700 BC, suggesting that the history of the state is less than 6,000 years old; thus, for most of human prehistory the state did not exist.\n\nGenerally speaking, the archaeological evidence suggests that the state emerged from stateless communities only when a fairly large population (at least tens of thousands of people) was more or less settled together in a particular territory, and practiced agriculture. Indeed, one of the typical functions of the state is the defense of territory. Nevertheless, there are exceptions: Lawrence Krader for example describes the case of the Tatar state, a political authority arising among confederations of clans of nomadic or semi-nomadic herdsmen.\n\nCharacteristically the state functionaries (royal dynasties, soldiers, scribes, servants, administrators, lawyers, tax collectors, religious authorities etc.) are mainly not self-supporting, but rather materially supported and financed by taxes and tributes contributed by the rest of the working population. This assumes a sufficient level of labor-productivity per capita which at least makes possible a \"permanent\" surplus product (principally foodstuffs) appropriated by the state authority to sustain the activities of state functionaries. Such permanent surpluses were generally not produced on a significant scale in smaller tribal or clan societies.\n\nThe archaeologist Gregory Possehl has argued that there is no evidence that the relatively sophisticated, urbanized Harappan civilization, which flourished from about 2,500 to 1,900 BC in the Indus region, featured anything like a centralized state apparatus. No evidence has yet been excavated locally of palaces, temples, a ruling sovereign or royal graves, a centralized administrative bureaucracy keeping records, or a state religion—all of which are elsewhere usually associated with the existence of a state apparatus.\n\nSimilarly, in the earliest large-scale human settlements of the stone age which have been discovered, such as Çatal Höyük and Jericho, no evidence was found of the existence of a state authority. The Çatal Höyük settlement of a farming community (7,300 BC to circa 6,200 BC) spanned circa 13 hectares (32 acres) and probably had about 5,000 to 10,000 inhabitants.\n\nModern state-based societies regularly pushed out stateless indigenous populations as their settlements expanded.\n\nUncontacted peoples may be considered remnants of prehistoric stateless societies. To varying extents they may be unaware of and unaffected by the states that have nominal authority over their territory.\n\nSome political philosophies consider the state undesirable, and thus consider the formation of a stateless society a goal to be achieved.\n\nA central tenet of anarchism is the advocacy of society without states. The type of society sought for varies significantly between anarchist schools of thought, ranging from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.\n\nIn Marxism, Marx's theory of the state considers that in a post-capitalist society the state, an undesirable institution, would be unnecessary and wither away. A related concept is that of stateless communism, a phrase sometimes used to describe Marx's anticipated post-capitalist society.\n\nAnthropologists have found that social stratification is not the standard among all societies. John Gowdy writes, \"Assumptions about human behaviour that members of market societies believe to be universal, that humans are naturally competitive and acquisitive, and that social stratification is natural, do not apply to many hunter-gatherer peoples.\"\n\nThe economies of stateless agricultural societies tend to focus and organize subsistence agriculture at the community level, and tend to diversify their production rather than specializing in a particular crop.\n\nIn many stateless societies, conflicts between families or individuals are resolved by appealing to the community. Each of the sides of the dispute will voice their concerns, and the community, often voicing its will through village elders, will reach a judgment on the situation. Even when there is no legal or coercive authority to enforce these community decisions, people tend to adhere to them, due to a desire to be held in esteem by the community.\n\n"}
{"id": "14026639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14026639", "title": "Tanning dependence", "text": "Tanning dependence\n\nTanning dependence is a syndrome where an individual appears to have a physical or psychological dependence on sunbathing or the use of ultraviolet (UV) tanning beds. Compulsive tanning may satisfy the definition of a behavioral addiction as well.\n\nTanning dependence may have a physiological basis involving endogenous opioids. There is evidence that UV exposure produces beta-endorphin in the epidermis and conflicting evidence of this opioid being released into the blood system, a pathway to the brain. A small study also found the opioid antagonist naltrexone reduced preference for UV tanning beds and at higher doses produced withdraw symptoms in frequent tanners. Better understanding of tanning dependence requires further controlled studies, especially in imaging and neurobiology.\n\nThe finding that excessive tanning can lead to dependence is based upon \"the observations of many dermatologists.\" Dermatologists tell researchers that although they advise their patients not to visit tanning beds because of the risk of melanoma, patients still do. In a 2014 literature review, researchers wrote that many people who tan excessively meet psychiatry's symptom criteria for substance abuse. In a case where ten studies provided data for the assessment of melanoma risk among subjects who reported “ever” being exposed compared with those “never” exposed; a positive association was found between exposure and risk.\n\nThe effects of tanning dependence are/but not limited to: skin cancer, skin burns, premature skin aging, and eye damage (both short and long-term).\n\nTanorexia is the term used to describe a condition in which a person, most notably Caucasian people, participates in excessive outdoor sun tanning or excessive use of other skin tanning methods (such as tanning beds) to achieve a darker skin complexion because they perceive themselves as unacceptably pale. The syndrome is different from tanning dependence, although both may fit into the same syndrome and can be considered a subset of tanning dependence.\n\nAlthough the term \"tanorexia\" has been used by the media and several doctors to describe the syndrome, both the word and syndrome have not been widely accepted by the medical community, and is considered slang by many. The term tanorexia was coined after the medical condition anorexia nervosa, a disorder characterized by low body weight and body image distortion with an obsessive fear of gaining weight. It can be likened to the common practice of adding the suffix \"-aholic\" (from the term alcoholic) to the end of any action or food someone enjoys extensively and often (e.g., \"choc-aholic\", \"work-aholic\", \"golf-aholic\", \"shop-aholic\", etc.).\n\nSerious cases of tanorexia can be considered dangerous. This is because many of the more popular methods of tanning (such as those mentioned above) require prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which is known to be a cause of many negative side effects, including skin cancer.\n\nExtreme instances may be an indication of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a mental disorder in which one is extremely critical of his or her physique or self-image to an obsessive and compulsive degree. As it is with anorexia, a person with BDD is said to show signs of a characteristic called distorted body image. In layman's terms, anorexia sufferers commonly believe they are overweight, many times claiming they see themselves as \"fat\", when in reality, they are often, but not always, nutritionally underweight and physically much thinner than the average person. In the same way, a sufferer of \"tanorexia\" may believe him or herself to have a much lighter – even a pale – complexion when he or she is actually quite dark-skinned.\n\nNeither tanning dependence nor tanorexia are covered under the latest edition of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\". However, a 2005 article in \"The Archives of Dermatology\" presents a case for UV light tanning dependence to be viewed as a type of substance abuse disorder.\n\nIn 2012, New Jersey mother Patricia Krentcil received national media attention amid accusations that she had brought her five-year-old daughter with her to a tanning salon in order for the child to receive a tan. The child's school nurse had expressed concern over her sunburn, at which point the daughter claimed she had gone \"tanning with Mommy\". This prompted the school to call Division of Youth and Family Services, as New Jersey law bans children under 14 from tanning booths. Initial media coverage of the event resulted in widespread attention given to Patricia Krentcil's unusually bronzed image, leading many to speculate that she was tanorexic. She was subsequently charged with second-degree child endangerment, and she was banned from over 60 tanning salons in the tri-state area. Patricia claimed that it was all a misunderstanding, saying her daughter was never exposed to the tanning booth's UV rays and instead got slightly sunburned while playing outside on a warm day. She was later cleared of the charge. At one point, she was challenged to stop tanning for one month, which she did, greatly changing her appearance. She claimed it made her feel \"weird and pale\", and that she would cut back on tanning, but not eliminate it from her hobbies. A Connecticut-based business also attempted to seize and capitalize on the \"tan mom\" craze by creating an action figure doll of Patricia.\n\nExcessive tanning increases the risk of developing certain types of skin cancer. People that are addicted to tanning are dealing with a body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). People with tanorexia dislike the color of their skin but in reality the perceived defect may be only a slight imperfection or non-existent. Commonly, people who are suffering from tanorexia also suffer from anxiety disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and eating disorders.\n\nTo get the right treatment for tanorexia, people must mention specifically their concerns with their appearance when they talk to a doctor or mental health professional. Effective treatments that are available at the moment are cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressant medications, hypnosis and addiction treatment centers. Antidepressant medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and can help relieve the obsessive and compulsive symptoms of tanorexia. The third treatment, is an audio hypnosis session which is developed by psychologists with a wide experience in helping people beat all kinds of addictive behaviour patterns. Lastly, people with an extreme tanning addiction can look for help at specific addiction centres that are spread throughout the United States.\n\nIn Western European culture, pale skin has indicated high status. A tan signified that you had to work outdoors as a manual laborer, while pale skin announced that you could afford to stay out of the sun and spend time and money cultivating your appearance. In the 1920s, pioneering fashion designer Coco Chanel popularized the idea of tanning. She made it so the sun represented pleasure and relaxation as well as wealth. Post Industrial Revolution, tanning gained popularity because at this time it was easier to be employed, and therefore there was less outdoor manual labor, and more indoor labor. Due to more indoor jobs, a tan began to mean that you had time the leisure time to bronze your skin and the money to travel to places where it could be acquired. A tan also represented enthusiasm for outdoor activities, as well as physical fitness and good health.\n\nWhen tanning bed became implemented the concept of tanning changed yet again. The first self tanner, Tan-Man, was introduced in 1959, and UV tanning beds started to appear in the United States in 1978. A study conducted at Pepperdine University in 2005 found that 25 percent of beach-goers showed signs of tanning addiction or tanorexia. Since the implementation of tanning beds in the United States, nearly 30 million people tan indoors every year.\n\nThere have been health issues related to tanning trends. In 2014 most Australian states put a ban on all commercial tanning beds. It is the second nation after Brazil to impose restrictions. In 2011 over 2000 people died from skin cancer in Australia. Several European counties and American States have banned the use of tanning beds by minors. Scientists have also suspected that frequent exposure to UVs has the potential to become addictive. Researchers have found that several parts of the brain that a play a role in addiction are active when people are exposed to UV rays.\n\nIn the mid 1990’s, a new type of tanning trend appeared in Japan called Ganguro. It was a way for Japanese women to resist traditional roles for women in Japan. The style is described as having deep tans and blond, orange, or silver gray hair. Many of these women were shunned by the public and media.\n\n"}
{"id": "325542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=325542", "title": "Technology acceptance model", "text": "Technology acceptance model\n\nThe technology acceptance model (TAM) is an information systems theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology. The model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:\nThe TAM has been continuously studied and expanded—the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 ( & ) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (or UTAUT, ). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of e-commerce with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use ().\n\nTAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein's theory of reasoned action (TRA) in the literature. Davis's technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989)\nis the most widely applied model of users' acceptance and usage of technology\n(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and Richard Bagozzi (, ). TAM replaces many of TRA's attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures—\"ease of use\", and \"usefulness\". TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act ().\n\nBagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:\n\nEarlier research on the diffusion of innovations also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein () analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms \"task fit\" to describe the metric (quoted in ) suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.\n\nSeveral researchers have replicated Davis's original study () to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use (; ; ; ; ; ). Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. () replicated the work of Davis () to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. () found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna () found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.\n\nSegars and Grover () re-examined Adams et al.'s () replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman () by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.\n\nMark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis's model into what they call the Usefulness/EOU Grid, which is a 2×2 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software ().\nThe TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly \nVenkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2 ().\n\nIn an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent) (). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.\n\n\nTAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a \"theory\" include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value (). Benbasat and Barki suggest that TAM \"has diverted researchers' attention away from other \nimportant research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the \nindependent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion\" (). In general, TAM focuses on the individual 'user' of a computer, with the concept of 'perceived usefulness', with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user 'perceives' 'usefulness', and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology. For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi ().\n\nLegris et al. claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system's use.\n\nPerceived ease of use is less likely to be a determinant of attitude and usage intention according to studies of telemedicine (), mobile commerce (, and online banking ().\n\nA study conducted by Okafor, D. J., Nico, M. & Azman, B. B. (2016) discovered that perceived ease of use doesn't have any influence on the adoption of multimedia online technologies for Malaysian SMEs. The answers from the participants in this study suggest that, for them, perceived ease of use was not indicative of their behavioural intention to adopt multimedia online technologies (MOT) in the future. Instead of not adopting MOT, if they are complicated some participants said they are willing to learn it or practice more.\n\n\n"}

This results from the way participation in a creative process and pursuit of an artistic practice can promote a critical re-evaluation of previously held beliefs, accompanied by unfamiliar feelings, which alters perception of the world, oneself, and others.\n\nThe social changes effected through transformative arts occurs when this altered perception manifests in new ways of interacting with others.\n\nAlthough engagement in artistic activities has been integral to the means by which individuals and communities have sought personal comfort, self-reflection, and group cohesion for thousands of years, the origin of transformative arts as a modern formal concept is commonly attributed to the work of John Dewey.\n\nDewey espoused four main ideas around which transformative arts pivot. Firstly, art is not an object but an experience, in which one or more persons participate. Secondly, every individual is potentially an artist by way of his or her capacity to participate in this experience, through any artistic activity. Thirdly, such participation inevitably precipitates some kind of transformative change to how the participants think, feel, and behave. Fourthly, art is therefore both psychological and social, transforming not only individual intrapersonal processes, but also interpersonal relationships.\n\nAccordingly, transformative arts are facilitated by artists with the psychological purpose of promoting individual introspection, and with the social purpose of promoting inclusion, reciprocity, and justice.\n\n"}
{"id": "34814043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34814043", "title": "Transgenerational trauma", "text": "Transgenerational trauma\n\nTransgenerational trauma is trauma that is transferred from the first generation of trauma survivors to the second and further generations of offspring of the survivors via \"complex post-traumatic stress disorder\" mechanisms.\n\nSoon after descriptions of \"concentration camp syndrome\" (also known as survivor syndrome) appeared, clinicians observed in 1966 that large numbers of children of Holocaust survivors were seeking treatment in clinics in Canada. The grandchildren of Holocaust survivors were overrepresented by 300% among the referrals to a child psychiatry clinic in comparison with their representation in the general population.\n\nThe phenomenon of children of traumatized parents being affected directly or indirectly by their parents’ post-traumatic symptoms has been described by some authors as \"secondary traumatisation\" (in reference to the \"second generation\"). To include the \"third generation\", as well, the term intergenerational transmission of trauma was introduced. Building upon the clinical observations by Selma Fraiberg, child trauma researchers such as Byron Egeland, Inge Bretherton, and Daniel Schechter have empirically identified psychological mechanisms that favor intergenerational transmission, including dissociation in the context of attachment, and \"communication\" of prior traumatic experience as an effect of parental efforts to maintain self-regulation in the context of post-traumatic stress disorder and related alterations in social cognitive processes.\n\nBoth survivors and immediate witnesses of traumatic events in family history have traditionally been treated by family therapists. The first-generation experiences of combat veterans, hostages, prisoners of war, and the civil population who was victimized at the hands of war criminals from genocidal organizations such as the German Nazi Party, Italian Fascist party, and similar organizations and their (para-)military arms, have been dealt with within the confines of political arena and international law, however the descendants of both immediate witnesses and victims of genocide, colonial suppression, slavery, political totalitarian control, clerical abuse in religious organizations, and many survivors of terrorism had to deal with the victimization symptoms themselves, without the transfer of original trauma being recognized and help offered.\n\nEnslavement and slavery, civil and domestic violence, sexual abuse, and extreme poverty are also sources of trauma that can be transferred to subsequent generations. For instance, survivors of child sexual abuse may negatively influence future generations due to past untreated or unresolved trauma which can increase feelings of mistrust, isolation, and loneliness. Goodman and West-Olatunji proposed potential transgenerational trauma in the aftermath of natural disasters. In a post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, residents have seen a dramatic increase in interpersonal violence with higher mortality rates.\n\nThis phenomenon has been reported in the descendants of students at American Indian boarding schools, who were removed from their parents and extended family and lacked models for parenting as a result. Being punished for speaking their native language and forbidden from practicing traditional rituals had a traumatic effect on many students, and child abuse was rampant in the schools as well.\n\nPrevious research assumed that the trauma transmission was mainly caused by the parents’ child-rearing behavior, however, it may have been also epigenetically transferred. An epigenetics study published in 2015 suggested that a parent’s experience of trauma may change a child’s stress hormone profiles. However, many experts have since pointed out flaws in the study's methodology, which had a very small sample size, studied only a tiny number of genes, and didn't control for social factors. One blog, published by the Center for Epigenomics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, called this research the “over-interpreted epigenetics study of the week.”\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13878013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13878013", "title": "Verisimilitude (fiction)", "text": "Verisimilitude (fiction)\n\nVerisimilitude is the \"lifelikeness\" or believability of a work of fiction. The word comes from meaning truth and \"similis\" meaning similar. Language philosopher Steve Neale distinguishes between two types: cultural verisimilitude, meaning plausibility of the fictional work within the cultural and/or historical context of the real world, outside of the work; and generic verisimilitude, meaning plausibility of a fictional work within the bounds of its own genre (so that, for example, characters regularly singing about their feelings is a believable action within the fictional universe of a musical).\n\nVerisimilitude has its roots in both the Platonic and Aristotelian dramatic theory of mimesis, the imitation or representation of nature. For a piece of art to hold significance or persuasion for an audience, according to Plato and Aristotle, it must have grounding in reality.\n\nThis idea laid the foundation for the evolution of mimesis into verisimilitude in the Middle Ages particularly in Italian heroic poetry. During this time more attention was invested in pinning down fiction with theory. This shift manifested itself in increased focus on unity in heroic poetry. No matter how fictionalized the language of a poem might be, through verisimilitude, poets had the ability to present their works in a way that could still be believed in the real world. Verisimilitude at this time also became connected to another Aristotelian dramatic principle, decorum: the realistic union of style and subject. Poetic language of characters in a work of fiction as a result had to be appropriate in terms of the age, gender or race of the character.\n\nThis classical notion of verisimilitude focused on the role of the reader in his/her engagement in the fictional work of art. The goal of the novel therefore, as it became a more popular form of verisimilitude, was to instruct and offer a pleasurable experience to the reader. The novel had to facilitate the reader's willingness to suspend his/her disbelief, a phrase used originally by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Verisimilitude became the means to accomplish this mindset. To promote the willing suspension of disbelief, a fictional text needed to have credibility. Anything physically possible in the worldview of the reader or humanity's experience was defined as credible. Through verisimilitude then, the reader was able to glean truth even in fiction because it would reflect realistic aspects of human life.\n\nThe idea that credibility, and in turn verisimilitude, rested on the reader's sense of the world encountered opposition because of the dilemma it created: every reader and every person does not have the same knowledge of the world. This kind of theory suggests that the novel consisted of distinct parts. The way novelists avoided this dilemma initially was by adding a preface to the work of fiction stating its credibility or by including more references to known history within the text of the fiction. \n\nAs more criticism on the novel surfaced, the inclusion of a preface or a scattering of some historical references was not enough to engage the reader. French theorist Pierre Nicolas Desmolets' notion that the author should obscure the fiction or art of the novel to avoid destroying illusion: the made up attributes of the text. The novel before was perceived as a work of distinct parts. Now the novel was not thought of in terms of separate parts, but rather as a work as a whole. The novel was a total illusion of life within itself. It was a closed fictional world that could establish its own rules and laws. Verisimilitude then became deeply rooted in structure. The focus of credibility did not rest solely on the external world of the reader; the novel's credibility then could be seen in terms of the novel's own internal logic. \n\nThe focus of verisimilitude was no longer concerned with the reader. The focus shifted to the novel itself. Verisimilitude was a technical problem to resolve within the context of the novel's fictional world. Detail centered on the creation of a logical cause web in the text that then could reinforce the overarching structural logic of the plot.\n\nDuring the rise of the postmodern novel, some critics suggested that truth or significance lies beyond verisimilitude and that only by complete non-discursive freedom to encounter a novel could meaning truly be discovered. Verisimilitude, they argued, was not the first aspect of the text a reader experiences. The reader instead first tries to observe if the novel works as an intelligible narrative. The lens of verisimilitude is applied only after the reader establishes if the novel makes sense or not.\n\nThe reader can understand the novel as art but not necessarily as a cultural construction. The novel should challenge the construction of reality. In this sense, it was possible for art to precede reality. Reality had to catch up to the text rather than text staying present to reality. A boundary existed establishing that text does not belong to a current time or situation. In the postmodern context, verisimilitude was less of a concern for the novelist according to some critics.\n\n"}
