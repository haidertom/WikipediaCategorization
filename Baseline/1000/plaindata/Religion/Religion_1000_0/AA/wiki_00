{"id": "34080397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34080397", "title": "\"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" trial in Russia", "text": "\"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" trial in Russia\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita As It Is trial in Russia was a trial that commenced in 2011 about banning the Russian edition of the book, \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" (1968), a translation and commentary of the Hindu holy text, \"Bhagavad Gita\", on charges of religious extremism. It contains a translation and commentary by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement.\n\nThe trial was initiated in June 2011 in Tomsk, Russia, based on an assessment of the book by scholars of Tomsk State University, which concluded that Prabhupada's translations and commentaries incite religious, social, and racial intolerance. The trial caused controversy, which was reported in the Indian, Russian, and international media, as well as on social networks. The Indian government harshly criticized the proposed ban as \"patently absurd\" undertaking of \"ignorant and misdirected or motivated individuals\". The overwhelmingly wide negative response to the trial forced Russian officials to offer apologies to India, promising the necessary remedial measures to prevent the ban. The trial also sparked public protests and legal actions in India against the proposed ban and drew harsh criticism of the intellectual community in Russia, leading Russian scholars publicly denounced the perpetuation of the trial. The scholars appealed to President Dmitry Medvedev and Premier Vladimir Putin for intervention and warned them of the trial's negative consequences for India-Russia relations and for Russia's international reputation.\n\nIn December 2011, the judge dismissed the court case, a decision praised by the communities both in India and Russia. On January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office filed an appeal against the judge's ruling, but on March 21, 2012, the appeal court dismissed it, upholding the lower court's verdict. On May 29, 2012 Tomsk region prosecutor's office decided not to challenge the appeal court's verdict. The \"Bhagavad Gita\" trial was included in the 2011 annual International Religious Freedom Report of the U.S. Department of State among instances of attempted restrictions of religious freedom by the Russian government.\n\n\"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" is a Russian version of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) founder A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's translation and commentaries on the \"Bhagavad Gita\", a revered scripture for nearly one billion Hindus. The book, a central scripture for Hare Krishna followers, was first published by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust in 1968 and has been translated into 80 languages, with over 100 million copies distributed globally till date. According to scholars, the book has never been accused of fomenting extremism before. According to ISKCON, in 2004 and 2005 Moscow state prosecutors found no extremism in the previous edition \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\", which had only slight stylistic differences from the one on trial.\n\n\"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" was presented to a number of world leaders, including the British Prime Minister David Cameron, who said that he \"keeps a copy of the book in his office.\" Indian Ambassador to Russia Ajay Malhotra said that Prabhupada's translation of the Gita \"is one of the best that you can find, because he gives you the words, the meanings and the options to understand it as it was written\". In November 2011, President of India Pratibha Patil in a message to ISKCON Russia for its 40th anniversary commended the organization for \"an important role in popularising the noble and eternal message of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita and promoting spiritual harmony in many foreign lands\".\n\nThe \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" trial follows prohibition of a number of publications by groups such as the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Church of Scientology.\n\nThe court case was filed in June 2011 by the public prosecutor of Tomsk Victor Fyodotov. The prosecutor based his plea on an expert analysis of the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" commissioned by the FSB. Its authors, three professors of Tomsk State University, Sergei Avanesov, Valery Svistunov, and Valery Naumov, concluded that Bhaktivedanta Swami's commentaries on the \"Bhagavad Gita\" contain \"signs of fomenting religious hatred, denigration of human dignity on grounds of gender, race, nationality, language, origins, and religious conviction\", claim exclusiveness of the Krishna religion, use derogatory terms against those who were not devotees of Krishna, and foster \"social discord\", \"gender, race, nationality, and language\" discrimination. In addition to this, it was alleged to contain \"calls to hostile, violent actions against a number of social and religious groups\".\n\nThe prosecutor thus charged the book as being in violation of the Federal law № 114-ФЗ (\"On countering extremist activities\") and petitioned the court to include \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" in the Federal List of Extremist Materials, which would ban its printing, possession, and distribution. The Federal List contains over 1,000 works, Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\" among them, considered as fomenting ethnic, social, and religious hatred.\n\nIn the first, second, and third court hearings held on 12, 18, and 29–30 August 2011 respectively, Federal Judge Galina Butenko dismissed the assessment as inadequate and subjective after the prosecutor's experts said that their opinion in the assessment should be taken as private rather than official. According to Avanesov, the 2010 expert analysis was personally requested by Federal Security officer Dmitry Velikotsky. They also stated that the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" did not contain any extremist statements. Two experts invited by the court, N. V. Serebrennikov (Tomsk) and N. N. Karpitsky (Tomsk), also rejected the written expert opinion, maintaining, that while Prabhupada's commentaries used abusive words for those who are not Krishna's devotees, the use of these words did not attempt to create a racial or religious divide, to which the Judge recalled that similarly emotionally charged statements are found in the Bible, like: \"Don't throw pearls before swine\". The court noted that, despite some claims of exclusiveness in Prabhupada's commentaries, such statements are characteristic of most religious texts and therefore posed no evidence to support the accusations made against the book.\n\nThe judge consequently postponed the next hearing until December 2011, as the prosecution requested a new assessment of the book by a panel of three professors of Kemerovo State University, including linguist Michael Osadchy, psychologist Sergei Dranishnikov, and religious studies expert Alexei Gorbatov. They were divided on the issue: two found signs of extremism in the text and one did not. Following a plea by ISKCON advocate Mikhail Fralov to seek a statement of the Russian Human Rights Committee on the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" and on the right of religious minorities, the Judge agreed to hear their opinion and postponed the final verdict until December 28, 2011.\n\nOn December 28, 2011, Federal Judge Galina Butenko rejected the prosecutor's plea for a ban of the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\". The court's resolution stated that the main criterion for classifying any text as an extremist one is the presence of calls for extremist actions and justifications for such actions, and that the propaganda of exclusiveness found in the book and criticism of political, ideological, and religious convictions is not sufficient grounds for classifying it as such.\n\nThe decision received wide coverage by the international media.\n\nOn January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office appealed the court's refusal to declare the Russian \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" an extremist text in a superior court, insisting that the book should be banned, and asking for more time.\n\nThe prosecutors insisted that the Russian translation of the book be banned as \"extremist literature.\" The appeal quoted Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich questioning the translated version, the authenticity of its linguistics as they relate to Hindu scripture, and \"semantic distortions.\"\n\nThe prosecutor general for Tomsk Vasily Voikin said, \"When we have to deal with such materials, we are just bound to proceed with them. The law opposes extremism. When scholars say the text is of an extremist character, we just have to respond\". The appeal was scheduled for hearing by the Tomsk regional court on March 6, 2012 but was later rescheduled for March 20.\n\nOn February 16, 2012, explaining the rationale behind the appeal, first deputy prosecutor general of Russia Alexander Buksman said in an interview during his visit to Tomsk that the public misunderstood the initial plea of prosecutor's office to have the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" declared an extremist text. He stated that the prosecutor’s office sought a ban of the Russian version of the book’s commentaries rather than on the Hindu text itself, adding, \"it’s important to discern gems from the chatter in this very case; the society’s perception of this issue is that prosecutors are standing against the concepts of this religion [Hinduism]. However, the problem is that the Russian translation has paragraphs that could be seen as promoting extremism; prosecutors started the case for that reason.\" Deputy prosecutor general of Russian in Siberia region Ivan Semchishyn confirmed, \"That is why the prosecutor now has to stand up for his position in the appellate court\".\n\nOn February 21, 2012, at a press conference at the Interfax office in Tomsk, anti-cult activist Alexander Dvorkin stated that the \"manifesto book of the Krishna Consciousness Society, \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\", is not immediately related to the original, being a free and not quite skilled translation.\"\n\nIn response to the appeal, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), along with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), stated that they would fight \"internationally\" against any threats to ban the Bhagavad Gita in Russia.\n\nRepresentative of the prosecution said that the district court incorrectly interpreted the definition of \"extremism\" when it claimed that it is necessary for it to contain calls to extremist activity which must be expressed in any kind of actions, pointing out that the law prohibits all propaganda that incites any kind of hatred.\n\nOn March 21, 2012, the appeal court upheld the decision of the lower court, rejecting the prosecutor's petition. On May 29, 2012, Tomsk regional prosecutor Vasily Voykin said that the prosecutor's office will no further appeal the court's refusal to declare \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" extremist.\n\nSince December 17, 2011, when \"Indo-Asian News Service\" (IANS) issued a report by a staff writer Nallan Chakravarthi Bipindra (NC Bipindra) from Moscow about the proposed \"Bhagavad Gita\" ban in Russia, the event became breaking news in the Indian printed and electronic media, with over 600 publications, including editorials, in all major newspapers and TV news channels as of December 27, 2011.\n\nOn December 19, 2011, Bhartruhari Mahtab, leader of the Biju Janata Dal party, raised up the issue of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" trial in the Indian Parliament (Lok Sabha), demanding to know what the Indian government was undertaking to protect \"the religious rights of Hindus in Russia\". He also called on the government to \"impress [this] upon the Russian authorities through diplomatic channels\". The House Speaker Meira Kumar then turned down requests for speeches on the topic and had to adjourn the session amid protests against the ban of the \"Gita\" sparked by Mahtab's statement, as angry members of the Parliament across the party lines strongly condemned the ban, shouting: \"We will not tolerate an insult to Lord Krishna!\" The issue was simultaneously raised in Rajya Sabha (the Upper House). This display of political unity surprised the media and prompted a Rajya Sabha member to call the December 19 parliamentary session \"a golden day in our history when all differences were deleted to express solidarity for Gita, the book of India\".\n\nOn December 20, Sushma Swaraj, leader of the largest opposition party BJP demanded that the Indian government declare the \"Bhagavad Gita\" a \"national book\". Her move seconded by a BJP member of Rajya Sabha, Tarun Vijay, who asked rhetorically \"Can sun be banned, Himalayas be banned ...?\" Members across party lines voiced their support. Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha K. Rahman Khan, member of the Indian National Congress, said \"the entire house agrees with this and joins in condemning this\".\n\nOn December 21, a Bharatiya Janata Party delegation led by the party's foreign affairs chief Vijay Jolly met with the Deputy Chief of the Russian Mission in Delhi Denis Alipov to express the party's \"pain and anguish\" at the \"Bhagavad Gita\" trial and demand that \"suitable measures\" be taken by the Russian government to immediately dismiss the court case as baseless. Jolly also expressed surprise that the Russian government allowed the trial to continue for over half a year despite the fact that \"India–Russia relations is of paramount importance to both countries\". The delegation also sent through the Russian embassy a copy of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" to President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev along with a letter, in which the BJP delegation stressed to the Russian President that the Gita is a book of \"sublime thoughts\" that \"preaches self discipline ... promotes spiritualism and teaches to the mankind the need to fulfill responsibility towards worldly duties\".\n\nAccording to officials of the Prime Minister of India's office, \"[t]his matter is receiving the highest attention and the Indian embassy officials in Moscow have been instructed to follow up the case with the Russian authorities\", in order to either have the case withdrawn by the state or resolved. Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajeev Shukla said that the Indian authorities are \"apprising the Russian government\" on the issue. However, members of the Parliament accused the Indian government of inaction. They said that on November 1, ISKCON informed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's principal secretary Pulok Chatterji of the impending court case, urging the government to use \"some high-level ministerial visits\" to Moscow, prior to the Prime Minister's own visit December 15–17, to protect the scripture from legal action. The letter, written by ISKCON's Governing Body Commissioner Gopala Krishna Goswami, cited the assessment as stating that \"Krishna is evil and not compatible with Christian views\". Despite the advance notice, which was also sent to the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Sonia Gandhi, Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma, and the External Affairs Minister S. M. Krishna, the issue was not discussed with the Russian government during the following six official visits of Indian ministers and top officials to Moscow. Officials who were part of the delegation accompanying the Prime Minister confirmed receipt of the letter to the Indo-Asian News Service.\n\nFollowing the Parliament's demand for a report from the External Affairs Ministry on the issue, Foreign Minister S. M. Krishna said that ISKCON had been advised to take legal recourse and put the controversy in the light of Russia-India relations. He also stated in Lok Sabha that \"the Bhagavad-gita is the definitive treatise of Indian thought.\"\n\nOn December 21, the High Court of Mumbai questioned the Indian government as to the measures it is undertaking to intervene in the possible ban of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" and directed the government to consider representing the position of India on the issue before the court in Tomsk. The High Court decision came in response to a Public Interest Litigation filed by two local activists charging the Indian government with inaction in regard to informing the Russian court of the actual purport of the \"Bhagavad Gita\", and that the Indian Embassy's \"monitoring the matter closely\" was not sufficient. The court observed Indian Foreign Minister S. M. Krishna's Parliament statement does not imply if Indian government's direct involvement with the December 28 \"Bhagavad Gita\" trial hearing and asked the government to submit its reply on the steps taken by January 9.\n\nOn December 19, dozens of ISKCON followers organized a rally in front of the Russian Consulate in Kolkata, holding up copies of the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" in various languages and demanding to stop persecution of their most important scripture. Similar protest marches were held in New Delhi and Chandigarh. Gopal Krishna Goswami, ISKCON's Governing Body Commissioner for India, said that ISKCON members are poised to intensify their public protests across the globe if their scripture is banned. He said, \"I hope the Indian government will be able to pressurize the Russian government and the matter gets solved legally. It's a book of peace and there's nothing extreme in it. Holy scriptures shouldn't be taken to court\".\n\nOn December 21, a highly respected Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband issued a statement signed by its vice-chancellor Abul Qasim Nomani in defense of the \"Bhagavad Gita\", in which he condemned \"Russian diktat against the Hindu holy scripture\". Nomani also called accusations of the Gita of extremism \"totally baseless and highly objectionable\", maintaining that the proposed ban is tantamount to violation of the freedom of conscience \"enshrined\" in the Indian Constitution, and called on boldly countering the \"Russian highhandedness\".\nMaulana Khalid Rashid, head of Firangi Mahal, another Islamic center of higher education in Lucknow, also condemned what he called \"Russian arrogance\" and called on Muslims to support Hindu followers while appealing to the Indian government \"to take a firm stance so that such blasphemous interference is not attempted in future\".\n\nOn December 22, 2011, Isai Mahasangh organization representing Christians in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh addressed the President of India Pratibha Patil and the Pope Benedict XVI, asking for their intervention in the \"Bhagavad Gita\" trial. An Isai Mahasangh delegation conveyed their memorandum to the President through Madhya Pradesh governor Ram Naresh Yadav, and to the Pope through the Holy See embassy in New Delhi. Jerry Paul, General Secretary of Isai Mahasangh, stated that it was clear from the court case against the Gita that \"the Russians are not aware of the importance of the Gita, the teachings and values it upholds and above all its place in the life of millions of Indians\".\n\nA prominent Hindu teacher Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in his Twitter called the proposed ban of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" in Russia \"an unpardonable loss for the people of Russia\" and, countering accusations of the book of \"extremism\" and \"intolerance\" opined that it was the move to ban the scripture that showed intolerance and bred terrorism rather than the Gita's teachings.\n\nOn December 20, 2011, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) threatened to protest outside Russian missions in India if Russia effects the ban. VHP General Secretary Pravin Togadia said in a statement that the \"Bhagavad Gita\" is held sacred by all Hindus and that its principles have universal appeal and \"touch humanity so very deeply\", citing Albert Einstein's fascination with the book as an example. Togadia also warned Russian authorities that Indians will be forced to boycott Russian goods, plants, and offices in India in response to the Gita ban in Russia. A group of VHP members held a protest march in front of the Russian consulate in Mumbai. VHP and Bajrang Dal activists also staged protest in Chandigarh, calling on the Indian government to protect the rights of Hindus in Russia and denouncing the proposed ban. On December 23, dozens of activists of Rashtrawadi Sena, a hardline Hindu group, burned a Russian flag and shouted anti-Russian slogans during a protest march in New Delhi over the proposed ban. Rashtrawadi Sena president Jai Bhagwan Goyal called the \"Gita\" \"the most pious book of the nation\" and said there will be no tolerance for insulting it. The protesters also sent a memorandum to Indian President Pratibha Patil, and to the Russian embassy, demanding to avert the ban. They also urged the President to declare the \"Bhagavad Gita\" a \"national scripture\" in order to prevent such insults in the future. A similar protest along with the burning of a Russian flag was held on December 26 by activists of the right-wing Hindu organisation Shiv Sena in Amritsar. In a similar move, a Jammu unit of Sri Ram Sena appealed to Indian and Russian authorities to forestall the impending \"Gita \" ban \"for the betterment of Indo-Russia relations\".\n\nSanal Edamaruku, the president of the Indian Rationalist Association, opposed the ban calling for the right to read any literature under the freedom of expression, even if he considered the book to be promoting the caste system. Similarly, Dr Jayagopal, the founder of the Atheist Society of India, opposed the ban, in spite of considering the book to be undemocratic and against the spirit of the constitution. He also suspected that the Russian Orthodox Church may have been behind the ban. Megh Raj Mitter, the founder of the Tarksheel Society, also opposed this move, but admitted that Russians may have been offended by the book and their sentiments should be respected.\n\nOn the other hand, Dalit Marxist scholar Chittibabu Padavala supported the ban, as he considered Gita to be promoting inequalities from the birth unlike other religious texts.\n\nOn December 21, 2011, the Russian community in Goa has issued a statement condemning the proposed ban on the \"Bhagavad Gita\" in Russia. Speaking on behalf of the 150-strong community, Russian consulate in Goa Vikram Varma stated: \"The Russian community in Goa as a whole condemns the possibility of a ban on any of India's ancient scriptures. It is felt by the Russian community in Goa as well as by a large section of Russians visiting Goa that the depth of knowledge and wisdom offered by the Bhagavad Gita cannot be understood by a casual reader. It is well accepted that all the ancient Hindu scriptures are of tremendous importance not only to India but to the rest of the world.\"\n\nThe trial sparked community protests in India. On December 16, 2011, an online petition to stop the \"Bhagavad Gita\" trial was launched, and by December 22 more than 45,000 people from all over the world, mostly from India.\n\nThe topic has gone viral on social networks, with the hashtag #Gita becoming a leading trend on Indian Twitter. Noted poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar, for instance, twitted: \"Banning Gita ? Have they lost their minds. This great book of wisdom belongs not only to Hindus but to the whole humanity\". Member of Parilament Naveen Jindal wrote in his blog, \"I welcome the statement by the Russian ambassador to India condemning the \"Bhagavad Gita\" controversy\". Janata Dal party leader Subramanian Swamy wrote on Twitter: \"Happy to inform that Russian Ambassador will tell my daughter on TV that he is a student of Gita and Russia will rectify matters soon. Ok?\" and Bollywood celebrity Farah Khan suggested in a retweet: \"The Russians have banned the Gita. In retaliation let's ban something equally sacrosanct to them: vodka\".\n\nProminent social activists from a broad societal spectrum also condemned the trial. \nA vocal anti-fundamentalist Ram Puniyani of the EKTA Committee for Communal Amity called the move to ban the \"Bhagavad Gita\" translation \"irrational\", suggesting that possible questionable passages should be analyzed and debated, but they do not warrant the legal action. Former president of the Students Islamic Movement of India Shahid Badr Falahi said he was \"completely against\" this or any other bans of religious books, calling on \"equal opinion on issues pertaining to every religion\". Ram Madhav, national executive member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh termed the attempted ban \"a shameful act\" planned by some \"fundamentalist groups in Russia\" to portray the Bhagavad Gita as a \"terror manual\". He emphasized the Gita's status as one of the most sacred texts respected in all religions and expressed hope that the Russian government will help stop the trial.\n\nThe Russian society appears to be embarrassed by the court case over the Gita, with the media mostly condemning the ongoing trial, carrying reports titled like \"Trial of Indian book brings shame to Tomsk\". A prominent Russian Internet paper Gazeta.ru published a satirical article on how a work that was created 5,000 years ago has suddenly become an extremist document.\n\nHare Krishna followers, who count over 100,000 members and over 100 centers in Russia, expressed fear that the trial on their main scripture, if upheld by the court, will be followed by a ban of their entire movement and religion nationwide. The 15,000-strong Hindu community in Russia shared the apprehension. On November 1, ISKCON leader in India Gopal Krishna Goswami appealed to the Indian government asking to intervene and resolve the impending trial by bringing it up with the Russian authorities during Indian official visits to Moscow. Hindu followers in Russia from India, Bangladesh, Mauritius, Nepal and other countries held an emergency meeting, at which they set up the Hindu Council of Russia meant to protect their interests in Russia, and elected Sadhu Priya Das, and India-born member of ISKCON, as its chairman. Das said that they were seeking opinion of the Russian Ombudsman and experts from Moscow and St. Petersburg, the main centers of Indology in Russia, and that they trusted the Russian judiciary, hoping that \"finally the truth will prevail\".\n\nISKCON members alleged that the court case was instigated by the Russian Orthodox Church in order to limit their activities in Russia.\n\nIslamic studies scholar Roman Silantyev opined that Prabhupada's interpretation \"has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism\" and that his commentaries contained statements that can be considered extremist.\n\nOn November 28, at a round table organized by Russian newspaper \"Moskovskij Komsomolets\", scientists and members of the Russian Academy of Sciences along with a few religious leaders stated in a resolution, \"there is no basis for conducting such a trial and the very fact of initiating a trial by the public prosecutor is an insult to the religious feelings of followers of Vaishnavism in India and Russia and it will give a body blow to Indo-Russian relations.\"\n\nSergey Serebryanny, the head of the Institute of High Humanitarian Studies at the Russian State University for the Humanities and an Indologist, said Russian courts give the term ‘extremism’ a very broad interpretation, which allows them to label as extremist anything going against the authorities, whether secular or religious. He also opined that, while Prabhupada supplemented his version of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" with his own ideas and beliefs, his followers \"have the same right for the freedom of conscience as believers of other religious confessions that observe the laws of the Russian Federation\".\n\nRussian Indologist Yevgenia Vanina of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences wrote an article severely criticizing the court case over the \"Bhagavad Gita\", which \"is revered by millions in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and wherever Hindus live\". She reminded that in Europe, the Gita was \"admired by many great philosophers and thinkers, such as Herder, Schopenhauer and Tolstoy\" and thought it ironic that while the Hindu scripture was first translated into Russian in 1788, \"nobody put the book and its translators on trial in the Orthodox Russian Empire in 1788, but it’s being judged in secular democratic Russia\". Vanina also argued that charges of extremism against Prabhupada's \"copious\" commentaries on the \"Bhagavad Gita\" are fallacious and based on a \"primitive\" screening of the religious text for negative words (such as \"fool,\" \"enemy,\" \"demon, \"kill\"). According to Vanina, using this approach, any ancient text, from the Greek myths to the Bible, and the Koran, can be found extremism, especially when \"specialists in philosophical suicidology are entrusted with passing judgement on ancient Indian texts\". Vanina concluded by opining that, despite people's right to their attitudes towards \"a Russian lad wearing Indian clothes and singing Hare Krishna\", ISKCON followers have the right to practice their religion, and that the Russian Orthodox Church, instead of calling for a ban on competitors or attempting to legally equate their holy book to \"Mein Kampf\", should introspect as to the reasons that deter young Russians from joining the Church. Otherwise, Vanina predicted, \"people will again start being burned alive\".\n\nHistorian and full professor of the Diplomatic Academy at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia Andrey Volodin opined that the move to ban the \"Gita\" was \"contrary to the basic principle of tolerance inherent in Russian civilisation\". He said that this trial, held in Tomsk, \"one of Russia’s intellectual capitals, raises doubts as to whether the local leaders are sane and the intellectual community in one of the country’s main academic and university centers is actually mature\". To a question, which forces in Russia are interested in a ban on the \"Bhagavad Gita\" Volodin replied that \"all the intelligence services in the world, including the CIA and M16, could never have come up with a more effective move to compromise Russia in India and in the world\".\n\nIn an interview by \"CNN-IBN\", Russia's ambassador to India Alexander Kadakin called \"Bhagavad Gita\" \"the source of wisdom and inspiration not only for the people of India but for Russia as well and the world.\"\nHe assured that the Russian government is using all means to end the \"Bhagavad Gita\" scandal and added that he thought it \"categorically inadmissible\" to take any sacred scriptures \"for examination to ignorant people\" to the courts rather than to academic forums Kadakin ruled out the possibility of the Russian government directly influencing the court decision, but added that the government still \"can do something\" and called the instigators of the trial \"madmen\", whose \"madness should be stopped.\" He also answered a question of a possible apology to the people of India by the Russian government, opining that since it was not the Russian government who started the case, it \"has nothing to apologize for, [but] can only testify and reiterate the love and affection and highest esteem our nation has for Bhagvat Gita.\"\n\nOn December 27, 2011, after a meeting with the Foreign Minister of India S. M. Krishna, at which Krishna reiterated India's grave concerns over the issue, Kadakin told reporters that the Russian government will do everything within its powers to prevent the ban. He said that, while it was a judicial process, the Russian government can ask the people of Russia \"to express our love and admiration for the Gita, ... that [assurance] you can get from anyone in Russia\". He also added that he had read the Gita and thought it was a great scripture of the world, and maintained that \"no holy scripture, whether it is Bible, Quran or Gita, can be brought to a court\".\n\nAccording to the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajeev Shukla, a top Russian minister also \"expressed regrets\" about the situation.\n\nRussian Chief Director for Human Rights Vladimir Lukin stated that the attempt to ban \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" amounted to \"infringement on the constitutional right to the freedom of consciousness\" and that it was \"unacceptable\" to ban the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" written by ISKCON founder Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, in Russia, as he said it was a \"globally respected book\". As the Ombudsman for Russia, Vladimir Lukun took the Bhagavad Gita court case under his special control and will testify in the court on December 28 asking to dismiss the charges.\n\nAt a December 22, 2011 press briefing, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich attempted to clarify a number of points seemingly misunderstood by his Indian colleagues: \"In June this year Tomsk prosecutors instigated legal proceedings against the third edition of the Russian translation of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is' with a view to have it added to the federal list of extremist materials. I would like to stress that the trial is not about 'Bhagavad Gita', a religious philosophical poem, which forms part of the great Indian epic Mahabharata and is one of the most famous texts of the ancient Hindu literature. In Russia, the book was first published in Russian in 1788 and then went through many editions in different years and in various translations. The Tomsk court case is about classifying as extremist material the Russian-language edition of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is', written in 1968 by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. The work represents an authorized translation of the original from Sanskrit into English. The book was translated into Russian in 1984. As evident from the materials available, the complaints of law enforcement are not so much about the text of the book itself, whose double translation suffers from semantic distortions, as about the author's comments which were regarded as falling under Article 13 of the Federal Law 'On Counteracting Extremist Activity'.\"\n\nNelly Krechetova, Human Rights Ombudsman of Tomsk region, has termed the trial \"absurd\". Speaking on the \"Echo of Moscow\" radio station, she said, \"This book is considered sacred by more than a billion people the world over, and in Russia itself the book has been in circulation for 20 years.\" She continued that there was no manifest incident of extremism caused by the dissemination of the book. A ban on the book, she said, would amount to \"violation of constitutional rights of citizens to freedom of conscience and faith.\" \n\n\"Associated Press\" reported that the attempt to ban \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" angered Hindus around the world.\n\nThe court case evoked protests by US-based Hindu activists, who called the trial \"an attack on religious freedom and belittling of the entire Hindu community.\" The Hindu American Foundation (HAF) based in Washington, DC expressed \"shock and outrage\" over the attempted ban. Subhag Shukla, HAF managing director, called the move by Russian prosecutors \"indefensible\" and \"a draconian attempt to restrict the religious freedom of Hindus in Russia\".\nShukla added that, \"[b]y promoting a narrow and intolerant agenda that demonizes a sacred scripture revered by more than one billion Hindus worldwide, Russian officials are acting contrary to the principles of a free democratic society\". HAF members conveyed their concerns in an official statement to the Russian embassy in Washington, DC, requesting a follow-up meeting to monitor the situation, and urged the Russian judiciary and government \"to uphold the basic rights of their Hindu citizens\". They also warned that \"Any court ruling or law that would prohibit the Bhagavad Gita or any other Hindu religious literature would be considered a direct attack on the civil liberties of Russia's Hindu community and an affront to Hindus throughout the world\".\n\nIn Kathmandu, Nepal, a consortium of the country's Hindu organizations, Rastriya Dharma Sabha Nepal, condemned the proposed ban, urging the government and the Parliament to support the \"Bhagavad Gita\". Chairman of the Dharma Sabha Madhav Bhattarai also requested the Parliament to discuss the issue and address it with the Russian government and embassy in Nepal. Another protest was expressed by a Nepali Shreemadbhagawat Publicity Service Association (SPSA), which emphasized that rather than being extremist, the \"Gita\" \"guides one for the self-discipline and responsibility to human duties\" and informed of plans to hold rallies against the potential ban.\n\nThe United States Department of State in its annual International Religious Freedom Report for 2011 cited the Bhagavad Gita trial among instances of \"selectively enforced existing legal restrictions on religious freedom\" by the Russian government. The report quoted the Russian Ombudsperson for Human Rights Vladimil Lukin as saying that \"the struggle with terrorism is a struggle with real terrorist planning and creation of groups, not with the interpretation of ancient holy books, of whatever faith\".\n\nOn February 24, 2012, Russian religious scholars and experts held a nationwide conference \"Bhagavad Gita in history and modern society\" at the Tomsk State University. They said they were \"perplexed\" over the Tomsk prosecutor's office's continued attempts to have the \"Bhagavad Gita as It Is\" declared extremist. Chief researcher of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, indologist Irina Glushkova said in an interview with \"RIA Novosti\" that there are various schools of Hinduism \"and each school is based on its own scripture or commentary\", adding that \"from this point of view \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" has the right to exist as any other commentary or scripture. It is a fundamental principle of Hinduism and there is no any other Hinduism whoever says it, Dvorkin or the Tomsk prosecutor's office\". She also stated it was \"impermissible\" to subject the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" to a criminal court trial, because \"it is inseparable from the original \"Bhagavad Gita\", both being parts of the same culture\". Philosopher Tatyana Lyubimova, chief researcher of the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said that most ancient scriptures, including the \"Bhagavad Gita\", were revised or adapted over the years so that modern people could better understand them.\n\nOn March 12, 2012, a group of twenty leading Russian philosophers, orientologists, and philologists published an open letter addressing both Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and the Russian Prime Minister and President-elect Vladimir Putin, with copies sent to Russia's Presecutor General, Ministry of Justice, and Public Chamber, urging the ruling tandem to take the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" court case under their \"personal control\". The scholars said they were alarmed by the Tomsk prosecutor's attempting to overrule the earlier court's rejection of the extremest charges against the book, and filing a modified petition asking the court to ban only Bhaktivedanta Swami's commentaries and exempting the original text from the charges of extremism. The scholars criticized the prosecutor's indictment of the commentaries with extremism as \"untrue and contrary to the traditions of Hinduism\". They emphasized that, contrary to the prosecutor's accusations, the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" was considered sacred by a section of Hindu followers as belonging to the commentary tradition of Bengali Vaishnavism, \"one of the most popular branches of Hinduism\", and \"did not contain any signs of extremism and did not incite hatred on ethnic, religious or any other grounds\". The scholars also warned Russia's top leaders that the trial \"discredits Russia's cultural and democratic credentials in the eyes of the civilized world and is driving a wedge in Russian-Indian relations\".\n\nMaxim Osipov, a representative of ISKCON's Governing Body Commission, said that the commentary to \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" is \"a precise and clear reflection\" on the religious tradition taught by Prabhupada, the founder-acharya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.\n\n\"I welcome the verdict of the Honourable District Court in Tomsk today, which has dismissed the appeal petition in the \"Bhagavad Gita\" case. It is good that the decision of the lower trial court in this matter has been reaffirmed. I trust that this issue is now conclusively behind us\", said Ajai Malhotra, Indian Ambassador to the Russian Federation.\n\n\"We appreciate this sensible resolution of a sensitive issue and are glad to put this episode behind us. We also appreciate the efforts of all friends in Russia who made this outcome possible. This demonstrates yet again that the people of India and Russia have a deep understanding of each other’s cultures and will always reject any attempt to belittle our common civilizational values\", said Indian foreign ministry spokesman Vishnu Prakash.\n\nOn April 11, 2012 Vladimir Lukin, the Human Rights Commissioner of Russia, \"warned against court decisions on \"Bhagavad Gita\" texts based on judges' opinions rather than expert examinations.\" Lukin stated that the \"Tomsk [judges] considered something they should not have… It should have been up to theologians and historians.\" Lukin noted that \"Winston Churchill once said: Stupidity is also a gift of God, but one mustn't misuse it.\"\n\nOn December 28, 2011, the day the Tomsk court dismissed extremism charges against the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\", director of the Human Rights Center of the World Russian People's Council Roman Silantyev said that the examination of the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" as extremist was accurate, and that \"it has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism.\"\n\nHe also called Krishna devotees in Russia marginal pseudo-Hindu cult members with \"extremely nasty reputation\" and condemned their charitable food distribution programs saying it was unacceptable for Orthodox, Muslim, Jews and Buddhist believers.\n\nOn January 18, 2012, a number of Russia's Islamic leaders denounced Hare Krishna followers in Russia as a \"destructive cult\" and called on the Russian authorities not to yield to the Indian pressure in regard of the proposed banning of the \"Bhagavad Gita As It\". Mufti Muhammedgali Huzin, head of All-Russian Muslim Board executive committee, said, \n\"I believe that Russian authorities should be principally tough in the question and shouldn't give way to any provocations and pressure. I think that Russia can do without semiliterate interpretations of ancient epos\". First deputy chairman of the Central Spiritual Board of Russian Muslims Mufti of Moscow and Russia's Central Region Albir Krganov proposed to \"pay the debt\" to Krishna devotees in Russia for their charitable food distribution by \"delivering nutritious Halal canned beef to starving Krishna devotees of India. We are ready to personally distribute this meat to Russian Krishnaites\". However, other all-Russia Islamic umbrella organizations rejected their statements as \"fortunately\" not representing the opinion of a majority of Russian Muslims of the issue.\n\nOn January 27, 2012, a group of Russian Orthodox Christian activists entered the premises of the Moscow Krishna temple and tried to hand the temple authorities a box of canned beef. The group claimed that their action was in retaliation for the burning of the Russian flag in India by Hindu fundamentalists protesting the proposed ban of the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\", which they called an \"anti-Russian … disgraceful act\" and \"one of the steps in the unprecedented campaign of pressing on Russian court\".\n\nOn January 31, 2012, the head of the Traditional Buddhist Sangha of Russia Andrey Baljirov called the Indian authorities who asked the Russian government to help avert the proposed ban of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is \"misinformed\" and \"exerting pressure\" and spoke against the proposed construction of the Krishna temple in Moscow because \"there are Buddhist followers in Moscow who do not have a temple yet\".\n\n\n\n\n\nwiktionary:en:cast pearls before swine\n"}
{"id": "1242905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1242905", "title": "A Mathematician's Apology", "text": "A Mathematician's Apology\n\nA Mathematician's Apology is a 1940 essay by British mathematician G. H. Hardy. It concerns the aesthetics of mathematics with some personal content, and gives the layman an insight into the mind of a working mathematician.\n\nIn the book's title, Hardy uses the word \"apology\" in the sense of a formal justification or defence (as in Plato's \"Apology of Socrates\"), not in the sense of a plea for forgiveness.\n\nHardy felt the need to justify his life's work in mathematics at this time mainly for two reasons. Firstly, at age 62, Hardy felt the approach of old age (he had survived a heart attack in 1939) and the decline of his mathematical creativity and skills.\nBy devoting time to writing the Apology, Hardy was admitting that his own time as a creative mathematician was finished. In his foreword to the 1967 edition of the book, C. P. Snow describes the Apology as\n\"a passionate lament for creative powers that used to be and that will never come again\".\nIn Hardy's words, \"Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds. [...] It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics. The function of a mathematician is to do something, to prove new theorems, to add to mathematics, and not to talk about what he or other mathematicians have done.\"\n\nSecondly, at the start of the World War II, Hardy, a committed pacifist, wanted to justify his belief that mathematics should be pursued for its own sake rather than for the sake of its applications. He wanted to write a book in which he would explain his mathematical philosophy to the next generation of mathematicians; that would defend mathematics by elaborating on the merits of pure mathematics solely, without having to resort to the attainments of applied mathematics in order to justify the overall importance of mathematics; and that would inspire the upcoming generations of pure mathematicians. Hardy was an atheist, and makes his justification not to God but to his fellow man.\n\nOne of the main themes of the book is the beauty that mathematics possesses, which Hardy compares to painting and poetry. For Hardy, the most beautiful mathematics was that which had no practical applications in the outside world (pure mathematics) and, in particular, his own special field of number theory. Hardy contends that if useful knowledge is defined as knowledge which is likely to contribute to the material comfort of mankind in the near future (if not right now), so that mere intellectual satisfaction is irrelevant, then the great bulk of higher mathematics is useless. He justifies the pursuit of pure mathematics with the argument that its very \"uselessness\" on the whole meant that it could not be misused to cause harm. On the other hand, Hardy denigrates much of the applied mathematics as either being \"trivial\", \"ugly\", or \"dull\", and contrasts it with \"real mathematics\", which is how he ranks the higher, pure mathematics.\n\nHardy expounds by commenting about a phrase attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss that \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics.\" Some people believe that it is the extreme non-applicability of number theory that led Gauss to the above statement about number theory; however, Hardy points out that this is certainly not the reason. If an application of number theory were to be found, then certainly no one would try to dethrone the \"queen of mathematics\" because of that. What Gauss meant, according to Hardy, is that the underlying concepts that constitute number theory are deeper and more elegant compared to those of any other branch of mathematics.\n\nAnother theme is that mathematics is a \"young man's game\", so anyone with a talent for mathematics should develop and use that talent while they are young, before their ability to create original mathematics starts to decline in middle age. This view reflects Hardy's increasing depression at the wane of his own mathematical powers. For Hardy, real mathematics was essentially a creative activity, rather than an explanatory or expository one.\n\nHardy's opinions were heavily influenced by the academic culture of the universities of Cambridge and Oxford between World War I and World War II.\n\nSome of Hardy's examples seem unfortunate in retrospect. For example, he writes, \"No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years.\" Since then number theory was used to crack German enigma codes and much later, figure prominently in public-key cryptography. However, Hardy's more prominent examples of elegant mathematical discoveries with no use (proofs of the infinitude of primes and of the irrationality of the square root of two) still hold up.\n\nThe applicability of a mathematical concept is not the reason that Hardy considered applied mathematics somehow inferior to pure mathematics, though; it is the simplicity and prosiness that belong to applied mathematics that led him to describe them as he did.\n\nHe considers that Rolle's theorem for example, though it is of some importance for calculus, cannot be compared to the elegance and preeminence of the mathematics produced by Évariste Galois and other pure mathematicians.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3231", "title": "Absolute Infinite", "text": "Absolute Infinite\n\nThe Absolute Infinite (\"symbol\": Ω) is an extension of the idea of infinity proposed by mathematician Georg Cantor.\n\nIt can be thought as a number which is bigger than any conceivable or inconceivable quantity, either finite or transfinite.\n\nCantor linked the Absolute Infinite with God, and believed that it had various mathematical properties, including the reflection principle: every property of the Absolute Infinite is also held by some smaller object.\n\nCantor said:\n\nCantor also mentioned the idea in his letters to Richard Dedekind (text in square brackets not present in original):\n\nThe idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist seems paradoxical to many. This is related to Cesare Burali-Forti's \"paradox\" which states that there can be no greatest ordinal number. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.\n\nMore generally, as noted by A. W. Moore, there can be no end to the process of set formation, and thus no such thing as the \"totality of all sets\", or the \"set hierarchy\". Any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the hierarchy and thus failing to contain every set.\n\nA standard solution to this problem is found in Zermelo's set theory, which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. Rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property \"and lie in some given set\" (Zermelo's Axiom of Separation). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.\n\nWhile this solves the logical problem, one could argue that the philosophical problem remains. It seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. Indeed, naive set theory might be said to be based on this notion. Although Zermelo's fix allows a class to describe arbitrary (possibly \"large\") entities, these predicates of the meta-language may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory. For example, the class of all sets would be a proper class. This is philosophically unsatisfying to some and has motivated additional work in set theory and other methods of formalizing the foundations of mathematics such as New Foundations by Willard Van Orman Quine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23834216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23834216", "title": "Agni Yoga", "text": "Agni Yoga\n\nAgni Yoga (Russian: \"Агни Йога\") or the Living Ethics (Russian: \"Жива́я Этика\"), or the Teaching of Life (Russian: \"Учение Жизни\") is a one of the neo-theosophical religious doctrine transmitted by the Helena Roerich and Nicholas Roerich from 1920. The term \"Agni Yoga\" means “Mergence with Divine Fire” or “Path to Mergence with Divine Fire”. This term was introduced by the Roerichs. The followers of Agni Yoga believe that the teaching was given to the Roerich family and their associates by Master Morya, the guru of Roerichs and Helena Blavatsky, one of the founders of the modern theosophical movement and the Theosophical Society. \n\nAgni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. According to Helena Roerich, Agni Yoga is the synthesis of all yogas. In all the ancient Hindu scriptures, the approaching Fiery Age was predicted. Agni-Fire, which to a varying degree is at the heart of all the yogas, will extremely sate the atmosphere of our planet, and all the branches of Yoga will be merged into a fiery synthesis. Agni Yoga is a fire baptism.\n\nThe most significant features of Agni Yoga are cosmism and universalism. They are expressed in the interpretation of any phenomena of human existence from the point of view of their cosmic significance and interrelation with the being of the Universe.\n\nAgni Yoga played a significant role in bringing knowledge of Asian religions to Western world. Living Ethics has an international following and has thousands of adherents. The ideas of Teaching of Life have exerted an influence on another esoteric movements and philosophies, among them the New Age and Transhumanism.\n\nThe term \"Agni Yoga\" means “Mergence with Divine Fire” or “Path to Mergence with Divine Fire”. This term was introduced to the western public by the Nicholas Roerich and Helena Roerich.\n\n\"Agni\" () is the Vedic and Living Ethics \"God of Fire\", one marks immortality and the symbol of life. Agni is one of the supreme gods in the Rigveda. In Agni Yoga it is the Creative Fire of the Universe, the root of the \"Fire of Space\"; and \"psychic energy\", the powers of the human mind and heart, particularly those manifesting in love, thought, and creativity. The origin myth found in many Indo-European cultures Agni is a bird like being, that brings fire from the gods to mankind. Alternatively, this messenger brings an elixir of immortality from heaven to Earth. In the early Vedic literature, Agni primarily connotes the fire as a god, one reflecting the primordial powers to consume, transform and convey.\n\n\"Yoga\" (; ) is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Yoga is a group of spiritual, mental, and physical practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. The term \"Yoga\" has been applied to a variety of practices and methods. In Hinduism these include Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga, Laya Yoga and Hatha Yoga. The term \"Rāja yoga\" originally referred to the ultimate goal of yoga, which is Samadhi (Sanskrit: , ), but was popularised by Swami Vivekananda as the common name for \"Ashtanga Yoga\". In the Ashtanga Yoga tradition, \"Samadhi\" is the eighth and final limb identified in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.\n\n\"Aum\" or \"Oṃ\" (Devanagari: ), , is a sacred sound and a spiritual symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. This word has three phonemes: \"a\", \"u\", and \"m\", though it is often described as trisyllabic despite this being either archaic or the result of translation. That signifies the essence of the ultimate reality, consciousness or Atman. The twelfth book of the Scriptures of Agni Yoga is called \"AUM\". Aum, as this book says, was a synthesis of sonant strivings. Prayer and inward concentration are excellent attainments which render healthful the state of the spirit. Each one in his own way has contributed a manifestation useful to spiritual concentration, whether he sought the solution in music, in song, or in the dance; man was striving to create a particularly exalted state of mind, promoting the reception of the higher energies.\n\n\"Ur\" or \"Aditi\" (Sanskrit: अदिति \"limitless\"), in the Vedas and Living Ethics is the Mother of the gods and all twelve zodiacal spirits from whose cosmic matrix the heavenly bodies were born. As celestial mother of every existing form and being, the synthesis of all things, she is associated with space and with mystic speech. She is mentioned nearly 80 times in the Rigveda: the verse \"Daksha sprang from Aditi and Aditi from Daksha\" is seen by Theosophists as a reference to \"the eternal cyclic re-birth of the same divine Essence\" and divine wisdom. \"Ur is the root of the Light of Fire\", it is stated in the holy writ of Agni Yoga.\n\n\"Shambhala\" (, ;) is a birthplace of Kalki, the final incarnation of Vishnu, who will usher in a New Age — Satya Yuga. Shambhala is ruled over by Maitreya. The Kalacakra Tantra prophesies that when all is lost, Kalki will emerge from Shambhala to vanquish \"Dark Forces\" and usher in a worldwide Golden Age. Shambhala is also called Shangri-la.\n\n\"Morya\" is one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom within modern Theosophical beliefs. He is one of the Mahatmas who inspired the founding of the Theosophy and Agni Yoga. He has written and dictated the letters with the goal of elevating mankind and bringing in a New Age. The Master Morya will physically incarnate in order to be the Manu (\"progenitor\") of the new root race.\n\n\"Tara Urusvati\" (\"The Light of the Morning Star\") is the spiritual name of Helena Roerich (1879 – 1955) in Agni Yoga and Rerikhism. She was a teacher and healer as well as the inspired co-author of the \"Agni Yoga series\", the first English books about Living Ethics and the Roerichs' relationship with their Guru. Each of the 935 paragraphs of the book \"Supermundane\" begins with the word \"Urusvati\". In the epilogue of the book \"Agni Yoga\" she was called the Mother of Agni Yoga.\n\n\"Fuyama\" is the spiritual name of Nicholas Roerich (1874 – 1947) in Agni Yoga and Rerikhism. He was an internationally acclaimed artist, conservationist, archeologist, humanitarian and peacemaker. Nicolas Roerich called Urusvati “She Who Leads” in his creations.\n\n\"Karma\" (; , ) means action, work or deed. It also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual influence his future. Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and future suffering. With origins in ancient India's Vedic civilization, the philosophy of karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth in many schools of Indian religions, particularly Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. Karma works as one of the great principles of Cosmic Action. \"When man realizes the power of karma and strives to express the best aspirations, his path is parallel with the universal energy. The universal energy attracts the creative strivings. The future and the Infinite are thus being built\", written in the Holy Scripture of Agni Yoga.\n\n\"Spiritual evolution\" is the philosophical, theological, esoteric or spiritual idea that nature and human beings and human culture evolve: either extending from an established cosmological pattern (ascent), or in accordance with certain pre-established potentials. The phrase \"spiritual evolution\" can occur in the context of \"higher evolution\", a term used to differentiate psychological, mental, or spiritual evolution from the \"lower evolution\" or biological evolution of physical form.\nThe concept of spiritual evolution is also complemented by the idea of a creative impulse in human beings, known as epigenesis. \n\n\"Agni Yoga\", in general, is a neo-theosophical religious doctrine transmitted by the Helena and Nicholas Roerichs from 1920. The followers of \"Living Ethics\" believe that the teaching was given to the Roerichs' family and their associates by Master Morya, the guru of Roerichs and Helena Blavatsky, one of the founders of the modern theosophical movement and the Theosophical Society. \"Teaching of Life\" is a path of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind.\nThe most significant features of Agni Yoga are cosmism and universalism. They are expressed in the interpretation of any phenomena of human existence from the point of view of their cosmic significance and interrelation with the being of the Universe.\n\nThe Theosophical Society was officially formed in New York City on 17 November 1875 by Helena Blavatsky, Henry Steel Olcott, William Quan Judge, and others. It was self-described as \"an unsectarian body of seekers after Truth, who endeavour to promote Brotherhood and strive to serve humanity.\" After a few years Olcott and Blavatsky moved to India and established the International Headquarters at Adyar, in Madras. \n\nMadame Blavatsky (\"Upasica\" - this spiritual name means a female lay disciple. So the \"Teachers\" called HPB), the greatest occultist in the history of Western civilization, insisted that Theosophy is not a religion, although did refer to it as the modern transmission of the \"once universal religion\" that she claimed had existed deep into the human past. The motto of the Theosophical movement: There is no Religion higher than Truth.\n\nTheosophical organisations, regard it as a system that embraces what they see as the \"essential truth\" underlying religion, philosophy, and science. Theosophical groups allow their members to hold other religious allegiances, resulting in Theosophists who also identify as Christians, Buddhists, or Hindus.\n\nThe term Neo-Theosophy was coined by Ferdinand T. Brooks around 1912. This term used by the followers of Helena Blavatsky to denominate the system of theosophical ideas expounded following the death of Blavatsky in 1891. This material differed in major respects from Blavatsky's original presentation, but it is accepted as genuinely theosophical by many theosophists around the world. Daryl S. Paulson associates \"Neo-Theosophy\" with Alice Bailey. She introduced the term New Age – Age of Aquarius. \n\nOther neo-theosophists include Rudolf Steiner's contemporary Peter Deunov and Samael Aun Weor. Dion Fortune and Aleister Crowley were also influencers of the leading edge of the theosophical movement. Some examples of neo-theosophists today include Benjamin Creme and Victor Skumin. So, in 1990, Skumin, based on the theosophical concept of spiritual evolution, proposed a classification of Homo spiritalis (Latin: \"Spiritual man\"), the sixth root race, consisting of eight sub-races (subspecies): \"HS-0\" Anabiosis spiritalis, \"HS-1\" Scientella spiritalis, \"HS-2\" Aurora spiritalis, \"HS-3\" Ascensus spiritalis, \"HS-4\" Vocatus spiritalis, \"HS-5\" Illuminatio spiritalis, \"НS-6\" Creatio spiritalis, and \"HS-7\" Servitus spiritalis.\n\nRussian philosophy as a separate entity started its development in the 19th century, defined initially by the opposition of Westernizers, advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and Slavophiles, insisting on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group included Nikolai Danilevsky and Konstantin Leontiev, the early founders of eurasianism. \"Slavophilia\" was an intellectual movement originating from 19th century that wanted the Russian Empire to be developed upon values and institutions derived from its early history. There were also similar movements in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Serbia. Depending on the historical context, its opposite could be termed Slavophobia, a fear of Slavic culture.\n\nThe discussion of Russia's place in the world has since become the most characteristic feature of Russian philosophy. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include Vladimir Solovyev, Vasily Rozanov, Lev Shestov, Leo Tolstoy, Sergei Bulgakov, Pavel Florensky, Pitirim Sorokin.In its further development, Russian philosophy was also marked by deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, religion, and Russian cosmism.\n\nVladimir Solovyov described his encounters with the entity \"Sophia\" in his works, such as \"Three Encounters\" and \"Lectures on Godmanhood\". His fusion was driven by the desire to reconcile or unite with Orthodox Christianity the various traditions by the Russian Slavophiles' concept of sobornost. His Russian religious philosophy had a very strong impact on the Russian Symbolist art movements of his time. His teachings on \"Sophia\", conceived as the merciful unifying feminine wisdom of God comparable to the Hebrew Shekinah or various goddess traditions, have been deemed a heresy by Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and as unsound and unorthodox by the Patriarchate of Moscow.\n\nNikolai Fyodorov was a Russian Orthodox Christian philosopher, who was part of the Russian cosmism movement and a precursor of transhumanism. Fedorov argued that humanity is the culmination of evolution, as well as its creator and director. Humans must therefore direct evolution where their reason and morality dictate. Fedorov stated that the struggle against death can become the most natural cause uniting all people, regardless of their nationality, race, citizenship or wealth. He called this the \"Common Cause\". Fedorov thought that death and afterdeath existence should become the subject of comprehensive scientific inquiry, that achieving immortality and revival is the greatest goal of science.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, there was a burst of scientific investigation into interplanetary travel, largely driven by the fiction writers such as Jules Verne and Herbert Wells as well as philosophical movements like Russian cosmism. In 1903, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky published the first serious scientific work on space travel. His work was essentially unknown outside the Russian Empire, but inside the country it inspired further research, experimentation and the formation of the Society for Studies of Interplanetary spaceflight. Tsiolkovsky wrote a book called \"The Will of the Universe; Unknown Intelligent Forces\" in which he propounded a philosophy of panpsychism. He believed humans would eventually colonize the Milky Way. His thought preceded the Space Age by several decades, and some of what he foresaw in his imagination has come into being since his death. Tsiolkovsky did not believe in traditional religious cosmology, but instead he believed in a cosmic being that governed humans.\n\nThe ideas of the Russian philosophers and cossmists later were developed by those in the transhumanist movement and Rerikhism.\nFor example, the Russian scientist Victor Skumin argues that the Culture of Health will play an important role in the creation of a human spiritual society into the Solar System.\n\nInformation about Vedanta and Buddhism spread in Western countries in the first decade of the 20th century. In the United States of the 1920s, when the voises in religion were arguing over fundamentalism and modernism as the only available choice, and long before Shangri-La had become a popularly accepted myth, a vanguard movement was promoting the alternative of the wisdom of the Eastern world.\n\nTheosophy proposed the existence of a society of Secret Chiefs called the Great White Brotherhood. The members of this Brotherhood, in belief systems akin to Theosophy and New Age, are said to be perfected beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans. The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or the Ascended Masters. They are referred to by theosophists as Elder Brothers of the human race, Adepts, Mahātmās, or simply as the Masters. The first person to talk about them in the West was Helena Blavatsky, after she and other people claimed to have received messages from them. These included Nicholas Roerich and Helena Roerich, too. She emphasized that knowledge was the leading path of all great Teachers. Knowledge will permit a free and vital approach to the great Teaching, as vitally real as is great Matter itself.\n\nWhen Nicholas Roerich passed away, his wife is believed to have carried on the work prescribed by Master Morya, “I exist only due to the ray of the Great Master, who said it was necessary for me to remain because no one could replace me as I worked under the highest Cosmic Sign, and this century was in need of my attainment”. The main aim of Helena Roerich was to spread the message of Agni Yoga.\n\nThe Agni Yoga Society was founded in 1920 by Helena and Nicholas Roerich. It is a non-profit educational institution incor|porated in 1946 under the laws of the State of New York, and is supported entirely by voluntary contributions and membership dues. The organization was located in the building \"Master Apartments\". The aims of the Society are embodied in the philosophy that gives it its name—Agni Yoga—as contained in the books of the Agni Yoga Series published by the Society. In them is found a synthesis of ancient Eastern beliefs and modern Western thought and a bridge between the spiritual and the scientific. \n\nUnlike previous yogas, Agni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. Though not systematized in an ordinary sense, it is a teaching that helps the student to discover moral and spiritual guide-posts by which to learn to govern his or her life and thus contribute to the common good. For this reason Agni Yoga has been called a \"Living ethic\". \nSpeaking about the role of personality in the spiritual evolution of mankind, Helena Roerich wrote,\nThe Latvian Roerich Society is one of the oldest society established by the Roerichs family. In 1920 Vladimir Schibayev, while being in London, met Nicholas and Helena Roerichs. In Riga they created a group of people to study Agni Yoga and another theosophical literature. In 1928, Schibayev went to India, to become the secretary of Roerich.\n\nIn Riga the place of the leader of Latvian Roerich Society was taken by doctor-homeopath Dr. Felix Lukin and his son Dr. conducted clinical trials are many natural medications that they received from Svetoslav Roerich of the Himalayan Research Institute named \"Urusvati\".\n\nIn 1936 officially became the president of the Latvian Society. During his lead, the books of Living Ethics, the works by the Roerichs, Helena Blavatsky’s and works by Rudzitis himself were published. In 1937 the first conference of Baltic Roerich Societies took place. The Latvian Society was renewed at the Soviet Union in 1988. Dr. Harald Lukin carried the Roerichs Banner of Peace. The new president Gunta Rudzite, the daughter of Rihard Rudzitis, held contacts with many people of the republics in the USSR who were interested in the ideas of Agni Yoga. On 2005 the Roerich Society received a social beneficial status in the Republic of Latvia.\n\nNicolas Roerich is known as a thinker and a builder of life. His art and writings are an evocation to Beauty, to Knowledge, and to Culture. His vision is nicely captured in his philosophical statement of the Master Institute of United Arts which he formed in New York City in 1921:\nMr. and Mrs. Horch financed and directed the Master Institute that taught the fine and dramatic arts. For much of its existence, the Master Institute was housed in the Master Apartments, designed by Harvery Wiley Corbett in 1929 for Roerich and built on the site of the former Horch mansion at 310 Riverside Dr. in New York City.\n\nRoerich planned to realize the educational concepts at the Institute. He invited as teachers such famous people as George Bellows, Claude Fayette Bragdon, Norman Bel Geddes, Stark Young, Deems Taylor, Robert Edmond Jones, and Lee Simonson. Intensive work was in process under direct supervision of Roerich. Nicholas gave lectures, organized new classes, for example classes of music and sculpture for the blind. Many representatives of American science and culture expressed their willingness to educate students according with the proposed curriculum. There were Felix Salmond, Ernest Bloch, and Michael Fokin. In the \"Institute of United Arts in New York City\" also taught Rockwell Kent, Claude Bragdon, George Bellows, and Norman Bel Geddes.\n\nSome contemporaries were skeptical spiritual mission of Nicholas Roerich. But those who embraced his philosophy experienced something transformative in his canvases. Roerich's name is universally known not only as Master of the brush but also as a thinker and a builder of life. The works of the Artist are an evocation to Beauty, to Knowledge, and to Culture.\n\nRoerich's family moved to India in December 1923. They settled in Darjeeling, a town in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is located in the Lower Himalayan Ranges at an elevation of .\n\nFrom 1925 to 1928, Roerichs took part in a Central Asia expedition, that traveled through hard-to-reach and little-investigated regions of India, China, Soviet Union, Mongolia and Tibet. Sikkim was the starting point of the expedition. During the expedition, research in topics such as history, archeology, ethnography, history of philosophy, arts and religions, and geography was conducted. Rare manuscripts were found, and rich linguistic materials were collected. Special attention was paid to the problem of historical unity of cultures of various peoples. In 1925, Helena Roerich began to translate an extensive selection from \"The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett\". She also wrote a book named \"Chalice of the East\", which was published under the pen name \"Iskander Khanum\". Helena Roerich's manuscript \"Foundations of Buddhism\" was published in 1926, at Urga, where her expedition was staying at the time. In this book, the fundamental philosophical notions of Buddha's Teaching were interpreted.\n\nThe plethora of materials collected during the Central Asia Expedition became the foundation for the establishment of the Himalayan Research Institute named \"Urusvati\" in Darjeeling in 1928. A few months later the institute moved to Naggar in Kulu Valley.\n\nThe center engaged in scientific exchange with 285 institutes, universities, museums, and libraries around the world. George de Roerich was a world-renowned scientist, orientalist, and guru. His monumental translation of the \"Blue Annals\" (), and his 11-volume \"Tibetan-Russian-English dictionary with Sanskrit parallels\" were published in 1934.\n\nOne of his main focuses for the center was to bring people to the Institute who practiced and lived the cultures being examined by the center. George Roerich was the director of the Himalayan Research Institute named \"Urusvati\" for 10 years.\n\nSvetoslav Roerich was in charge of the work of the Natural Sciences Department. He carried out unique researches in various fields of the natural sciences. At the basis of his scientific investigations was understanding of nature as one whole that is inalienably connected with the cosmic laws. The scope of his interests: cultural studies, comparative religious studies and philosophy, botany, mineralogy, tibetan pharmacopoeia, chemistry and its alchemical sources.\n\nThe work of the Himalayan Research Institute was based on wide international cooperation. Major scientists and cultural workers collaborated with the Institute Urusvati. Such as Soviet academician Nikolai Vavilov, biologist and biophysicist Jagadish Chandra Bose, Bengali polymath Rabindranath Tagore, the father of Indian journalism Ramananda Chatterjee, Indian philosopher and statesman Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Swedish geographer and explorer Sven Hedin, and many others.\n\n\"The Journal of the Urusvati Himalayan Research Institute (U.J.)\" published articles on various aspects of science and culture. The publications presented a multi-level perception of the authors who were looking for a new integration of different cultural models in the mainstream of Agni Yoga.\n\nThe Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City was originally located in the Master Apartments at 103rd Street and Riverside Drive (Manhattan), which were built especially for Roerich in 1929. Now the museum is located in a brownstone at 319 West 107th Street on Manhattan's Upper West Side. This Museum is one of the most off-the-beaten-path of Manhattan's museums, a collection of works by Nicolas Roerich, who lived on the Upper West Side for a time in the 1920's. The brownstone is chock-full of amazing natural scenes from the Himalayas, where this artist spent two decades of his life. Roerich usually painted in stark tempera, with blazing orange skies or impossibly deep blue mountains.\n\nCurrently, the museum includes between 100 and 200 of Roerich's works as well as a collection of archival materials and still attracts pilgrims from throughout the world. The mission of the Nicholas Roerich Museum is one: to make available to the public the full range of Roerich’s accomplishments. They cover the realms of art, science, spirituality, peacemaking, and more.\n\nThe Museum seeks to realize the ideas of Agni Yoga on the role of culture in the evolution of the world and evolution of the human consciousness. Information about these Roerich's ideas is always available. The museum also provides an opportunity for young musicians to perform in front of an audience on a voluntary and free basis.\n\nThe Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York is the largest center of Roerich-related activity outside of Russian Federation.\n\n\"The International Center of the Roerichs\" (Russian: \"Междунаро́дный це́нтр Ре́рихов\") is a non-governmental public association of citizens and public associations incorporated on the basis of their common interests in the cause of study, preservation, and popularization of the Roerich family \nheritage. The Center is an associated member of the Non-Governmental Organizations Association under the United Nations Department of Public Information. Conducting its activities, this International public organization proceeds from the applicable the law of the states in which its structural divisions are acting, the United Nations Charter, norms of the International law and International legal acts related to the Center’s sphere of activity.\n\n\"Museum named after Nicholas Roerich\" (Russian: \"Музе́й и́мени Н. К. Ре́риха Междунаро́дного це́нтра Ре́рихов\") contents comprises the Roerichs' cultural heritage passed on to the Soviet Roerichs' Foundation (now International Center of the Roerichs) by Svetoslav Roerich in 1990. It carries in itself a new cosmic world view for which new interest grows more each year. The core of the Rerikhism is the philosophy of cosmic reality – the Agni Yoga, which develops the idea of a close relationship between man and Cosmos, contains knowledge which assists in understanding the specific features peculiar to the new evolutionary stage of mankind's development.\n\n\"The World Organisation of Culture of Health (WOCH)\" — International social movement \"To Health via Culture\" (Russian: Междунаро́дное обще́ственное Движе́ние «К Здоро́вью че́рез Культу́ру») was founded in the year 1994. Victor Skumin was elected to the post of the President-founder of this organisation. The WOCH operates in accordance with the registered in Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation Charter.\n\nIn Agni Yoga much attention is paid to health. So in the book \"Supermundane\" (paragraph 525) recorded the words of Master Morya, addressed to Urusvati,\n\nIt is from these positions that WOCH approaches the solution of problems related to health. As \"Holy Scripture of Agni Yoga\" says, physicians can be true helpers of humanity in the ascent of the spirit. The intellect of a physician must be reinforced by his heart. The physician must be a psychologist, and he must not ignore the wondrous psychic energy.\n\nProf. Verhorubova and Prof. Lobanova from Tomsk State Pedagogical University argued (2012) that in accordance with the concept of a culture of health, proposed by Skumin, the culture – spiritual, mental, and physical – determines the status of human health. And health – spiritual, mental, physical – is a prerequisite for achieving a higher level of culture.\n\nThe World Organisation of Culture of Health, in order to promote international relations, has established a link with the International Buddhist Meditation Centre.\n\nThe anthem of WOCH (\"To Health via Culture\") consists of four stanzas. The capital letters each of the four stanzas form the word Agni. (). Another anthem by Skumin is termed \"Urusvati\". Helena Roerich, known as the \"Tara Urusvati\" in Agni Yoga and Rerikhism. This anthem begins with the phrase, \"The fire of the heart ignites Urusvati, she teaches the spirit take-off on the wings of the grace\". Six more hymns have the names: \"Heart\", \"Shambhala\", \"Morya\", \"Ur\", \"Agni\", and \"Sun\".\n\nIn the Russian Orthodox Church the social activities of this international organization qualifies as an ideology of the Agni Yoga and New Age (NA),\n\nThe WOCH has its own publishing house (\"To Health via Culture\"), who has the right to publish the books with the International Standard Book Number (ISBN). \"The Journal of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (″World Health Culture Organization″)\" is based in Novocheboksarsk. The journal received an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) 0204-3440. The main topics of the magazine are the dissemination of ideas of culture of health, holistic medicine, Rerikhism, and Agni Yoga.\n\nThe beginning of the religious and philosophical \"series of Agni Yoga\" was delivered on March 24, 1920. These Roerichs records eventually became the \"Holy Scripture\", consisting of a series of books with a total volume of about 5000 pages.\n\n\nMany works of Nicholas Roerich and Svetoslav Roerich, as an artists, are thematically related to Agni Yoga. Roerichs artistic works speak about the internal needs of the individual and about the ways of their realization. Roerich's paintings are a kind of \"Teaching of Life\", on the spiritual development of mankind, about culture and its role in human life. This is a conversation about the Eternity.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27913535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27913535", "title": "All Religions are One", "text": "All Religions are One\n\nAll Religions are One is a series of philosophical aphorisms by William Blake, written in 1788. Following on from his initial experiments with relief etching in the non-textual \"The Approach of Doom\" (1787), \"All Religions are One\" and \"There is No Natural Religion\" represent Blake's first successful attempt to combine image and text via relief etching, and are thus the earliest of his illuminated manuscripts. As such, they serve as a significant milestone in Blake's career; as Peter Ackroyd points out, \"his newly invented form now changed the nature of his expression. It had enlarged his range; with relief etching, the words inscribed like those of God upon the tables of law, Blake could acquire a new role.\"\n\nIn 1822, Blake completed a short two-page dramatic piece which would prove to be the last of his illuminated manuscripts, entitled \"The Ghost of Abel A Revelation In the Visions of Jehovah Seen by William Blake\". Inscribed in the colophon of this text is \"W Blakes Original Stereotype was 1788\". It is almost universally agreed amongst Blakean scholars, that the \"Original Stereotype\" to which he here refers was \"All Religions are One\" and/or \"There is No Natural Religion\".\n\nDuring the 1770s, Blake had come to feel that one of the major problems with reproducing artwork in print was the division of labour by which it was achieved; one person would create a design (the artist), another would engrave it (the engraver), another print it (the printer) and another publish it (the publisher). It was unusual for artists to engrave their own designs, due primarily to the social status attached to each job; engraving was not seen as an especially exalted profession, and was instead regarded as nothing more than mechanical reproduction. Artists like James Barry and John Hamilton Mortimer were the exceptions to the norm insofar as they tended to engrave their own material. A further division in the process was that text and images were handled by different artisans; text was printed by means of a movable letterpress, whereas images were engraved, two very different jobs.\n\nDuring Blake's training as a professional copy engraver with James Basire during the 1770s, the most common method of engraving was stippling, which was thought to give a more accurate impression of the original picture than the previously dominant method, line engraving. Etching was also commonly used for layering in such aspects as landscape and background. All traditional methods of engraving and etching were intaglio, which meant that the design's outline was traced with a needle through an acid-resistant 'ground' which had been poured over the copperplate. The plate was then covered with acid, and the engraver went over the incised lines with a burin to allow the acid to bite into the furrows and eat into the copper itself. The acid would then be poured off, leaving the design incised on the plate. The engraver would then engrave the plate's entire surface with a web of crosshatched lines, before pouring the ink onto the plate and transferring it to the printing press.\n\nFrustrated with this method, Blake seems to have begun thinking about a new method of publishing at least as early as 1784, as in that year a rough description of what would become relief etching appears in his unpublished satire, \"An Island in the Moon\". Around the same time, George Cumberland had been experimenting with a method to allow him to reproduce handwriting via an etched plate, and Blake incorporated Cumberland's method into his own relief etching; treating the text as handwritten script rather than mechanical letterpress, and thus allowing him to make it a component of the image.\n\nBlake's great innovation in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, parts of the plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto the plate with an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate’s edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and pour the acid about a quarter of an inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly above the rest of the plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern rubber stamp. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press. This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio. The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he wrote in reverse. Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text on a sheet of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.\n\nBlake could also colour the plates themselves in coloured inks before pressing them or tint them with watercolours after printing. Because of this aspect, a major component of relief etching was that every page of every book was a unique piece of art; no two copies of any page in Blake's entire \"oeuvre\" are identical. Variations in the actual print, different colouring choices, repainted plates, accidents during the acid bath etc., all led to multiple examples of the same plate.\n\nBlake himself referred to relief etching as \"printing in the infernal method, by means of corrosives [...] melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid.\" A contemporary description of the method was provided by Blake's friend, J.T. Smith; \"writing his poetry, and drawing his marginal subjects of embellishments in outline upon the copper-plate with an impervious liquid, and then eating the plain parts or lights away with aquafortis considerably below them so that the outlines were left as Stereotype.\"\n\nRelief etching was the same basic method used for woodcutting, and copper relief etching had been practised in the early eighteenth century by Elisha Kirkall, but Blake was the first to use such a method to create both words and designs mixed together on the same plate. Apart from the unique aesthetic effects possible, a major advantage of relief etching was that Blake could print the material himself. Because the text was in relief, the pressure needed for printing was constant, unlike in intaglio printing, where different pressures were needed to force the paper into the furrows, depending on size. Additionally, intaglio etchings and engravings were printed with great pressure, but in relief etching, because the printed material was a raised surface rather than incised lines, considerably less pressure was required. As such, relief etching tackled the problem of the division of labour of publishing. Blake's new method was autographic; \"it permitted – indeed promoted – a seamless relationship between conception and execution rather than the usual divisions between invention and production embedded in eighteenth-century print technology, and its economic and social distinctions among authors, printers, artists and engravers. Like drawings and manuscripts, Blake's relief etchings were created by the direct and positive action of the author/artist's hand without intervening processes.\" Blake served as artist, engraver, printer \"and\" publisher.\n\nAlthough \"All Religions are One\" was etched in 1788, the only surviving copy (known as Copy A) was not printed until 1795; a large paper copy printed as part of a deluxe edition of Blake's collected illuminated manuscripts. Whether he had printed \"All Religions\" prior to 1795 is unknown. However, the fact that it is not mentioned in his 'To the Public' address of October 1793, where he listed all of his extant manuscripts up to that time except \"All Religions\" and \"No Natural Religion\", would suggest he had not.\n\nCopy A is located in The Huntington Library, except Plate 2 (title page), which exists in two impressions. The copy of the title page which goes with Copy A is located in the Geoffrey Keynes Collection in the Fitzwilliam Museum. The title page from another copy (colour printed in brown ink), the additional plates of which are unrecorded, is in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\n\"All Religions are One\" comprises ten plates, each of which is roughly 5.4 X 4 cm., with each paragraph on a separate plate, except Plate 10, which contains both Principal 7 and a short paragraph which functions as a conclusion to the series. In numerous cases, it seems as if the acid has eaten away too much of the relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and wash, often touching the text and design outlines with pen. Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary colour printing, a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of white line engraving, a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be eaten away by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.\n\nThe black ink framing lines drawn around each design are thought to have been added at a later date, possibly in 1818, just prior to Blake giving the plates to John Linnell. The ink and wash work in the designs themselves may also have been executed at that time, although this cannot be ascertained for certain. It has been suggested that the framing lines may have been added due to the discrepancy between the size of the plates and the size of the paper (each sheet is 37.8 x 27 cm.).\nPlates 1 and 3–10 of the Huntington copy were acquired by John Linnell some time after 1818, with the missing title page replaced by an impression of the title page from \"There is No Natural Religion\". The plates were sold from the Linnell estate on 15 March 1918 to Henry E. Huntington. Plate 2 was acquired by George A. Smith in 1853. It may have subsequently been owned by William Muir, but was ultimately sold at Sotheby's by Sir Hickman Bacon on 21 July 1953, to Geoffrey Keynes, who donated it to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1982.\n\nAfter the original 1795 printing, the text of \"All Religions\" was not published again until 1893, in \"The Works of William Blake, Poetic, Symbolic and Critical\", edited by W.B. Yeats and E.J. Ellis.\n\nUntil 1971, most editors tended to consider \"All Religions are One\" as later than \"There is No Natural Religion\". For example, in his 1905 book \"The poetical works of William Blake; a new and verbatim text from the manuscript engraved and letterpress originals\", John Sampson places \"No Natural Religion\" prior to \"All Religions\" in his 'Appendix to the Prophetic Books'. However, in 1971, Geoffrey Keynes argued that \"All Religions are One\" was the earlier of the two, based on what he saw as its \"greater technical imperfection.\" In his 1978 book, \"The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake\", David Bindman initially disagreed with Keynes, arguing that the imperfections in \"All Religions\" are not because of an earlier date of composition, but because of the increased complexity of the plates, with such complexity demonstrating Blake growing in confidence from the more rudimentary plates for \"No Natural Religion\". Most scholars however support Keynes, and \"All Religions are One\" precedes \"There is No Natural Religion\" in almost all modern anthologies of Blake's work; for example, Alicia Ostriker's \"William Blake: The Complete Poems\" (1977), David V. Erdman's 2nd edition of \"The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake\" (1982), Morris Eaves', Robert N. Essick's and Joseph Viscomi's \"Blake's Illuminated Books, Volume 3: The Early Illuminated Books\" (1993), even Bindman's own \"The Complete Illuminated Books of William Blake\" (2003), and W.H. Stevenson's 3rd edition of \"Blake: The Complete Poems\" (2007).\n\nFurther evidence for Keynes hypothesis is discussed by Eaves, Essick and Viscomi, who, in counterpoint to Bindman, see the style of \"No Natural Religion\" as more confident than that of \"All Religions\". They especially cite the use of upright roman lettering in \"All Religions\" contrasted with the italic, cursive writing on several plates of \"No Natural Religion\"; \"this style was easier to execute since it required fewer independent strokes. And since the resulting dense matrix of lines provided better support for the inking dabber, italic permitted a shallower etch.\" Blake introduced italic script on plate a3 of \"No Natural Religion\", a script which he would use throughout the 1790s. Other evidence for an earlier dating of \"All Religions\" is that many of the individual letters themselves lean to the left, unlike in \"No Natural Religion\". This was a common problem in mirror writing, and its presence in \"All Religions\" but not \"No Natural Religion\" suggests Blake was only learning how to overcome it as he worked.\n\nWhen analysing \"All Religions are One\" it is important to remember that the images are not necessarily literal depictions of the text; \"the philosophical propositions [...] offer little visual imagery or even named objects. These qualities may have determined the relative independence of many of the designs from the accompanying text. The links are thematic and metaphoric, not direct and literal.\"\nThe central concern in \"All Religions are One\" is the notion of the \"Poetic Genius\", which is roughly analogous to the imagination. Blake argues that the Poetic Genius is greater than all else and \"is the true man.\" The Poetic Genius thus replaces traditional concepts of divinity insofar as \"The body or outward form of Man is derived from the Poetic Genius [...] the forms of all things are derived from their Genius. which by the Ancients was call'd an Angel & Spirit & Demon.\" Thus, the Poetic Genius supplants theological belief. This Poetic Genius is universal, common to all Mankind; \"as all men are alike in outward form [...] all men are alike in the Poetic Genius.\" Similarly, all philosophies are derived from the Poetic Genius; \"all sects of Philosophies are from the Poetic Genius adapted to the weaknesses of every individual\", and so too are all religions, which are merely expressions of the Poetic Genius; \"the Religions of all Nations are derived from each Nations different reception of the Poetic Genius which is everywhere call'd the Spirit of Prophecy,\" again emphasising the theological character of the Poetic Genius. Even the Bible originates with the Poetic Genius; \"The Jewish & Christian Testaments are An original derivation from the Poetic Genius.\" Thus, as all Men are alike in their Poetic Genius, and as all religions originate with the Poetic Genius, so too must all religions be alike, thus all religions are one.\n\nDavid Bindman classifies \"All Religions are One\" as \"a rather abstract dialogue with conventional theology,\" and in this sense, it is often interpreted as Blake's earliest engagement with deism and dualism. Similarly, Northrop Frye argues that Blake's theory that all religions are one is a \"visionary tolerance\" at odds with the \"rational tolerance\" of deism \"which holds that all religions are equally an attempt to solve an insoluble mystery.\" Working along the same lines, Florence Sandler argues that in these texts Blake \"set himself to the task of separating true religion from its perversions in his own age and in the Bible itself.\" Also concentrating on the refutation of deism, Alicia Ostriker refers to the series as a \"mockery of rationalism and an insistence on Man's potential infinitude.\" S. Foster Damon suggests that what Blake has done in \"All Religions are One\" is \"dethroned reason from its ancient place as the supreme faculty of man, replacing it with the Imagination.\" Damon also argues that \"Blake had completed his revolutionary theory of the nature of Man and proclaimed the unity of all true religions.\" Harold Bloom reaches much the same conclusion, suggesting that Blake is arguing for the \"primacy of the poetic imagination over all metaphysical and moral systems.\" A similar conclusion is reached by Denise Vultee, who argues that \"the two tractates are part of Blake's lifelong quarrel with the philosophy of Bacon, Newton, and Locke. Rejecting the rational empiricism of eighteenth-century deism or \"natural religion\", which looked to the material world for evidence of God's existence, Blake offers as an alternative the imaginative faculty or \"Poetic Genius\".\"\n\nIn terms of influences on Blake, in 1787 Henry Fuseli was working on a translation of J.C. Lavater's \"Aphorisms on Man\" for the publisher Joseph Johnson, when he hired Blake to engrave the frontispiece. Blake became so enamoured of Lavater's work that on the inside cover of his own copy of the book, he inscribed both his name and Lavater's, and drew a heart encompassing them. Blake also extensively annotated his own copy of \"Aphorisms\", and a number of critics have noted parallels between the Lavater annotations and Blake's own aphorisms in both \"All Religions\" and \"No Natural Religion\". S. Foster Damon specifically points to Lavater's first two aphorisms as having a strong influence on Blake;\n\n\nTo these points Blake has annotated \"This is true Christian philosophy far above all abstraction.\"\n\nAnother work which may also have influenced him is Emanuel Swedenborg's \"Heaven and Hell\" (1758). In his annotations to Swedenborg, Blake twice connects the word \"Lord\" with \"Poetic Genius\". During Swedenborg's discussion of the connection between the spiritual world and the natural world, Blake writes \"He who Loves feels love descend into him & if he has wisdom may perceive it is from the Poetic Genius which is the Lord.\" Shortly thereafter, to Swedenborg's \"the negation of God constitutes Hell\", Blake annotates \"the negation of the Poetic Genius.\"\n\nWhile the Lavater and Swedenborg influences are somewhat speculative, the importance of Bacon, Newton and Locke is not, as it is known that Blake despised empiricism from an early age. In 1808, as he annotated \"The Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds\", Blake wrote\n\nHarold Bloom also cites the work of Anthony Collins, Matthew Tindal and John Toland as having an influence on Blake's thoughts. In a more general sense, \"Blake sees the school of Bacon and Locke as the foundation of natural religion, the deistic attempt to prove the existence of God on the basis of sensate experience and its rational investigation.\" To that end, Blake \"manipulates the syncretic mythology of Jacob Bryant, Paul Henri Mallet, and perhaps other founders of what has become the comparative study of religion, to argue for the existence of a universal and supra-rational 'Poetic Genius' that expresses itself through the shared (though ever various) forms of all religions.\"\n\nIn relation to his later work, Northrop Frye sees \"All Religions are One\" and \"There is No Natural Religion\" as forming a fundamental statement of intent for Blake, a kind of pre-emptive outline of his future work, \"a summarised statement of the doctrines of the engraved canon.\" Similarly, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi state that they \"contain some of Blake's most fundamental principles and reveal the foundation for later development in his thought and art.\" W.H. Stevenson calls them \"a very early statement of fundamental opinions [Blake] held all his life.\" As an example of how Blake returned to the specific themes of \"All Religions\", in \"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\" (1790), he writes \"the Poetic Genius was the first principle and all the others merely derivative\" (12:22–24).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "175914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175914", "title": "Anthropology of religion", "text": "Anthropology of religion\n\nAnthropology of religion is the study of religion in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures.\n\nIn the early 11th century, Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī (973–1048), wrote detailed comparative studies on the anthropology of religions and cultures across the Middle East, Mediterranean and the Indian subcontinent. He discussed the peoples, customs, and religions of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAnthropology circa 1940 assumed that religion is in complete continuity with magical thinking, and that it is a cultural product. The complete continuity between magic and religion has been a postulate of modern anthropology at least since early 1930s. The perspective of modern anthropology towards religion is the \"projection idea\", a methodological approach which assumes that every religion is created by the human community that worships it, that \"creative activity ascribed to God is projected from man.\" In 1841, Ludwig Feuerbach was the first to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion. A prominent precursor in the formulation of this projection principle was Giambattista Vico, and an early formulation of it is found in ancient Greek writer Xenophanes, which observed that \"the gods of Ethiopians were inevitably black with flat noses while those of the Thracians were blond with blue eyes.\"\n\nIn 1912 Émile Durkheim, building on Feuerbach, considered religion \"a projection of the social values of society,\" \"a means of making symbolic statements about society,\" \"a symbolic language that makes statements about the social order\"; in short, \"religion is society worshiping itself\".\n\nIn the 19th century, cultural anthropology was dominated by an interest in cultural evolution; most anthropologists assumed that there was a simple distinction between \"primitive\" and \"modern\" religion and tried to provide accounts of how the former evolved into the latter. In the 20th century most anthropologists rejected this approach. Today the anthropology of religion reflects the influence of, or an engagement with, such theorists as Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Émile Durkheim, and Max Weber. They are especially concerned with how religious beliefs and practices may reflect political or economic forces; or the social functions of religious beliefs and practices.\n\nOne major problem in the anthropology of religion is the definition of religion itself. At one time anthropologists believed that certain religious practices and beliefs were more or less universal to all cultures at some point in their development, such as a belief in spirits or ghosts, the use of magic as a means of controlling the supernatural, the use of divination as a means of discovering occult knowledge, and the performance of rituals such as prayer and sacrifice as a means of influencing the outcome of various events through a supernatural agency, sometimes taking the form of shamanism or ancestor worship. According to Clifford Geertz, religion is\nToday, religious anthropologists debate, and reject, the cross-cultural validity of these categories (often viewing them as examples of European primitivism). Anthropologists have considered various criteria for defining religion – such as a belief in the supernatural or the reliance on ritual – but few claim that these criteria are universally valid.\n\nAnthony F. C. Wallace proposes four categories of religion, each subsequent category subsuming the previous. These are, however, synthetic categories and do not necessarily encompass all religions.\n\n\n"}

As with other aspects of the Day of the Dead festival, calacas are generally depicted as joyous rather than mournful figures. They are often shown wearing festive clothing, dancing, and playing musical instruments to indicate a happy afterlife. This draws on the Mexican belief that no dead soul likes to be thought of sadly, and that death should be a joyous occasion. This goes back to Aztec beliefs, one of the few traditions to remain after the Spanish conquest.\n\nCalacas used in the festival include carved skull masks worn by revelers, small figures made out of carved wood or fired clay, and sweet treats in the form of skulls or skeletons. Calacas are sometimes made of wood, stone, or even candy.\n\nA popular phrase among Mexicans and those Latinos that personally know someone is \"se lo (la) llevó la calaca\" after someone has died, literally meaning \"the calaca took him (her)\" or \"death took him (her)\".\n\nIn Guatemala, \"calaca\" is understood as \"death\". The figure of a bare skeleton represents death and implies fear of death. Thus, it is not normally utilized as a joyful image.\n\nCalaca-like figures can be seen in the Tim Burton films \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" and \"Corpse Bride\", Neil Gaiman's movie \"Coraline\", the PlayStation 3 games \"LittleBigPlanet\" (2008) and \"Guacamelee!\" (2013), and the 1998 Tim Schafer computer game \"Grim Fandango.\"\n\nCalacas are prominently featured as representations of the deceased in \"The Book of Life\".\n\nIn \"Monster High\", Skelita Calaveras is a calaca and is the daughter of Los Esklitos (The Skeletons).\n\nIn \"\", the villain Sartana of the Dead is a calaca and commands various calacas that are in her service.\n\nThe Calacas are featured in \"Coco\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2331004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331004", "title": "Cannabis and religion", "text": "Cannabis and religion\n\nDifferent religions have varying stances on the use of cannabis, historically and presently. In ancient history some religions used cannabis as an entheogenic, particularly in the Indian subcontinent where the tradition continues on a more limited basis.\n\nIn the modern era, religions with prohibitions against intoxicants, such as Islam, Buddhism, Bahai, Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and others have opposed the use of cannabis by members, or in some cases opposed the liberalization of cannabis laws. Other groups, such as some Protestant and Jewish factions, have supported the use of medicinal cannabis.\n\nIn the Bahá'í Faith, use of alcohol and other drugs for intoxication, as opposed to medical prescription, is prohibited, see Bahá'í laws. But Bahá'í practice is such laws should be applied with \"tact and wisdom\". The use of tobacco is an individual decision, it is yet strongly frowned on and not explicitly forbidden. Bahá'í authorities have spoken against intoxicant drugs since the earliest stages of the religion, with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writing:\n\nIn Buddhism, the Fifth Precept is frequently interpreted to mean \"refrain from intoxicating drinks and drugs which lead to heedlessness\", although in some direct translations, the Fifth Precept refers specifically to alcohol. Cannabis and some other psychoactive plants are specifically prescribed in the Mahākāla Tantra for medicinal purposes.\n\nPrior to assuming his position as leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis had spoken against recreational cannabis. He stated in 2013 in Buenos Aires: \"A reduction in the spread and influence of drug addiction will not be achieved by a liberalization of drug use.\" The catechism of the Catholic Church states that \"The use of drugs inflicts very grave damage on health and life. Their use, except on strictly therapeutic grounds, is a grave offense.\"\n\nIn The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there is general prohibition against intoxicating substances. In August 1915, the LDS Church banned the use of cannabis by its members. In 2016, the church's First Presidency urged members to oppose legalization of recreational cannabis use. The LDS Church says it has \"raised no objection to SB 89\" (non-psychoactive medical marijuana in Utah).\n\nThe Georgian Orthodox Church has resisted legalization of cannabis in that country.\n\nThe Arkansas Baptist State Convention voted to discourage medical marijuana in 2016. In 2016, the executive director of the Florida Baptist Convention, Tommy Green, also said that congregations should be encouraged to vote against expanded legalization of medical marijuana in Florida. The \nNational Evangelical Association of Belize opposed the 2017 decriminalization of cannabis in Belize.\n\nThe Assemblies of God USA, as well as other Pentecostal and holiness churches, have historically advocated abstinence from all alcohol, tobacco, and narcotics. Supporters of this view generally cite biblical passages enjoining respect for one's body as well as forbidding intoxication.\n\nOther Protestant churches have endorsed the legality of medical marijuana, including the Presbyterian Church (USA), United Methodist Church, United Church of Christ, and the Episcopal Church.\n\nDuring the Hindu festival of Holi, people consume \"bhang\" which contains cannabis flowers. According to one description, when the \"amrita\" (elixir of life) was produced from the churning of the ocean by the devas and the asuras, Shiva created cannabis from his own body to purify the elixir (whence, for cannabis, the epithet \"angaja\" or \"body-born\"). Another account suggests that the cannabis plant sprang up when a drop of the elixir dropped on the ground. Thus, cannabis is used by sages due to association with elixir and Shiva. \nIn Hinduism, wise drinking of \"bhang\" (which contains cannabis), according to religious rites, is believed to cleanse sins, unite one with Shiva and avoid the miseries of hell in the future life. It is also believed to have medicinal benefits. In contrast, foolish drinking of \"bhang\" without rites is considered a sin.\n\nThe Quran does not directly forbid cannabis; however, cannabis is deemed to be \"khamr\" (an intoxicant) by many religious scholars and therefore generally believed to be \"haraam\" (forbidden). A hadith by the prophet Mohammed states: \"If much intoxicates, then even a little is haraam.\" Despite these prohibitions, cannabis is consumed in many parts of the Islamic world, even sometimes in a religious context particularly within the Sufi mystic movement. In 1378 Soudoun Sheikouni, the Emir of the Joneima in Arabia, prohibited cannabis, considered one of the world's first-attested cannabis bans.\n\nThe Sufi tradition attributes the discovery of cannabis to Jafar Sharazi (Sheikh Haydar), a Sufi leader in the 12th century. Other Sufis attribute its origin to the apocryphal Khidr (\"Green Man\").\n\nSome modern Islamic leaders state that medical cannabis, but not recreational, is permissible in Islam. Imam Mohammad Elahi in Dearborn Heights, Michigan (United States), declared: \"Obviously, smoking marijuana for fun is wrong... It should be permissible only if that is the only option in a medical condition prescribed by medical experts.\"\n\nThough the argument has not been accepted by mainstream scholars, some writers have theorized that cannabis may have been used ritually in early Judaism, though these claims \"have been widely dismissed as erroneous\". Sula Benet (1967) claimed that the plant \"kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם\" mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the holy anointing oil of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis, although lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by Michael Zohary (1985), Hans Arne Jensen (2004) and James A. Duke (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either \"Acorus calamus\" or \"Cymbopogon citratus\".\n\nIn the modern era, Orthodox rabbi Moshe Feinstein stated in 1973 that cannabis was not permitted under Jewish law, due to its harmful effects. However Orthodox rabbis Efraim Zalmanovich (2013) and Chaim Kanievsky (2016) stated that medical, but not recreational, cannabis is kosher.\n\nIt is not known when Rastafari first claimed cannabis to be sacred, but it is clear that by the late 1940s Rastafari was associated with cannabis smoking at the Pinnacle community of Leonard Howell. Rastafari see cannabis as a sacramental and deeply beneficial plant that is the Tree of Life mentioned in the Bible. Peter Tosh, among many others, has quoted , \"... the herb is the healing of the nations.\" The use of cannabis, and particularly of long-stemmed water-pipes called chalices, is an integral part of what Rastafari call \"reasoning sessions\" where members join together to discuss life according to the Rasta perspective. They see the use of cannabis as bringing them closer to God (Jah), allowing the user to penetrate the truth of things more clearly.\n\nWhile it is not necessary to use cannabis to be a Rastafari, many use it regularly as a part of their faith, and pipes of cannabis are dedicated to His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I before being smoked. According to the anti-cult group the Watchman Fellowship \"The herb is the key to new understanding of the self, the universe, and God. It is the vehicle to cosmic consciousness\" and is believed to burn the corruption out of the human heart. Rubbing the ashes into the skin from smoked cannabis is also considered a healthy practice.\n\nPart of the Rastafari movement, elders of the 20th-century religious movement known as the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, consider cannabis to be the \"eucharist\", claiming it as an oral tradition from Ethiopia dating back to the time of Christ.\n\nScientology opposes the use of cannabis, and made \"Truth About Marijuana\" the focus of their 2016 World Health Day presentation.\n\nIn Sikhism, the First Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak, stated that using any mind altering substance (without medical purposes) is a distraction to keeping the mind clean of the name of God. According to the \"Sikh Rehat Maryada\", \"A Sikh must not take hemp (cannabis), opium, liquor, tobacco, in short any intoxicant. His only routine intake should be food and water\".\n\nHowever, there exists a tradition of Sikhs using edible cannabis, often in the form of the beverage bhang, particularly among the Sikh community known as Nihang.\n\nBeginning around the 4th century, Taoist texts mentioned using cannabis in censers. Needham cited the (ca. 570 AD) Taoist encyclopedia \"Wushang Biyao\" 無上秘要 (\"Supreme Secret Essentials\") that cannabis was added into ritual incense-burners, and suggested the ancient Taoists experimented systematically with \"hallucinogenic smokes\". The \"Yuanshi shangzhen zhongxian ji\" 元始上真眾仙記 (\"Records of the Assemblies of the Perfected Immortals\"), which is attributed to Ge Hong (283-343), says:\n\nLady Wei Huacun 魏華存 (252-334) and Xu Mi 許謐 (303-376) founded the Taoist Shangqing School. The Shangqing scriptures were supposedly dictated to Yang Xi 楊羲 (330-c. 386) in nightly revelations from immortals, and Needham proposed Yang was \"aided almost certainly by cannabis\". The \"Mingyi bielu\" 名醫別錄 (\"Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians\"), written by the Taoist pharmacologist Tao Hongjing (456-536), who also wrote the first commentaries to the Shangqing canon, says, \"Hemp-seeds (麻勃) are very little used in medicine, but the magician-technicians (\"shujia\" 術家) say that if one consumes them with ginseng it will give one preternatural knowledge of events in the future.\" A 6th-century AD Taoist medical work, the \"Wuzangjing\" 五臟經 (\"Five Viscera Classic\") says, \"If you wish to command demonic apparitions to present themselves you should constantly eat the inflorescences of the hemp plant.\"\n\nJoseph Needham connected myths about Magu, \"the Hemp Damsel\", with early Daoist religious usages of cannabis, pointing out that Magu was goddess of Shandong's sacred Mount Tai, where cannabis \"was supposed to be gathered on the seventh day of the seventh month, a day of seance banquets in the Taoist communities.\"\n\nOther religions have been founded in the past century that treat cannabis as a sacrament. They include the Santo Daime church, the THC Ministry, Cantheism, the Cannabis Assembly, the Church of Cognitive Therapy (COCT Ministry), Temple 420, Green Faith Ministries, the Church of Cognizance, the Church of the Universe, the Free Marijuana Church of Honolulu, the First Cannabis Church of Florida World Wide, the Free Life Ministry Church of Canthe, the Church of Higher Consciousness, and the federally tax-exempt inFormer Ministry Collective of Palms Springs, CA. The Temple of the True Inner Light believes that cannabis is one of the parts of God's body, along with the classical psychedelics: mescaline, psilocybin, LSD, and DMT. The First Church of Cannabis Inc. officially gained legal recognition in Indiana in 2015 following the passage of that state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Nonprofit religious organization Elevation Ministries opened its Denver headquarters, known as the International Church of Cannabis, on April 20, 2017.\n\nModern spiritual figures like Ram Dass openly acknowledge that the use of cannabis has allowed them to gain a more spiritual perspective and use the herb frequently for both its medicinal and mind-altering properties.\n\nIn Mexico, followers of the growing cult of Santa Muerte regularly use marijuana smoke in purification ceremonies, with marijuana often taking the place of incense used in mainstream Catholic rituals.\n\n\n\n"}

In monotheistic faiths references to God are used in constructs such as \"God's Chosen People\". The phenomenon of a \"chosen people\" is particularly common in the\nIsraelite tradition, where it originally referred to the Israelites—in fact Jews refer to this as a burden to spread the message of one God. Some claims of chosenness are based on parallel claims of Israelite ancestry, as is the case for the Christian Identity and Black Hebrew sects—both which claim themselves (and not Jews) to be the \"true Israel\". Others claim a \"spiritual\" chosenness, including most Christian denominations, who traditionally believe the church has replaced Israel as the People of God.\n\nAnthropologists commonly regard claims of chosenness as a form of ethnocentrism.\n\nIn Judaism, \"chosenness\" is the belief that the Jews, via descent from the ancient Israelites, are the chosen people, i.e. chosen to be in a covenant with God. The idea of the Israelites being chosen by God is found most directly in the Book of Deuteronomy as the verb \"bahar\" (), and is alluded to elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible using other terms such as \"holy people\". Much is written about these topics in rabbinic literature. The three largest Jewish denominations—Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism—maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose. Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah.\n\nIn Mormonism, all Latter Day Saints are viewed as covenant, or chosen, people because they have accepted the name of Jesus Christ through the ordinance of baptism. In contrast to supersessionism, Latter Day Saints do not dispute the \"chosen\" status of the Jewish people.\nMost practicing Mormons receive a patriarchal blessing that reveals their lineage in the House of Israel. This lineage may be blood related or through \"adoption;\" therefore, a child may not necessarily share the lineage of her parents (but will still be a member of the tribes of Israel). It is a widely held belief that most members of the faith are in the tribe of Ephraim or the tribe of Manasseh.\n\nThe Christian Identity movement sees the Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, Nordic and kindred peoples of the world as both the descendants of the ancient Israelites and the physical descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Christian Identity, though not organized as a religion, comprises certain individuals, churches and some prison gangs with a white supremacist theology\nthat promotes a racial interpretation of Christianity. Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who regarded Europeans as the \"chosen people\" and Jews as the cursed offspring of Cain. White supremacist sects and gangs later adopted many of these teachings.\n\nBased on Jewish biblical tradition and Ethiopian legend via Kebra Nagast, Rastas believe that Israel's King Solomon, together with Ethiopian Queen of Sheba, conceived a child which began the Solomonic line of kings in Ethiopia, rendering the Ethiopian people as the true children of Israel, and thereby chosen. Reinforcement of this belief occurred when Beta Israel, Ethiopia's ancient Israelite First Temple community, were rescued from Sudanese famine and brought to Israel during Operation Moses in 1985.\n\nSun Myung Moon taught that Korea is the chosen nation, selected to serve a divine mission and was \"chosen by God to be the birthplace of the leading figure of the age\" and was the birthplace of \"Heavenly Tradition\", ushering in God's kingdom.\n\nThe NOI teaches that black people constitute a nation and that through the institution of the Atlantic slave trade they were systematically denied knowledge of their history, language, culture, and religion and, in effect, lost control of their lives. Founder Elijah Muhammad called for the establishment of a separate nation for black Americans and the adoption of a religion based on the worship of Allah and on the belief that blacks were his chosen people.\n\n"}

The original version was one of dozens of works displayed as large outdoor posters in Jerusalem in 2001.\n\nVariations of this artwork have been used as bumper stickers and elements in rock concerts.\n\n, a Polish graphic designer based in Warsaw, had his original work chosen by a jury to be one of several dozen images to be displayed as x outdoor posters as part of a touring exhibit sponsored by the Museum on the Seam in Jerusalem. The exhibit opened to the public in Jerusalem in 2001.\n\nHis original image consisted of the word COEXIST in all capital letters, with the C replaced by an oversized Muslim Crescent, the X replaced by an oversized Star of David, and the T replaced by an oversized Latin Cross.\n\nDuring the international 2005–2006 Vertigo Tour of the Irish rock band U2, the original version of the image played a key role. Shortly after playing \"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\", the group would play politically-themed songs. During the opening portion of \"Love and Peace or Else\", Bono wore a white headband bearing a handwritten version of the word. In some venues, including Mexico City, the word was displayed on large electronic signs.\n\nThe image and variations of it are used as automobile bumper stickers.\n\nThe bumper stickers first began to emerge in the United States in the early 2000s in partial response to the military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan which began after the events of September 11, 2001. The stickers signify the capability or desire of humans to live together in peace.\n\nOne common version of the bumper sticker spells \"COEXIST\" using an Islamic crescent moon for the \"C\", a peace sign for the \"O\", a combination of the male symbol and female symbol for the \"E\", a Star of David for the \"X\", a pentagram for the dot of the \"I\", a yin-yang symbol for the \"S\", and a Christian cross for the \"T\". This version, designed by Jerry Jaspar, is perhaps the most common version of the bumper sticker.\n\nThe prevalence of the COEXIST bumper stickers has been noted in the Bay Area region centered on San Francisco. Users of the bumper stickers are often not practicing adherents of religion. This has led to one academic, Mark Coppenger, of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary to criticize the use of the symbol by atheists and to also question the ability of the bumper sticker to affect a wider audience.\n\nIn 2005, Młodożeniec and U2 were unaware of each other. They were also unaware that a company in Indiana already filed for a trademark in the United States in 2003. At the time, as there was no official U2 merchandise carrying this image, U2 fans created their own. The Indiana company filed suit against companies like Cafepress in May 2005 in an effort to stop unauthorized merchandise sales. Młodożeniec's attorneys maintained that he owned the copyright to the image. Separately, The Museum on the Seam, which sponsored the competition in which the original image first appeared in public, claimed legal rights to the image.\n\nThe following table shows the individual characters of the more well-known versions, either as Unicode characters, icons, or descriptions.\n\n\nThe popularity of the bumper stickers has spawned several anti-Muslim responses, including one with the image of the crescent altered with the addition of explosives.\n\nThere are several anti-religious parodies, spelling out words such as 'Toxic', 'Fiction' and 'Contradict'.\n\nOther parodies include a Communist hammer and sickle for the \"E\" and a swastika for the \"X\", indicating the dangers inherent in all ideologies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7159198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7159198", "title": "Compensationism", "text": "Compensationism\n\nCompensationism is one of several theological doctrines, opposed to Probabilism.\n\nCompensationism maintains that a doubtful law is not devoid of all binding force, and that there must be a compensating reason, proportionate to the probability and gravity of the law, to justify the performance of the action which is probably forbidden. This teaching is based on an analogy with an act which has two effects, one good and the other bad. It is not lawful to perform such an act unless there is a justifying cause proportionate to the evil. In the case of a doubtful law the bad effect is the danger of material sin, and the good effect is the benefit, which arises from the performance of the action which is probably forbidden. Hence in this as in the former case, a compensating cause, proportionate to the probable evil, is required to justify the performance of the action.\n\nProbabilists reply that this moral system leads to Tutiorism, because it implies that if no compensating benefit exists, it is not lawful to perform an action so long as it certainly is not forbidden. Again, Probabilists say that the preservation of liberty is of itself a sufficient compensating reason when there is question of a law which is not certain. Finally, Probabilists are prepared to admit that, as a point of expediency though not of obligation, it is advisable to look for a compensating cause over and above the preservation of liberty when a confessor is directing penitents in the use of probable opinions. If no such compensating reason exists, the penitent can be advised, though not under pain of sin, to abstain from the performance of the action which is probably forbidden.\n\n\n"}

Critics also commonly claim that Zoroastrians are worshipers of other deities and elements of nature, such as of fire—with one prayer, the Litany to the fire (Atesh Niyaesh), stating: \"I invite, I perform (the worship) of you, the Fire, O son of Ahura Mazdā together with all fires\"—and Mithra. Some critics have charged Zoroastrians with being followers of dualism, who only claimed to be followers of monotheism in modern times to confront the powerful influence of Christian and Western thought which \"hailed monotheism as the highest category of theology.\" Critics insist that the monotheistic reformist view is seen to contradict the conservative (or traditional) view of a dualistic worldview most evident in the relationship between Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu. and arguing that Zoroastrians follow a belief system influenced by henotheism. Other Western scholars such as Martin Haug, however, have dismissed the concept of theological dualism as a corruption of Zoroaster's original teachings, gradually added by later adherents of the faith. Critics add that the fact that such differing views have proliferated are a sign of the enigmatic nature of the Zoroastrian beliefs regarding the divinity.\n\nZoroastrian reformers, such as Maneckji Nusserwanji Dhalla, have argued that literary precedence should be given to the Gathas, as a source of authority and textual authenticity. They have also deplored and criticized many Zoroastrian rituals (e.g. excessive ceremonialism and focus on purity, using \"bull's urine for ritual cleansing, the attendance of a dog to gaze at the corpse during funerary rites, the exposure of corpses on towers [for consumption by vultures and ravens]\") and theological and cosmological doctrines as not befitting of the faith. This \"orthodox\" versus \"reformist\" controversy rages even on the internet.\n\nDivisions and tensions also exist between Iranian and Indian Zoroastrians and over such issues as the authority of a hereditary priesthood in the transmission and interpretation of the faith, ethnicity and the nature of Ahura Mazda. Historically, differences also existed between the Zoroastrian branches of Zurvanism, Mazdakism and Mazdaism.\n\nMuch like the question of who is a Jew?, Zoroastrian identity, especially whether it is adopted through birth or belief (or both), \"remains a cause for tension\" within the community. Reformers have criticised the orthodox refusal to accept religious converts as one reason for the communities' declining population.\n\nZoroastrians have been criticized by Muslim authors for their rejection of predestination. This follows a famous hadith of Muhammad in which he negatively associates the Qadariyah Islamic sect with the Magians.\n\nZoroastrianism has been criticized for the perception that it promotes a patriarchal system, expressed through such avenues as an all-male priesthood and its historical allowance of polygamy—practiced by Zoroaster himself.\n"}

The BBC aired his \"Dave Allen Show\" 1972–1986, which was also exported to several other European countries. His career had a major resurgence during the late 1980s and early 1990s. At the height of his career he was Britain's most controversial comedian, regularly provoking indignation at his frequent highlighting of political hypocrisy and disregard for religious authority. His television shows were also broadcast in the United States, Canada, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nDavid Tynan O'Mahony was born in Firhouse, Dublin, Ireland, the youngest of three sons of Gerard \"Cully\" Tynan O'Mahony, managing editor of \"The Irish Times\", and an English mother, Jean Archer. His brothers were John and Peter. O'Mahony left school aged 16, after attending the secondary school at Newbridge College, Terenure College and the Catholic University School, and followed his father into journalism. He joined the \"Drogheda Argus\" as a copy boy, but at the age of 19 went to London.\n\nHe drifted through a series of jobs, before becoming a Butlins Redcoat at Skegness in a troupe that also included the British jazz trumpeter and writer John Chilton. At the end of each summer season he did stand-ups at strip clubs and for the next four years appeared in night clubs, theatres and working men's clubs. When entertainment work was slow he sold toys in a Sheffield store and also worked as a door-to-door draught-excluder salesman. He changed his stage surname to \"Allen\" on the prompting of his agent, who believed that few people in Britain could pronounce \"O'Mahony\" correctly. Allen himself hoped that a surname beginning with \"A\" would put him at the top of any agent's list.\n\nAllen lost the top of his left forefinger above the middle knuckle after catching it in a machine cog. However, he enjoyed inventing stories to explain the loss, which became a minor part of his act. One version was that his brother John had surprised him by snapping his jaw shut when they were children, resulting in him biting it off. A further explanation he gave on his programme, \"Dave Allen at Large\", was that he often stuck his finger in his whiskey glass, and it had been eaten away by strong drink. He also said it was worn away from repeatedly brushing the dust from his suit. One of his stand-up jokes was that, when he was a boy, he and his friends would go see a cowboy movie at the local cinema, then come out all ready to play Cowboys and Indians. Staring down at his truncated finger, he would mutter, \"I had a sawn-off shotgun.\" On his show he told a long, elaborate ghost story, ending with \"something evil\" attacking Allen in a dark and haunted house. Allen grabbed and bit the attacker, the studio lights came back up, and it was his own left hand.\n\nAllen's first television appearance was on the BBC talent show \"New Faces\" in 1959. He hosted pop music shows in the early 1960s, including tours by Adam Faith and Helen Shapiro, and in early 1963 was the compère of a tour of Britain, headlined by Shapiro, that also included The Beatles, then starting to become well known. In 1962 he had toured South Africa with American vaudeville star Sophie Tucker, whom he described as \"one of the most charming and delightful performers with whom I have ever worked\". Tucker was impressed with him and suggested that he try his luck in Australia. Moving there, he worked with Digby Wolfe on Australian television, becoming Wolfe's resident comedian.\n\nWhile on tour in Australia in 1963, he quickly proved successful and accepted an offer to headline a television talk show with Channel 9, \"Tonight with Dave Allen\", which was also successful. However, only six months after his television début he was banned from the Australian airwaves when, during a live broadcast, he told his show's producer—who had been pressing him to go to a commercial break—to \"go away and masturbate\", so that he could continue an entertaining interview with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. The ban was dropped quietly as Allen's popularity continued unabated.\n\nAllen returned to the United Kingdom in 1964 and made a number of appearances on ITV, including \"The Blackpool Show\" and \"Val Parnell's Sunday Night at the London Palladium\", and on the BBC on \"The Val Doonican Show\". In 1967 he hosted his own comedy/chat series, \"Tonight with Dave Allen\", made by ATV, which earned him the Variety Club's ITV Personality of the Year Award.\n\nHe signed with the BBC in 1968 and appeared on \"The Dave Allen Show\", a variety/comedy sketch series. This was followed from 1971-79 by \"Dave Allen at Large\". The theme tune for \"The Dave Allen Show\" and \"Dave Allen at Large\", written by Alan Hawkshaw, was \"Blarney's Stoned\" (originally recorded for KPM in 1969 under the title \"Studio 69\").\n\nThe shows introduced his solo joke-telling-while-sitting-on-a-stool-and-drinking routine. This stand-up routine by Allen led to sketches that continued the themes touched on in the preceding monologues. Meanwhile, he began to appear in theatre. In 1972 he acted as a doctor in the Royal Court's production of Edna O'Brien's play \"A Pagan Place\". With family friend Maggie Smith in the lead, he appeared in \"Peter Pan\" in a run during 1973 and 1974. Allen played the roles of Mr Darling and Captain Hook in the production at the London Coliseum. Allen made \"The Dave Allen Show in Australia\" (1975–1977) for his old employers, Channel 9.\n\nAllen was also a social commentator, appearing in several television documentaries for ITV, beginning with \"Dave Allen in the Melting Pot\" (1969), looking at life in New York City and dealing with issues such as racism and drugs. Later programmes included \"Dave Allen in Search of the Great English Eccentric\" (1974) and \"Eccentrics at Play\" (1974), in which he looked at colourful characters with idiosyncratic passions. \"Both the BBC and Dave Allen received death threats from the IRA and the Provisional IRA\" \nAllen's satirizing of religious ritual, especially Catholic, throughout each episode of \"Dave Allen at Large\" caused minor controversy, which - coupled with sometimes comparatively frank material - earned the show a risqué reputation. In 1977 the Irish state broadcaster RTÉ placed a \"de facto\" ban on Allen. Routines included sketches showing the Pope (played by Allen) and his cardinals doing a striptease to music (\"The Stripper\") on the steps of St Peter's, aggressive priests beating their parishioners and other priests, priests who spoke like Daleks through electronic confessionals, and an extremely excitable Pope who spoke in a Chico Marx style accent as he ordered Allen to \"getta your bum outta Roma!\" In 1979 he played a troubled property man suffering a mid-life crisis in Alan Bennett's television play \"One Fine Day\". New seasons of the comedy series, now titled \"Dave Allen\", were broadcast from 1981 until 1990.\n\nHis final series for the BBC in 1990 caused controversy with a joke:\n\nThis prompted MP Robert Hayward to ask a parliamentary question about \"offensive language\" in broadcasting. In 1993 Allen returned to ITV, where he starred in the \"Dave Allen Show\", which was his final regular television series.\n\nBy the late 1990s Allen was living quietly in semi-retirement at home in Holland Park, west London. A keen amateur artist, he continued to exhibit his paintings. He had given up cigarettes in the 1980s, having smoked regularly during earlier television appearances. A comedy skit in 1994 talked not only about quitting smoking but hating the smell of smoke. The 90s saw him make occasional chat show appearances and discuss his career in the six-part \"The Unique Dave Allen\" (BBC, 1998), in between clips from his past BBC series.\n\nAs he grew older, he brought a rueful awareness of aging to his material, with reflections on the antics of teenagers and the sagging skin and sprouting facial hair of age. He was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the British Comedy Awards in 1996.\n\nAllen's act was typified by a relaxed, rueful and intimate style. He sat on a high bar stool facing his audience, smoking and occasionally sipping from a glass of what he always allowed people to assume was whiskey but in fact was merely ginger ale with ice. He was a sober-minded man, and although he sometimes appeared crotchety and irritable on stage he always gave off an air of charm and serene melancholy, both in his act and in real life. Each day he pored over newspapers, scribbling notes and ideas for his routines. Along with his seated stand-up routines his television shows were interspersed with filmed sketch comedy.\n\nHe was a religious sceptic (according to Allen, \"what you might call a practising atheist\", and often joked, \"I'm an atheist, thank God\") as a result of his deeply held objections to the rigidity of his strict Catholic schooling. Consequently religion became an important subject for his humour, especially the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England, generally mocking church customs and rituals rather than beliefs. In 1998 he explained:\nThe hierarchy of everything in my life has always bothered me. I'm bothered by power. People, whoever they might be, whether it's the government, or the policeman in the uniform, or the man on the door—they still irk me a bit. From school, from the first nun that belted me—people used to think of the nice sweet little ladies—they used to knock the fuck out of you, in the most cruel way that they could. They'd find bits of your body that were vulnerable to intense pain—grabbing you by the ear, or by the nose, and lift you, and say 'Don't cry!' It's very hard not to cry. I mean, not from emotion, but pain. The priests were the same. And I sit and watch politicians with great cynicism, total cynicism.\nAt the end of his act Allen always raised his glass and quietly toasted his audience with the words \"Goodnight, thank you, and may your God go with you.\"\n\nHighly regarded in Britain, Allen's comic technique and style had a lasting influence on many young British comedians. His targets were often figures of authority, his style was observational rather than gag-driven, and his language frequently ripe; as such he was a progenitor for the \"alternative\" comedians of the 1980s. In his native Ireland, he always remained somewhat controversial. His mocking of the Catholic Church made him unpopular amongst some Irish Catholics, while his mocking of the Ulster Protestant leader Ian Paisley made him unpopular amongst many Protestants in Northern Ireland. \n\nIn a 2017 interview with Howard Stern, Adam Sandler attributed Dave Allen as one of his first comedic influences when he saw his act at the Nevele hotel at the age of 10.\n\nIn 1964 Allen married actress Judith Stott, whom he had met in Australia. The marriage ended in divorce in 1983. Their son, Edward James Tynan O'Mahony (professionally Ed Allen), is also a comedian.\n\nAllen's hobbies included painting, which he became increasingly enthusiastic about in his later years. His first exhibition, \"Private Views\", was held in Edinburgh in 2001. \n\nHe died peacefully in his sleep as a result of Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome at his home in Kensington, London, on 10 March 2005 at the age of 68. He was survived by Karin Tynan O'Mahony (née Stark), his wife of 18 months who had been his partner since 1986, and his three children from his first marriage: his children Edward and Jane, and stepson Jonathan, a son of his first wife. Three weeks after Allen's death Karin gave birth to their son, Cullen.\n\nA dramatisation of Allen's life and career, entitled \"Dave Allen At Peace\", was shown on RTÉ One and BBC Two in 2018, with Aidan Gillen portraying the comedian.\n\n\n"}

As the title suggests, the ballad takes as its primary focus the coronation of William III of England and his consort Mary II of England, which took place in February 1689 (even though the ballad claims it took place in 1688. This is most likely a typographical error on the part of the composer or the printer). William III and Mary II's coregency marked the end of the Glorious Revolution and the reign of James II of England. The coregency also brought about a shift in the religious paradigm of 17th-century England, which was Roman Catholic when James II sat upon the throne. Indeed, the ballad comments on the \"vile pop'ry\" that ruled the throne prior to the rule of William III, which saw the restoration of Protestant liberty. Extant copies of the ballad are available at Magdelene College in the Pepys Library. Alternatively, online facsimiles of the ballad are available online for public consumption.\n\nSet to the tune of \"Hark the Thundering Cannons Roar,\" the ballad opens with an encomium directed toward King William III: \"Now the Royal deed is done, / King William’s seated on the Throne, / and we his Subjects justly own, / He was our preservation.\" The ballad goes on to explicate what it means for England's religious state now that William III is \"seated on the throne\": \"The Glories of our Court are clear, / Now Rome’s dark Clouds all disappear / And shall no more o’re-cast us here, / nor send their priests to fool us. ... [O]ur brave Prince William came, / Who smote the Babylonian Dame, / And brough her Tod-pole Tools to shame, / redeem’d us all from Slav’ry\" As the ballad makes clear, the ascension of William and Mary meant that Catholicism, the \"Babylonian Dame\" mentioned in these lines, was once again no longer the official religion of England. The ballad concludes as most encomium ballads do, which is to say with general praise of the subject: \"May they all delights obtain, / Prove happy in a prosp’rous Reign, / And e’ery thing they wish for gain, / and prove to them a blessing.\"\n\nThe ballad is broken up into eight octets with varying rhyme schemes. For instance, the first stanza has an \"AA BB CCC B\" rhyme scheme while the second stanza has an \"AAA B CCC B\" rhyme scheme.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54347291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54347291", "title": "Expulsion of Jews from Spain", "text": "Expulsion of Jews from Spain\n\nThe expulsion of the Jews from Spain was ordered in 1492 by the Catholic Monarchs ruling Castile and Aragon through the Edict of Granada with the purpose, according to the decree, of preventing them from influencing \"New Christians\", Jews and their descendants who had under duress converted to Christianity. The decision to expel the Jews—or to prohibit the practice of Judaism—followed the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition in the Crowns of Castile and Aragon to weed out the conversos who continued practising their old faith. Historian Julio Valdeón wrote, \"undoubtedly the expulsion of the Jews from the Iberian site is one of the most controversial issues of all that have happened throughout the history of Spain\". French hispanist Joseph Pérez highlighted the similarities that exist between this expulsion and the persecution of the Jews in Hispania visigoda almost a thousand years earlier.\n\nIn 2015 the Spanish Parliament passed a law recognizing as Spanish those presumed to be descendants of the Jews expelled in 1492, thereby annulling the consequences of that expulsion.\n\nUntil the fourteenth century the Jews who lived under the Muslim caliphates of Al-Andalus were tolerated.\n\nOn January 2, 1492, the Catholic Monarchs conquered the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada. The last Muslim king, Boabdil, withdrew to the Alpujarras after almost 800 years of Muslim rule were ended by the Reconquista.\n\nA letter sent by the Catholic Monarchs to the Council of Bilbao in 1490 stated that under canon law and according to the laws of the kingdoms, the Jews are tolerated and allowed to live in the kingdoms as subjects and vassals. Joseph Pérez said \"one must discard the commonly accepted idea of a Spain where members of the three religions of the Book—Christians, Muslims and Jews—would have lived together peacefully during the first two centuries of Al-Andalus, and later in the Christian Reconquest of Spain in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Tolerance implies not discriminating against minorities and respecting their difference, and between the eighth and fifteenth centuries we find nothing on the peninsula like tolerance.\" He states that communities of Christians, Jews and Muslims had never lived In the Christian kingdoms. According to Henry Kamen, Jews and Muslims were treated \"with contempt\". And the Jews were treated with disdain. Three communities \"lived separate stocks.\"\n\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Christian anti-Judaism in the medieval West was intensified, which is reflected in the harsh anti-Jewish measures agreed in the Lateran Council celebrated in 1215 at the behest of the Pope Innocent III. The peninsular Christian kingdoms were by no means foreign to the growth of increasingly belligerent anti-Judaism—in the Castilian code of Siete Partidas it was said that the Jews lived among Christians \"so that their presence would remind that they descended from those who crucified Our Lord Jesus Christ\"—but the kings continued to \"protect\" the Jews for the important role they played in their kingdoms.\n\nIn the fourteenth century the period of \"tolerance\" towards the Jews was over, passing into a phase of increasing conflicts. According to Joseph Perez, \"the changing times are not the mentalities, the circumstances. The good times of Spain of the three religions had coincided with a phase of territorial, demographic and economic expansion, Jews and Christians did not compete in the labor market: both one and the other contributed to the general prosperity and shared their benefits. The militant of the Church and the friars hardly found an echo. Of the fourteenth century, the wars and natural catastrophes that precede and follow the Black Plague create a new situation. ... [People] believe themselves to be the victim of a curse, punished for sins they would have committed. It invites the faithful to repent, to change their behavior and to return to God. This is when the presence of the \"deicidal people\" among Christians is considered scandalous.\n\nThe first wave of violence against the Jews in the Iberian Peninsula occurred in the Kingdom of Navarre as a consequence of the arrival in 1321 of the crusade of the shepherds from the other side of the Pyrenees. The Jewry of Pamplona and Estella are massacred. Two decades later the impact of the Black Death of 1348 provokes assaults on the juderías of several places, especially those of Barcelona and other places in the Principality of Catalonia. In the Crown of Castile anti-Jewish violence is closely related to the Civil War of the reign of Pedro I in which the side that supported Enrique de Trastámara used anti-Judaism as a propaganda weapon, and the pretender accused his stepbrother, King Peter, of favoring the Jews. Thus the first slaughter of Jews, in Toledo in 1355, was carried out by the supporters of Enrique de Trastámara when they entered the city. The same happened eleven years later when they occupied Briviesca. In Burgos, Jews who could not pay the large tribute imposed on them in 1366 were reduced to slavery and sold. In Valladolid the Jewry was assaulted in 1367 to the shout of \"Long live King Henry!\". There were no deaths, but the synagogues were burned down.\nBut the great catastrophe for the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula took place in 1391 when massacres took place in the juderías of the Crowns of Castile and of Aragon. The assaults, the fires, the looting and the massacres begin in June in Seville, where Ferrand Martinez, archdeacon of Écija, taking advantage of the power vacuum created by the death of the archbishop of Seville, hardened his preaching against the Jews that had begun in 1378, and ordered the overthrow of the synagogues and requisitioning of prayer books. In January of 1391, a first attempt of assault on the Jewish quarter was avoided by the municipal authorities, but in June hundreds of Jews were murdered, their houses ransacked, and the synagogues converted into churches. Some Jews managed to escape; others, terrified, asked to be baptized.\n\nFrom Seville anti-Jewish violence extended throughout Andalusia, and then extended to Castile. In August it reached the Crown of Aragon. Murders, looting and fires took place everywhere. Many of the Jews who survived fled, many to the kingdoms of Navarre and of Portugal, France, and North Africa. Others accepted baptism to avoid death. The number of victims is difficult to know. About 400 Jews were murdered in Barcelona; in Valencia 250; In Lérida 68 ... \n\nAfter the massacres of 1391, anti-Jewish measures were intensified: in 1411 Castile ordered that Jews wear a red badge sewn to their clothing. In the Crown of Aragon the possession of the Talmud was declared unlawful, and the number of synagogues per aljama is limited to one. In addition, the mendicant orders, with the support of the monarchs, intensified their campaign of proselytism, in which Valencian Vincent Ferrer played a prominent part, to convert Jews to Christianity. It was also decreed that Jews were obliged to attend three sermons every year. As a result of the massacres of 1391 and the measures that followed, by 1415 more than half of the Jews of Castile and Aragon had renounced the Mosaic law and had been baptized, including many rabbis and important members of the community.\n\nAfter the massacres of 1391 and the preaching that followed them, by 1415 scarcely a hundred thousand Jews continued to practice their religion in the crowns of Castile and Aragon. Joseph Perez said, \"Spanish Judaism will never recover from this catastrophe.\" The Jewish community \"came out of the crisis not only physically diminished but morally and intellectually shattered\".\n\nIn the Crown of Aragon, Judaism in important places such as Barcelona, Valencia and Palma virtually disappeared—in 1424 the Barcelona Jewry was abolished because it was considered unnecessary— and only the Zaragoza one remained. In Castile aljamas once flourishing such as those of Seville, Toledo or Burgos lost much of their members; in 1492, the year of the expulsion, in the Crown of Aragon only a quarter of the former number of Jews remained. The famous Jewish community of Gerona, for example, was left with only 24 families. In the Crown of Castile not 80,000 were left. In Seville before the revolts of 1391 there were about 500 Jewish families. According to Joseph Perez, at the time of the expulsion there were fewer than 150,000 Jews, distributed in 35 aljamas of the Crown of Aragon and 216 in the Crown of Castile. In both Crowns it was observed that the Jews had left the great cities and lived in the small and the rural areas, less exposed \"to the excesses of the Christians.\"\nAfter the critical period of 1391-1415, the pressure on Jews recovering their synagogues and books confiscated decreased, and they became able to avoid certain obligations such as carrying the red ribbon or attending friars' sermons. They could also reconstruct the internal organization of the aljamas and their religious activities, thanks to the agreements reached by the procurators of the aljamas gathered in Valladolid in 1432 and sanctioned by the king, which means that \"the Crown of Castile accepts again officially that a minority of its subjects has another religion than the Christian one and recognizes the right of this minority to exist legally, with a legal status.\" \"In this way the Jewish community is rebuilt with the approval of the crown.\" Abraham Beneviste, who presided over the meeting of Valladolid, was appointed court rabbi with authority over all the Jews of the kingdom, and at the same time as delegate of the king over them.\n\nDuring the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, in the last quarter of the 15th century, many Jews lived in rural villages and engaged in agricultural activities. Crafts and trade were not monopolized—international trade had passed into the hands of converts. While Jews continued to trade as money-lenders, the number of Christian lenders had increased a lot. Jews also continued to collect royal, ecclesiastical and seigniorial rents, but their importance had also diminished—in Castile they were only in charge of a quarter of the revenues. However, in the court of Castile—but not Aragon—Jews held important administrative and financial positions. Abraham Senior was from 1488 treasurer-major of the Holy Brotherhood, a key organism in the financing of the war of Grenada, and also chief rabbi of Castile. Yucé Abravanel was \"A greater collector of the service and mountaineering of the herds, one of the more healthy income and greater yield of the Crown of Castile.\" However, according to Joseph Perez, the role of the Jews in the court must not be exaggerated. \"The truth was that the state could do without the Jews, both in the bureaucratic apparatus and in the management of the estate.\"\nWe must therefore reject the claim that the Hebrew community at the end of the fifteenth century was immensely rich and influential. \"In fact, the Spanish Jews at the time of their expulsion did not form a homogeneous social group. There were among them classes as in Christian society, a small minority of very rich and well-placed men, together with a mass of small people: Farmers, artisans, shopkeepers.\" What united them was that they practiced the same faith, different from the one recognized, which made them a separate community within the monarchy and which was \"property\" of the crown which thereby protected them. In a letter dated 7 July, 1477, addressed to the authorities of Trujillo, where incidents had occurred against the Jews, Queen Isabella I of Castile, after putting the aljama under her protection and prohibiting all type of oppression or humiliation against its members, states:\n\nThus, the Jews \"formed not a State in the State, but rather a micro-society next to the majority Christian society, with an authority [the rabbi greater] that the crown delegated to him over its members.\" The aljamas were organized internally with a wide margin of autonomy. They designated by lottery the council of elders that governed the life of the community; collecting their own taxes for the maintenance of worship, synagogues, and rabbinical teaching; lived under the norms of Jewish law, and had their own courts that understood all cases in civil matters - from the Cortes de Madrigal of 1476 criminal cases had passed to the royal courts. But Jews did not enjoy the fullness of civil rights: they had a specific tax system far more burdensome than that of Christians and were excluded from positions that could confer authority on Christians.\n\nThe situation in which the Jews lived, according to Joseph Perez, posed two problems: \"as subjects and vassals of the king, the Jews had no guarantee for the future - the monarch could at any time close the autonomy of the aljamas or require new Most important taxes-\"; and, above all, \"in these late years of the Middle Ages, when a state of modern character is being developed, there could be no question of a problem of immense importance: was the existence of separate and autonomous communities compatible with the demands of A modern state? This was the real question.\"\n\nIn the fifteenth century, the main problem stopped being the Jews to become the conversos, whose number according to Joseph Perez would probably be close to two hundred thousand people. Christian convert was applied to the Jews who had been baptized and their descendants. As many of them had done it by force they were always looked upon with distrust by those who will call themselves Old Christians.\nIn the fifteenth century the positions abandoned by the Jews were mostly occupied by the converts, who concentrated there where the Jewish communities had flourished before 1391. They dealt with the activities formerly performed by the Jews - trade, the handicraft - and now with the added advantage that as Christians they can access trades and professions that were previously forbidden to the Jews. Some even enter the clergy becoming canon so prior is and even bishops.\n\nThe social rise of the converts was viewed with suspicion by the \"old\" Christians, a resentment that was accentuated by the conscience on the part of those who had a differentiated identity, proud of being Christians and having Jewish ancestry, which was the lineage of Christ. Thus popular revolts broke out against the converts between 1449 and 1474, when in Castile lived a period of economic difficulties and political crisis (especially during the civil war of the reign of Henry IV). The first and most important of these revolts was the one that took place in 1449 in Toledo, during which a \"Judgment-Statute\" was approved that prohibited the access to the municipal positions of \"no confesso of the lineage of the Jews\" - an antecedent of the following blood-cleaning statutes of the following century. The origin of the revolts was economic in Andalusia especially there was a situation of hunger, aggravated by an epidemic of plague - and in principle \"not directed especially against the converts.\" It is the parties and the demagogues that take advantage of the exasperation of the people and direct it against the converts.\"\nIn order to justify the attacks on the converts, it is affirmed that they are false Christians and that they are still practicing the Jewish religion in secret. According to Joseph Perez, it is a proven fact that, among those who converted to escape the blind furor of the masses in 1391, or by the pressure of the proselytizing campaigns of the early fifteenth century, some clandestinely returned to their old faith when It seemed that the danger had passed, of which it is said that \"Judaízan.\" The accusation of Crypto-Judaism becomes more plausible when some cases of prominent converts who continued to observe the Jewish rites after their conversion. But Joseph Judaizers, according to Joseph Perez, were a minority, although relatively important. The same affirms Henry Kamen when he says that \"it can be affirmed that in the end of the 1470’s there was no Judaizing movement highlighted or proven among the converts.\" He also points out that when a convert was accused of judaizing, in many cases the \"proofs\" that were brought were in fact cultural elements of his Jewish ancestry - such as the Sabbath, not Sunday, as the day of rest - or the lack of knowledge of the new faith - such as not knowing the creed or eating meat in Lent - \n\nThis is how the \"convergent problem\" is born. The baptized can not renounce their faith according to the canonical doctrine of the Church by which Crypto-Judaism is assimilated to heresy, and as such must be punished. This is how they begin to claim various voices including those of some converts who do not want to question the sincerity of their baptism because of those \"false\" Christians who are beginning to be called Marrano. And it also extends the idea that the presence of the Jews among the Christians is what invites the converts to continue practicing the Law of Moses.\n\nWhen in 1474 she acceded to the throne, married to the heir of the Crown of Aragon, the future Ferdinand II of Aragon, crypto-Judaism was not punished, \"not, of course, by tolerance Or indifference, but because they lacked appropriate legal instruments to characterize this type of crime. \"Thus, when they decide to confront the \"converso problem\", especially after the prior of the Dominicans of Seville, Fray Alonso de Ojeda, in 1475 sent them an alarming report on the number of converts who in that city judaízan, even in an open way, are addressed to Pope Sixtus IV to authorize them to appoint inquisitors in their kingdoms, which the pontiff grants them by the Bull \"Exigit sincerae devotionis\" of November 1, 1478. \"With the creation of the tribunal of the Inquisition, the authorities will have the instrument and the means of in \"According to Joseph Perez, Ferdinand and Isabella\" were convinced that the Inquisition would compel the converts to integrate definitively: the day when all new Christians renounced Judaism nothing would distinguish them from the other members of the social body.\"\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Isabel and Ferdinand were concerned to protect the Jews - since they were \"property\" of the crown. For example, on September 6, 1477, in a letter addressed to the Jewish community of Seville, Queen Elizabeth I gave assurances about her safety:\nBut the Catholic Monarchs could not do away with all the vexations and discrimination suffered by the Jews, encouraged on many occasions by the preaching of the friars of the mendicant orders. They then made the decision to segregate the Jews to end the conflict. Already in the Cortes of Madrigal of 1476 the kings had protested by the breach of the provisions in the Order of 1412 on the Jews - prohibition to wear luxury dresses; Obligation to wear a red slice on the right shoulder; prohibition to hold positions with authority over Christians, to have Christian servants, to lend money at usurious interest, etc. - but in the Cortes de Toledo of 1480 they decided to go much further to fulfill these norms: to force the Jews to live In separate quarters, from where they could not leave except during the day to carry out their professional occupations. Until then the Jewish quarters-where the Jews used to live and where they had their synagogues, butchers, etc.-had not formed a separate world in the cities and there were also Christians living in them and Jews living outside them. From 1480 onwards, the Jewish quarters were converted into ghettos surrounded by walls and the Jews were confined in them to avoid confusion and damage of our holy faith. A process for which a term of two years was established, but which lasted for more than ten years, and which was not exempt from problems and abuses by Christians.\nThe text approved by the Cortes, which also included the Mudejar, read as follows:\nThe decision of the kings approved by the Courts of Toledo, had antecedents since the Jews already had been confined in some Castilian localities like Cáceres or Soria. In this last locality had been realized with the approval of the kings \"to avoid dapnos [sic] that because of bevir and to dwell and to be the Jews among the christianos they followed\". Fray Hernando de Talavera, confessor of the queen and who had opposed the use of force to solve the \"convergent problem\", also justified the segregation \"by avoiding many sins, which are followed of the mixture and a great deal of familiarity [between Christians and Jews] and of not keeping everything close to their conversation with Christians by holy canons and civil laws is ordered and commanded.\"\n\nAccording to Joseph Perez, with the decision to detain Jews in ghettos, it was not only a question of separating them from Christians and of protecting them, but also of imposing a series of obstacles on them in the development of their activities, so that they would not have more remedy \"than to give up their status as Jews if they want to lead a normal existence. Their conversion is not demanded - not yet - nor is their autonomous statute touched, but they proceed with them in such a way that they end up convincing themselves that the only solution is conversion.\"\n\nThe first inquisitors appointed by the kings arrived in Seville in November 1480, \"immediately sowing terror\". In the first years and only for this city they dictate 700 death sentences and more than five thousand \"reconciliations\" - that is, prison sentences, exile or simple penances - that are accompanied by the confiscation of their property and the disqualification For public office and ecclesiastical benefits.\n\nIn their inquiries the inquisitors discovered that for a long time many converts had met with their Jewish relatives to celebrate Jewish holidays and even attend synagogues. This convinces them that they will not be able to put an end to crypto-Judaism if converts continue to maintain contact with the Jews, for example: what they ask the kings to be expelled from Andalusia. These approve and in 1483 give a period of six months for the Jews of the dioceses of Seville, Cordoba and Cadiz to go to Extremadura. There are doubts as to whether the order was strictly enforced since at the time of the final expulsion in 1492 some chroniclers speak of the fact that eight thousand families of Andalusia embarked in Cadiz and others in Cartagena and in the ports of the Crown of Aragon. On the other hand, the expulsion of the Jews of Saragossa and Teruel was also proposed, but in the end it was not carried out.\n\nAccording to Julio Valdeón, the decision to expel the Jews from Andalusia also obeyed \"the desire to move them away from the border between the crown of Castile and the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, scenario, during the eighties of the fifteenth century And the first years of the 1990s, of the war that ended with the disappearance of the last stronghold of peninsular Islam.\n\nOn March 31, 1492, shortly after the end of the Granada war, the Catholic Kings signed the decree of expulsion of the Jews in Granada, which was sent to all the cities, towns and lordships of their kingdoms with orders strict to not read it or make it public until May 1. It is possible that some prominent Jews tried to nullify or soften it but did not have any success. Among these Jews stands out Isaac Abravanel who offered King Ferdinand a considerable sum of money. According to a well-known legend when the Inquisitor General Tomas de Torquemada found out, he presented himself before the king and threw a crucifix at his feet, saying: \"Judas sold our Lord for thirty pieces of silver; His Majesty is about to sell it again for thirty thousand.\" According to the Israeli historian Benzion Netanyahu, quoted by Julio Valdeón, when Abravanel met with the Queen Isabella, she said to him: \"'Do you think this comes from me? The Lord has put that thought into the heart of the King?\"\n\nA few months before a car of faith held in Avila in which three converts and two Jews condemned by the Inquisition were burnt alive for an alleged crime of ritual crime against a Christian child (who will be known as the [Child of the Guard] contributed to create the propitious environment for the expulsion.\n\nThe Catholic Kings had precisely entrusted to the [inquisitor general] Tomás de Torquemada and its collaborators the writing of the decree fixing to them, according to the historian Luis Suarez, three previous conditions Which would be reflected in the document: to justify the expulsion by charging Jews with two sufficiently serious offenses - usury and \"heretical practice\"; That there should be sufficient time for Jews to choose between baptism or exile; And that those who remained faithful to the Mosaic law could dispose of their movable and immovable property, although with the provisos established by the laws-they could not draw either gold, silver, or horses. Torquemada presented the draft decree to the kings on March 20, 1492, and the monarchs signed and published it in Granada on March 31. According to Joseph Perez, that the kings commissioned the drafting of the decree to Torquemada \"demonstrates the leading role of [the Inquisition] in that matter.\"\n\nOf the decree promulgated in Granada on March 31, which was based on the draft decree of Torquemada - drawn up \"with the will and consent of their altezas\" and which is dated in Santa Fe On March 20 - there are two versions. One signed by the two kings and valid for the Crown of Castile and another signed only by King Ferdinand and valid for the Crown of Aragon. Between the draft decree of Torquemada and the two final versions and between these, they exist, according to Joseph Perez, \"significant variants.\" In contrast to the Torquemada project and the Castilian decree, in the version addressed to the Crown of Aragon the protagonism of the Inquisition is recognized - \" Persuading us the venerable father prior of Santa Cruz [Torquemada], inquisitor general of the heretical staidness usury is mentioned as one of the two crimes of which the Jews are accused: \"We find the Jewish sayings, by means of great and unbearable usages, to devour and absorb the properties and substances of Christians\"; We reaffirm the official position that only the Crown can decide the fate of the Jews since they are the possession of the kings - \"they are ours,\" it is said; And contains more insulting expressions against the Jews: they are accused of making fun of the laws of Christians and of considering them idolaters; Mention is made of the abominable circumstances and of Jewish perfidy. The Judaism of \"leprosy\" is qualified; It is recalled that the Jews \"by their own fault are subject to perpetual servitude, to be slaves and captives.\"\n\nRegarding the essentials the two versions have the same structure and expose the same ideas. The first part describes the reasons why the kings - or the king in the case of the \"Aragonese\" version - decide to expel the Jews and in the second part it is detailed how the expulsion is going to take place.\n\nThe second part of the decree detailed the conditions for expulsion:\n\nAlthough the edict did not refer to a possible conversion, this alternative was implicit. As the historian Luis Suárez pointed out, the Jews had \"four months to take the most terrible decision of their lives: to abandon their faith to be integrated in it [in the kingdom, in the political and civil community], or leave the territory in order to preserve it.\"\n\nThe drama that lived the Jews is collected by a contemporary source:\n\nThe most outstanding Jews, with few exceptions among which the one of Isaac Abravanel stands out, decided to convert to the Christianity. The most relevant case was that of Abraham Senior, the chief rabbi of Castile and one of the closest collaborators of the kings. He and all his relatives were baptized on June 15, 1492 in the Guadalupe monastery, being his godfathers the kings Isabel and Fernando. It took the name of Fernán Núñez Coronel and its son-in-law Mayr Melamed of Fernán Pérez Coronel - the same name of pile that the one of the king. In this case, like that of Abraham de Córdoba, he was given much publicity to serve as an example for the rest of his community. In fact during the four-month tacit term that was given for the conversion many Jews were baptized, especially the rich and the most educated, and among them the vast majority of the rabbis.\n\nA chronicler of the time relates the intense propaganda campaign that unfolded:\nThe Jews who decided not to become \"had to prepare themselves for the march in tremendous conditions\". They had to sell their goods because they had very little time and had to accept the sometimes ridiculous amounts they offered them in the form of goods that could be carried away because the gold and silver output of the kingdom was prohibited - the possibility of taking bills of exchange were not much help because the bankers, Italians for the most part, demanded them enormous interests. A chronicler of the time attests this:\n\nThey also had serious difficulties in recovering the money lent to Christians because either the repayment term was after August 10, deadline for their departure, or many of the debtors denounced \"usury fraud\", knowing that the Jews, they would not have time for the courts to prove them right. In a letter to the kings, the Ampudia Jews complained that \"The mayors of the said village made them and have closed many unreason and grievances says that they do not consent to them, nor do they want them to pay and pay their personal property and that they have no less, but they want to make and pay the debts owed to them and that which they deem urge them to do and then pay them even if the deadlines are not reached.\"\n\nIn addition they had to take care of all the expenses of the trip - transport, maintenance, freight of the ships, tolls, etc. -. This was organized by Isaac Abravanel, who contracted the ships, having to pay very high prices and whose owners in some cases did not fulfill the contract or killed the travelers to steal what little they had. Avranel counted on the collaboration of the real official convert Luis de Santángel and of the banker genovés, Francisco Pinelo.\n\nThe kings had to give orders to be protected during the trip, because during the same suffered vexations and abuse. This is how Andrés Bernaldez, pastor of Los Palacios, the time when the Jews had to \"abandon their land of their births\":\n\nAt the beginning of the decree It is said that:\nIt is well known that in our domains there are some bad Christians who have Judaized and have committed apostasy against the holy Catholic faith, being the cause most by the relations between Jews and Christians.\nThe following are the measures taken hitherto by kings to end the communication between the Jewish community and the converts, a fundamental cause according to the kings and the Inquisition, that the new Christians, first of all the agreement of the Cortes de Toledo of 1480 by which the Jews were forced to live in neighborhoods separated from the Christians, in order to prevent the Jews from \"subverting and subtracting the Christian faithful from our holy Catholic faith.\" Secondly, the decision to expel the Jews from Andalusia, \"believing that this would suffice for those of the other cities and towns and places of our kingdoms and lordships to cease to do and commit the aforesaid.\" But this measure failed\" \"because every day it is found and it seems that the said Jews grow in continuing their bad and damaged purpose where they live and talk.'\"\n\nFinally, the reason for deciding to expel the entire Jewish community, and not just those of its members who allegedly wanted to \"pervert\" the Christians, is explained:\n\nAs highlighted Julio Valdeón, \"undoubtedly the expulsion of the Jews from the Iberian site is one of the most controversial issues of all that have happened throughout the history of Spain.\" It is not surprising, therefore, that historians have debated whether, in addition to the motives laid out by the Catholic Monarchs in the decree, there were others. Nowadays, some of those who argued at the time, such as the expulsion of the Jews to stay with their wealth, seem to have been discarded, since the majority of the Jews who left were the most modest, while the richest converted and they stayed, and on the other hand, the crown did not benefit at all from the operation - rather it was damaged because it stopped receiving the taxes paid by the Jews. Nor does the argument seem to hold that the expulsion was an episode of classes - the nobility wanted to get rid of an incipient bourgeoisie that represented the Jews and that supposedly threatened their interests - because many Jews were defended by some of the most important nobiliary families of Castile, and because he was also among the ranks of the \"bourgeoisie\" of \"old Christians\" where anti-Judaism grew the most.\n\nThe personal motives of the kings also seem to be ruled out, because everything indicates that they did not feel any repugnance towards Jews and converts. Among the trusted men of the kings were several who belonged to this group, such as the confessor of the queen fray Hernando de Talavera, the steward Andrés Cabrera, the treasurer of the Santa Hermandad Abraham Senior, or as Mayr Melamed or Isaac Abarbanel, without counting the Jewish doctors that attended them.\nCurrent historians prefer to place expulsion in the European context and stand out, such as Luis Suárez Fernández or Julio Valdeón, that the Catholic Kings were in fact the last of the sovereigns of the great western European states to decree The expulsion-the Kingdom of England did it in 1290, the Kingdom of France in 1394; in 1421 the Jews are expelled from Vienna; in 1424 of Linz and of Colonia; in 1439 of Augsburg; in 1442 of Bavaria; in 1485 of Perugia; in 1486 of Vicenza; in 1488 of Parma; in 1489 of Milan and Luca; in 1493 of Sicily; in 1494 of Florence; in 1498 of Provenza...-. The aim of all of them was to achieve unity of faith in their states, a principle that will be defined in the sixteenth century with the formula \"cuius regio, eius religio\", that the subjects should profess the same religion as their prince.\n\nAs Joseph Perez pointed out, the expulsion \"puts an end to an original situation in Christian Europe: that of a nation that consents to the presence of different religious communities\" with which it \"becomes a nation like the rest in Christendom European\". \"The University of Paris congratulated Spain for having carried out an act of good government, an opinion shared by the best spirits of the time (Machiavelli, Guicciardini, Pico della Mirandola)... [...] it was the so-called medieval coexistence that missed Christian Europe.\n\nJulio Valdeón affirms that the decision of the Catholic Monarchs, who \"showed themselves, in their first years of rule, clearly protective of the Hebrews,\" was due to \"pressure from the rest of Christianity\" and to \"the constant pressure of Church, who often preached against those he called \"deicides\", as well as the \"tremendous animosity that existed in the Christian people against the Jewish community.\" In this sense he quotes the thesis of the Israeli historian Benzion Netanyahu that the expulsion was the consequence of the climate of racism that was lived in the Christian society of the time. A thesis the latter - that the kings decided the expulsion to ingratiate themselves with the masses in which the anti-Jewish sentiments predominated - that Joseph Perez considers without foundation. \"Why should kings have to worry about what the masses felt about Jews and converts when they did not serve the more concrete interests of those masses?\" Of the three surviving versions of the expulsion edict, only the third term \"usury\", which was signed only by Don Fernando, refers to the subject of usury, in very harsh terms, and in the other two versions we do not read a single mention or even the slightest mention of this matter. Accusations that had been repeated for centuries against the Jews: people deicide, desecration of hosts, ritual crimes ... do not appear in any of the three versions.\"\n\nFor Joseph Perez, the decision of the Catholic Monarchs, as evidenced by the content of the Granada Edict, is directly related to the \"converso problem\". The first step was the creation of the Inquisition, the second the expulsion of the Jews to eliminate those who allegedly incited the converts to Judaize. \"What concerned them [the kings] was the total and definitive assimilation of the converts, for which the previous measures failed; they resort to a drastic solution: the expulsion of the Jews to start evil.\" \"The idea of expelling the Jews is part of the Inquisition, of which there is no doubt ... The Inquisition found the expulsion of the Jews the best way to put an end to the Judaizing converts: removed the Catholic Monarchs take the idea to their own account, but this does not mean that the pressure of the inquisitors is low. Heresy is not to their liking, they want to \"clean\" their kingdom, as the queen wrote, but these concerns are also political: they hope that the elimination of Judaism will facilitate the definitive assimilation and integration of converts into Spanish society\".\n\nOn the other hand, Joseph Perez, following Luis Suárez, places the expulsion within the context of the construction of the \"modern state,\" which requires greater social cohesion based on unity of faith to impose its authority on all groups and individuals of the kingdom. Unlike the medieval period in this type of state, it does not fit the groups that are governed by particular norms, as was the case of the Jewish community. It is therefore not a coincidence, Pérez warns, that only three months after having eliminated the last Muslim stronghold of the peninsula with the conquest of the Nazari kingdom of Granada, they decree the expulsion of the Jews. \"What was intended then was to completely assimilate Judaizers and Jews so that there would be no more than Christians. Kings must have thought that the prospect of expulsion would encourage Jews to become massively and that a gradual assimilation would do away with the remnants of Judaism\". The vast majority chose to leave, with all that entailed of tears, sacrifices and vexations, and to remain faithful to their faith. \"They totally refused to assimilate as an alternative.\" However, \"assimilation\" is in this quotation a euphemism: what was offered to the Sephardic was in fact the conversion to a faith that was not his own, hence his Emigration in mass (towards the different directions indicated in the attached map).\n\nAs Joseph Perez pointed out, \"In 1492 the story of Spanish Judaism ends, which will only lead to an underground existence, always threatened by the Spanish Inquisition and the suspicion of a public opinion that saw In Jews, Judaizers and even sincere converts to natural enemies of Catholicism and Spanish idiosyncrasy, as understood and imposed by some ecclesiastical and intellectual leaders, in an attitude that bordered on racism.\"\n\nThe number of expelled Jews remains controversial. The figures ranged from 45,000 to 350,000, although the most recent investigations, according to Joseph Perez, place it at around 50,000, taking into account the thousands of Jews who left after returning because of the mistreatment they suffered in some places in Fez, Marruecos. Julio Valdeón, citing also the latest investigations, places the figure between 70,000 and 100,000, of which between 50,000 and 80,000 would come from the Crown of Castile, although in these numbers the returnees are not counted.\n\nThe situation of those who returned was regularized with an order of November 10, 1492, in which it was established that civil and ecclesiastical authorities had to be witnesses to baptism, and in the event that they had been baptized before returning, evidence and testimonials that confirm it. They were also able to recover all their goods for the same price at which they had sold them. Returns are documented at least until 1499. On the other hand, a provision of the Royal Council of October 24, 1493, determined harsh sanctions for those who reviled these new Christians - calling them \"transgressors,\" for example.\n\nAs for the economic impact of the expulsion, it seems to be ruled out that it was a hard setback and stopped the birth of capitalism, which would be one of the causes of the decline of Spain. As Joseph Perez has pointed out, \"in view of the published literature on taxation and economic activities, there is no doubt that the Jews were no longer a source of relevant wealth, neither as bankers nor as renters nor as merchants who developed the expulsion of the Jews produced problems at the local level but not a national catastrophe. It is clearly unreasonable to attribute to that event the decadence of Spain and its supposed inability to adapt to the transformations of the modern world. What we now know shows that sixteenth-century Spain was not precisely an economically backward nation. [...] In strictly demographic and economic terms, and apart from human aspects, the expulsion did not imply for Spain any substantial deterioration, but only a temporary crisis Quickly overtaken.\"\n\nA copy of the Amsterdam Gazette published in the Netherlands on September 12, 1672. The Hebrews of Amsterdam printed a newspaper showing the interest of the Jewish community in what was happening at that time in Madrid and , It also read the news in Spanish - after 180 years of being expelled from its ancestral soil (1492).\nDocument preserved and exhibited in Beth Hatefutsoth, Nahum Goldmann Museum and House of the Diasporas, University of Tel Aviv, State of Israel.\n\nMost of the expelled Jews settled in North Africa, sometimes via Portugal, or in nearby states, such as the Kingdom of Portugal, the Kingdom of Navarre, or in the Italian states. As of the first two kingdoms also they were expelled to them in 1497 and in 1498 respectively, they had to emigrate again. Those of Navarre settled in Bayona for the most part. And those of Portugal ended up in northern Europe (England or Flanders).\n\nIn North Africa, those who went to the Fez kingdom suffered all kinds of ill-treatment and were plundered, even by the Jews who had lived there for a long time. Those who fought the best were those who settled in the territories of the Ottoman Empire, both in North Africa and in the Middle East, as in the Balkans and the Republic of Ragusa, after having passed by Italy. The sultan gave orders to be welcomed and his successor Soliman the Magnificent exclaimed on one occasion referring to King Ferdinand: \"You call him king who impoverishes his states to enrich the mine?\" This same sultan commented to the ambassador sent by Carlos V who marveled that \"they had cast the Jews of Castile, because it was to throw the wealth.\"\n\nAs some Jews identified Spain and the Iberian Peninsula with Biblical Sepharad, the Jews expelled by the Catholic Monarchs took or received the name of Sephardi. These, in addition to their religion, They also kept many of their ancestral customs, and in particular they have preserved the use of the Spanish language, a language which, of course, is not exactly what was spoken in fifteenth-century Spain: like any living language, it evolved and suffered the passage of time, notable alterations, although the structures and essential characteristics remained those of the Castilian late medieval. [...] The Sephardi never forgot the land of their parents, sheltering for her mixed feelings: on the one hand, the resentment for the tragic ones events of 1492, on the other hand, walking the time, the nostalgia of the lost homeland ...\".\n\nAbout judeoespañol as a socio-cultural and identity phenomenon, Garcia-Pelayo and Gross wrote in the twentieth century:\n\n"}

Written by Harold G. Koenig, Michael E. McCullough, and David B. Larson, the book was published in the United States in 2001. The book has been discussed in magazines and reviewed in professional journals.\n\nA second revised edition of the \"Handbook\" was published in 2012.\n\nThe first edition of the \"Handbook of Religion and Health\" (published in 2001) is divided into 8 major parts that contain a total of 34 chapters. The book also contains an 11-page introduction, a 2-page conclusion, 95 pages of references, and a 24-page index. One reviewer described the book as \"surprisingly readable\" (p. 791).\n\nThe parts and chapters are shown in the adjacent table. Most chapters focus on reviewing and discussing the relation between religion and particular health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease or depression. In two chapters, the authors present more encompassing theoretical models that they suggest may explain the generally favorable associations observed between religion and health:\n\nThe authors note that their model for effects on physical health \n\ndoes not consider 'supernatural'... explanations... since such mechanisms (if they exist at all) act outside the laws of science as we know them today. We focus here on known psychological, social, behavioral, and physiological mechanisms by which religion may exert effects on physical health. (p. 389)\n\nThe book's 34th and final chapter contains a 77-page table with systematic information about all 20th-century studies of religion and health. Topics are arranged in the order of the other chapters, and provide technical information such as the type of population, the number of subjects, the existence of a control or a comparison group, and a 1-to-10 rating or \"grade\" of the study's quality and rigor. The \"reader thus gains a snapshot view of each study, can easily identify those with a variable of interest, and can reference back to the text to see what the authors have to say about it\" (p. 139).\n\nReviews and discussions have appeared in \n\"The New Yorker\",\n\"Freethought Today\", \n\"First Things\",\n\"Journal of the American Medical Association\",\n\"The Gerontologist\",\nthe \"Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health\",\n\"Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion\",\n\"The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion\",\n\"Journal of Hospice & Palliative Nursing\",\n\"Journal of Sex Education & Therapy\",\n\"Anglican Theological Review\",\nthe \"American Journal of Psychiatry,\nand elsewhere.\n\nThe \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" wrote that the authors of the \"Handbook of Religion and Health\" are\n\nwell-regarded researchers in this maturing field... Their analysis of more than 1200\nstudies and 400 reviews is meticulous and balanced... This is an unparalleled resource not only for physicians with an interest in the relationship between religion and health but perhaps even more for those who doubt its significance. All physicians should consider the possibility that something so meaningful to a large number of patients might also be good for their health. (pp. 465-6)\n\n\"JAMA\" also stated that \"Studies are cited to illustrate the complexity and limitations of available knowledge,\" that \"The authors offer theoretical models for how religion might directly or indirectly influence both mental and physical health,\" and that \"The authors provide an outline for a religious history that can serve as part of a clinical assessment. Ways to aid patients to use their religious beliefs within the health care system are suggested\" (all p. 465).\n\nIn the \"Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health\", Leonard Duhl wrote that\n\nthe authors have done a very thorough overview of all we know at this time. Clearly spirituality and religion affect growth and development, the creation of pathology and the treatment of disease. They have not got the total answer. However, they have laid a ground work for understanding a complex set of issues. They review those studies that exist, critically interpret their findings, and offer new ways of \"asking the question.\" They hypothesise the possible mechanisms, and suggest new directions.\nIn \"The Gerontologist\", David O. Moberg described the book as \"mind-boggling, comprehensive, and evenhanded...This comprehensive reference work deserves an honored place in every medical, religious, gerontological, professional, and scientific research library, even though it has one major weakness, the lack of an index of names.\" (pp. 699–700;)\n\nIn \"The New Yorker\", Jerome Groopman wrote that the \"Handbook\"'s conclusions \n\nare not entirely encouraging: they suggest that although the relationship between health and spirituality is clearly worthy of serious study, much of the research done in the field to date has been shoddy. Koenig and his collaborators also go to great lengths to educate the reader about negative effects of belief and orthodoxies... such as the fear that disease is punishment for sin, and that assistance is preferably derived through miracles rather than through medicine. (p. 166)\n\"Freethought Today\", a magazine published by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, wrote that the \"Handbook\" \"reports that there are at least 1200 studies on religion and health - with the vast majority showing positive associations\" and asked\nAre there really this many studies? What are these studies like? Well, here's one of them that qualifies by Koenig's standards... The authors reported differences between Jewish and non-Jewish Cleveland attorneys in the incidence of some index of cardiovascular disease. That's it... So that's how numbers like 1200 arise, because studies like this get included. (pp. 10-11)\nIn the \"Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion\", Thomas G.

It should not be conflated with concepts such as doing God's will or taking one's proper place in a divine pattern... A cultural product of present-day American behavioral science, this book renders unto the Caesar of controlled studies... it fits the current pattern of assimilation and loses the Spirit of the message. (pp. 1619-20)\nIn the \"Anglican Theological Review\", Daniel Grossoehme, \"a priest serving as a pediatric chaplain\" (p. 800), wrote that \n\nnow more than ever there is a need for religion and science (and specifically health science) to be in conversation with one another...

[it] is accessible to educated nonprofessionals as well as professionals in religion and medicine... It is not, however, an introduction to the controversy surrounding the field. The authors do not explicitly argue for the religion–health relation; they are content to let the weight of evidence as they present it speak for itself... For a more critical discussion, the reader must look to other sources. But anyone planning a course or introducing a colleague to the general field of religion and health should make this book available.

{"id": "11408137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11408137", "title": "History of Taoism", "text": "History of Taoism\n\nThe history of Taoism stretches throughout Chinese history. Originating in prehistoric China, it has exerted a powerful influence over Chinese culture throughout the ages. Taoism evolved in response to changing times, with its doctrine and associated practices being revised and refined. The acceptance of Taoism by the ruling class has waxed and waned, alternately enjoying periods of favor and rejection. Most recently, Taoism has emerged from a period of suppression and is undergoing a revival in China.\n\nLaozi is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoist religion and is closely associated in this context with \"original\", or \"primordial\", Taoism. Whether he actually existed is disputed, however, the work attributed to him - the Daodejing - is dated to the 4th or 3rd century BC. However, Taoism clearly predates Laozi (Lao Tzu) as he refers to \"The Tao masters of antiquity\" in Chapter 15 of the Daodejing (Tao Te Ching). Moreover, the Yellow Emperor, Huangdi (2697–2597 BCE) Is often associated with origin of the Tao.\n\nSinologist Isabelle Robinet identifies four components in the emergence of Taoism:\n\nSome elements of Taoism may be traced to prehistoric folk religions in China that later coalesced into a Taoist tradition. In particular, many Taoist practices drew from the Warring-States-era phenomena of the Wu (shaman) (connected to the \"shamanism\" of Southern China) and the Fangshi (which probably derived from the \"archivist-soothsayers of antiquity, one of whom supposedly was Laozi himself\"), even though later Taoists insisted that this was not the case. Both terms were used to designate individuals dedicated to \"... magic, medicine, divination... methods of longevity and to ecstatic wanderings\" as well as exorcism; in the case of the \"wu\", \"shamans\" or \"sorcerers\" is often used as a translation. The \"fangshi\" were philosophically close to the School of Yin-Yang, and relied much on astrological and calendrical speculations in their divinatory activities.\n\nThe term \"Daojia\" (usually translated as \"philosophical Taoism\") was coined during the Han Dynasty. In Sima Qian's history (chapter 63) it refers to immortals; in Liu Xiang it refers to Laozi and Zhuangzi (\"Daojiao\" came to be applied to the religious movements in later times). The earliest commentary on the \"Dao De Jing\" is that of Heshang Gong (the \"Riverside Master\"), a legendary figure depicted as a teacher to the Han emperor. In the early Han Dynasty, the Tao came to be associated with or conflated with the Xian Di Emperor. A major text from the Huang-Lao movement would be the \"Huainanzi\", which interprets earlier works of the Taoist canon in light of the quest for immortality.\n\nThe first organized form of Taoism, the Tianshi (Celestial Masters') school (later known as Zhengyi school), developed from the Five Pecks of Rice movement at the end of the 2nd century CE; the latter had been founded by Zhang Daoling, who claimed that Laozi appeared to him in the year 142. The Tianshi school was officially recognized by ruler Cao Cao in 215, legitimizing Cao Cao's rise to power in return. Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in the mid-2nd century.\n\nThe Celestial Masters' activities did hasten the downfall of the Han Dynasty, largely because Zhang's grandson set up a theocratic state into what is now Sichuan province. The same could be said of their contemporaries, the Taoist-leaning Yellow Turban sect.\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms Period, the Xuanxue (Mysterious Wisdom) school, including Wang Bi, focused on the texts of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Many of the school's members, including Wang Bi himself, were not religious in any sense. Wang Bi mostly focused on reconciling Confucian thought with Taoist thought. Because the version of the Tao Te Ching that has been passed on to the present is the one that Wang Bi commented upon, his interpretations became very influential as they were passed on alongside the Tao Te Ching. In addition, his commentary was compatible with Confucian ideas and Buddhist ideas that later entered China. This compatibility ensured Taoism would remain an important aspect of Chinese culture, and made the merging of the three religions easier in later periods, such as the Tang dynasty.\n\nTaoist alchemist Ge Hong, also known as Baopuzi (抱扑子 The \"Master Embracing Simplicity\") was active in the third and fourth centuries and had great influence on later Taoism. Major scriptures were produced during this time period, including The Shangqing (上清 \"Supreme Clarity\") (365–370) and Lingbao (靈寶 \"Sacred Treasure\") scriptures (397–402) received at Maoshan. The Shangqing revelations were received by Yang Xi, a relative of Ge Hong's; the revelations emphasised meditative visualisation (內觀 \"neiguan\"). They spoke of the Shangqing heaven, which stood above what had been previously considered the highest heaven by Celestial Master Taoists. Yang Xi's revelations consisted of visitations from the residents of this heaven (the \"Zhenren\") many of whom were ancestors of a circle of aristocrats from southern China. These Zhenren spoke of an apocalypse which was to arrive in 384, and claimed that only certain people from this aristocratic circle had been chosen to be saved. For the first century of its existence, Shangqing Taoism was isolated to this aristocratic circle. However, Tao Hongjing (456–536) codified and wrote commentaries on Yang Xi's writings and allowed for the creation of Shangqing Taoism as a popular religion. The Lingbao scriptures added some Buddhist elements such as an emphasis on universal salvation.\n\nAlso during the Six Dynasties period, the Celestial Master movement re-emerged in two distinct forms. The Northern Celestial Masters were founded in 424 century by Kou Qianzhi, and a Taoist theocracy was established that lasted until 450 CE. After this time, the Northern Celestial Masters were expelled from the Wei court and re-established themselves at Louguan where they survived into the Tang Dynasty. The Southern Celestial Masters were centered at Jiankang (modern-day Nanjing, and were likely made of those adherents who fled Sichuan and others who fled from Luoyang after its fall in 311 CE. These various followers of The Way of the Celestial Master coalesced to form a distinct form of Taoism known as the Southern Celestial Masters, who lasted as a distinct movement into the fifth century.\n\nTaoism gained official status in China during the Tang Dynasty, whose emperors claimed Laozi as their relative. However, it was forced to compete with Confucianism and Buddhism, its major rivals, for patronage and rank. Emperor Xuanzong (685–762), who ruled at the height of the Tang, wrote commentaries on texts from all three of these traditions, which exemplifies the fact that in many people's lives they were not mutually exclusive. This marks the beginning of a long-lived tendency within imperial China, in which the government supported (and simultaneously regulated) all three movements. The Gaozong Emperor added the \"Tao Te Ching\" to the list of classics (\"jing,\" 經) to be studied for the imperial examinations.\n\nSeveral Song emperors, most notably Huizong, were active in promoting Taoism, collecting Taoist texts and publishing editions of the \"Daozang.\"\n\nThe Quanzhen school of Taoism was founded during this period, and together with the resurgent Celestial Masters called the Zhengyi is one of the two schools of Taoism that have survived to the present.\n\nThe Song Dynasty saw an increasingly complex interaction between the elite traditions of organised Taoism as practised by ordained Taoist ministers (\"daoshi\") and the local traditions of folk religion as practised by spirit mediums (\"wu\") and a new class of non-ordained ritual experts known as \"fashi\". This interaction manifested itself in the integration of 'converted' local deities into the bureaucratically organised Taoist pantheon and the emergence of new exorcistic rituals, including the Celestial Heart Rites and the Thunder Rites.\n\nAspects of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism were consciously synthesised in the Neo-Confucian school, which eventually became Imperial orthodoxy for state bureaucratic purposes.\n\nTaoism suffered a significant setback in 1281 when many copies of the \"Daozang\" were ordered burned. This destruction gave Taoism a chance to renew itself. \"Neidan\", a form of internal alchemy, became a major emphasis of the Quanzhen sect, whose practitioners followed a monastic model inspired by Buddhism. One of its leaders, Qiu Chuji became a teacher of Genghis Khan before the establishment of the Yuan Dynasty. (and used his influence to save millions of lives). Originally from Shanxi and Shandong, the sect established its main center in Beijing's Baiyunguan (\"White Cloud Monastery\"). Before the end of the dynasty, the Celestial Masters sect (and Buddhism) again gained preeminence.\n\nIn 1406, Ming emperor Zhu Di commanded that all Taoist texts be collected and combined into a new version of the \"Daozang.\" The text was finally finished in 1447, and took nearly forty years to complete.\n\nThe fall of the Ming Dynasty and the subsequent establishment of the Qing Dynasty by the Manchus was blamed by some literati on religion, specifically Taoism. They sought to regain power by advocating a return to Confucian orthodoxy in a movement called \"Hanxue\", or \"Han Learning.\" This movement returned the Confucian classics to favor and nearly completely rejected Taoism. During the eighteenth century, the imperial library was constituted, but excluded virtually all Taoist books. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Taoism had fallen much from favor (only one complete copy of the \"Daozang\" still remained, at the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing).\n\nGuomindang (Chinese Nationalist Party) leaders embraced science, modernity, and Western culture, including (to some extent) Christianity. Viewing the popular religion as reactionary and parasitic, they confiscated some temples for public buildings, and otherwise attempted to control traditional religious activity.\n\nThe Communist Party of China, officially atheistic, initially suppressed Taoism along with other religions. During the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, many Taoist temples and sites were damaged and Monks and priests were sent to labor camps.\n\nPersecution of Taoists stopped in 1979, and many Taoists began reviving their traditions. Subsequently, many temples and monasteries have been repaired and reopened.\n\nTaoism is one of five religions recognized by the PRC, which regulates its activities through the China Taoist Association. Sensitive areas include the relationship of the Zhengyi Taoists with their sect's lineage-holder, who lives in Taiwan, and various traditional temple activities such as astrology and shamanism, which have been criticized as \"superstitious\".\n\nFrom 1927-1944, the chief proponent of Taoism in the West was Professor Henri Maspero in Paris. Michael Saso was the first westerner to be initiated as a Taoist priest; he subsequently served also as co-editor of \"Taoist Resources\". Today, many Taoist organizations have been established in the West.\n\n\"Popular Western Taoism\" is a term coined by Jonathan R. Herman in his 1998 review of Ursula K. Le Guin's \"Daodejing\" \"rendition\", referring to the\nabundance of new literature on Taoism by nonspecialists, including \"translations\" of Taoist texts by authors who (sometimes boastfully) lack linguistic competence. Scholars have been quick to reject such documents as ahistorical and inauthentic, and many do indeed combine questionable scholarship with a promiscuous blend of western individualism and new-age universalism. However, this popular western Taoism is not exclusively or even primarily a scholarly phenomenon; rather, it is an \"aesthetic\", \"cultural\", and \"religious\" phenomenon.\nThis review was largely positive with some criticisms and cautions. While Herman states that the book \"is not a useful text for informing students\" about philosophical thought during the Chinese Warring States period,\nHerman praised the book as a \"surprisingly interesting and scholastically responsible\" example of western Daoist thought and as \"an intelligent example of the emerging western transformation of Taoism, an area too often overlooked by sinologists.\" On the other hand, he criticized that Le Guin \"make[s] some claims—or rather, employs some language—that may carry misleading implications\", such as identifying Laozi \"as a mystic and his perceptions as mystical, without ever defining the terms or questioning what generalizations can be drawn.\"\n\nHerman subsequently described popular Western Taoism as the modern proliferation of self-proclaimed Daoist journals, meditation centers, websites, and renderings of Daoist texts by nonspecialists; and said, \"not surprisingly, the sinological community (myself included) has generally greeted this overall phenomenon – what I will from here on label \"popular Western Daoism\" – with varying degrees of indifferences, amusement, and derision.\"\n\nIn a 1998 article about teaching Daoism, Russell Kirkland urged colleagues not to \"Pooh-pooh Taoism\" with \"popular fluff\" like Benjamin Hoff's coffee-table book \"The Tao of Pooh\", and characterized Stephen Mitchell and others as \"self-indulgent dilettantes who deceive the public by publishing pseudo-translations of the \"Tao-te ching\", without having actually read the text in its original language\".\n\nLouis Komjathy described modern \"Western Daoism\" or \"American Daoism\" in religious studies terms, where \"New Age discourse communities and advocates of Perennial Philosophy identify and interpret Daoist texts as part of a 'universal wisdom tradition'.\" Komjathy later elaborated on these spiritual hybrids that \"domesticate, sterilize and misrepresent Daoism\", and may best be understood as part of a new religious movement labeled \"Popular Western Taoism (PWT), with 'Taoism' pronounced with a hard 't' sound.\" In this construct, \"'Daoism' becomes anything for anyone\", and Popular Western Taoism \"has little to no connection with the Daoist religious tradition.\"\n\nHad lreligion 7em9a\n\n"}

They are characterized as being animistic, and have been collectively referred to as Anitism or Bathalism or the more modern and less Tagalog-centric Dayawism.\n\nThe profusion of different terms arises from the fact that these indigenous religions mostly flourished in the pre-colonial period before the Philippines had become a single nation. The various peoples of the Philippines spoke different languages and thus used different terms to describe their religious beliefs. While these beliefs can be treated as separate religions, scholars have noted that they follow a \"common structural framework of ideas\" which can be studied together.\n\nSome writers have noted that these beliefs have similarities with the Shinto religion of Japan, although they do not draw a historical linkage between the two belief systems. More historically linked are the various indigenous religious beliefs the various religions of Oceania and the maritime Southeast Asia, which draw their roots from Austronesian beliefs as those in the Philippines.\n\nAs of 2010, an estimated 2% of the Philippine population identified as practicing indigenous beliefs - the majority of whom live in isolated areas where Islam, Catholicism, or Protestantism have not become dominant. Since the entrance of the 21st century, streams of Christian and Muslim Filipinos are steadily reverting to their indigenous ethnic religions that were once branded as lowly by Spanish, American, and Arabians colonizers, but have been affirmed by the social sciences as comprehensive and highly in nature.\n\nOn the other hand, many aspects of these traditions have been integrated into the local practice of Catholicism and Islam, resulting in syncretistic practices called \"Folk Catholicism\" and \"Folk Islam\".\n\nThe folklore narratives associated with these religious beliefs constitute what is now called Philippine mythology, and is an important aspect of the study of Philippine culture and Filipino psychology.\n\nHistorian T. Valentino Sitoy, in his review of documents concerning pre-Spanish religious beliefs, notes that three core characteristics which shaped the religious worldview of Filipinos throughout the archipelago before the arrival of Spanish colonizers. First, Filipinos believed in the existence of parallel spirit world, which was invisible but had an influence on the visible world. Second, Filipinos believed that there were spirits (\"anito\") everywhere - ranging from the high creator gods to minor spirits that lived in the environment such as trees or rocks or creeks. Third, Filipinos believed that events in the human world were influenced by the actions and interventions of these spirit beings.\n\n\"Anito\" were the ancestor spirits (\"umalagad\"), or nature spirits and deities (\"diwata\") in the indigenous animistic religions of precolonial Philippines. \"Paganito\" (also \"maganito\" or \"anitohan\") refers to a séance, often accompanied by other rituals or celebrations, in which a shaman (Visayan: \"babaylan\", Tagalog: \"katalonan\") acts as a medium to communicate directly with the spirits. When a nature spirit or deity is specifically involved, the ritual is called \"pagdiwata\" (also \"magdiwata\" or \"diwatahan\"). \"Anito\" can also refer to the act of worship or a religious sacrifice to a spirit.\n\nWhen Spanish missionaries arrived in the Philippines, the word \"anito\" came to be associated with the physical representations of spirits that featured prominently in \"paganito\" rituals. During the American rule of the Philippines (1898–1946), the meaning of the Spanish word \"idolo\" (\"a thing worshiped\") has been further conflated with the English word \"idol\", and thus \"anito\" has come to refer almost exclusively to the carved figures or statues (\"taotao\") of ancestral and nature spirits.\n\nThe belief in \"anito\" is sometimes referred to as anitism in scholarly literature (Spanish: \"anitismo\" or \"anitería\").\n\nMany indigenous Filipino cultures assert the existence of a high god, creator god, or sky god. Among the Tagalogs, the supreme god was known as Bathala, who was additionally described as Maykapal (the all-powerful) or Lumikha (the creator). Among the Visayan peoples the creator God is referred to as Laon, meaning \"the ancient one.\" Among the Manuvu, the highest god was called Manama. Among most of the Cordilleran peoples (with the Apayao region as an exception), the creator and supreme teacher is known as Kabuniyan.\n\nIn most cases, however, these gods were considered such great beings that they were too distant for ordinary people to approach. People thus tended to pay more attention to \"lesser gods\" or \"assistant deities\" who could more easily approached, and whose wills could more easily be influenced.\n\nLesser deities in Filipino religions generally fit into three broad categories: nature spirits residing in the environment, such as a mountain or a tree; guardian spirits in charge of specific aspects of daily life such as hunting or fishing; and deified ancestors or tribal heroes. These categories frequently overlap, with individual deities falling into two or more categories, and in some instances, deities evolve from one role to another, as when a tribal hero known for fishing becomes a guardian spirit associated with hunting.\n\nDuring the pre-Hispanic period, \"babaylan\", functioned as shamans and spiritual leaders and \"mananambal\" were for folk healers. At the onset of the Colonial era, the suppression of the \"babaylans\" and the native Filipino religion gave rise to the \"albularyo\". By exchanging the native prayers and spells with Catholic \"oraciones\" and Christian prayers, the albularyo was able to synchronize the ancient mode of healing with the new religion.\n\n\"Albularyos\" employ herbs, alum, coconut oil, etc., in their healing practices as well as various prayers, chants and \"supernatural\" cures—especially for cases involving supernatural causes. As time progressed, the \"albularyo\" became more prominent in rural areas in the Philippines. Lacking access to scientific medical practices, rural Filipinos trusted the \"albularyos\" to rid them of common (and sometimes believed to be supernatural) sicknesses and diseases.\n\nHowever, the role of the \"albularyo\" was slowly overshadowed by the rise of modern medical facilities. Urbanization gave the masses access to more scientific treatments, exchanging the chants and herbs of the \"albularyos\" with the newer technologies offered by the medical field. Still, \"albularyos\" flourish in many rural areas in the Philippines where medical facilities are still expensive and sometimes inaccessible.\n\nSome of the rituals observed by Filipino Folk Healers include:\n\n\n"}

Other beliefs may be rationally justified, but they do not rise to the level of \"knowledge\" unless absolutely certain given one's evidence. Infallibilism's opposite, fallibilism, is the position that a justified true belief may be considered knowledge, even if one's evidence does not guarantee its truth, or can, given one's evidence, rationally doubt it. \n\nFallibilism is not to be confused with skepticism, which is the belief that knowledge is unattainable for rational human beings. René Descartes, an early proponent of infallibilism argued, “my reason convinces me that I ought not the less carefully to withhold belief from what is not entirely certain and indubitable, than from what is manifestly false” Infallibilism can be expressed in logic as \"if I know that p, then I can't be mistaken about p\". \n\nFallibilism is endorsed by most contemporary epistemologists, though many in epistemology have recently presented significant arguments against fallibilism, and for infalliblism.\n\nIn religion, infallibilism is the belief that certain texts or persons are incapable of being in the wrong. The most famous example of this is probably the Catholic doctrine of papal infallibility, under which the Pope is considered infallible in certain matters of doctrine, when his decisions are promulgated \"ex cathedra\". Since 1870, the Catholic Church has officially declared that its earthly head, the Pope, in certain circumstances, is so grounded in the mission of the church that he teaches \"infallibly\". Papal infallibility also belongs to the body of bishops as a whole, when, in doctrinal unity with the pope, they solemnly teach a doctrine as true.\n\n"}
{"id": "555881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=555881", "title": "Innocence", "text": "Innocence\n\nInnocence is a lack of guilt, with respect to any kind of crime, or wrongdoing. In a legal context, innocence is to the lack of legal guilt of an individual, with respect to a crime. In other contexts, it is a lack of experience.\n\nInnocence can imply lesser experience in either a relative view to social peers, or by an absolute comparison to a more common normative scale. In contrast to \"ignorance\", it is generally viewed as a positive term, connoting an optimistic view of the world, in particular one where the lack of knowledge stems from a lack of wrongdoing, whereas greater knowledge comes from doing wrong. This connotation may be connected with a popular false etymology explaining \"innocent\" as meaning \"not knowing\" (Latin \"noscere\" (To know, learn)). The actual etymology is from general negation prefix \"in-\" and the Latin \"nocere\", \"to harm\".\n\nPeople who lack the mental capacity to understand the nature of their acts may be regarded as innocent regardless of their behavior. From this meaning comes the usage of \"innocent\" as a noun to refer to a child under the age of reason, or a person, of any age, who is severely mentally disabled. “Nonetheless, the word, innocence, is used to describe childhood innocence as a notion created and controlled by adults. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau describes 'childhood as a time of innocence' where children are 'not-knowing' and must reach the age of reason to become competent people in society. However, this is not the case anymore as technology advances, this has given children in the contemporary world a platform where they are referred to as 'digital natives', where they are seen more knowledgeable than adults Furthermore, because of digital media and internet, young people have become well-informed of the world around and have a better understanding.\n\nIn some cases, the term \"innocence\" has a pejorative meaning, where an assumed level of experience dictates common discourse or baseline qualifications for entry into another, different, social experience. Since experience is a prime factor in determining a person's point of view, innocence is often also used to imply naiveté or lack of personal experience.\n\nThe lamb is a commonly used symbol of innocence's nature. In Christianity, for example, Jesus is referred to as the \"Lamb of God\", thus emphasizing his sinless nature. Other symbols of innocence include children, virgins, acacia branches (especially in Freemasonry), non-sexual nudity, songbirds and the color white (biblical paintings and Hollywood films depict Jesus wearing a white tunic).\n\nA \"loss of innocence\" is a common theme in fiction, pop culture, and realism. It is often seen as an integral part of coming of age. It is usually thought of as an experience or period in a person's life that leads to a greater awareness of evil, pain and/or suffering in the world around them. Examples of this theme include songs like \"American Pie\", poetry like William Blake's collection Songs of Innocence and of Experience and novels like \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", \"The Catcher in the Rye\", \"A Farewell to Arms\", and \"Lord of the Flies\".\n\nBy contrast, the \"I Ching\" urges a recovery of innocence - the name given to Hexagram 25 - and \"encourages you to \"actively practice innocence\"\".\n\nInnocence could also be viewed as a Westernized view of childhood, and the \"loss\" of innocence is simply a social construction or viewed as the dominant ideology. Thinkers such as Jean-Jaques Rousseau used the romanticism discourse as a way to separate children from adults. Ideas surrounding childhood and childhood innocence stems from this discourse. It was during the 19th century when childhood became synonymous with \"innocence\", however not all children were considered to be innocent during that time, as it was highly dependent on the colour of one's skin. The term innocence being connected to \"white childhood\" was a way to racialize childhood and exclude the non-whites not only from \"innocence\" but from childhood as well.\n\nThe psychoanalytic tradition is broadly divided between those (like Fairbairn and Winnicott) who saw the child as initially innocent, but liable to lose its innocence under the impact of stress or psychological trauma; and those (like Freud and Klein) who see the child as \"developing\" innocence - maturing into it - as a result of surmounting the Oedipus complex and/or the depressive position.\n\nMore eclectically, Eric Berne saw the Child ego state, and its vocabulary, as reflecting three different possibilities: the cliches of conformity; the obscenities of revolt; and \"the sweet phrases of charming innocence\". In a rather different formulation, Christopher Bollas used the term 'Violent Innocence' to describe a fixed and obdurate refusal to acknowledge the existence of an alternative viewpoint - something akin to what he calls \"the fascist construction, the outcome is to empty the mind of all opposition\".\n\n\n"}

British philosopher and biologist Julian Huxley (also the first director of UNESCO) presided over the founding Congress of the IHEU in Amsterdam, 1952; Dutch philosopher and politician Jaap van Praag became its first chairman until 1975.\n\nThe IHEU works \"to build and represent the global Humanist movement that defends human rights and promotes Humanist values world-wide.\"\n\nIn 2002, the IHEU General Assembly unanimously adopted the Amsterdam Declaration 2002, which presents as the \"official defining statement of World Humanism\". The Happy Human is the official symbol of the IHEU.\n\nIHEU holds a World Humanist Congress usually every three years. The next is to be held in Miami, United States, in 2020.\n\nIn 2002 at the IHEU's 50th anniversary World Humanist Congress, delegates unanimously passed a resolution known as the Amsterdam Declaration 2002, an update of the original Amsterdam Declaration (1952).\n\nThe Amsterdam Declaration defines Humanism as a \"lifestance\" that is \"ethical\", \"rational\", supportive of \"democracy and human rights\", insisting \"that personal liberty must be combined with social responsibility\"; it is \"an alternative to dogmatic religion\"; it values \"artistic creativity and imagination\" and is aimed at living lives of \"fulfillment\" through the powers of \"free inquiry\", \"science\" and \"creative imagination\".\n\nIn addition to the Amsterdam Declaration's \"official statement of World Humanism\", the IHEU provides a \"Minimum Statement on Humanism\":\n\nHumanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not theistic, and it does not accept supernatural views of reality.Member Organisations of the IHEU are required according to IHEU's membership regulations to have objects that are \"consistent\" with this understanding of Humanism.\n\nIn 2010, in an \"unprecedented alliance\" of the IHEU, the European Humanist Federation and Catholics for Choice, launched the Brussels Declaration, a secular response to a proposed Berlin Declaration, under which the amended EU Constitution would have made references to \"God\" and the \"Christian roots of Europe\".\n\nAt World Humanist Congress 2011, in Norway, the IHEU General Assembly adopted The Oslo Declaration on Peace, which concludes: \"We urge each of our member organizations and Humanists globally to work for a more peaceful culture in their own nations and urge all governments to prefer the peaceful settlement of conflicts over the alternative of violence and war.\"\n\nAt World Humanist Congress 2014, in the United Kingdom, the IHEU General Assembly adopted The Oxford Declaration on Freedom of Thought and Expression, which asserts: \"Freedom of thought implies the right to develop, hold, examine and manifest our beliefs without coercion, and to express opinions and a worldview whether religious or non-religious, without fear of coercion. It includes the right to change our views or to reject beliefs previously held, or previously ascribed. Pressure to conform to ideologies of the state or to doctrines of religion is a tyranny.\"\n\nFive Humanist organisations, the American Ethical Union, American Humanist Association, British Ethical Union (later the British Humanist Association and now Humanists UK), Vienna Ethical Society and the Dutch Humanist league hosted the founding congress of the IHEU in Amsterdam, 22–27 August 1952. On the last day of the congress five resolutions were passed, which included a statement of the fundamentals of \"modern, ethical Humanism\", a resolution which would come to be known as the Amsterdam Declaration (1952).\n\nThe IHEU is a democratic organisation, the Board of which is elected by representatives of the Member Organisations at annual General Assemblies. The President as of 2015 is Andrew Copson (who is also the Chief Executive of Humanists UK as of 2010). The IHEU headquarters is in London, sharing an office with Humanists UK.\n\nRepresentatives of IHEU Member Organisations ratify new memberships annually during a General Assembly. Following the 2017 General Assembly, the IHEU listed its membership as 139 Member Organisations from 53 countries from a variety of non-religious traditions.\n\nA staff of four is headed by the current Chief Executive, Gary McLelland, and the IHEU maintains delegations to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, the United Nations in New York, and the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.\n\nThe IHEU is an international NGO with Special Consultative Status with the United Nations, General Consultative Status at the Council of Europe, Observer Status with the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, and maintains operational relations with UNESCO.\n\nIHEU has a wing for people aged up to 35 called the International Humanist and Ethical Youth Organisation (IHEYO).\n\nThe name of the IHEU may soon change, as delegates at the organization's 2017 General Assembly passed a resolution \"mandating the Board to oversee a transition to a revised identity for the organization\".\n\nThe aim of the IHEU is to \"build, support and represent the global humanist movement, defending human rights, particularly those of non-religious people, and promoting humanist values world-wide\". As a campaigning NGO the IHEU aims \"to influence international policy through representation and information, to build the humanist network, and let the world know about the worldview of Humanism.\"\n\nIn 2012 the IHEU began publishing an annual report on \"discrimination against humanists, atheists and the non-religious\" called The Freedom of Thought Report.\n\nThe report centres around a \"Country Index\" with a textual entry for every sovereign state.\n\nEach country is measured against a list of 64 boundary conditions, which are categorised into four thematic categories (\"Constitution and government\", \"Education and children's rights\", \"Family, community, society, religious courts and tribunals\", and \"Freedom of expression, advocacy of humanist values\") at five levels of overall \"severity\" (\"Free and equal\", \"Mostly satisfactory\", \"Systemic discrimination\", \"Severe discrimination\" and \"Grave violations\"). The 64 boundary conditions include for example: \"‘Apostasy’ or conversion from a specific religion is outlawed and punishable by death\", which is placed at the worst level of severity, and under the category \"Freedom of expression\", and: \"There is state funding of at least some religious schools\", which is a middle severity condition, under the category \"Education and children's rights\". The data from the report is freely available under a Creative Commons license.\n\nIn 2017, the report found that 30 countries meet at least one boundary condition at the most severe level (\"Grave violations\"), and a further 55 countries met at least one boundary condition in the next most severe level (\"Severe discrimination\").\nThe various annual editions of the Freedom of Thought Report have been reported in the media under headlines such as: \"How the right to deny the existence of God is under threat globally\" (the Independent, UK); \"Most countries fail to respect rights of atheists – report\" (Christian Today); and \"Stephen Fry's mockery of religion could land him the death penalty in these countries\" (the Washington Post). The report has received coverage in the national media of countries that are severely criticised, for example \"Malaysia's free thought, religious expression under 'serious assault', study shows\" (the Malay Mail).\n\nForewords and prefaces to the various annual editions of report have been written by then-United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Heiner Bielefeldt, in 2012; two victims of \"blasphemy\" accusations, Kacem El Ghazzali and Alber Saber in 2013; human rights defenders Gulalai Ismail and Agnes Ojera in 2014; humanist activist and survivor of an anti-secularist machete attack in Bangladesh, Rafida Ahmed Bonya (2015); and United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Ahmed Shaheed, in 2016. In 2015 and 2016 the annual edition of the Freedom of Thought Report was launched at the European Parliament in Brussels hosted by the European Parliamentary Intergroup on Freedom of Religion or Belief and Religious Tolerance chaired by Dennis de Jong MEP.\n\nIn his foreword to the first edition of the Freedom of Thought Report, Heiner Bielefeldt wrote: \"As a universal human right, freedom of religion or belief has a broad application. However, there seems to be little awareness that this right also provides a normative frame of reference for atheists, humanists and freethinkers and their convictions, practices and organizations. I am therefore delighted that for the first time the Humanist community has produced a global report on discrimination against atheists. I hope it will be given careful consideration by everyone concerned with freedom of religion or belief.\"\n\nAt a panel event at the European Parliament for the launch of the 2015 edition, Bielefeldt said he \"unambiguously welcomed\" the report and reiterated with regard to \"freedom of religion or belief\" that it is \"only a kind of short-hand\", and \"Formulations such as \"religious freedom\" obfuscate the scope of this human right which covers the identity-shaping, profound convictions and conviction-based practices of human beings broadly.\"\n\nThe report was the subject of a question in the UK Parliament in 2013, to which David Lidington MP responded for the government asserting, \"Our freedom of religion or belief policy is consistent with the key message of the International Humanist and Ethical Union's (IHEU) report: that international human rights law exists to protect the rights of individuals to manifest their beliefs, not to protect the beliefs themselves. The report records a sharp increase in the number of prosecutions for alleged criticism of religion by atheists on social media. Protecting freedom of expression online is a priority for the British Government and we have consistently argued against attempts to create a new international standard in order to protect religions from criticism.\"\n\nThe IHEU denies it is an Islamophobic organisation, and that its criticism of the tenets of Islam is an acceptable use of freedom of speech . The 2018 Freedom of Thought report , which focuses mainly on the treatment of religious and non-religious minorities in Muslim countries, has, however, been condemned for being openly Islamophobic in its coverage of the application of \"Sharia\"-based laws in the Islamic Republic of Iran . The report, which was largely unsourced, and whose research methodology is not given, cited the \"testimony\" of an atheist woman claiming that atheists in Iran were being sentenced to death for admitting their lack of belief: no cases involving the prosecution of persons in Iran simply for declaring their atheism have been reported by civil rights groups. The report also made a number of other spurious and dubious claims such as that members of the Baha'i sect, which is not recognised as a religion in Iran, could be killed with impunity under Islamic law and that atheists could be put to death for the crime of \"Moharebeh\" (waging war on God), even though this refers only to those who violently taken up arms against the authorities and not the non-religious or religious dissenters. Like many other human rights groups, the report confuses \"Sharia\" - the Muslim code of practice and way of life - with the implementation of corporal punishments (Hadd/Hudud) such as flogging and amputation. Muslims have repeatedly objected to the way in which the \"Sharia\" that they follow is caricatured in terms of certain physical penalties like these .\n\nRecurring themes of the IHEU's advocacy and campaigns work include LGBTI rights and women's rights, sexual and reproductive health and rights, laws against blasphemy and apostasy, caste-based discrimination, slavery, and advocacy of secularism.\n\nIndividuals persecuted for expressing their non-religious views (actual or perceived) have frequently been the subject of IHEU campaigns. Some prominent cases include:\nThe IHEU delegation at the United Nations Human Rights Council has repeatedly raised the imprisonment and corporal punishment of Raif Badawi for \"insulting religion\", and Waleed Abulkhair for \"disrespecting the authorities\", both in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe IHEU similarly highlights cases where individuals are accused of \"apostasy\", such as the blogger Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir currently on death row in Mauritania, and the poet Ashraf Fayadh currently imprisoned in Saudi Arabia. In June 2016 at the 32nd session of the Human Rights Council the IHEU's delegate took the unusual step of reading one of Ashraf Fayadh's poems during General Debate.\n\nThe IHEU complained that fundamentalists linked to the government were \"terrorising\" secular activists, including individuals in connection with IHEU Member Organisations, as far back as 2006. However, a series of machete attacks primarily targeting secular and atheist bloggers and freethinkers in Bangladesh has been especially severe since 2013, and the IHEU has campaigned persistently in response and highlighted the murders at the UN Human Rights Council.\n\nThe IHEU responded in 2013 to the murder of blogger and activist Ahmed Rajib Haider and the machete attack on his friend Asif Mohiuddin, and highlighted the subsequent arrest and imprisonment of Mohiuddin and others for \"hurting religious sentiments\".\n\nWhen author and prominent leader of the Bengali freethought movement Avijit Roy was murdered, 26 February 2015, the IHEU revealed that he had been advising them on the situation in Bangladesh; the IHEU's Director of Communications commented, \"This loss is keenly felt by freethinkers and humanists in South Asia and around the world. He was a colleague in humanism and a friend to all who respect human rights, freedom, and the light of reason.\"\n\nFollowing the murder of Washiqur Rahman Babu (or Oyasiqur Rhaman), 30 March 2015, the IHEU republished some of his final writings.\n\nFollowing the murder of Ananta Bijoy Das, 12 May 2016, the IHEU leaked parts of the letter Bijoy Das had recently received from Sweden rejecting his visa application, despite his having being invited to the country by Swedish PEN. The IHEU highlighted \"the failures of the Bangladeshi authorities to bring to justice the individuals and to break the networks behind this string of targeted killings\", and also criticised Sweden's rejection of his visa application, commenting, \"We call on all countries to recognise the legitimacy and sometimes the urgency and moral necessity of asylum claims made by humanists, atheists and secularists who are being persecuted for daring to express those views.\"\n\nFollowing the murder of Niladri Chattopadhyay Niloy (or Niloy Chatterjee, also known by his pen name Niloy Neel), 7 August 2015, the IHEU again attacked the government and authorities, saying, \"Apparent failure to pursue the most obvious lines of inquiry even when initial arrests are made, and media manipulation resulting in conflicting stories, further makes reportage difficult and police operations opaque.\"\n\nA coordinated attack against two separate publishing houses in Dhaka, 31 October 2016, killed the publisher Faisal Arefin Dipon and seriously injured the publisher Ahmedur Rashid Chowdhury. The IHEU later published an interview with Chowdhury about the attack and his escape to Norway.\n\nIn August 2015 the IHEU coordinated a joint open letter in English and Bangla by a coalition of \"Bloggers, free speech campaigners, humanist associations, religious and ex-Muslim groups\" calling on the president and prime minister of Bangladesh to \"ensure the safety and security of those individuals whose lives are threatened by Islamist extremists... instruct the police to find the killers, not to harass or blame the victims... disassociate yourself publicly from those who call for death penalties against non-religious Bangladeshis...\" and repeal the laws under which secular bloggers faced arrest and imprisonment.\n\nFollowing the murder of a student and secular activist Nazimuddin Samad, 6 April 2016, and then the murder of university lecturer Professor Rezaul Karim Siddique, 23 April 2016, the IHEU's president Andrew Copson said \"Unless the government [of Bangladesh] immediately begins to defend the right to speak and write freely, without adding the unprincipled and anti-secular qualifications that it keeps applying to freedom of expression, then very soon the only voices that will be heard will be those of murderous extremists.\"\n\nThe IHEU, along with the IHEU Member Organisation the Dutch Humanist Association, and Hague Peace Projects, organised a \"solidarity book fair\" in The Hague, 26 February 2016, to coincide with the annual Ekushey Book Fair in Dhaka.\n\nThe range of targets for these attacks began to broaden in the later part of 2015 and throughout 2016 to more often include minority religious individuals and foreigners, culminating in the July 2016 Dhaka attack in Gulshan Thana.\n\nIn January 2015, in part as a response to the Charlie Hebdo shooting, the IHEU alongside other transnational secular groups the European Humanist Federation and Atheist Alliance International and a two-hundred strong organisational coalition, founded the End Blasphemy Laws Campaign. End Blasphemy Laws is \"campaigning to repeal \"blasphemy\" and related laws worldwide.\"\n\nThe \"First World Conference on Untouchability\" was organised by the IHEU in London, June 2009. Anticipating the event, the BBC News quoted then-Executive Director of the IHEU Babu Gogineni as saying that legal reforms alone would not end caste discrimination: \"There are Dalit politicians in India, but nothing has changed. The answer is to educate Dalits and empower them.\" The event was preceded by questions in the UK Parliament and guests included Lord Desai and Lord Avebury from the UK House of Lords; Binod Pahadi, Member of the Constituent Assembly, Nepal; and Tina Ramirez, US Congressional Fellow on International Religious Freedom. The Second World Conference on Untouchability was held in Kathmandu, in April 2014.\n\nIn 2013 the IHEU criticised the US-based Appeal of Conscience Foundation for awarding their \"World Statesman Award\" to then-president of Indonesia Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono; IHEU argued that the award \"is a slap in the face to prisoners of conscience across the world. While Alexander Aan suffers in an Indonesian jail for posting his beliefs to Facebook, his jailer will be honored in New York as a champion of freedom of belief.\"\n\nIn 2014 the IHEU as part of a \"coalition of secular groups\" led a campaign around the hashtag \"#TwitterTheocracy\" to protest the social media website Twitter's implementation of tools blocking \"blasphemous\" tweets in Pakistan.\n\nThe IHEU makes a number of regular and occasional special awards.\n\nThe International Humanist Award recognises outstanding achievements and contributions to the progress and defence of Humanism.\n\n\nThe Distinguished Service to Humanism Award recognises the contributions of Humanist activists to International Humanism and to organised Humanism.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "511595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=511595", "title": "List of Enochian angels", "text": "List of Enochian angels\n\nEnochian angels are entities described in the Enochian magic system, introduced in the sixteenth century by John Dee (1527–1608) and Edward Kelley (1555–1597).\n\nJohn Dee was born a Christian, and this can be seen throughout his journals and his \"Enochian\" system of Angel Magic. Therein, we find an obvious belief in the Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). We also find a fourth Supreme Being in the figure of \"Galvah\" (Omega) — who is also called the Mother, Wisdom and \"I AM\" in Dee's journals. This figure is known in Judaism as the Shekhinah — Divine Presence; to the Gnostics as Sophia — Wisdom; and to the Hermetic Qabalah as Aima Elohim — Mother of the gods. Compare Theotokos, Mother of God, in Catholic beliefs.\n\nBeneath these four Divinities are several hierarchies of angels, or intelligent rulers, set over such things as the Planets, the Stars and the four Quarters of the Earth.\n\nThe angels of the four quarters are symbolized by the \"Watchtowers\" — four large magical word-square Tables (collectively called the Great Table of the Earth). Most of the well-known Enochian Angels are drawn from the Watchtowers of the Great Table.\n\nEach of the four Watchtowers is collectively governed by six Seniors (aka Elders) — making a total of 24 Elders as seen in the Revelation of St. John. Each Watchtower is further divided into four sub-quadrants, where we find the names of various Archangels and Angels who govern the quarters of the world. In this way, the entire universe, visible and invisible, is teeming with living intelligences.\n\nThe names of the Enochian angels are drawn from a number of enciphered tables, received through the \"spirit actions\" of John Dee, Edward Kelly, and occasionally another scryer. The Watchtower set of angels is one of the larger and better developed sets. A problem arises in that there are several variations on the Watchtowers themselves and several ways of drawing the names therefrom. The four Watchtowers were first received on 25 June 1584. This arrangement and order is reflected in Dee's prayer - The Fundamental Obeisance. They were then rearranged slightly and corrected in the days following: 26 June through 2 July 1584; this arrangement corresponds to the majority of prayers in Sloane MS. 3191 (The Book of Earthly Victory and Science) and is what is given in the published versions of that text, notably Geoffrey James' \"Enochian Evocation\" / \"Magick\" and Robert Turner's \"Elizabethan Magic\". Late in the course of Dee and Kelly's work together, on 19 April 1587, the Archangel Raphael, was said to have appeared, and reformed the Watchtowers, rearranging their order and directions and making some minor corrections. It is this arrangement that is used in the Golden Dawn and subsequent derivatives such as Thelema, Wicca and the Church of Satan. The Golden Dawn also follows a slightly different method of drawing forth some of the names from the Tables. The Golden Dawn method of extracting the names, is heavily influenced by the post Dee text contained in Sloane MS. 307 and published by Stephen Skinner and David Rankine as \"Practical Angel Magic of Dr John Dee's Enochian Tables\". For convenience sake, in identifying these variations when they differ, the received set is labelled Received, the set reflected in Sloane MS. 3191 is labelled Orthodox, the set reformed by Raphael as Reformed and the variations used by the Golden Dawn as GD. The Angelic Hierarchies of the Watchtowers are also set out in several visions of Edward Kelly's and enshrined in a Talisman constructed by John Dee, published in \"A True & Faithful Relation\" and on display in the British Museum collection.\n\nThis is a list of the names of Enochian angels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"John Dee's actions with spirits: 22 December 1581 to 23 May 1583.\" edt. & trans.

{"id": "15625048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15625048", "title": "List of satanic ritual abuse allegations", "text": "List of satanic ritual abuse allegations\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s a moral panic about alleged Satanic ritual abuse (SRA) occurred, mainly in parts of the English-speaking world. This was propagated by certain psychotherapists, social workers, Christian fundamentalists and law enforcement officials. Some of the cases ended in prosecution and imprisonment. Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States have had several incidents of alleged SRA which received national and international news coverage. Other countries have also had isolated events in which abuse or murder took place with Satanic ritual elements, including Argentina and Brazil.\n\nIn 1991, police in Perth linked Scott Gozenton, a self-professed Satanist, with organised child sexual abuse. His lawyer claimed 13 Satanic covens existed in the area, holding bizarre orgies involving children, and that Gozenton had been followed and threatened by \"coven\" members throughout the court proceedings.\n\nIn 2001, the Melbourne diocese of the Catholic Church acknowledged as \"substantially true\" allegations that a Melbourne priest took part in Satanic ritual abuse in which a number of deaths occurred in the 1960s, and paid compensation to a surviving victim.\n\nIn 1999, two journalists from the Sun-Herald claimed to have seen evidence of the ritual abuse of children. They interviewed six mothers whose children had disclosed experiences of SRA and organised abuse in New South Wales. The children's disclosures were corroborating, although they had never met one another, and they had been able to draw representations of \"Satanic\" ritual sites which were similar to ritual sites uncovered by police on the central coast of New South Wales. One mother stated that her sons remembered being drugged and hypnotised. \"He said they dressed in black robes and had eye and mouth pieces cut out,\" she said. \"I know they're dangerous people. I have had warnings outside the house telling me to stop investigations. We're fearful for our lives. The boys never want me out of their sight.\"\n\nDuring the investigation of the Belgian serial killer Marc Dutroux, a number of women approached police claiming to be adult survivors of a network of sexual offenders. One witness described satanic ceremonies with a goal of disorienting new victims, causing them to doubt the reality of their memories and prevent disclosure.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Superior Universal Alignment, an Argentinian-based international cult, was implicated in the ritualistic murders of several children. One of the leaders of the group, Osvaldo Marcineiro, confessed to murdering a number of young children in Satanic rituals in which the children were tortured and their body parts cannibalised. A number of prominent citizens were arrested in relation to the murders, and it later emerged that they had paid the cult to conduct the murderous ceremonies. A search of cult member's houses turned up cult registers, guns, hooded cloaks, 100 videotapes of cult ceremonies and satanist publications, including a 200-page book by cult leader Valentina de Andrade called \"God, the Great Farce\". Brazilian authorities suggested that the cult was connected to Satanic groups internationally.\n\nIn 2003, five members of the Superior Universal Alignment cult in the Amazonian town of Altamira were convicted for the ritualistic murders of three children and the castration of two others. The victims were aged between eight and thirteen years, and they were kidnapped, tortured or killed between 1989 and 1993. Their genitals were removed and used in Satanic rituals by 75-year old village clairvoyant, Valentina de Andrade, the leader of the Superior Universal Alignment cult. De Andrade had previously been sought by police in Argentina and Uruguay prior to her arrest in Brazil on suspicion of involvement in other satanic ritual killings.\n\nFollowing the castration of victims, two doctors involved in the sect removed the victim's other organs for sale on the international black market. Other people sentenced in relation to the murders included a former police officer, a businessman and the son of an influential landowner. The charges related to the murders of three young children and the attempted murder of another, however, victim's families say that there were at least nineteen other murdered children. The cult is based in Argentina and has branches in Holland.\n\nOne of the earliest claims of SRA was made in the book \"Michelle Remembers\" co-written by Canadian psychiatrist Lawrence Pazder and Michelle Smith, later Pazder's wife. The book detailed a Satanic cult that allegedly operated in Victoria, British Columbia.\n\nA protracted child custody case contested in family court in Hamilton, Ontario, from 1985-1987, centred on allegations of Satanic ritual abuse; it was later documented in a book written by a Globe and Mail reporter who was assigned to cover the case.\n\nThe Martensville Satanic sex scandal occurred in Martensville, Saskatchewan in 1992, where an allegation of day care sexual abuse hysteria escalated into claims of satanic ritual abuse.\n\nIn 2007, a jury at Dublin Country Coroner's court unanimously ruled that an infant found stabbed to death over three decades ago was the daughter of Cynthia Owen (then 'Sindy Murphy'). The infant was alleged to have been murdered by the infant's grandmother. The Minister of Justice had previously rejected a request by Cynthia Owen to have the body of the child exhumed, a decision Ms. Owen did not contest. The inquest was prohibited from assigning blame due to the Coroners Act of 1962 and therefore returned an open verdict. Also, the jury was instructed that the standard of proof was not the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" benchmark of criminal trials, but rather the lesser standard of determining whether Owen's claims were true based \"on the balance of probabilities\". Ms. Owen made claims about a stillborn second child buried in the family garden, but police found no human remains after digging up the plot. Owen's parents, as well as her older siblings, denied her allegations of abuse.\n\nDuring the trial, Owen provided her account of incest, organised abuse, and satanic ritual abuse orchestrated by her parents involving at least nine other men and her account was supported by her psychologist. She claimed that her brother, Michael, and sister, Theresa, were also abused, a charge that was denied by her older brother and father. One of the alleged abusers is Cynthia Owen's older brother, Peter Murphy Junior, while the father, Peter Murphy Senior, is also an alleged abuser. One brother, Martin, committed suicide in 1995 after revealing he had been sodomised in his family home, while another brother, Michael, disappeared in 2002 and sister Theresa committed suicide shortly after the discovery of his body in 2005; Theresa's detailed 37-paged suicide note corroborated Cynthia's account. A friend of Theresa's testified at the trial, stating that Theresa had spoken to him at length about her sexual abuse in childhood. Theresa Murphy committed suicide on February 24, 2005 as a result of childhood sexual abuse, this finding was supported by police evidence. Theresa was the child of her older sister, Margaret Murphy.\n\nFollowing the findings of the Coroner's Court, Owen has raised questions regarding the disposal of her daughter's body and the failure of the police to investigate the murder. In particular, she has highlighted the fact that no blood or tissue samples were kept, that the bag and sanitary towels found alongside the murdered child have gone missing, that the records of the first inquest into the murder have gone missing, and that her daughter was buried in a mass grave alongside other infants. Owen claimed that the police knew about the murder and did nothing. She also stated that she felt robbed of justice by her mother's natural and peaceful death.\n\nOwen's father, Peter Murphy Senior, and three of her sisters won the right to appeal the findings of the inquest from the High Court. The family claimed that the coroner was biased toward Owen, shielded her when giving evidence and was selective in the evidence presented to the jury. The case of the murdered child was reported in 2008, and in 2013, to be the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Garda Síochána. \n\nPeter Murphy Senior has since died.\n\nIn 1998, six adults in Emilia-Romagna were arrested with allegations of prostituting their children and the production of child pornography. The children were also reported to be involved in Satanic rituals. In 2002, four people were arrested for \"Satanism and paedophilia\" in Pescara. Police believed that the group may have abused dozens of children in rituals involving bodies stolen from ceremonies. In April 2007, six people were arrested for sexually abusing fifteen children in Rignano Flaminio. The suspects were accused of filming the children engaged in sexual acts with 'Satanic' overtones.\n\nIn 1989 a group of parents published allegations in a conservative magazine that their children had witnessed SRA and had been ritually abused from May, 1987 until October 1988 in Oude Pekela, a city in the north-eastern province of Groningen, the Netherlands. During the initial investigation, only the non-ritual aspects were reported in the press and investigated by the authorities and the allegations were unconfirmed. In 1989 the conservative Christian news program \"Tijdsein\" reported allegations that included Satanic ritual abuse, to which there was no official response. After attending a conference in which the concept of satanic ritual abuse was discussed, Oude Pekela general practitioners Fred Jonker and Ietje Jonker-Bakker alleged that several children had been abused by unknown men in the context of Satanic rituals. This was first reported in a lecture at the Institute of Education of London University and later published in several academic journals in both English and Dutch, but their findings were heavily criticised by American and Dutch scholars. National authorities were informed in 1991 and 1992 of the allegations, though no action was taken until the press was informed. The State Secretary of Justice responded to the allegations by appointing the \"Werkgroep Ritueel Misbruik\" multidisciplinary workgroup to study SRA in the Netherlands, which produced a report in 1994. The report concluded that it was unlikely SRA had occurred or the allegations were factually true, suggested the allegations were a defence mechanism produced in part by suggestive questioning by 'believing' therapists, and that the stories were contemporary legends dispersed through a network of therapists and patients who were concerned with dissociative identity disorder.\n\nIn 1990, Gert van Rooyen and his accomplice were accused of murdering several young girls, ultimately committing suicide while running from the police. One of the accused's sons was later himself accused of murdering a Zimbabwean girl in 1991; the same son claimed his father's victims were involved in international child pornography rings, slavery and Satanism rituals, but no evidence of this was found. The case was so similar to crimes committed by Marc Dutroux that multiple agencies investigated a possible international smuggling ring in prostituted children and body parts.\n\nThere have been a number of cases in the United Kingdom in which SRA has been alleged. Some of these cases have garnered significant media attention, and they are listed below.\n\nThe National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children documented allegations of ritual abuse in 1990, with the publication of survey findings that, of 66 child protection teams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 14 teams had received reports of ritual abuse from children and seven of them were working directly with children who had been ritually abused, sometimes in groups of 20. An investigation into SRA allegations by the British government produced over two hundred reports, of which only three were substantiated and proved to be examples of pseudosatanic, in which sexual abuse was the actual motivation and the rituals were incidental.\n\nThe Cleveland child abuse scandal featured allegations of satanic ritual abuse.\n\nIn 1990 there was a case in Rochdale which around twenty children were removed from their homes by social services who alleged the existence of SRA after discovering 'Satanic indicators'. No evidence was found of Satanic apparatus, and charges were dismissed when a court ruled the allegations were untrue. The children who were removed from their homes sued the city council in 2006 for compensation and an apology.\n\nIn 1990-1991 nine children suspected of being sexually abused by their families and an alleged child abuse ring were removed by social services in Orkney. The abuse was also alleged to involve \"ritualistic elements\". The parents approached the media and made the case national and international news. In April 1991, a sheriff ruled that the evidence was seriously flawed and the children were returned home.\n\nIn June, social services appealed the sheriff's ruling but the appeal was overturned and an official inquiry was established in August 1991, which after 9 months' investigation at a cost of £6 million, published its report in October 1992. It described the dismissal of the first judgment as \"most unfortunate\" and criticized all those involved, including the social workers, the police, and the Orkney Islands Council. Social workers' training, methods, and judgment were given special condemnation, and the report stated that the concept of \"ritual abuse\" was \"not only unwarrantable at present but may affect the objectivity of practitioners and parents\". A 1994 government report based on three years of research found that there was no foundation to any of the Satanic abuse claims.\n\nIn October 1987 children were removed from their families in Nottingham, and in February 1989 a Broxtowe family was charged with multigenerational child sexual abuse and neglect. A 600-page report on the incident concluded that there was no evidence of the SRA claims made by children or corroborating adults. Though the children may have been 'sadistically terrorized', allegations of organized Satanic abuse were found to be baseless and the indicators used by the Social Services department were without validity.\n\nIn 2003 allegations by three children in Lewis, Scotland resulted in the arrest of eight people for sexual abuse occurring between 1990 and 2000. A 2005 investigation by the Social Work Inspection Agency found extensive evidence of sexual, physical and emotional abuse and neglect. Police investigation resulted in allegations of an island-wide \"Satanic paedophile ring\", though charges were dropped nine months later following an inconclusive investigation.\n\nA key witness who had implicated her family in the abuse and whose evidence was \"vital\" to the case of satanic abuse recanted her testimony in 2006 and the media raised questions about the nature of the police interviewing techniques. with a police spokesperson replying that the witness was questioned appropriately and that allegations were made by numerous witnesses.\n\nIn March 2011, four adults who lived in a cul-de-sac in the Welsh town of Kidwelly were convicted of multiple sex offences against children and young adults. The group led by Colin Batley was described by the media as a \"Satanic sex cult\", a \"quasi-religious sex cult\" and a \"paedophile cult\" however the group members were not followers of Satanism. The prosecution said they practised \"free sex\" and were influenced by Aleister Crowley, a practitioner of ceremonial magic who founded the belief system of Thelema. They dressed in hoods and read from Crowley's \"The Book of the Law\", the central text of Thelema and some victims were made to wear inverted crosses. Members of the cult were initiated in a ceremony involving sex with an adult, and they were threatened with being killed if they did not take part in the ceremony. Some of the victims were forced into prostitution. The abuse also took place outside of a ritual context, such as Batley taking victims to a caravan to rape, in line with Jean La Fontaine's findings and her conclusion that sexual gratification, not religion, is the motive of abusers.\n\nIn the United States, major allegations of Satanic ritual abuse occurred in the Kern County child abuse cases, McMartin preschool trial and the West Memphis 3, which garnered world-wide media coverage. It was eventually determined that no satanic abuse ever took place in these cases due to false testimony and police misconduct. There have been countless, debunked allegations of SRA in the United States; of which the most recent allegation was Pizzagate; a speculated pedophile ring in the Washington D.C area at supposed ping pong themed restaurant, Comet Ping Pong. In the allegations, Hillary Clinton was an avid supporter and member in the pedophilia ring, with various sources of selected evidence pointing to her possible involvement and the possible involvement of Clinton's associations. \n\nThe first such case occurred in Jordan, Minnesota, in 1983, where several children made allegations against an unrelated man and their parents. The man confessed and then identified a number of the children’s parents as perpetrators. Ultimately twenty-four adults were charged with child abuse though only three went to trial with two acquittals and one conviction. Despite strong medical findings of sexual assault, all other charges were dropped after the young child witnesses decompensated under the duress of the criminal trial.\n\nDuring the investigation, the children made allegations regarding the manufacturing of child pornography, ritualistic animal sacrifice, coprophagia, urophagia and infanticide, at which point the Federal Bureau of Investigation was alerted. No criminal charges resulted from the FBI investigation, and in his review of the case, the Attorney General noted that the initial investigation by the local police and county attorney was so poor that it had destroyed the opportunity to fully investigate the children’s allegations.\n\nJudge Antonin Scalia referred to the Minnesota case in his summation on a later case, and stated, \"[t]here is no doubt that some sexual abuse took place in Jordan; but there is no reason to believe it was as widespread as charged,\" and cited the repeated, well-intentioned but coercive techniques used by the investigators as damaging to the investigation. The bizarre allegations of the children, the ambiguities of the investigation and the unsuccessful prosecutions were widely covered by the media. A number of accused parents confessed to sexually abusing their children, received immunity, and underwent treatment for sexual abuse, while parental rights for six other children in the case were terminated.\n\nIn December 2007, Austin Trey Bernard was found guilty of raping his son and daughter, convicted on the basis of three previous confessions and a detailed diary of his actions although he pleaded not guilty. The allegations came to light upon the confession of one of the defendants. Bernard confessed the sexual abuse of his children as well as claiming to have participated in satanically-themed ritualistic abuse including the use of animal parts and blood.\n\n"}

This theory began in the 18th century with the goal of recognizing the relative levels of civility in societies.\n\nIn world cultures, there have traditionally been many different groupings of religious belief. In Indian culture, different religious philosophies were traditionally respected as academic differences in pursuit of the same truth. In Islam, the Quran mentions three different categories: Muslims, the People of the Book, and idol worshipers. Initially, Christians had a simple dichotomy of world beliefs: Christian civility versus foreign heresy or barbarity. In the 18th century, \"heresy\" was clarified to mean Judaism and Islam; along with paganism, this created a fourfold classification which spawned such works as John Toland's \"Nazarenus, or Jewish, Gentile, and Mahometan Christianity\", which represented the three Abrahamic religions as different \"nations\" or sects within \"religion\" itself, the \"true monotheism.\"\n\nDaniel Defoe described the original definition as follows: \"Religion is properly the Worship given to God, but 'tis also applied to the Worship of Idols and false Deities.\" At the turn of the 19th century, in between 1780 and 1810, the language dramatically changed: instead of \"religion\" being synonymous with spirituality, authors began using the plural, \"religions,\" to refer to both Christianity and other forms of worship. Therefore, Hannah Adams's early encyclopedia, for example, had its name changed from \"An Alphabetical Compendium of the Various Sects...\" to \"A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations\".\n\nIn 1838, the four-way division of Christianity, Judaism, Mahommedanism (archaic terminology for Islam) and Paganism was multiplied considerably by Josiah Conder's \"Analytical and Comparative View of All Religions Now Extant among Mankind\". Conder's work still adhered to the four-way classification, but in his eye for detail he puts together much historical work to create something resembling our modern Western image: he includes Druze, Yezidis, Mandeans, and Elamites under a list of possibly monotheistic groups, and under the final category, of \"polytheism and pantheism,\" he listed Zoroastrianism, \"Vedas, Puranas, Tantras, Reformed sects\" of India as well as \"Brahminical idolatry,\" Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Lamaism, \"religion of China and Japan,\" and \"illiterate superstitions\" as others.\n\nThe modern meaning of the phrase \"world religion,\" putting non-Christians at the same level as Christians, began with the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago. The Parliament spurred the creation of a dozen privately funded lectures with the intent of informing people of the diversity of religious experience: these lectures funded researchers such as William James, D. T. Suzuki, and Alan Watts, who greatly influenced the public conception of world religions.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the category of \"world religion\" fell into serious question, especially for drawing parallels between vastly different cultures, and thereby creating an arbitrary separation between the religious and the secular. Even history professors have now taken note of these complications and advise against teaching \"world religions\" in schools. Others see the shaping of religions in the context of the nation-state as the \"invention of traditions.\"\n\nReligious traditions fall into super-groups in comparative religion, arranged by historical origin and mutual influence. Abrahamic religions originate in West Asia, Indian religions in the Indian subcontinent (South Asia) and East Asian religions in East Asia. Another group with supra-regional influence are Afro-American religion, which have their origins in Central and West Africa.\n\n\nOne way to define a major religion is by the number of current adherents. The population numbers by religion are computed by a combination of census reports and population surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example the United States or France), but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey.

{"id": "590270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=590270", "title": "Miko", "text": "Miko\n\nIn Shinto, a miko (巫女) is a shrine (jinja) maiden or a supplementary priestess. Miko were once likely seen as a shaman but are understood in modern Japanese culture to be an institutionalized role in daily shrine life, trained to perform tasks, ranging from sacred cleansing to performing the sacred Kagura dance.\n\nThe traditional attire of a \"miko\" would be a pair of red hakama (long, divided trousers) or a long, red, slightly pleated skirt tied with a bow, a white haori (kimono jacket), and some white or red hair ribbons. In Shintoism, the color white symbolizes purity.\n\nTraditional Miko tools include azusayumi (梓弓 or “catalpa bow”) the tamagushi (玉串 or “offertory sakaki-tree branches”) and the gehōbako (外法箱 or the “supernatural box that contains dolls, animal and human skulls ... [and] Shinto prayer beads”).\n\nThe miko also use bells, drums, candles, and bowls of rice in ceremonies.\n\nThe Japanese words \"miko\" and \"fujo\" (\"female shaman\" and \"shrine maiden\" respectively) are usually written 巫女 as a compound of the kanji 巫 (\"shaman\"), and 女 (\"woman\"). \"Miko\" was archaically written 神子 (literally \"kami\" or \"god\" + \"child\") and 巫子 (\"shaman child\").\n\n\"Miko\" once performed spirit possession and \"takusen\" as vocational functions in their service to shrines. As time passed, they left the shrines and began working independently in secular society. Miko at shrines today do no more than sit at reception counters and perform kagura dance. In addition to a medium or a miko (or a Geki, which is a male shaman), the site of a \"takusen\" may occasionally also be attended by a sayaniwa who interprets the words of the possessed person to make them comprehensible to other people present. Kamigakari and takusen may be passive, when a person speaks after suddenly becoming involuntarily possessed or has a dream revelation; they can also be active, when spirit possession is induced in a specific person to ascertain the divine will or gain a divine revelation.\n\nMiko are known by many names; Fairchild lists 26 terms for \"shrine-attached Miko\" and 43 for \"non-shrine-attached Miko\". Other names are \"ichiko\" (巫子, \"shaman child\", or 市子, \"market/town child\", both likely instances of ateji) meaning \"female medium; fortuneteller\", and \"reibai\" (霊媒) meaning \"spirit go-between, medium\").\n\nIn English, the word is often translated as \"shrine maiden\", though freer renderings often simply use the phrase \"female shaman\" (shamanka) or, as Lafcadio Hearn translated it, \"Divineress\".\n\nSome scholars prefer the transliteration, contrasting the Japanese Mikoism with other Asian terms for female shamans. As Fairchild explains:\n\nWomen played an important role in a region stretching from Manchuria, China, Korea and Japan to the Ryukyu Islands. In Japan these women were priests, soothsayers, magicians, prophets and shamans in the folk religion, and they were the chief performers in organized Shintoism. These women were called Miko, and the author calls the complex \"Mikoism\" for lack of a suitable English word.\n\nMiko traditions date back to the prehistoric Jōmon period of Japan, when female shamans who would go into “trances and convey the words of the gods” (the kami), an act comparable with \"the pythia or sibyl in Ancient Greece.\"\n\nThe earliest record of anything resembling the term \"miko\", is of the Chinese reference to Himiko, Japan's earliest substantiated historical reference (not legendary), however it is completely unknown whether Himiko was a miko, or even if miko existed in those days.\n\nThe early Miko was an important social figure who was \"associated with the ruling class\". \"In addition to her ritual performances of ecstatic trance\", writes Kuly, \"[the Miko] performed a variety of religious and political functions\". One traditional school of Miko, Kuly adds, \"claimed to descend from the Goddess Uzume\".\n\nDuring the Nara period (710–794) and Heian period (794–1185), government officials tried to control Miko practices. As Fairchild notes:\n\nIn 780 A.D. and in 807 A.D. official bulls against the practice of ecstasy outside of the authority of the shrines were published. These bulls were not only aimed at ecstasy, but were aimed at magicians, priests, sorcerers, etc. It was an attempt to gain complete control, while at the same time it aimed at eradicating abuses which were occurring.\n\nDuring the feudal Kamakura period (1185–1333) when Japan was controlled by warring \"shōgun\" states:\n\nThe Miko was forced into a state of mendicancy as the shrines and temples that provided her with a livelihood fell into bankruptcy. Disassociated from a religious context, her performance moved further away from a religious milieu and more toward one of a non-ecclesiastical nature. The travelling Miko, known as the aruki Miko, became associated with prostitution.\n\nDuring in the Edo period (1603–1868), writes Groemer, \"the organizational structures and arts practiced by female shamans in eastern Japan underwent significant transformations\". Though in the Meiji period (1868–1912), many shamanistic practices were outlawed:\n\nAfter 1867 the Meiji government's desire to create a form of state Shinto headed by the emperor—the shaman-in-chief of the nation—meant that Shinto needed to be segregated from both Buddhism and folk-religious beliefs. As a result, official discourse increasingly repeated negative views of Miko and their institutions.\n\nThere was an edict called \"Miko Kindanrei\" (巫女禁断令) enforced by security forces loyal to Imperial forces, forbidding all spiritual practices by miko, issued in 1873, by the Religious Affairs Department (教部).\n\nThe Shinto kagura dance ceremony, which originated with \"ritual dancing to convey divine oracles\", has been transformed in the 20th century into a popular ceremonial dance called Miko-mai (巫女舞) or Miko-kagura (巫女神楽).\n\nThe position of a shaman passed from generation to generation, but sometimes someone not directly descended from a shaman went voluntary into training or was appointed by the village chieftains. To achieve this, such a person had to have some potential. Several characteristics could be seen as a sign a person was called towards shamanism: neurosis, hallucinations, unusual behavior and hysteria. These conditions are still referred to as \"‘shamanistic sicknesses’\".\n\nTo become a shaman, the girl (still at a young age, mostly after the start of the menstruation cycle) had to undergo very intensive training specific to the \"kuchiyose miko\". An acknowledged elder shaman, who could be a family member (like an aunt) of a member of the tribe, would teach the girl in training the techniques required to be in control of her trance state. This would be done by rituals including washings with cold water, regular purifying, abstinence and the observation of the common taboos like death, illness and blood. She would also study how to communicate with \"kami\" and spirits of the deceased, as a medium, by being possessed by those spirits. This was achieved by chanting and dancing, thus therefore the girl was taught melodies and intonations that were used in songs, prayers and magical formulas, supported by drum and rattlers. \n\nOther attributes used for rituals were mirrors (to attract the kami) and swords (katana). She also needed the knowledge of the several names of the kami that were important for her village, as well as their function. Finally she learned a secret language, only known by insiders (other shamans of the tribe) and so discovered the secrets of fortune-telling and magical formulas.\nAfter the training, which could take three to seven years, the girl would get her initiation rite to become a real shaman. This mystic ceremony was witnessed by her mentor, other elders and fellow shamans. The girl wore a white shroud as a symbol for the end of her previous life. The elders began chanting and after a while the girl started to shiver. Next, her mentor would ask the girl which \"kami\" had possessed her and therefore she would serve. As soon as she answered, the mentor would throw a rice cake into her face, causing the girl to faint. The elders would bring the girl to a warm bed and keep her warm until she woke up. When the whole ordeal was over and the girl had woken up, she was permitted to wear a beautifully coloured wedding dress and perform the corresponding tradition of the wedding toast.\n\nThe resemblance of a wedding ceremony as the initiation rite suggests that the trainee, still a virgin, had become the bride of the kami she served (this is called a \"Tamayori Hime\" 玉依姫). During her trance, said kami had requested the girl to his shrine. In some areas of Japan she had to bring a pot filled with rice (\"meshibitsu\") and a pan. An old, since long forsaken, practice was the sexual intercourse with a shintô priest who would represent the kami. As a result of this intercourse, the shaman would have the \"kami’s\" baby (\"mikogami\" 御子神 ). \n\nIn some cases the girls or women were visited at night by a travelling spirit (\"marebito\" 稀人). After this visit the woman made her new position of being possessed by a \"kami\" known to the rest of her village by placing a white, feathered arrow on the roof of her house.\n\nModern miko are often seen at Shinto shrines, where they assist with shrine functions, perform ceremonial dances, offer \"omikuji\" fortune telling, sell souvenirs, and assist a Kannushi in Shinto rites. Kuly describes the contemporary miko: \"A far distant relative of her premodern shamanic sister, she is most probably a university student collecting a modest wage in this part-time position.\"\n\nThe ethnologist Kunio Yanagita (1875–1962), who first studied Japanese female shamans, differentiated them into \"jinja miko\" (神社巫女 or \"shrine shamans\") who dance with bells and participate in \"yudate\" (湯立て or \"boiling water\") rituals, \"kuchiyose miko\" (口寄せ巫女 or \"spirit medium shamans\") who speak on behalf of the deceased, and \"kami uba\" (神姥 or \"god women\") who engage in cult worship and invocations (for instance, the Tenrikyo founder Nakayama Miki).\n\nResearchers have further categorized contemporary miko in terms of their diverse traditions and practices. Such categorizations include blind \"itako\" (concentrated in north and east Japan), mostly blind \"okamin\" (north and east Japan), blind \"waka\" or \"owaka\" (northeastern Japan), \"moriko\" (north and east of Tokyo), \"nono\" (central Japan), blind \"zatokaka\" (northwest Japan), \"sasa hataki\" who tap \"sasa\" (\"bamboo grass\") on their faces (northeast of Tokyo), plus family and village organizations. Others have divided miko or fujo by blindness between blind \"ogamiya\" (尾上屋 or \"invocation specialist\") or \"ogamisama\" who perform \"kuchiyose\" and spirit mediumship and sighted miko' or \"kamisama\" who perform divination and invocations.\n\nIn the eclectic Shugendō religion, male priests who practiced ecstasy often married miko. Many scholars identify shamanic miko characteristics in Shinshūkyō (\"New Religions\") such as Sukyo Mahikari, Ōmoto, and Shinmeiaishinkai.\n\n\n\n"}

Addressed \"To All Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, and Bishops of the Catholic World\", it is general in scope.\n\nFelicité Robert de Lamennais, Charles Forbes René de Montalembert and Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire started a newspaper, \"L'Avenir\" (\"The Future\"). While the paper was a strong proponent of Ultramontanism, supporting the authority of the papacy in opposition to nationalist and secularist ideas, it also advocated an enlarged suffrage, separation of church and state, and universal freedom of conscience, instruction, assembly, and the press. They saw no conflict between Catholicism and liberal reform. The conservative French hierarchy regarded such views as dangerous nonsense. In November 1831, Lammennais and Montalembert traveled to Rome, seeking confirmation from Pope Gregory that views expressed in their newspaper were orthodox.\n\nAlthough pressured by the French government and the French hierarchy, Pope Gregory XVI would have preferred not to make an official issue of the matter. After much opposition, they gained an audience on March 15, 1832, only on condition that their political views should not be mentioned. The meeting was apparently cordial and uneventful. Klemens von Metternich, whose Austrian troops ensured the stability of the Papal States, pressed for a condemnation.\n\nThe Pope's advisors were convinced that if he said nothing, it would viewed that he did not disapprove of Lamennais's opinions. \"Mirari vos\" was issued the following August, criticizing Lamennais's views without mentioning him by name.\n\nHe voiced support for Christian freedom, upheld the ecclesiastical supremacy of the papacy and raised concerns over alliances that were too close between the clergy and government. It denounced those who advocated a married clergy: \"We ask that you strive with all your might to justify and to defend the law of clerical celibacy as prescribed by the sacred canons, against which the arrows of the lascivious are directed from every side.\" He also denounced those who advocated divorce and secret societies that sought overturn the legitimate governments of the Italian states.\n\nHe attacked religious indifferentism, which was defined as the opinion that one religion is as good as another, which he saw as the basis for the argument for liberty of conscience. He saw it as the state's duty to restrain the promotion of false truth, which leads to immorality and so denounced freedom to publish or distribute any writings indiscriminately. Owen Chadwick explains Gregory's perspective: \"To provide legally that writers or speakers shall be free to promote what is not true or to utter words that declare that racial prejudice, or paederasty, or pornography, or adultery, or murder not to be sins, cannot be what God demands of any State.\n\nHe stated, \"Some are so carried away that they contentiously assert that the flock of errors arising from them is sufficiently compensated by the publication of some book which defends religion and truth. Every law condemns deliberately doing evil simply because there is some hope that good may result. Is there any sane man who would say poison ought to be distributed, sold publicly, stored, and even drunk because some antidote is available and those who use it may be snatched from death again and again?\n\nThe encyclical satisfied neither Lamennais's supporters nor his detractors.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51920687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51920687", "title": "Multiple religious belonging", "text": "Multiple religious belonging\n\nMultiple religious belonging refers to the idea that individuals can belong to more than one religious tradition. While this is often seen as a common reality in regions such as Asia with its many religions, religious scholars have begun to discuss multiple religion belonging with respect to religious traditions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\n\nIn some religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, those who hold to an exclusivist understanding of religion see multiple religious belonging as problematic. This is in contrast with countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, whose cultures have a long history of being influenced by different religions. Moreover, in the postmodern period people tend to question their identity, because of the unlimited choices of religions, which leads to the difficulty in defining their identity.\n\nVan Bragt showed that 79% of Japanese self-identify as Shintoists and 75% self-identify as Buddhists. The reason for the extremely high percentage of both religions is that many Japanese consider themselves as both a Shintoist and a Buddhist and do not consider it a problem to belong to more than one religion. (Whether this statistic is correct is arguable.) This phenomenon, according to Van Bragt, is a \"division of labour\". Van Bragt argued that the cause of this phenomenon is that, different from the Western concept of religion, Shintoism and Buddhism in Japan are defined by their rituals and practices, not by their moral and social authority. Thus, the Japanese can belong to several religions that do not conflict with each other in terms of social and ethical issues.\n\nScholars such as Catherine Cornille, Peter C. Phan, Francis Xavier Clooney, Jan Van Bragt, Aloysius Pieris and Devaka Premawardhana have questioned the possibility of defining oneself into multiple religions. For these scholars, \"religious belonging\" is not an individual's subjective sense of a particular religion but rather, in Cornille's words, \"the recognition of one's religious identity by the tradition itself and the disposition to submit to the conditions for membership as delineated by that tradition.\" For Cornille, the ultimate purpose of a scholarly discussion on multiple religious belonging is to transform one's religion through the understanding of other religions.\n\nBased on Van Bragt's study, scholars have tried to investigate the possibility for adherents of a religion such as Christianity to belong to multiple religions. The approach to Christian multiple religious belonging, according to Devaka Premawardhana, can be divided into two trends: Peter Phan's approach based on a Christological ground, in which he emphasises on Christ's \"asymmetrically superior status\", and Francis Clooney's approach rooted in a methodological ground, which tries to cross boundaries into another religion just as religions must have discrete entities. These two approaches are summarised below.\n\nPhan's approach emphasised the assymmetricality in which Jesus is the Logos made flesh and the climax of God dealing with humankind. In an attempt to resonate with one's cultural identity and tradition, Phan explained that multiple religious belonging is necessary in order for practitioners of multiple belonging to treat other religions as a qualifier of their identity. This approach, according to Phan, does not deny one's Christian identity, which functions as substantive in relation to non-Christian religion. Phan noted that multiple religious belonging is not a new issue in the twenty-first century but rather the common form of life of the first-century Christians recorded in the book of Acts. In Phan's view, the disappearance of this trend was \"a tragic loss to both Judaism and Christianity\", because it led to a subsequent history of bitter hatred, especially from the side of Christianity.\n\nAs a comparative theologian, Clooney writes about the diversity in the world nowadays, especially with respect to the flourishing of different religions. For Clooney, reflecting on one's religion in this pluralistic world is necessary, so that we can \"see the others in light of our own, and our own in light of the other.\" Focusing on the study of scriptural and theological texts, Clooney compares them between Christian traditions and non-Christian religions, to \"cross boundaries\" to other traditions, so that one would re-think his or her theology, which would thus shape his or her identity. After more than 40 years of studying Hinduism, Clooney concluded that he finds the distinctive disciplines of theology and Hinduism are \"mutually enriching\". By applying this approach, according to Clooney, one can start within his or her \"home\" tradition, enter a different tradition and return to his or her tradition, which is enriched and reformulated after crossing boundaries.\n\nWhile scholars studying multiple religious belonging attempt to appreciate other religions' traditions besides their own, the conservative segment of Christianity tends to question the inclusivistic view of multiple religious belonging because it implies that salvation can be found from somewhere else other than Jesus Christ. In a 2010 article, Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen, a systematic theologian, questioned the approach of \"othering\" those that have traditions different from Christians' because God is the one who offers salvation; Christians only witness it. It is out of humility that Christians can say that salvation belongs to God, and God only, in Kärkkäinen's view. On the other hand, scholars studying multiple religious belonging such as John B. Cobb see this as an opportunity rather than a threat: \"I do not see multiple religious belonging as the primary way into the future. The primary way is the transformation of the particular religious traditions, at least in the Christian case, through their new encounter with other traditions.\" For Cobb, engaging in interfaith dialogue helps smooth the tension between Christianity and Judaism and avoid misunderstanding toward Islam.\n\nIn a 2017 article, sociologist Steve Bruce pointed out that most of the published writings in which multiple religious belonging is studied are purely conceptual and offer \"only anecdotes to illustrate theoretical or classificatory discussions\". Bruce argued that the few attempts to gather empirical data on the phenomenon have conflated a variety of different attitudes that should not be given the label of \"multiple religious belonging\", attitudes such as: universalistic re-interpretation of multiple religions, multiple religious association through family ties, multiple religious interest or sympathies, ancillary religious respect for a specific aspect of a religion, and secular equal respect for all religions. Bruce argued that the term \"multiple religious belonging\" should be strictly confined to being \"an observant 'member' of more than one religion (religion here meaning such high level abstractions as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism etc)\", and since most religions have strict requirements for and expectations of observant members, sociologists should expect multiple religious belonging, defined in this way, to be \"remarkably rare\".\n\n"}
{"id": "19541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19541", "title": "Muslim", "text": "Muslim\n\nA Muslim () is someone who follows or practices Islam, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion. Muslims consider the Quran, their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. The majority of Muslims also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (\"sunnah\") as recorded in traditional accounts (\"hadith\"). \"Muslim\" is an Arabic word meaning \"submitter\" (to God).\n\nThe beliefs of Muslims include: that God ( \"\") is eternal, transcendent and absolutely one (\"tawhid\"); that God is incomparable, self-sustaining and neither begets nor was begotten; that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that has been revealed before through many prophets including Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Moses, and Jesus; that these previous messages and revelations have been partially changed or corrupted over time (\"tahrif\") and that the Qur'an is the final unaltered revelation from God (Final Testament).\n\nThe religious practices of Muslims are enumerated in the Five Pillars of Islam: the declaration of faith (\"shahadah\"), daily prayers (\"salat\"), fasting during the month of Ramadan (\"sawm\"), almsgiving (\"zakat\"), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (\"hajj\") at least once in a lifetime.\n\nTo become a Muslim and to convert to Islam, it is essential to utter the \"Shahada\", one of the Five Pillars of Islam, a declaration of faith and trust that professes that there is only one God \"(Allah)\" and that Muhammad is God's messenger. It is a set statement normally recited in Arabic: \"lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāhu muḥammadun rasūlu-llāh\" () \"There is no god but Allah, (and) Muhammad is the messenger of God.\"\n\nIn Sunni Islam, the shahada has two parts: \"la ilaha illa'llah\" (there is no god but God), and \"Muhammadun rasul Allah\" (Muhammad is the messenger of God), which are sometimes referred to as the first \"shahada\" and the second \"shahada\". The first statement of the shahada is also known as the \"tahlīl\".\n\nIn Shia Islam, the shahada also has a third part, a phrase concerning Ali, the first Shia Imam and the fourth Rashid caliph of Sunni Islam: (), which translates to \"Ali is the \"wali\" of God.\n\nThe word \"muslim\" (, ; , , or \"moslem\" , ) is the active participle of the same verb of which \"islām\" is a verbal noun, based on the triliteral \"S-L-M\" \"to be whole, intact\". A female adherent is a \"muslima\" () (also transliterated as \"Muslimah\" ). The plural form in Arabic is \"muslimūn\" () or \"muslimīn\" (), and its feminine equivalent is \"muslimāt\" (). The Arabic form \"muslimun\" is the stem IV participle of the triliteral \"S-L-M\".\n\nThe ordinary word in English is \"Muslim\". It is sometimes transliterated as \"Moslem\", which is an older spelling. The word \"Mosalman\" (, alternatively \"Mussalman\") is a common equivalent for \"Muslim\" used in Central and South Asia. Until at least the mid-1960s, many English-language writers used the term \"Mohammedans\" or \"Mahometans\". Although such terms were not necessarily intended to be pejorative, Muslims argue that the terms are offensive because they allegedly imply that Muslims worship Muhammad rather than God. Other obsolete terms include \"Muslimite\" and \"Muslimist\".\n\nMusulmán/Mosalmán () is a synonym for \"Muslim\" and is modified from Arabic. It is the origin of the Spanish word ', the (dated) German ', the French word \"musulman\", the Polish words ' and ', the Portuguese word ', the Italian word ' or ', the Romanian word \"musulman\" and the Greek word (all used for a Muslim). In English it was sometimes spelled Mussulman and has become archaic in usage.\n\nApart from Persian, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Italian, and Greek, the term could be found, with obvious local differences, in Armenian, Dari, Pashto, Urdu, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Panjabi, Turkish, Kazakh, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Azeri, Maltese, Hungarian, Czech, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Russian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Romanian, Dutch, and Sanskrit.\n\nThe Muslim philosopher Ibn Arabi said:\n\nThe Qur'an describes many prophets and messengers within Judaism and Christianity, and their respective followers, as Muslim: Adam, Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Jacob, Moses, and Jesus and his apostles are all considered to be Muslims in the Qur'an. The Qur'an states that these men were Muslims because they submitted to God, preached His message and upheld His values, which included praying, charity, fasting and pilgrimage. Thus, in Surah 3:52 of the Qur'an, Jesus' disciples tell him, \"We believe in God; and you be our witness that we are Muslims (\"wa-shahad be anna muslimūn\").\" In Muslim belief, before the Qur'an, God had given the Tawrat (Torah) to Moses, the Zabur (Psalms) to David and the Injil (Gospel) to Jesus, who are all considered important Muslim prophets.\n\nThe most populous Muslim-majority country is Indonesia, home to 12.7% of the world's Muslims, followed by Pakistan (11.0%), Bangladesh (9.2%), and Egypt (4.9%). About 20% of the world's Muslims lives in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nSizable minorities are also found in India, China, Russia, Ethiopia, the Americas, Australia and parts of Europe. The country with the highest proportion of self-described Muslims as a proportion of its total population is Morocco. Converts and immigrant communities are found in almost every part of the world.\n\nOver 75–90% of Muslims are Sunni. The second and third largest sects, Shia and Ahmadiyya, make up 10–20%, and 1% respectively.\n\nWith about 1.8 billion followers (2015), almost a quarter of earth's population, Islam is the second-largest and the fastest-growing religion in the world. due primarily to the young age and high fertility rate of Muslims, with Muslim having a rate of (3.1) compared to the world average of (2.5). According to the same study, religious switching has no impact on Muslim population, since the number of people who embrace Islam and those who leave Islam are roughly equal.\n\nA Pew Center study in 2016 found that Muslims have the highest number of adherents under the age of 15 (or 34% of the total Muslim population) of any major religion, while only 7% are aged 60+ (the smallest percentage of any major religion). According to the same study, Muslims have the highest fertility rates (3.1) of any major religious group. The study also found that Muslims have the lowest average levels of education after Hindus, with an average of 5.6 years of schooling. About 36% of all Muslims have no formal schooling, and Muslims have the lowest average levels of higher education of any major religious group, with only 8% having graduate and post-graduate degrees.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25793095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25793095", "title": "National god", "text": "National god\n\nNational gods are a class of guardian divinities or deities whose special concern is the safety and well-being of an ethnic group (\"nation\"), and of that group's leaders. This is contrasted with other guardian figures such as family gods responsible for the well-being of individual clans or professions, or personal gods who are responsible for the well-being of individuals. These guardian roles augment the functions that a divinity might otherwise have (wisdom, health, war, and so on).\n\nIn antiquity (and to some extent continuing today), religion was a characteristic of regional culture, together with language, customs, traditions, etc. Many of these ethnic religions included national god(s) in their pantheons, such as \n\nIn antiquity, each ethnic group (\"nation\") had its own pantheon, which may or may not have overlapped with that of neighbouring groups. Many of these religions had guardian figures, which then sometimes included national gods, who were considered responsible for the safety and well-being of the nation and of its people, with a special concern for the nation's ruler and guardian. These national gods stood alongside the personal gods, that is, the patron gods who took a special interest in an individual's personal well-being. Additionally, there were the family gods associated with the care of a clan or profession, as well as gods associated with specific situations or the protection thereof (fertility, health, war, contracts and so on).\n\nThis perception of divinity was common in the ancient world. Deities were often geographically localized by association to their main cult centers, and in the Ancient Near East were often tutelary deities of their respective city-states. Many of the individual ethnic groups also considered itself the progeny of its national gods. For example, in the region that is now Yemen, the Sabaeans, the Minaeans and the Himyar each perceived themselves to be the children of respectively Almaqah, Wadd and Shamash. Similarly, in Canaan, Milcom held that role for the Ammonites, while Chemosh did so for the Moab.\n\nYahweh's role as the national god of the Judaeans and Samarians is a key reason for that figure's adoption as the monist figure by the Yahweh-only movement of the 7th-century BC. Yahweh's subsequent exaltation as a supreme figure occurred not because national gods were necessarily heads of their pantheons (this was certainly not the case for the national gods of the peoples surrounding Israel), but as a reaction to the changing political landscape, in which other national gods had previously become exalted in that fashion. Because peoples were perceived to effectively worship the same gods, merely by different names (Smith (2008) terms this \"translatability\"), Yahweh's function as a national god had previously automatically equated him with other national gods. Thus, with the rise of the multi-cultural Assyrian Empire in the 10th century BC, the concomitant rise of the Assyrian's nation god Assur to inter-cultural prominence influenced how national gods were generally perceived. Moreover, the political unification of the fractured nation-states under a single supreme head of state encouraged the idea of a multi-national \"one-god\" worldview as well. By the 7th-century BC however, Assyria was in decline and the smaller nation-states began to reassert their independence. In this context, the development of a \"one-god\" worldview in 7th century BC Kingdom of Judah can be perceived as a response to the diminishing claims to cultural hegemony of the Assyrian \"one-god\" ideology of the time. The process is evident in some parts of the Torah which predate the 6th century BC and thus preserve vestiges of the theology centered on a national god during the 10th-century BC monarchic period. \"The OT is still conscious of the fact that Yhwh, the national god of Israel, originally was one of the gods in the council of El.\" (\"Deut\" 32:8-9*)\n\nChristian missionaries have repeatedly re-interpreted national gods in terms of the Christian God. This fact is reflected in the names of God in various languages of Christianized peoples, such as Shangdi or Shen among Chinese Christians, Ngai among a number of tribes of Kenya, Bathalang Maykapal for the Tagalog in the Philippines, etc.\n\nIn a modern context, the term of a \"national god\" addresses the emergence of national churches within Christianity. This tendency was of \"nationalizing\" the Christian God, especially in the context of national churches sanctioning warfare against other Christian nations during World War I, was denounced as heretical by Karl Barth.\n\nCarl Jung in his essay \"Wotan\" (1936) identifies the Germanic god of the storm (leader of the Wild Hunt), Wotan, as the national god of the German people, and warns of the rise of German nationalism and ultimately the then-impending catastrophe of Nazism and World War II in terms of the re-awakening of this god:\n\n"}
{"id": "27702479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27702479", "title": "Pizza effect", "text": "Pizza effect\n\nThe pizza effect is a term used especially in religious studies and sociology for the phenomenon of elements of a nation or people's culture being transformed or at least more fully embraced elsewhere, then re-imported back to their culture of origin, or the way in which a community's self-understanding is influenced by (or imposed by, or imported from) foreign sources. It is named after the idea that modern pizza toppings were developed among Italian immigrants in the United States (rather than in native Italy, where in its simpler form it was originally looked down upon), and was later exported back to Italy to be interpreted as a delicacy in Italian cuisine.\n\nRelated phrases include \"hermeneutical feedback loop\", \"re-enculturation\", and \"self-orientalization\". The term \"pizza effect\" was coined by the Austrian-born Hindu monk and professor of Anthropology at Syracuse University, Agehananda Bharati in 1970.\n\nThe original examples given by Agehananda Bharati mostly had to do with popularity and status:\n\nAnalyst Mark Sedgwick wrote that Islamist terrorism, and specifically suicide bombing, can be seen as examples, beginning as isolated interpretations of the concept of shahid, or martyrdom, then being re-exported to the greater Muslim world.\n\nThe Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City was inspired by an event in the James Bond film \"Spectre\", which was fictional at the time of the film's production. \n\nThe founders of the Theosophical Society, Helena Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott, were influenced by Eastern religions, then placed their headquarters in Adyar, Chennai, from where they spread their views within India.\n\nSimilarly, Buddhist modernism or \"Protestant Buddhism\" was developed by Westerners, who according to scholar Stephen Jenkins, \"mistook it for an indigenous Sri Lankan product\", and they in turn influenced Sri Lankan Buddhist Anagarika Dharmapala, who, along with the Theosophical Society, was instrumental in spreading Buddhism in both India and the West.\n\nAccording to scholar Kim Knott, Mahatma Gandhi \"was not very interested in religion until he went to London to study law, where he studied the Bhagavad Gita in English in Sir Edwin Arnold's translation, and this deeply influenced his spiritual outlook.\"\n\nThe influence of translations by the British-based Pali Text Society on South Asian Buddhism.\n\nThe religious thought of Ibn Rushd (Averroes), which was taken up by 19th-century Europeans such as Ernest Renan, and thereby regained popularity during the Nahda, the Islamic renaissance.\n\nChicken tikka masala, a dish created in Britain, based on Indian cooking, which then became popular in India.\n\nTeppanyaki, a Western-influenced style created in Japan, popular in the U.S.\n\nSalsa music: the first salsa bands were mainly Puerto Ricans who moved to New York in the 1930s.\n\nHaoqiu zhuan, a Chinese novel. James St. André, author of \"Modern Translation Theory and Past Translation Practice: European Translations of the \"Haoqiu zhuan\"\", wrote that in China the novel was originally \"considered second-rate fiction and stood in danger of being completely forgotten with changes in literary taste in the early twentieth century.\" He stated that the fact there had been interest in translating the novel into English \"gave life and fame\" to \"Haoqiu zhuan\" and therefore affected its standing in China.\n\nScholar David Miller wrote that Westerners were responsible for \"…the renewed interest in the four Vedas and the Upanishads, as texts in themselves apart from the endless number of commentaries that have been written by Indians to interpret and to systematize the texts,\" and that due to this interest, \"Indian scholars have also served up that menu, often in a less appetizing way than their Western counterparts. In so doing they have missed the very life force or essence of Indian ethical traditions.\"\n\nScholar Jørn Borup wrote about an \"inverted pizza-effect\", when a society's modification of another culture gets further re-modified by that same society, such as European philosophers including Martin Heidegger \"appear to have been significantly inspired by Eastern thought - an Eastern thought itself presented through \"Protestant\" or \"Western\" eyes. This transformation is naturally not a unique phenomenon in religious studies, where interpretations, re-interpretations and inventions are seen as common characteristics of religion.\"\n\nStephen Jenkins noted that the feedback phenomenon could continue; in the case of pizza, he wrote that the return of pizza to Italy again influenced American cuisine: \"...pizza-loving American tourists, going to Italy in the millions, sought out authentic Italian pizza. Italians, responding to this demand, developed pizzerias to meet American expectations. Delighted with their discovery of \"authentic\" Italian pizza, Americans subsequently developed chains of \"authentic\" Italian brick-oven pizzerias. Hence, Americans met their own reflection in the other and were delighted.\"\n\nJim Douglas, familiar with Bharati's thesis, applied it to black blues originating in the United States before 1960. The music of Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, etc. went over to England, where it was embraced by other musicians (especially white men playing electric guitar). Then, this re-packaged blues came back to the US presented by the Rolling Stones, Cream, Led Zeppelin, etc. in the late 1960s where it was embraced by baby boomers (who had never heard of Robert Johnson, etc.). Later, some of these American baby boomers discovered the roots of the British blues-rock in the recordings of the original American blues artists.\n\n"}
{"id": "25042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25042", "title": "Prayer", "text": "Prayer\n\nPrayer is an invocation or act that seeks to activate a rapport with an object of worship, typically a deity, through deliberate communication. In the narrow sense, the term refers to an act of supplication or intercession directed towards a deity, or a deified ancestor. More generally, prayer can also have the purpose of thanksgiving or praise, and in comparative religion is closely associated with more abstract forms of meditation and with charms or spells.\n\nPrayer can take a variety of forms: it can be part of a set liturgy or ritual, and it can be performed alone or in groups. Prayer may take the form of a hymn, incantation, formal creedal statement, or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person.\n\nToday, most major religions involve prayer in one way or another; some ritualize the act, requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray, while others teach that prayer may be practised spontaneously by anyone at any time.\n\nThe English term \"prayer\" is from Medieval Latin \"precaria\" \"petition, prayer\". The Vulgate Latin is \"oratio\", which translates Greek προσευχή in turn the Septuagint translation of Biblical Hebrew \"tĕphillah\".\n\nVarious spiritual traditions offer a wide variety of devotional acts. There are morning and evening prayers, graces said over meals, and reverent physical gestures. Some Christians bow their heads and fold their hands. Some Native Americans regard dancing as a form of prayer. Some Sufis whirl. Hindus chant mantras. Jewish prayer may involve swaying back and forth and bowing. Muslims practice \"salat\" (kneeling and prostration) in their prayers. Quakers keep silent. Some pray according to standardized rituals and liturgies, while others prefer extemporaneous prayers. Still others combine the two.\n\nFriedrich Heiler is often cited in Christian circles for his systematic \"Typology of Prayer\" which lists six types of prayer: primitive, ritual, Greek cultural, philosophical, mystical, and prophetic. Some forms of prayer require a prior ritualistic form of cleansing or purification such as in ghusl and wudhu.\n\nPrayer may be done privately and individually, or it may be done corporately in the presence of fellow believers. Prayer can be incorporated into a daily \"thought life\", in which one is in constant communication with a god. Some people pray throughout all that is happening during the day and seek guidance as the day progresses. This is actually regarded as a requirement in several Christian denominations, although enforcement is not possible nor desirable. There can be many different answers to prayer, just as there are many ways to interpret an answer to a question, if there in fact comes an answer. Some may experience audible, physical, or mental epiphanies. If indeed an answer comes, the time and place it comes is considered random.\nSome outward acts that sometimes accompany prayer are: anointing with oil; ringing a bell; burning incense or paper; lighting a candle or candles; See, for example, facing a specific direction (i.e. towards Mecca or the East); making the sign of the cross. One less noticeable act related to prayer is fasting.\n\nA variety of body postures may be assumed, often with specific meaning (mainly respect or adoration) associated with them: standing; sitting; kneeling; prostrate on the floor; eyes opened; eyes closed; hands folded or clasped; hands upraised; holding hands with others; a laying on of hands and others. Prayers may be recited from memory, read from a book of prayers, or composed spontaneously as they are prayed. They may be said, chanted, or sung. They may be with musical accompaniment or not. There may be a time of outward silence while prayers are offered mentally. Often, there are prayers to fit specific occasions, such as the blessing of a meal, the birth or death of a loved one, other significant events in the life of a believer, or days of the year that have special religious significance. Details corresponding to specific traditions are outlined below.\n\nAnthropologically, the concept of prayer is closely related to that of surrender and supplication. \nThe traditional posture of prayer in medieval Europe is kneeling or supine with clasped hands, in antiquity more typically with raised hands. The early Christian prayer posture was standing, looking up to heaven, with outspread arms and bare head. This is the pre-Christian, pagan prayer posture (except for the bare head, which was prescribed for males in Corinthians 11:4, in Roman paganism, the head had to be covered in prayer). Certain Cretan and Cypriote figures of the Late Bronze Age, with arms raised, have been interpreted as worshippers. Their posture is similar to the \"flight\" posture, a crouching posture with raised hands, observed in schizophrenic patients and related to the universal \"hands up\" gesture of surrender. The kneeling posture with clasped hands appears to have been introduced only with the beginning high medieval period, presumably adopted from a gesture of feudal homage.\n\nAlthough prayer in its literal sense is not used in animism, communication with the spirit world is vital to the animist way of life. This is usually accomplished through a shaman who, through a trance, gains access to the spirit world and then shows the spirits' thoughts to the people. Other ways to receive messages from the spirits include using astrology or contemplating fortune tellers and healers. \n\nSome of the oldest extant literature, such as the Sumerian temple hymns of Enheduanna (c. 23th century BC) are liturgy addressed to deities and thus technically \"prayer\". The Egyptian Pyramid Texts of about the same period similarly contain spells or incantations addressed to the gods. In the loosest sense, in the form of magical thinking combined with animism, prayer has been argued as representing a human cultural universal, which would have been present since the emergence of behavioral modernity, by anthropologists such as Sir Edward Burnett Tylor and Sir James George Frazer.\n\nReliable records are available for the polytheistic religions of the Iron Age, most notably Ancient Greek religion (which strongly influenced Roman religion). These religious traditions were direct developments of the earlier Bronze Age religions.\nCeremonial prayer was highly formulaic and ritualized. \n\nIn ancient polytheism, ancestor worship is indistinguishable from theistic worship (see also Euhemerism).\nVestiges of ancestor worship persist, to a greater or lesser extent, in modern religious traditions throughout the world, most notably in Japanese Shinto and in Chinese folk religion. The practices involved in Shinto prayer are heavily influenced by Buddhism; Japanese Buddhism has also been strongly influenced by Shinto in turn. Shinto prayers quite frequently consist of wishes or favors asked of the \"kami\", rather than lengthy praises or devotions. The practice of votive offering is also universal, and is attested at least since the Bronze Age. In Shinto, this takes the form of a small wooden tablet, called an \"ema\".\n\nPrayers in Etruscan were used in the Roman world by augurs and other oracles long after Etruscan became a dead language. The Carmen Arvale and the Carmen Saliare are two specimens of partially preserved prayers that seem to have been unintelligible to their scribes, and whose language is full of archaisms and difficult passages.\n\nRoman prayers and sacrifices were often envisioned as legal bargains between deity and worshipper. The Roman principle was expressed as \"do ut des\": \"I give, so that you may give.\" Cato the Elder's treatise on agriculture contains many examples of preserved traditional prayers; in one, a farmer addresses the unknown deity of a possibly sacred grove, and sacrifices a pig in order to placate the god or goddess of the place and beseech his or her permission to cut down some trees from the grove.\nCeltic, Germanic and Slavic religions are recorded much later, and much more fragmentarily, than the religions of classical antiquity. They nevertheless show substantial parallels to the better-attested religions of the Iron Age. In the case of Germanic religion, the practice of prayer is reliably attested, but no actual liturgy is recorded from the early (Roman era) period. An Old Norse prayer is on record in the form of a dramatization in skaldic poetry. This prayer is recorded in stanzas 2 and 3 of the poem \"Sigrdrífumál\", compiled in the 13th century \"Poetic Edda\" from earlier traditional sources, where the valkyrie Sigrdrífa prays to the gods and the earth after being woken by the hero Sigurd.\nA prayer to Odin is mentioned in chapter 2 of the \"Völsunga saga\" where King Rerir prays for a child. In stanza 9 of the poem \"Oddrúnargrátr\", a prayer is made to \"kind wights, Frigg and Freyja, and many gods In chapter 21 of \"Jómsvíkinga saga\", wishing to turn the tide of the Battle of Hjörungavágr, Haakon Sigurdsson eventually finds his prayers answered by the goddesses Þorgerðr Hölgabrúðr and Irpa.\nFolk religion in the medieval period produced syncretisms between pre-Christian and Christian traditions. An example is the 11th-century Anglo-Saxon charm \"Æcerbot\" for the fertility of crops and land, or the medical \"Wið færstice\". The 8th-century Wessobrunn Prayer has been proposed as a Christianized pagan prayer and compared to the pagan \"Völuspá\" and the Merseburg Incantations, the latter recorded in the 9th or 10th century but of much older traditional origins.\n\nIn Australian Aboriginal mythology, prayers to the \"Great Wit\" are performed by the \"clever men\" and \"clever women\", or \"kadji\". These Aboriginal shamans use maban or mabain, the material that is believed to give them their purported magical powers. The Pueblo Indians are known to have used prayer sticks, that is, sticks with feathers attached as supplicatory offerings. The Hopi Indians used prayer sticks as well, but they attached to it a small bag of sacred meal.\n\nThe most common form of prayer is to directly appeal to a deity to grant one's requests. Some have termed this as the social approach to prayer.\n\nAtheist arguments against prayer are mostly directed against petitionary prayer in particular. Daniel Dennett argued that petitionary prayer might have the undesirable psychological effect of relieving a person of the need to take active measures.\n\nThis potential drawback manifests in extreme forms in such cases as Christian Scientists who rely on prayers instead of seeking medical treatment for family members for easily curable conditions which later result in death.\n\nChristopher Hitchens (2012) argued that praying to a god which is omnipotent and all-knowing would be presumptuous. For example, he interprets Ambrose Bierce's definition of prayer by stating that \"the man who prays is the one who thinks that god has arranged matters all wrong, but who also thinks that he can instruct god how to put them right.\"\n\nIn this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. Among Jews, this has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, Rabbi Yehuda Halevi, Joseph Albo, Samson Raphael Hirsch, and Joseph B. Soloveitchik. This view is expressed by Rabbi Nosson Scherman in the overview to the Artscroll Siddur (p. XIII).\n\nAmong Christian theologians, E.M. Bounds stated the educational purpose of prayer in every chapter of his book, \"The Necessity of Prayer\". Prayer books such as the Book of Common Prayer are both a result of this approach and an exhortation to keep it.\n\nIn this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation (meditation). This approach was taken by the Jewish scholar and philosopher Maimonides and the other medieval rationalists. It became popular in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic intellectual circles, but never became the most popular understanding of prayer among the laity in any of these faiths. In all three of these faiths today, a significant minority of people still hold to this approach.\n\nIn this approach, the purpose of prayer is to enable the person praying to gain a direct experience of the recipient of the prayer (or as close to direct as a specific theology permits). This approach is very significant in Christianity and widespread in Judaism (although less popular theologically). In Eastern Orthodoxy, this approach is known as hesychasm. It is also widespread in Sufi Islam, and in some forms of mysticism. It has some similarities with the rationalist approach, since it can also involve contemplation, although the contemplation is not generally viewed as being as rational or intellectual. Christian and Roman Catholic traditions also include an experiential approach to prayer within the practice of Lectio Divina, historically a Benedictine practice in which scripture is read aloud; actively meditated upon using the intellect (but not analysis) possibly using the mind to place the listener within a relationship or dialogue with the text that was read; a prayer spoken; and finally concludes with , a more passive experiential approach than the previous meditation, which is characterized by the Catechism of the Catholic Church as an experience of consciously being attentive, and having a silent love toward God, which the individual experiences without demanding to receive an experience. The experience of God within Christian mysticism has been contrasted with the concept of experiential religion or mystical experience because of a long history or authors living and writing about experience with the divine in a manner that identifies God as unknowable and ineffable, the language of such ideas could be characterized paradoxically as \"experiential\", as well as without the phenomena of experience.\n\nThe notion of \"religious experience\" can be traced back to William James, who used a term called \"religious experience\" in his book, \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\". The origins of the use of this term can be dated further back.\n\nIn the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures put forth very influential views that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. While Kant held that moral experience justified religious beliefs, John Wesley in addition to stressing individual moral exertion thought that the religious experiences in the Methodist movement (paralleling the Romantic Movement) were foundational to religious commitment as a way of life.\n\nWayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of \"religious experience\" to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of \"religious experience\" was used by Schleiermacher and Albert Ritschl to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique, and defend the view that human (moral and religious) experience justifies religious beliefs.\n\nSuch religious empiricism would be later seen as highly problematic and was — during the period in-between world wars — famously rejected by Karl Barth. In the 20th century, religious as well as moral experience as justification for religious beliefs still holds sway. Some influential modern scholars holding this liberal theological view are Charles Raven and the Oxford physicist/theologian Charles Coulson.\n\nThe notion of \"religious experience\" was adopted by many scholars of religion, of whom William James was the most influential.\n\nThe notion of \"experience\" has been criticised. Robert Sharf points out that \"experience\" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences. The notion of \"experience\" introduces a false notion of duality between \"experiencer\" and \"experienced\", whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the \"non-duality\" of observer and observed. \"Pure experience\" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity. The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what \"experience\" someone has, which means that this \"experience\" is not the \"proof\" of the teaching, but a \"result\" of the teaching. A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by \"cleaning the doors of perception\", would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible prayer is an evolving means of interacting with God, most frequently through a spontaneous, individual, unorganized form of petitioning and/or thanking. Standardized prayer such as is done today is non-existent, although beginning in Deuteronomy, the Bible lays the groundwork for organized prayer, including basic liturgical guidelines, and by the Bible's later books, prayer has evolved to a more standardized form, although still radically different from the form practiced by modern Jews.\n\nIndividual prayer is described by the Tanakh two ways. The first of these is when prayer is described as occurring, and a result is achieved, but no further information regarding a person's prayer is given. In these instances, such as with Isaac, Moses, Samuel, and Job, the act of praying is a method of changing a situation for the better. The second way in which prayer is depicted is through fully fleshed out episodes of prayer, where a person's prayer is related in full. Many famous biblical personalities have such a prayer, including every major character from Hannah to Hezekiah.\n\nIn the New Testament prayer is presented as a positive command (; ). The People of God are challenged to include Christian prayer in their everyday life, even in the busy struggles of marriage () as it brings people closer to God.\n\nJesus encouraged his disciples to pray in secret in their private rooms, using the Lord's Prayer, as a humble response to the prayer of the Pharisees, whose practices in prayer were regarded as impious by the New Testament writers ().\n\nThroughout the New Testament, prayer is shown to be God's appointed method by which we obtain what He has to bestow (; ; . Further, the Book of James says that the lack of blessings in life results from a failure to pray (). Jesus healed through prayer and expected his followers to do so also (; ).\n\nObservant Jews pray three times a day, Shacharit, Mincha, and Ma'ariv with lengthier prayers on special days, such as the Shabbat and Jewish holidays including Musaf and the reading of the Torah. The siddur is the prayerbook used by Jews all over the world, containing a set order of daily prayers. Jewish prayer is usually described as having two aspects: \"kavanah\" (intention) and \"keva\" (the ritualistic, structured elements).\n\nThe most important Jewish prayers are the Shema Yisrael (\"Hear O Israel\") and the Amidah (\"the standing prayer\").\n\nCommunal prayer is preferred over solitary prayer, and a quorum of 10 adult males (a \"minyan\") is considered by Orthodox Judaism a prerequisite for several communal prayers.\nThere are also many other ritualistic prayers a Jew performs during their day, such as washing before eating bread, washing after one wakes up in the morning, and doing grace after meals.\n\nIn this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation. This approach was taken by Maimonides and the other medieval rationalists. One example of this approach to prayer is noted by Rabbi Steven Weil, who was appointed the Orthodox Union's Executive-Vice President in 2009. He notes that the word \"prayer\" is a derivative of the Latin \"precari\", which means \"to beg\". The Hebrew equivalent \"tefilah\", however, along with its root \"pelel\" or its reflexive \"l’hitpallel\", means the act of self-analysis or self-evaluation. This approach is sometimes described as the person praying having a dialogue or conversation with God.\n\nIn this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. This has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, Yehuda Halevy, Joseph Albo, Samson Raphael Hirsch, and Joseph Dov Soloveitchik. This view is expressed by Rabbi Nosson Scherman in the overview to the Artscroll Siddur (p. XIII); note that Scherman goes on to also affirm the Kabbalistic view (see below).\n\nKabbalah uses a series of \"kavanot\", directions of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalists ascribe a higher meaning to the purpose of prayer, which is no less than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.\n\nAmong Jews, this approach has been taken by the Chassidei Ashkenaz (German pietists of the Middle-Ages), the Arizal's Kabbalist tradition, Ramchal, most of Hassidism, the Vilna Gaon, and Jacob Emden.\n\nChristian prayers are quite varied. They can be completely spontaneous, or read entirely from a text, like the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. The most common prayer among Christians is the Lord's Prayer, which according to the gospel accounts (e.g. ) is how Jesus taught his disciples to pray. The Lord's Prayer is a model for prayers of adoration, confession and petition in Christianity. In medieval England, prayers (particularly the \"paternoster\") were frequently used as a measure of time in medical and culinary recipe books.\n\nChristians generally pray to God or to the Father. Some Christians (e.g., Catholics, Orthodox) will also ask the righteous in heaven and \"in Christ,\" such as Virgin Mary or other saints to intercede by praying on their behalf (intercession of saints). Formulaic closures include \"through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son, who lives and reigns with You, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, through all the ages of ages,\" and \"in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\"\n\nIt is customary among Protestants to end prayers with \"In Jesus' name, Amen\" or \"In the name of Christ, Amen.\" However, the most commonly used closure in Christianity is simply \"Amen\" (from a Hebrew adverb used as a statement of affirmation or agreement, usually translated as \"so be it\").\n\nIn the Western or Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church, probably the most common is the Rosary; In the Eastern Church (the Eastern rites of the Catholic Church and Orthodox Church), the Jesus Prayer. The Jesus Prayer is also often repeated as part of the meditative hesychasm practice in Eastern Christianity.\n\nRoman Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as acts of reparation which do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to repair the sins of others, e.g. for the repair of the sin of blasphemy performed by others.\n\nOther forms of prayer among Catholics would be meditative prayer, contemplative prayer and infused prayer discussed at length by Catholic Saints St. John of the Cross and St. Theresa of Jesus.\n\nIn Pentecostal congregations, prayer is often accompanied by speaking in an unknown tongue, a practice now known as glossolalia. Practitioners of Pentecostal glossolalia may claim that the languages they speak in prayer are real foreign languages, and that the ability to speak those languages spontaneously is a gift of the Holy Spirit. Some people outside of the movement, however, have offered dissenting views. George Barton Cutten suggested that glossolalia was a sign of mental illness. Felicitas Goodman suggested that tongue speakers were under a form of hypnosis. Others suggest that it is a learned behaviour. Some of these views have allegedly been refuted.\n\nChristian Science teaches that prayer is a spiritualization of thought or an understanding of God and of the nature of the underlying spiritual creation. Adherents believe that this can result in healing, by bringing spiritual reality into clearer focus in the human scene. The world as it appears to the senses is regarded as a distorted version of the world of spiritual ideas. Prayer can heal the distortion. Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality. Christian Scientists do not practice intercessory prayer as it is commonly understood, and they generally avoid combining prayer with medical treatment in the belief that the two practices tend to work against each other. Prayer works through love: the recognition of God's creation as spiritual, intact, and inherently lovable.\n\nThe Arabic word for prayer is \"salah\". In Islam, there are five daily obligatory prayers that are considered as one of the pillars of the religion. The command to ritual prayer occurs repeatedly in the Quran. The prayer is performed by the person while they are facing the Kaaba in Mecca. There is the \"call for prayer\" (\"adhan\"), where the \"muezzin\" calls for all the followers to stand together for the prayer. The prayer consists of actions such as glorifying and praising God (such as mentioning ‘Allāhu Akbar’ (God is Great)) while standing, recitation of chapters of the Quran (such as the opening chapter of the book (\"Al-Fatiha\")), bowing down then praising God, prostrating (\"sujud\") then again praising God and it ends with the words: \"Peace be with you and God’s mercy\". During the prayer, a Muslim cannot talk or do anything else besides pray. Once the prayer is complete, one can offer personal prayers or supplications to God for their needs that are known as \"dua\". There are many standard invocations in Arabic to be recited at various times (\"e.g.\" after the prayer) and for various occasions (\"e.g.\" for one's parents) with manners and etiquette such as before eating. Muslims may also say \"dua\" in their own words and languages for any issue they wish to communicate with God in the hope that God will answer their prayers. Certain Shi'a sects pray the five daily prayers divided into three separate parts of the day, providing several Hadith as supporting evidence; although according to Shia Islam, it is also permissible to pray at five times.\n\nBahá'u'lláh, the Báb, and `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote many prayers for general use, and some for specific occasions, including for unity, detachment, spiritual upliftment, and healing among others. Bahá'ís are also required to recite each day one of three obligatory prayers composed by Bahá'u'lláh. The believers have been enjoined to face in the direction of the Qiblih when reciting their Obligatory Prayer. The longest obligatory prayer may be recited at any time during the day; another, of medium length, is recited once in the morning, once at midday, and once in the evening; and the shortest can be recited anytime between noon and sunset. Bahá'ís also read from and meditate on the scriptures every morning and evening.\n\nIn both Buddhism and Hinduism, the repetition of mantras is closely related to the practice of repetitive prayer in Western religion (rosary, Jesus prayer). Many of the most widespread Hindu and Buddhist mantras are in origin invocations of deities, e.g. Gayatri Mantra dedicated to Savitr, Pavamana Mantra to Soma Pavamana, and many of the Buddhist Dhāraṇī originate as recitations of lists of names or attributes of deities. Most of the shorter Buddhist mantras originate as the invocation of the name of a specific deity or \"bodhisattva\", such as \"Om mani padme hum\" being in origin the invocation of a \"bodhisattva\" called \"Maṇipadma\". However, from an early time these mantras were interpreted in the context of mystical sound symbolism. The most extreme example of this is the om syllable, which as early as in the Aitareya Brahmana was claimed as equivalent to the entire Vedas (collection of ritual hymns).\n\nIn the earliest Buddhist tradition, the Theravada, and in the later Mahayana tradition of Zen (or Chán), prayer plays only an ancillary role. It is largely a ritual expression of wishes for success in the practice and in helping all beings.\n\nThe skillful means (Sanskrit: \"upāya\") of the transfer of merit (Sanskrit: \"pariṇāmanā\") is an evocation and prayer. Moreover, indeterminate buddhas are available for intercession as they reside in awoken-fields (Sanskrit: \"buddha-kshetra\").\n\nThe \"nirmānakāya\" of an awoken-field is what is generally known and understood as a mandala. The opening and closing of the ring (Sanskrit: \"maṇḍala\") is an active prayer. An active prayer is a mindful activity, an activity in which mindfulness is not just cultivated but \"is\". A common prayer is \"May the merit of my practice, adorn Buddhas' Pure Lands, requite the fourfold kindness from above, and relieve the suffering of the three life-journeys below. Universally wishing sentient beings, Friends, foes, and karmic creditors, all to activate the bodhi mind, and all to be reborn in the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss.\" (願以此功德 莊嚴佛淨土 上報四重恩 下濟三途苦 普願諸眾生 冤親諸債主 悉發菩提心 同生極樂國)\n\nThe Generation Stage (Sanskrit: \"utpatti-krama\") of Vajrayana involves prayer elements.\n\nThe Tibetan Buddhism tradition emphasizes an instructive and devotional relationship to a guru; this may involve devotional practices known as guru yoga which are congruent with prayer. It also appears that Tibetan Buddhism posits the existence of various deities, but the peak view of the tradition is that the deities or \"yidam\" are no more existent or real than the continuity (Sanskrit: \"santana\"; refer mindstream) of the practitioner, environment and activity. But how practitioners engage \"yidam\" or tutelary deities will depend upon the level or more appropriately \"yana\" at which they are practicing. At one level, one may pray to a deity for protection or assistance, taking a more subordinate role. At another level, one may invoke the deity, on a more equal footing. And at a higher level one may deliberately cultivate the idea that one has become the deity, whilst remaining aware that its ultimate nature is \"śūnyatā\". The views of the more esoteric \"yana\" are impenetrable for those without direct experience and empowerment.\n\nPure Land Buddhism emphasizes the recitation by devotees of prayer-like mantras, a practice often called \"Nembutsu\". On one level it is said that reciting these mantras can ensure rebirth into a \"Sambhogakāya\" land (Sanskrit: \"buddha-kshetra\") after bodily dissolution, a sheer ball spontaneously co-emergent to a buddha's enlightened intention. According to Shinran, the founder of the Pure Land Buddhism tradition that is most prevalent in the US, \"for the long haul nothing is as efficacious as the Nembutsu.\" On another, the practice is a form of meditation aimed at achieving realization.\n\nBut beyond all these practices the Buddha emphasized the primacy of individual practice and experience. He said that supplication to gods or deities was not necessary. Nevertheless, today many lay people in East Asian countries pray to the Buddha in ways that resemble Western prayer—asking for intervention and offering devotion.\n\nHinduism has incorporated many kinds of prayer (Sanskrit: \"prārthanā\"), from fire-based rituals to philosophical musings. While chanting involves 'by dictum' recitation of timeless verses or verses with timings and notations, \"dhyanam\" involves deep meditation (however short or long) on the preferred deity/God. Again the object to which prayers are offered could be a persons referred as \"devtas\", trinity or incarnation of either \"devtas\" or trinity or simply plain formless meditation as practiced by the ancient sages. These prayers can be directed to fulfilling personal needs or deep spiritual enlightenment, and also for the benefit of others. Ritual invocation was part and parcel of the Vedic religion and as such permeated their sacred texts. Indeed, the highest sacred texts of the Hindus, the Vedas, are a large collection of mantras and prayer rituals. Classical Hinduism came to focus on extolling a single supreme force, Brahman, that is made manifest in several lower forms as the familiar gods of the Hindu pantheon. Hindus in India have numerous devotional movements. Hindus may pray to the highest absolute God Brahman, or more commonly to its three manifestations, a creator god called Brahma, a preserver god called Vishnu and a destroyer god (so that the creation cycle can start afresh) Shiva, and at the next level to Vishnu's avatars (earthly appearances) Rama and Krishna or to many other male or female deities. Typically, Hindus pray with their hands (the palms) joined together in \"pranam\". The hand gesture is similar to the popular Indian greeting \"namaste\".\n\nThe \"Ardās\" (Punjabi: ਅਰਦਾਸ) is a Sikh prayer that is done before performing or after undertaking any significant task; after reciting the daily \"Banis\" (prayers); or completion of a service like the \"Paath\" (scripture reading/recitation), \"kirtan\" (hymn-singing) program or any other religious program. In Sikhism, these prayers are also said before and after eating. The prayer is a plea to God to support and help the devotee with whatever he or she is about to undertake or has done.\n\nThe \"Ardas\" is usually always done standing up with folded hands. The beginning of the \"Ardas\" is strictly set by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh. When it comes to conclusion of this prayer, the devotee uses words like \"Waheguru please bless me in the task that I am about to undertake\" when starting a new task or \"Akal Purakh, having completed the hymn-singing, we ask for your continued blessings so that we can continue with your memory and remember you at all times\", etc. The word \"Ardās\" is derived from Persian word 'Arazdashat', meaning a request, supplication, prayer, petition or an address to a superior authority.\n\nArdās is a unique prayer based on the fact that it is one of the few well-known prayers in the Sikh religion that was not written in its entirety by the Gurus. The Ardās cannot be found within the pages of the Guru Granth Sahib because it is a continually changing devotional text that has evolved over time in order for it to encompass the feats, accomplishments, and feelings of all generations of Sikhs within its lines. Taking the various derivation of the word Ardās into account, the basic purpose of this prayer is an appeal to Waheguru for his protection and care, as well as being a plea for the welfare and prosperity of all mankind, and a means for the Sikhs to thank Waheguru for all that he has done.\n\nWiccan prayers can include meditation, rituals and incantations. Prayers are seen as a form of communication with the God and Goddess. This may include prayers for \"esbat\" and \"sabbat\" celebrations, for dinner, for pre-dawn times or for your own or others safety, for healing or for the dead.\n\nIn Raëlism rites and practises vary from initiation ceremonies, to sensual meditation. An initiation ceremony usually involves a Raelian putting water on the forehead of a new member. Such ceremonies are performed on certain special days on the Raelian calendar. Sensual meditation techniques include breathing exercises and various forms of erotic meditation.\n\nIn Eckankar, one of the basic forms of prayer includes singing the word \"HU\" which is pronounced as \"hue\", a holy name of God. This can be done with eyes closed or open, aloud or silently. Practitioners may experience the divine ECK or Holy Spirit.\n\nPractitioners of Theurgy and Western esotericism may practice a form of ritual which utilizes both pre-sanctioned prayers and names of God, and prayers \"from the heart\" that, when combined, allows the participant to ascend spiritually, and in some instances, induce a trance in which God or other spiritual beings may be realized. Very similar to Hermetic Qabalah, and orthodox Kabbalah, it is believed that prayer can influence both the physical and non-physical worlds. The use of ritualistic signs and names are believed to be archetypes in which the subconscious may take form as the Inner God, or another spiritual being, and the \"prayer from the heart\" to be that spiritual force speaking through the participant.\nIn Thelema (which includes both theist as well as atheist practitioners) adherents share a number of practices that are forms of individual prayer, including basic yoga; (asana and pranayama); various forms of ritual magick; rituals of one's own devising (often based upon a syncretism of religions, or Western Esotericism, such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and Star Ruby); and performance of Liber Resh vel Helios (aka Liber 200), which consists of four daily adorations to the sun (often consisting of 4 hand/body positions and recitation of a memorized song, normally spoken, addressing different godforms identified with the sun).\n\nWhile there is no dogma within Thelema that expresses the purpose behind any individual aspirant who chooses to perform \"Resh\", it may be noted that the practice of \"Resh\" is not a simple petition toward the sun, nor a form of \"worshiping\" the celestial body that we call the Sun, but instead uses the positioning of that source of light, which enables life on our planet, as well as uses mythological images of that solar force, so that the individual can perform the prayer, possibly furthering a self-identification with the sun, so \"that repeated application of the Liber Resh adorations expands the consciousness of the individual by compelling him to take a different perspective, by inducing him to 'look at things from the point of view of the Sun'.\n\nPrayer is often used as a means of faith healing in an attempt to use religious or spiritual means to prevent illness, cure disease, or improve health. \n\nScientific studies regarding the use of prayer have mostly concentrated on its effect on the healing of sick or injured people. Meta-studies have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is \"no discernable effect\" while a 2007 systemic review of studies on intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had \"small, but significant, effect sizes\" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings. Some studies have indicated increased medical complications in groups receiving prayer over those without. \n\nThe efficacy of petition in prayer for physical healing to a deity has been evaluated in numerous other studies, with contradictory results. There has been some criticism of the way the studies were conducted.\n\nSome attempt to heal by prayer, mental practices, spiritual insights, or other techniques, claiming they can summon divine or supernatural intervention on behalf of the ill. Others advocate that ill people may achieve healing through prayer performed by themselves. According to the varied beliefs of those who practice it, faith healing may be said to afford gradual relief from pain or sickness or to bring about a sudden \"miracle cure\", and it may be used in place of, or in tandem with, conventional medical techniques for alleviating or curing diseases. Faith healing has been criticized on the grounds that those who use it may delay seeking potentially curative conventional medical care. This is particularly problematic when parents use faith healing techniques on children.\n\nIn 1872, Francis Galton conducted a famous statistical experiment to determine whether prayer had a physical effect on the external environment. Galton hypothesized that if prayer was effective, members of the British Royal family would live longer, given that thousands prayed for their wellbeing every Sunday. He therefore compared longevity in the British Royal family with that of the general population, and found no difference. While the experiment was probably intended to satirize, and suffered from a number of confounders, it set the precedent for a number of different studies, the results of which are contradictory.\n\nTwo studies claimed that patients who are being prayed for recover more quickly or more frequently although critics have claimed that the methodology of such studies are flawed, and the perceived effect disappears when controls are tightened. One such study, with a double-blind design and about 500 subjects per group, was published in 1988; it suggested that intercessory prayer by born again Christians had a statistically significant positive effect on a coronary care unit population. Critics contend that there were severe methodological problems with this study. Another such study was reported by Harris et al. Critics also claim that the 1988 study was not fully double-blinded, and that in the Harris study, patients actually had a longer hospital stay in the prayer group, if one discounts the patients in both groups who left before prayers began, although the Harris study did demonstrate the prayed for patients on average received lower course scores (indicating better recovery).\n\nOne of the largest randomized, blind clinical trials was a remote \"retroactive\" intercessory prayer study conducted in Israel by Leibovici. This study used 3393 patient records from 1990–96, and blindly assigned some of these to an intercessory prayer group. The prayer group had shorter hospital stays and duration of fever.\n\nSeveral studies of prayer effectiveness have yielded null results. A 2001 double-blind study of the Mayo Clinic found no significant difference in the recovery rates between people who were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them and those who were not. Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer. In another similar study published in the \"American Heart Journal\" in 2006, Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications than those who did not know if they were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer. Another 2006 study suggested that prayer actually had a significant negative effect on the recovery of cardiac bypass patients, resulting in more frequent deaths and slower recovery time for those patient who received prayers.\n\nMany believe that prayer can aid in recovery, not due to divine influence but due to psychological and physical benefits. It has also been suggested that if a person knows that he or she is being prayed for it can be uplifting and increase morale, thus aiding recovery. (See Subject-expectancy effect.) Many studies have suggested that prayer can reduce physical stress, regardless of the god or gods a person prays to, and this may be true for many worldly reasons. According to a study by Centra State Hospital, \"the psychological benefits of prayer may help reduce stress and anxiety, promote a more positive outlook, and strengthen the will to live.\" Other practices such as yoga, t'ai chi, and meditation may also have a positive impact on physical and psychological health.\n\nOthers feel that the concept of conducting prayer experiments reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of prayer. The previously mentioned study published in the \"American Heart Journal\" indicated that some of the intercessors who took part in it complained about the scripted nature of the prayers that were imposed to them, saying that this is not the way they usually conduct prayer: \n\nOne scientific movement attempts to track the physical effects of prayer through neuroscience. Leaders in this movement include Andrew Newberg, an Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania. In Newberg's brain scans, monks, priests, nuns, sisters and gurus alike have exceptionally focused attention and compassion sites. This is a result of the frontal lobe of the brain’s engagement (Newberg, 2009). Newburg believes that anybody can connect to the supernatural with practice. Those without religious affiliations benefit from the connection to the metaphysical as well. Newberg also states that further evidence towards humans' need for metaphysical relationships is that as science had increased spirituality has not decreased. Newburg believes that at the end of the 18th century, when the scientific method began to consume the human mind, religion could have vanished. However, two hundred years later, the perception of spirituality, in many instances, appears to be gaining in strength (2009). Newberg's research also provides the connection between prayer and meditation and health. By understanding how the brain works during religious experiences and practices Newberg's research shows that the brain changes during these practices allowing an understanding of how religion affects psychological and physical health (2009). For example, brain activity during meditation indicates that people who frequently practice prayer or meditation experience lower blood-pressure, lower heart rates, decreased anxiety, and decreased depression.\n\nSome modalities of alternative medicine employ prayer. A survey released in May 2004 by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health in the United States, found that in 2002, 43% of Americans pray for their own health, 24% pray for others' health, and 10% participate in a prayer group for their own health.\n"}
{"id": "10053429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10053429", "title": "Religion and geography", "text": "Religion and geography\n\nReligion and geography is the study of the impact of geography, i.e. place and space, on religious belief.\n\nAnother aspect of the relationship between religion and geography is \"religious geography\", in which geographical ideas are influenced by religion, such as early map-making, and the \"biblical geography\" that developed in the 16th century to identify places from the Bible.\n\nTraditionally, the relationship between geography and religion can clearly be seen by the influences of religion in shaping cosmological understandings of the world. From the sixteenth and seventeenth century, the study of geography and religion mainly focused on mapping the spread of Christianity (termed ecclesiastical geography by Issac 1965), though in the later half of the seventeenth century, the influences and spread of other religions were also taken into account.\n\nOther traditional approaches to the study of the relationship between geography and religion involved the theological explorations of the workings of Nature – a highly environmentally deterministic approach which identified the role of geographical environments in determining the nature and evolution of different religious traditions.\n\nThus, geographers are less concerned about religion per se, but are more sensitive to how religion as a cultural feature affects social, cultural, political and environmental systems. The point of focus is not the specifics of religious beliefs and practices, but how these religious beliefs and practices are internalised by adherents, and how these processes of internalization influence, and is influenced by, social systems.\n\nTraditional cultural geographical approaches to the study of religion mainly seek to determine religion’s impact on the landscape. A more contemporary approach to the study of the intersections of geography and religion not only highlights the role of religion in affecting landscape changes and in assigning sacred meanings to specific places, but also acknowledges how in turn, religious ideology and practice at specific spaces are guided and transformed by their location.\n\nReligious experiences and the belief in religious meanings transforms physical spaces into sacred spaces. These perceptions and imaginings influence the way such spaces are used, and the personal, spiritual meanings developed in using such sacred spaces. These religiously significant spaces go beyond officially religious/spiritual spaces (such as places of worship) to include non-official religious spaces such as homes, schools and even bodies. These works have focused on both material aspects of spaces (such as architectural distinctiveness) and socially constructed spaces (such as rituals and demarcation of sacred spaces) to present religious meaning and significance.\n\nA key focus in the study of sacred places is the politics of identity, belonging and meaning that are ascribed to sacred sites, and the constant negotiations for power and legitimacy. Particularly in multicultural settings, the contestation for legitimacy, public approval, and negotiations for use of particular spaces are at the heart of determining how communities understand, internalise and struggle to compete for the right to practice their religious traditions in public spaces.\n\nReligion may be a starting point to examine issues of ethnic identity formation and the construction of ethnic identity Geographers studying the negotiations of religious identity within various communities are often concerned with the overt articulation of religious identity, for example, how adherents in different locations establish their distinctive (religious and cultural) identities through their own understandings of the religion, and how they externally present their religious adherence (in terms of religious practice, ritual and behaviour). As an overarching theme, the articulation of religious identity is concerned with material aspects of symbolizing religious identity (such as architecture and the establishment of a physical presence), with negotiations and struggles in asserting religious identity in the face of persecution and exclusion and with personal practices of religious ritual and behaviour that re-establishes one’s religious identity\n\nAs research on geography and religion has grown, one of the new focuses of geographical research examines the rise of religious fundamentalism, and the resulting impact this has on the geographical contexts in which it develops.\n\nIn addition, migration processes have resulted in the development of religious pluralism in numerous countries, and the landscape changes that accompany the movement and settlement of communities defined by religion is a key focus in the study of geography and religion. More work needs to be done to examine the intersections and collisions that occur due to the movement of communities (for example, the migration of Muslim communities to western countries) and highlight how these communities negotiate their religious experiences in new spaces. Recent research in this area has been published by Barry A. Vann who analyzes Muslim population shifts in the Western world and the theological factors that play into these demographic trends. \n\nAnother new area of interest in the study of geography and religion explores different sites of religious practice beyond the ‘officially sacred’ – sites such as religious schools, media spaces, banking and financial practices (for example, Islamic banking) and home spaces are just some of the different avenues that take into account informal, everyday spaces that intersect with religious practice and meaning.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12032006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12032006", "title": "Religion in ancient Tamil country", "text": "Religion in ancient Tamil country\n\nThe Sangam period in Tamilakam (c. 500 BCE to 300 CE) was characterized by the coexistence of many religions: Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism alongside the ethnic religions of the Tamil people. The monarchs of the time practiced religious tolerance and openly encouraged religious discussions and invited teachers of every sect to the public halls to preach their doctrines.\n\nTamil religions denotes the religious traditions and practices of Tamil-speaking people. The Tamils are native to modern state of India known as Tamil Nadu and the northern and eastern part of Sri Lanka. Tamils lives also outside their native boundaries due to migration such as Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, South Africa, Australia, Great Britain, United States, Canada, Réunion, Myanmar, Mauritius and in countries in Europe. Many emigrant Tamils retain elements of a cultural, linguistic, and religious tradition that predates the Christian era.\n\nA Neolithic cattle-herding culture existed in South India several millennia prior to the Christian era. By the first century, a relatively well-developed civilization had emerged. It is described in some detail in Tamil texts such as the Tholkappiyam (third BCE) and by the Sankam poets—an \"academy\" of poets who wrote in the first two centuries of the Common Era.\n\nAncient Tamil grammatical works Tholkappiyam, the ten anthologies Pathuppāṭṭu, the eight anthologies Eṭṭuttokai sheds light on early religion of ancient Tamil people. Murugan was glorified as, \"the red god seated on the blue peacock, who is ever young and resplendent,\" as \"the favored god of the Tamils.\" Shiva was also seen as the supreme God. Early iconography of Murugan and Shiva and their association with native flora and fauna goes back to Indus Valley Civilization. The Sangam landscape was classified into five categories, \"thinais\", based on the mood, the season and the land. Tolkappiyam, mentions that each of these \"thinai\" had an associated deity such Murugan in \"Kurinji\"-the hills, Thirumal in \"Mullai\"-the forests, Kaali in \"Pālai\"-the deserts, Indra in \"Marutham\"-the plains and Varuna in \"Neithal\"-the coasts and the seas. Other gods mentioned were Krishna and Balaram who were all assimilated into Sangam religion over time. Dravidian influence on early Vedic religion is evident, many of these features are already present in the oldest known Indo-Aryan language, the language of the \"Rigveda\" (c. 1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed to Dravidian languages. This represents an early religious and cultural fusion or synthesis between ancient Tamils and Indo-Aryans, which became more evident over time with sacred iconography, flora and fauna that went on to influence Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.\n\nThe cult of the mother goddess is treated as an indication of a society which venerated femininity. This mother goddess was conceived as a virgin, one who has given birth to all and one. The temples of the Sangam days, mainly of Madurai, seem to have had priestesses to the deity, which also appear predominantly a goddess. In the Sangam literature, there is an elaborate description of the rites performed by the Kurava priestess in the shrine Palamutircholai.\n\n\"Veriyattam\" refers to spirit possession of women, who took part in priestly functions. Under the influence of the god, women sang and danced, but also read the dim past, predicted the future, diagnosed diseases. Twenty two poets of the Sangam age in as many as 40 poems portray Veriyatal. Velan is a reporter and prophet endowed with supernatural powers. Veriyatal had been performed by men as well as women.\n\nAmong the early Tamils the practice of erecting hero stones (\"nadukkal\") had appeared, and it continued for quite a long time after the Sangam age, down to about 11th century. It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to bless them with victory.\n\nTheyyam is a ritual shaman dance popular in Kerala and parts of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Theyyam migrates into the artist who has assumed the spirit and it is a belief that the god or goddess comes in the midst of fathering through the medium of possessed dancer. The dancer throws rice on the audience and distributes turmeric powder as symbols of blessing. Theyyam incorporates dance, mime and music and enshrines the rudiments of ancient tribal cultures which attached great importance to the worship of heroes and the spirits of ancestors, is a socio-religious ceremony. There are over 400 Theyyams performed, the most spectacular ones are those of Raktha Chamundi, Kari Chamundi, Muchilottu Bhagavathi, Wayanadu Kulaven, Gulikan and Pottan. These are performed in front of shrines, sans stage or curtains.\n\nThe early character of Tamil religion was celebrative. It embodied an aura of sacral immanence, sensing the sacred in the vegetation, fertility, and color of the land. The summum bonum of the religious experience was expressed in terms of possession by the god, or ecstasy. Into this milieu there immigrated a sobering influence—a growing number of Jain and Buddhist communities and an increasing influx of northerners.\n\nThe layout of villages can be assumed to be standard across most villages. An Amman (mother goddess) is at the centre of the villages while a male guardian deity () has a shrine at the village borders. Nowadays, Amman can be either worshipped alone or as a part of the Vedic pantheon.\n\nThroughout Tamil Nadu, a king was considered to be divine by nature and possessed religious significance. The King was 'the representative of God on earth' and lived in a \"koyil\", which means the \"residence of God\". The Modern Tamil word for temple is koil (). Titular worship was also given to Kings.\n\nWords meaning 'King', like \"kō\" ( \"King\"), \"iṟai\" ( \"Emperor\") and \"āṇḍavan\" ( \"Conqueror\") now primarily refer to Gods. Mōcikīraṉār in the Purananuru says: \nThe Kingdom suffered by famine or disorder when the King erred. These elements were incorporated later into Hinduism like the legendary marriage of Shiva to Queen Meenatchi who ruled Madurai or Wanji-ko, a god who later merged into Indra. Tolkappiyar refers to the Three Crowned Kings as the \"Three Glorified by Heaven\", (). In the Dravidian-speaking South, the concept of divine kingship led to the assumption of major roles by state and temple.\n\nAt the birth of Raja Raja Chola I, the Thiruvalangadu inscription states, \"Having noticed by the marks (on his body) that Arulmozhi was the very Thirumal, the protector of the three worlds, descended on earth...\" During the Bhakti movement, poets often compared gods to kings.\n\nThe brick temple excavated in 2005 dates to the Sangam period and is believed to be the oldest Hindu temple to be found in Tamil Nadu. The temple faces north, unlike most Hindu temples which face either east or west and is believed to have been constructed even before \"shilpa shastras\" were written\nDuring the Sangam period, Shiva, Murugan, Thirumal and Kotravai were some of the popular deities. The poetic division of the landscape into five regions also associated each region with its own patron deity.\nThe people of the pastoral lands or the Mullai regions worshipped Thirumal. The Marutham people worshipped Indra or \"Ventan\", while the Neithal people considered Varunan or \"Katalon\" to be their patron deity and the Palai people worshipped Korravai or Kali. Other popular deities of this age were Kama the god of love, Surya the sun, Chandra the moon and Yama the god of death. The Brahmins of the Tamil country attached great importance to the performance of Vedic sacrifices. Priests learned in the Vedic rites typically performed them under the patronage of the kings.\n\nThe temples of the Sangam age were built out of perishable materials such as plaster, timber and brick, which is why little trace of them is found today. The only public structures of any historical importance belonging to this age that have survived to this day are the rock-beds hewn out of natural rock formation, that were made for the ascetics. The \"Silappatikaram\" and the Sangam poems such as \"Kaliththokai\", \"Mullaippāṭṭu\" and \"Purananuru\" mention several kinds of temples such as the \"Puranilaikkottam\" or the temple at the outskirts of a city, the \"Netunilaikkottam\" or the tall temple, the \"Palkunrakkottam\" the temple on top of a hill, the \"Ilavantikaippalli\" or the temple with a garden and bathing ghat, the \"Elunilaimatam\" or a seven storeyed temple, the \"Katavutkatinakar\" or the temple city.\n\nSome of the popular festivals of this age were Karthigaideepam, Tiruvonam, Kaman vizha and Indira vizha. Karthigaideepam was otherwise known as Peruvizha and was celebrated in the Tamil month of Karthigai every year. The Kaaman vizha was held in the spring and during this festival, men and women dressed up well and participated in dancing. Indravizha included the performance of Vedic sacrifices, prayers to various gods, musical recitals and dancing.\n\nThe exact origins of Jainism in Tamil Nadu is unclear. However, Jains flourished in Tamil Nadu at least as early as the Sangam period. Tamil Jain tradition places their origins are much earlier. Some scholars believe that the author of the oldest extant work of literature in Tamil (3rd century BCE), Tolkāppiyam, was a Jain.\n\nA number of Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions have been found in Tamil Nadu that date from the 2nd century BCE. They are regarded to be associated with Jain monks and lay devotees.\n\nScholars consider the Tirukkural by Valluvar to be the work by a Jain. It emphatically supports vegetarianism (Chapter 26) and states that giving up animal sacrifice is worth more than a thousand offerings in fire (verse 259).\n\nSilappatikaram, a major work in Tamil literature, was written by a Camaṇa, Ilango Adigal. It describes the historical events of its time and also of the then-prevailing religions, Jainism, Buddhism and Shaivism. The main characters of this work, Kannagi and Kovalan, who have a divine status among Tamils, were Jains.\n\nAccording to George L. Hart, the legend of the Tamil Sangams or \"literary assemblies: was based on the Jain \"sangham\" at Madurai:\nThere was a permanent Jaina assembly called a Sangha established about 604 CE in Maturai. It seems likely that this assembly was the model upon which tradition fabricated the cangkam legend.\"\n\nJainism began to decline around the 8th century, with many Tamil kings embracing Hindu religions, especially Shaivism. Still, the Chalukya, Pallava and Pandya dynasties embraced Jainism.\n\nThe Buddhists worshiped the impressions of Buddha’s feet engraved on stone and platforms made of stone that represented his seat. The pious Buddhist walked round them, with his right side towards them and bowed his head as a token of reverence. The Silapatikaram mentions that the monks worshipped Buddha by praising him as the wise, holy and virtuous teacher who adhered to his vows strictly, as the one who subdued anger and all evil passions and as the refuge of all mankind. Manimekalai is a sequel to the Silapathikaram, which tellst the story of Buddhism of the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi.\n\nIn the Buddhist Viharas or monasteries, learned monks preached their sermons, seated in a place which was entirely concealed from the view of the audience. The Buddhists did not observe the distinctions of caste and invited all ranks to assemble on a footing of equality. Self-control, wisdom and charity were among the virtues preached and practiced by the monks, who were numerous in the ancient Tamil country.\n\nChristianity is said to be introduced in India by St. Thomas the Apostle who landed at Muziris on Malabar Coast in the year 52 AD. These ancient Christians are today known as Saint Thomas Christians or Syriac Christians or Nasrani. They are now divided into different denominations namely, Syro-Malabar Catholic, Syro-Malankara Catholic, Malankara Orthodox, Jacobite and Malankara Marthoma. Syriac Christians followed the same rules of caste and population as that of Hindus and sometimes they were even considered as population neutralizers. They tend to be endogamous, and tend not to intermarry even with other Christian groupings. Saint Thomas Christians derive status within the caste system from the tradition that they were elites, who were evangelized by St. Thomas. Also, internal mobility is allowed among these Saint Thomas Christian sects and the caste status is kept even if the sect allegiance is switched (for example, from Syriac Orthodox to Syro-Malabar Catholic). Despite the sectarian differences, Syriac Christians share a common social status within the Caste system of Kerala and is considered as Forward Caste.\n\nThe traditional account is that traders from Judea arrived in the city of Cochin, Kerala in 562 BCE, and that more Jews came as exiles from Israel in the year 70 CE after the destruction of the Second Temple. The distinct Jewish community was called Anjuvannam. The still-functioning synagogue in Mattancherry belongs to the Paradesi Jews, the descendants of Sephardim that were expelled from Spain in 1492.\n\nThe secular identity of the Sangam literature is often celebrated to represent the tolerance among Tamil people. Es Vaiyāpurip Piḷḷai, concludes in his \"History of Tamil language and literature: beginning to 1000 A. D.\": Most scholars agree that the lack of 'god' should not be inferred to be atheistic. The Tamil books of Law, particularly the Tirukkural, is considered as the Perennial philosophy of Tamil culture because of its universalisability.\n\nŪzh meaning 'fate' or 'destiny' and vinai meaning 'works' concerns the ancient Tamil belief of differentiating what man can do and what is destined.\n\nSangam Tamil people understood two distinct characteristics of Godhood.

Some deities, such as Pachamama and Viracocha, were known throughout the empire, while others were localised.\n\nInca deities occupied the three realms:\n\n\nIn addition to the communally worshiped deities, Incan families sometimes worshiped household gods via their representation as miniature figurines most commonly referred to as \"chancas\" or \"conopas\". Conopa were often natural or carved stone objects that resembled crops or livestock, such as \"zarap conopa\" for maize, \"papap conopa\" for potatoes and caullama for llamas.\n\nMany ancient Andean peoples traced their origins to ancestral deities. Multiple clans could share similar ancestral origins. The Inca claimed descent from the Sun and the Moon, their Father and Mother. Many clans claimed descent from early proto-humans that emerged from local sites in nature called pacarinas.\n\nThe earliest ancestors of the Inca were known as Ayar, the first of which was Manco Capac or Ayar Manco. Inca mythology tells of his travels, in which he and the Ayar shaped and marked the land and introduced the cultivation of maize.\n\nReligious traditions in the Andes tended to vary among different ayllus. While the Inca generally allowed or even incorporated local deities and heroes of the ayllus they conquered, they did bring their gods to those peoples by incorporating them in law such as required sacrifice. The Inca attempted to combine their deities with conquered ones in ways that raised the status of their own. One example of this is Pachamama, the goddess of Earth, who was worshiped long before the rise of the Inca. In the Inca mythology Pachamama having been integrated was placed below the Moon who the Inca believed ruled over all female gods.\n\nA theme in Inca mythology is the duality of the Cosmos. The realms were separated into the upper and lower realms, the \"hanan pacha\" and the \"ukhu pacha\" and \"urin pacha\". \"Hanan pacha\", the upper world, consisted of the deities of the sun, moon, stars, rainbow, and lightning while \"ukhu pacha\" and \"urin pacha\" were the realms of Pachamama, the earth mother, and the ancestors and heroes of the Inca or other ayllus. \"Kay pacha\", the realm of the outer earth, where humans resided was viewed as an intermediary realm between \"hanan pacha\" and \"ukhu pacha\". The realms were represented by the condor (upper world), puma (outer earth) and snake (inner earth).\n\nSacred sites or things named \"wak'a\" were spread around the Inca Empire. In Andean mythology a \"wak'a\" was a deific entity which resided in natural objects such as mountains, boulders, streams, battle fields, other meeting places, and any type of place that was connected with past Incan rulers. A \"wak'a\" could also be an inanimate object such as pottery which was believed to be a deity-carrying vessel. Spiritual leaders in a community would use prayer and offerings to communicate with a \"wak'a\" for advice or assistance. Human sacrifice was part of Incan rituals in which they usually sacrificed a child (\"qhapaq hucha\") or a slave. The Incan people thought it was an honor to die as an offering.\n\nArchaeological remains confirm such human sacrificial practices, according to Reinhard and Ceruti: \"Archaeological evidence found on distant mountain summits has established that the burial of offerings was a common practice among the Incas and that human sacrifice took place at several of the sites. The excellent preservation of the bodies and other material in the cold and dry environment of the high Andes provides revealing details about the rituals that were performed at these ceremonial complexes.\"\n\nThe Incas also used divination. Divination was used to inform people in the city of social events, predict battle outcomes, and ask for metaphysical intervention.\n\nDivination was essential before taking any action. Nearly every religious rite was accompanied by sacrifices. These were usually maize beer, food or llamas, but were occasionally of virgins or children. \n\nDivination was an important part of Inca religion, as reflected in the following quote:\nThe rulers of the Inca empire, such as the last united Inca ruler Huayna Capac, were often mummified upon the time of their death, allowing for their bodies to be worshipped within the palaces.These worshipping events were intercepted by the Spaniards under Juan Polo de Ondegardo y Zárate, who was newly appointed as the Chief Magistrate of Cuzco in 1559, when it was under Spanish control. Ondegardo conducted a massive effort to prevent the Inca from committing their “idolatrous sins”, mainly by locating the mummified bodies of late Inca kings and sending them to the viceroy in Lima. They remained in a hospital for around 80 years before their whereabouts became unknown.The Inca used to mummify their kings and several times a year they would be aligned in accordance to when they chronologically ruled in Cuzco’s plaza for the public to pay their respects. In the other parts of the year, the mummies were returned to the Cuzco palaces and were worshipped privately by groups of visitors. Francisco Pizarro stated that “It was customary for the dead to visit one another, and they held great dances and debaucheries, and sometimes the dead went to the house of the living, and sometimes the living came to the house of the dead”. The kings were thought to have been able to speak back to the worshippers through the use of oracles, and even gave advice to the protection and ruling of the land. The ruling Inca was expected to seek advice from the mummies of his ancestors for important issues. Not all Inca mummies were glorified, however, as in one case Topa Inca Yupanqui’s mummified body was torched and his bloodline all killed as they sided with Huascar in the civil war.\n\nUpon the arrival of the Spanish, the Inca started to hide the bodies of the kings and become more secretive with their worship, as stated by Juan de Betanzos. After being appointed, Polo do Ondegardo and his men found most of the mummified kings and took their bodies along with other ritualistic items such as their huaques, or their statues. A popular thought is that Ondegardo had the bodies buried in or around Cuzco in secret so that they would not be uncovered and worshipped again. Garcilaso de la Vega visited Ondegardo’s house and was shown an assembly of embalmed kings and attested to the degree of their preservation: “The bodies were perfectly preserved without the loss of hair of the head or brow or an eyelash. They were dressed as if they had been in life, with Ilautus (royal headbands) on their heads… their hands were crossed across their breast.”. The mummies were afterwards sent to the viceroy for him to see them and then afterwards they were brought back to Cuzco and thought to be secretly buried.The viceroy stored the mummies in the Hospital of San Andres in Lima because he was “a major benefactor of it”. Since the hospital was solely for the Spanish residents, they were likely on display for the citizens to view, away from the natives.\n\nThe Inca calendar had 12 months of 30 days, with each month having its own festival, and a five-day feast at the end, before the new year began. The Incan year started in December, and began with Qhapaq Raymi, the magnificent festival.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36627768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36627768", "title": "Religiosity and education", "text": "Religiosity and education\n\nThe relationship between the level of religiosity and the level of education has been studied since the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe parameters of the two components diverse: the \"level of religiosity\" remains a concept which is difficult to differentiate scientifically, while the \"level of education\" is easier to compile, such as official data on this topic, because data on education is publicly accessible in many countries.\n\nDifferent studies show contrasted conclusions regarding any link between the two concepts, depending on whether \"religiosity\" is measured by religious practices (attendance at places of worship, for example) or specific religious beliefs (belief in miracles, for example), with notable differences between nations. For example, an international study states that in some Western nations the intensity of beliefs decreases with education, but attendance and religious practice increases. Other studies indicate that the religious have higher education than the non-religious. Other studies find that the positive correlation with low or non religiosity and education has been reversed in the past few decades.\n\nIn terms of university professors, one study concluded that in the US, the majority of professors, even at \"elite\" universities, were religious.\n\nA Pew Center study about religion and education around the world in 2016, found that Jews are most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 13.4 years of schooling; Jews also have the highest number of graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita (61%). Based on the study data, Muslims and Hindus have the lowest average levels of education, with an average of 5.6 years of schooling for both. About 36% of the world Muslim population and 41% of the world Hindu population have no formal schooling, Muslims and Hindus have the lowest average levels of higher education than any other major religious group, with only 8% and 10% respectively have graduate and post-graduate degrees.\n\nChristians ranked as the second most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 9.3 years of schooling. Christians were found to have the second highest number of graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita while in absolute numbers ranked in the first place (220 million). According to the study, Christians in North America, Europe, Middle East, North Africa and Asia-Pacific regions are highly educated since many of the world universities were built by the historic Christian churches, in addition to the historical evidence that \"Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic\". According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of gender equality in educational attainment, and the study suggests that one of the reasons is the encouragement of the Protestant Reformers in promoting the education of women, which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities.\n\nThe religiously unaffiliated—which includes atheists, agnostics and those who describe their religion as “nothing in particular”—ranked as the third most educated religious group with an average of 8.8 years of schooling, and around 16% of unaffiliated have graduate and post-graduate degrees.\n\nBuddhists have an average of 7.9 years of schooling, and around 12% of Buddhists have graduate and post-graduate degrees. According to the same study \"there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in sub-Saharan Africa\" as Muslim adults in this region are far less educated than their Christian counterparts, with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the educational facilities that were created by Christian missionaries during the colonial era for fellow believers.\n\nAccording to a 2015 global survey by Gallup International, the most religious had lower levels of education, however, religious people in general were a majority in all educational levels.\n\nAn EU survey finds a positive correlation between leaving school early and believing in a God.\n\nIn one analysis of World Values Survey data by Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote noted that in 65 former socialist countries there is a negative relationship between years of education and belief in God, with similar negative correlations for other religious beliefs while, in contrast, there were strong positive correlations between years of education and belief in God in many developed countries such as England, France and the US. They concluded that \"these cross-country differences in the education-belief relationship can be explained by political factors (such as communism) which lead some countries to use state controlled education to discredit religion\". The study also concludes that, in the United States and other developed nations, \"education raises religious attendance at individual level,\" while \"at the same time, there is a strong negative connection between attendance and education across religious groups within the U.S. and elsewhere.\" The authors suggest that \"this puzzle is explained if education both increases the returns to social connection and reduces the extent of religious belief,\" causing more educated individuals to sort into less fervent denominations.\n\nStatistical analysis of Nobel prizes awarded between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 65.4% of Nobel laureates were Christians, over 20% were Jewish, and 10.5% were atheists, agnostics, or freethinkers. According to a study that was done by University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 1998, 60% of Nobel prize laureates in physics from 1901 to 1990 had a Christian background. Since 1901-2013, 22% of all Nobel prizes have been awarded to Jews.\n\nResearch in nonreligion in Britain has shown that the positive relationship between education and non-religion has been reversed with generations after 1955. In other words, the nonreligious populations tend to have less education and religious populations tend to have higher education, even though religious affiliation has decreased for both. \n\nA survey conducted by the \"Times of India\" revealed that 22% of IIT Bombay graduates do not believe in the existence of God, while another 30% do not know.\n\nIn Ireland, the non-religious have a greater level of education than the general population.\n\nIn 1980, a study was conducted in Spain that showed that many educated people were Catholic.\n\nAccording to the General Social Survey, which has collected data on Americans since 1972, people who are educated often are more religious by various measures. For instance, as of 2010 sociologist Philip Schwadel found that, with each additional year of education, the likelihood of attending religious services increased 15%, the likelihood of reading the Bible at least occasionally increased by 9%. The likelihood of switching to a mainline Protestant denomination increased by 13%. Schwadel said, “With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God...But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’”\nSociologist Bradley Wright reviewed results from the 2008 Pew US Religious Landscape Survey and noted that religious groups normally have significant levels of education compared to those who are non-religious. \"The irony\" he states \"is that some of the religiously unaffiliated explain their rejection of religion in terms of superior learning, but several religious groups have much higher levels of education.\"\n\nHe found that Hindus, Jews, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Buddhists, and Orthodox Christians have the highest levels of education. Catholics, Mormons, and Muslims are at about the national average.. Jehovah's Witnesses have by far the lowest education. Evangelicals are somewhat below the national average. The religiously unaffiliated are just slightly above average in levels of college education. Sociological research by Patricia Snell and Christian Smith on many dimensions of general American youth have noted that older research on baby boomers showed correlations where higher education undermined religiosity, however, studies on today's youth have consistently shown that this has disappeared and now students in college are more likely religious than people who do not go to college.\n\nAccording to the Gallup's 2002 Index of Leading Religious Indicators for the US, the relationship between education and religiosity are complex. For instance, there are slight differences in belief in God and membership in a congregation: 88% of those with postgraduate degrees believe in God or a universal spirit, compared to 97% of those with a high school education or less; 70% of postgraduate degree holders say they are members of a congregation, compared to 64% of those with a high school education or less.\n\nResearch done by Barry Kosmin indicates that Americans with post-graduate education have a similar religious distribution and affiliation to the general population, with a higher \"public religiosity\" (i.e., membership in congregations and worship attendance), but slightly less \"belief.\" Advanced education in U.S. does not seem to produce much religious skepticism since so many post-graduates are religious believers.\n\nResearch done by Barry Kosmin and Ariela Keysar on college students looked at three worldviews — Religious, Secular, and Spiritual — and looked students from levels from freshmen to post-graduates from majors such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), Social and Behavioral Sciences, Arts and Humanities, and Undecided. The Religious were 31.8% of the total sample (40% from STEM, 27% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 27% from Arts and Humanities, and 5% from Undecided); the Secular were 28.2% of the total sample (38% from STEM, 29% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 30% from Arts and Humanities, and 3% from Undecided); the Spiritual were 32.4% of the total sample (29% from STEM, 36% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 31% from Arts and Humanities, and 4% from Undecided).\n\nResearch by Neil Gross and Solon Simmons done on more than 1,400 professors from 20 disciplinary fields and religiosity found that the majority of professors, even at \"elite\" universities were religious believers. As a whole, university professors were less religious than the general US population, but it is hardly the case that the professorial landscape is characterized by an absence of religion. In the study, 9.8% were atheists, 13.1% were agnostic, 19.2% believe in a higher power, 4.3% believe in God some of the time, 16.6% had doubts but believed in God, 34.9% believed in God and had no doubts. At \"elite\" doctoral universities 36.5% were either atheists or agnostics and 20.4% believed in God without any doubts. Furthermore the authors noted, \"religious skepticism represents a minority position, even among professors teaching at elite research universities.\" They also found that professors at elite doctoral universities are much less religious than professors teaching in other kinds of institutions with more atheists and agnostics in numbers. However, both groups were still a minority.\n\nA study noted positive correlations, among nonreligious Americans, between levels of education and not believing in a deity. \n\nFrank Sulloway of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Michael Shermer of the California State University conducted a study that found in their polling sample of \"credentialed\" U.S. adults (12% had Ph.Ds and 62% were college graduates) 64% believed in God, and there was a correlation indicating that religious conviction diminished with education level.\n\nSociologist W. Bradford Wilcox said that people with less education have decreased in religiosity in America. Their views on family and work have been associated with this effect. Research on secularity has noted that, in America, agnostics have significant levels of education, while atheists have relatively low levels of education. Sociologist Christian Smith has done research on American evangelicals and has found that, on average, self-identified evangelicals have more years of education than fundamentalists, liberals, Roman Catholics, and the nonreligious, but slightly less than mainline Protestants. He also found that evangelicals were the least likely to have high school education or less, the nonreligious were the most likely to have high school education or less, and higher proportions of evangelicals had studied at the graduate level than fundamentalists, liberals, and the nonreligious.\n\nSociologist Philip Schwadel found that higher levels of education \"positively affects religious participation, devotional activities, and emphasizing the importance of religion in daily life\", education is not correlated with disbelief in God, and correlates with greater tolerance for atheists' public opposition to religion and greater skepticism of \"exclusivist religious viewpoints and biblical literalism\". \n\nCross-national sociological research by Norris and Inglehart notes a positive correlation between religious attendance among the more educated in the United States.\n\nAccording to a Pew Center study there is correlation between education and income: about 77% of American Hindus have a graduate and post-graduate degree, followed by Unitarian Universalists (67%), Jews (59%), Anglican (59%), Episcopalians (56%) and Presbyterians (47%) and United Church of Christ (46%). While cording to the same study about (43%) of American atheists, and (42%) agnostics, and (24%) of those who say their religion is “nothing in particular” have a graduate and post-graduate degree.\n\nStudies of Mormons in the US show that Mormons with higher education attend church more regularly than less-educated Mormons. Survey research indicated that 41% of Mormons with only elementary school education attend church regularly, compared to 76% of Mormon college graduates and 78% of Mormons who went beyond their college degrees to do graduate study attending church regularly.\n\nEdward Dutton studied findings that indicate that universities that are particularly transitional and prestigious tend to have (in contrast to less transitional universities), tightly differentiated and ‘fundamentalist’ student evangelical groups and higher levels of conversion while at university. He argued that Oxford University students are likely to be not just more intelligent in IQ terms than comparable students but more creative, more original in their thinking and more able to acquire knowledge — factors Dutton found made religious experience more likely in an individual.\nIn 1975, Norman Poythress studied a sample of 234 US college undergraduates, grouping them into relatively homogeneous religious types based on the similarity of their religious beliefs and compared their personality characteristics. He found that \"Literally-oriented religious Believers did not differ significantly from Mythologically-oriented Believers on measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, or racial prejudice. Religious Believers as a group were found to be significantly less intelligent and more authoritarian than religious Skeptics.\" He used SAT scores as a measure of intelligence for this study.\n\nContrary to the researchers' expectations, fundamentalist 'converts' were not less educated people. However, a weak 'negative correlation' between education and Christian fundamentalism was found by Burton et al. (1989), a study comparing the religious beliefs and educational achievements of white, Protestant residents of Delaware County, Indiana.\n\n"}

The first time the topic of shadow people was discussed at length on the show was April 12, 2001 when host Art Bell interviewed Native American elder Thunder Strikes, who is also known as Harley \"SwiftDeer\" Reagan. During the show, listeners were encouraged to submit drawings of shadow people that they had seen and a large number of these drawings were immediately shared publicly on the website. In October that year, Heidi Hollis published her first book on the topic of shadow people, and later became a regular guest on \"Coast to Coast\". Hollis describes shadow people as dark silhouettes with human shapes and profiles that flicker in and out of peripheral vision, and claims that people have reported the figures attempting to \"jump on their chest and choke them\". She believes the figures to be negative, alien beings that can be repelled by various means, including invoking \"the Name of Jesus\".\n\nAlthough participants in online discussion forums devoted to paranormal and supernatural topics describe them as menacing, other believers and paranormal authors do not agree whether shadow people are either evil, helpful, or neutral, and some even speculate that shadow people may be the extra-dimensional inhabitants of another universe. Some paranormal investigators and authors such as Chad Stambaugh claim to have recorded images of shadow people on video.\n\nShadow people feature in two episodes of ITV paranormal documentary series \"Extreme Ghost Stories\", where the phenomenon is described as a \"black mass\".\n\nSeveral physiological and psychological conditions can account for reported experiences of shadowy shapes seeming alive. A sleep paralysis sufferer may perceive a \"shadowy or indistinct shape\" approaching them when they lie awake paralyzed and become increasingly alarmed. Neuroscientists Baland Jalal and V.S. Ramachandran have recently proposed neurological theories for why people hallucinate shadow figures during sleep paralysis.\n\nA person experiencing heightened emotion, such as while walking alone on a dark night, may incorrectly perceive a patch of shadow as an attacker.\n\nMany methamphetamine addicts report the appearance of \"shadow people\" after prolonged periods of sleep deprivation. Psychiatrist Jack Potts suggests that methamphetamine usage adds a \"conspiratorial component\" to the sleep deprivation hallucinations. One interviewed subject said that \"You don't see shadow dogs or shadow birds or shadow cars. You see shadow people. Standing in doorways, walking behind you, coming at you on the sidewalk.\" These hallucinations have been directly compared to the paranormal entities described in folklore.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55382", "title": "Supernatural", "text": "Supernatural\n\nThe concept of the supernatural proposes that something cannot be explained by scientific understanding or the laws of nature. Examples often include characteristics of or relating to entities and concepts such as ghosts, angels, gods, souls and spirits, non-material beings, or anything else considered \"beyond\" nature like magic or miracles.\n\nOver time, things once thought to be supernatural such as lightning, seasons, and human senses have been shown to have entirely naturalistic explanations and origins. Some believe that which is considered supernatural will someday be discovered to be completely physical and natural. Those who believe only the physical world exists are called naturalists. Those who believe similarly often maintain skeptical attitudes and beliefs concerning supernatural concepts. Belief in the supernatural can also occur in secular contexts.\n\nThe supernatural is featured in paranormal, occult, and religious contexts. However, belief in the supernatural can also occur in secular contexts as well.\n\nOccurring as both an adjective and a noun, descendants of the modern English compound \"supernatural\" enters the language from two sources: By way of Middle French (\"supernaturel\") and directly from the Middle French's term's ancestor, post-Classical Latin (\"supernaturalis\"). Post-classical Latin \"supernaturalis\" first occurs in the 6th century, composed of the Latin prefix \"super-\" and \"nātūrālis\" (see nature). The earliest known appearance of the word in the English language occurs in a Middle English translation of Catherine of Siena's \"Dialogue\" (\"orcherd of Syon\", around 1425; \"Þei haue not þanne þe supernaturel lyȝt ne þe liȝt of kunnynge, bycause þei vndirstoden it not\").\n\nThe semantic value of the term has shifted over the history of its use. Originally the term referred exclusively to Christian understandings of the world. For example, as an adjective, the term can mean 'belonging to a realm or system that transcends nature, as that of divine, magical, or ghostly beings; attributed to or thought to reveal some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature; occult, paranormal' or 'more than what is natural or ordinary; unnaturally or extraordinarily great; abnormal, extraordinary'. Obsolete uses include 'of, relating to, or dealing with metaphysics'. As a noun, the term can mean 'a supernatural being', with a particularly strong history of employment in relation to entities from the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.\n\nThe metaphysical considerations of the existence of the supernatural can be difficult to approach as an exercise in philosophy or theology because any dependencies on its antithesis, the natural, will ultimately have to be inverted or rejected.\n\nOne complicating factor is that there is disagreement about the definition of \"natural\" and the limits of naturalism. Concepts in the supernatural domain are closely related to concepts in religious spirituality and occultism or spiritualism.\n\nThe term \"supernatural\" is often used interchangeably with paranormal or preternatural — the latter typically limited to an adjective for describing abilities which appear to exceed what is possible within the boundaries of the laws of physics. Epistemologically, the relationship between the supernatural and the natural is indistinct in terms of natural phenomena that, \"ex hypothesi,\" violate the laws of nature, in so far as such laws are realistically accountable.\nMany supporters of supernatural explanations believe that past, present, and future complexities and mysteries of the universe cannot be explained solely by naturalistic means and argue that it is reasonable to assume that a non-natural entity or entities resolve the unexplained.\n\nViews on the \"supernatural\" vary, for example it may be seen as:\n\n\nDialogues from Neoplatonic philosophy in the third century AD contributed the development of the concept the supernatural via Christian theology in later centuries. The term \"nature\" had existed since antiquity with Latin authors like Augustine using the word and its cognates at least 600 times in \"City of God\". In the medieval period, \"nature\" had ten different meanings and \"natural\" had eleven different meanings. Peter Lombard, a medieval scholastic in the 12th century, asked about causes that are beyond nature, in that how there could be causes that were God's alone. He used the term \"praeter naturam\" in his writings. In the scholastic period, Thomas Aquinas classified miracles into three categories: \"above nature\", \"beyond nature\", and \"against nature\". In doing so, he sharpened the distinction between nature and miracles more than the early Church Fathers had done. As a result, he had created a dichotomy of sorts of the natural and supernatural. Though the phrase \"supra naturam\" was used since the 4th century AD, it was in the 1200s that Thomas Aquinas used the term \"supernaturalis\", however, this term had to wait until the end of the medieval period for it become more popularly used. The discussions on \"nature\" from the scholastic period were diverse and unsettled with some postulating that even miracles are natural and that natural magic was a natural part of the world.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3032160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3032160", "title": "Tattvartha Sutra", "text": "Tattvartha Sutra\n\nTattvartha Sutra (also known as Tattvarth-adhigama-sutra) is an ancient Jain text written by \"Acharya\" Umaswati, sometime between the 2nd- and 5th-century AD. It is the one of the Jain scripture written in the Sanskrit language. \"Tattvartha Sutra\" is also known in Jainism as the \"Moksha-shastra\" (Scripture describing the path of liberation).\n\nThe Tattvartha Sutra is regarded as one of the earliest, most authoritative text in Jainism, and the only text authoritative in both the \"Digambara\" and \"Śvētāmbara\" sects. Its importance in Jainism is comparable with that of the Brahma Sutras and Yoga Sutras of Patanjali in Hinduism. It is a text in sutra or aphorisms, and presents the complete Jainism philosophy in 350 sutras over 10 chapters. The term \"Tattvartha\" is composed of the Sanskrit words \"tattva\" which means \"reality, truth\" and \"artha\" which means \"nature, meaning\", together meaning \"nature of reality\".\n\nOne of its sutras, \"Parasparopagraho Jivanam\" is the motto of Jainism. Its meaning is interpreted as \"(The function) of souls is to help one another\", or \"Souls render service to one another\".\n\n\"Tattvartha Sutra\" is also known in Jainism as the \"Moksha-shastra\" (Scripture describing the path of liberation).\n\nThe text written in Sanskrit, begins with an invocation:\nThe first verse of \"Tattvārthsūtra\", \"\" summarizes the Jaina path to liberation. It means that the Ratnatraya (three jewels: right view, right knowledge and right conduct) collectively constitutes the path to liberation or moksha.\n\nIts ten chapters are:\nThe first chapter deals with the process of cognition and details about different types of knowledge. The next three chapters deal with the Jīva (soul), lower worlds, \"naraka\", and celestial abodes, \"devas\". The fifth chapter discusses the Non-soul (\"ajīva\"). The next three chapters deal with the \"karmas\" and their manifestations and the influx, \"asrava\", good and bad \"karma\", \"shubha-ashubha karma\" and the bondage of the karmas. The ninth chapter describes the blocking, \"samvara\" and shedding of the karmas, \"nirjara\". The final chapter discusses \"moksha\" or the liberation of the soul.\n\nThe theology in \"Tattvartha Sutra\" presents seven categories of truth in sutra 1.4:\n\nUmaswami categorizes the types of knowledge to be empirical, attained through one's sense of perception. He adds that knowledge is also acquired through literature, clairvoyance, and omniscience. In chapter 2, Umaswati presents sutras on soul. He asserts that soul is distinguished by suppression of deluding karma, or elimination of eight types of karmas, or partial presence of destructive karmas, or arising of eight types of new karmas, or those that are innate to the soul, or a combination of these. In chapter 3 through 6, Umaswati presents sutras for his first three categories of truth.\n\nIn chapter 7, Umaswati presents the Jaina vows and explains their value in stopping karmic particle inflow to the soul. The vows, with their respective translations by Nathmal Tatia, are \n\nUmaswati, in chapter 8 of \"Tattvartha Sutra\" presents his sutras on how karma affects rebirths. He asserts that accumulated karma in life determines the length of life and realm of rebirth for each soul in each of four states – infernal beings, plants and animals, human beings and as gods. Further, states Umaswati, karma also affects the body, the shape, the characteristics as well as the status of the soul within the same species, such as \"Ucchi\" (upper) or \"Nicchi\" (lower) status. The accumulated and new karma are material particles, states Umaswati, which stick to the soul and these travel with the soul from one life to the next as bondage, where each ripens. Once ripened, the karmic particles fall off, states Umaswati.\n\nThe chapter 9 of \"Tattvartha Sutra\" states how karmic particles can be stopped from attaching to the soul and how these can be shed. Umaswati asserts that \"gupti\" (curbing activity), \"dharma\" (virtues such as forbearance, modesty, purity, truthfulness, self-restraint, austerity, renunciation), contemplation, endurance in hardship (he lists twenty two hardships including hunger, thirst, cold, heat, nakedness, injury, lack of gain, illness, praise, disrespect), and with good character towards others (he lists five – equanimity, reinitiation, non-injury (Ahimsa), slight passion and fair conduct), a soul stops karmic accumulations. External austerities such as fasting, reduced diet and isolated habitation, along with internal austerities such as expiation, reverence, service, renunciation and meditation, according to Umaswati, along with respectful service to teachers and ailing ascetics help shed karma.\n\nThe state of liberation is presented in Chapter 10 by Umaswati. It is achieved when deluding and obstructive karmas have been destroyed. This leads to the state of quietism and potentiality, and the soul then moves to the end of the universe, states Umaswati.\n\nThe Tattvartha Sutra is regarded as one of the earliest, most authoritative book on Jainism, and the only text authoritative in both the Digambara and Śvētāmbara sects.\n\nThe Tattvartha Sutra has the largest number of Jaina bhashyas or commentaries in different Indian languages from the fifth century onward. The total number of commentaries and translations of \"Tattvartha Sutra\" goes beyond 25.\n\nThe most famous and oldest commentary on the \"Tattvārthasūtra\" is \"Sarvārthasiddhi\" of \"Ācārya Pujyapada\" (sixth century CE). \"Sarvārthasiddhi\" along with Akalanka's c. 780 CE \"Rajavartika\" and Vijayananda's \"Slokavarttika\" (9th century) form the central texts of Digambara monastic students.\n\nThe text is in \"sutra\" form. The word \"Sutra\" (Sanskrit: सूत्र) means \"string, thread\". The root of the word is \"siv\", that which sews and holds things together. In the context of Indian literature, \"Sutra\" means a distilled collection of syllables and words, any form or manual of \"aphorism, rule, direction\" hanging together like threads with which the \"teachings of ritual, philosophy, grammar or any field of knowledge\" can be woven.\n\nThe distilled nature of sutra texts leave them open to varying interpretations. The Tattvartha sutra have been variously translated. The first verse of \"Tattvartha Sutra\" has been translated as follows, for example:\n\nThe text has been translated into many languages including English and German, latest being English translation in 1993.\n\n\n\n"}

Since December 2016 its work has been continued by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change.\n\nThe Foundation was launched in May 2008 in New York at the headquarters of the media group Time Warner. In his speech, Blair outlined the Foundation's aim that \"idealism becomes the new realism\", and that one of its goals was to \"counter extremism in all six leading religions\" (i.e., according to the Foundation, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, and Sikhism). Blair said that while in office, he feared being exposed as a \"nutter\" if he had talked about his religious views. Former US president Bill Clinton attended the launch, describing Blair as \"a good man as well as a great leader\". In an interview with \"Time\" magazine, Blair said the Foundation was \"how I want to spend the rest of my life\".\n\nThe foundation listed several goals: \"The foundation provides the practical support required to help prevent religious prejudice, conflict and extremism. At school, university and professional level the foundation provides various education programmes. The foundation encouraged interfaith initiatives to tackle global poverty and conflict.\"\n\nThe Foundation's basic premises, as listed in its initial mission statement, were that 1) faith is important to many, underpinning their systems of thought, their behaviour and the behaviour of many of the world's progressive movements, and that 2) the great religions share values of respect, justice and compassion. But the statement also recognised that faith can be divisive, too; this is viewed by the Foundation as being based on distortions of faith rather than being intrinsic to it.\n\nThe aim of the Foundation was to use the tools of modern communication to \"educate, inform and develop understanding\" about various faiths, and the relationships between them. It aimed to do this in such a way as to address global poverty and conflict.\n\nThe Foundation had several projects: Faith and Globalisation Initiative, Face to Faith (later Generation Global), Faiths Act (an activist group), and Faith Shorts (for short religious films).\n\nFaith and Globalisation Initiative launched in Yale University in September 2008 was an attempt to build a \"global conversation\" between an \"elite group\" of universities. As part of this attempt, Blair was to be the Howland Distinguished Fellow at Yale and was one of the professors for the course.\n\nFace to Faith was a programme for schoolchildren (12–17 years) which allowed via videoconferencing international interaction where cross-faith discussions may take place. The proclaimed aim was to break down religious and cultural differences and thereby reduce conflict.\n\nFaiths Act was a project of the Foundation described as an attempt to build a global movement to both \"inspire and mobilise\" those who believe, in a faith, to address the Millennium Development Goals. The project focused on deaths from malaria.\n\nThe project known as Faith Shorts was announced in March 2010 for short-length movies which increase \"understanding between religions\".\nAwards were presented for the films rated highest.\n\nAngela Salt was the Executive Director of the Foundation, which was registered as charity in the UK with Tony Blair as its Patron. The trustees were Robert Clinton, Robert Coke and Jeremy Sinclair. The Foundation was also registered as a charity in the US with the following directors: Alfred E. Smith IV, Linda LeSourd Lader, Ruth Turner, Timothy C. Collins and Tony Blair. Ruth Turner, formerly Director of Government Relations within Tony Blair's Prime Ministerial office, was the first Chief Executive.\n\nThe Foundation had an International Religious Advisory Council made up of members of what the Foundation considered to be the six major religions. Its role was to advise Tony Blair on the work of the Foundation. Its members were:\n\n\"Buddhism\"\n\n\"Christianity\"\n\n\"Hinduism\"\n\n\"Judaism\" \n\n\"Islam\" \n\n\"Sikhism\"\n\nA major contributor was Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk through his Victor Pinchuk Foundation.\n\nHugh O'Shaughnessy in \"The Guardian\" stated that the Foundation \"inspires ridicule\". He noted that Professor Michel Schooyans of the Catholic University of Leuven and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences \"accused Blair and his wife of supporting a messianic US plan for world domination.\" The criticism's focus was that the Foundation's approach amounted to reducing the religions to the same, predetermined common denominator. This meant \"stripping them of their identity\". Schooyans arguing that \"(t)his project threatens to set us back to an age in which political power was ascribed the mission of promoting a religious confession, or of changing it. In the case of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, this is also a matter of promoting one and only one religious confession, which a universal, global political power would impose on the entire world.\"\n\nThe director of the Muslim charity Forward Thinking, Huda Jawad was reported by the BBC as raising doubts about levels of support from many Muslims for the Foundation, given Blair's foreign-policy record.\n\nOn 2 April 2009, sceptic and secularist Richard Dawkins mocked the Foundation in a spoof letter, published in the \"New Statesman\". In it, Dawkins ridiculed the idea that faith is not a divisive force, and attacked religion's record on promoting dialogue and equality.\n\nBetween April 2008 and April 2009, the foundation raised more than 3.5 million pounds, and paid, according to the \"Daily Telegraph\", six-figure salaries to its top officials. An implied criticism was that these pay scales were in line with much larger charitable organisations. However, the wages were also reported to be the result of external recommendations and a strategy of hiring a small number of capable senior staff to co-ordinate a variety of efforts.\n\nA former editor of a Foundation website, Martin Bright, was critical of the organisation and its style. He mentioned the problems associated with the need to tiptoe around some of Tony Blair's business interests in Kazakhstan, Romania and the Gulf, his advising of the new government of Egypt being \"a nightmare\", the organisation's use of \"ritzy offices in a West End tower block\", the employment of a five-people in a communications department \"whose sole aim seemed to be to say as little as possible\" and the use of unpaid interns.\n\n"}
{"id": "33909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33909", "title": "Wiccan Rede", "text": "Wiccan Rede\n\nThe Wiccan Rede is a statement that provides the key moral system in the Neopagan religion of Wicca and certain other related Witchcraft-based faiths. A common form of the Rede is \"An’ ye harm none, do what ye will\".\n\nThe word \"Rede\" derives from Middle English, meaning \"advice\" or \"counsel\" and being closely related to the German or Scandinavian . \"An\" is an archaic Middle English conjunction, meaning \"if.\" \"Ye\" is an archaic or dialectal form of \"you\" (nominative plural).\n\nOther variants of the Rede include:\n\nIn its best known form as the \"eight words\" couplet, the Rede was first publicly recorded in a 1964 speech by Doreen Valiente.\n\nA similar phrase, \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\", appears in Aleister Crowley's works by 1904, in The Book of the Law (though as used by Crowley it is half of a statement and response, the response being \"Love is the law, love under will\"). According to B.A. Robinson of the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, Crowley adopted this line from François Rabelais, who in 1534 wrote, \"DO AS THOU WILT because men that are free, of gentle birth, well bred and at home in civilized company possess a natural instinct that inclines them to virtue and saves them from vice. This instinct they name their honor\".\n\nKing Pausole, a character in Pierre Louÿs' \"Les aventures du roi Pausole\" (The Adventures of King Pausole, published in 1901), issued a similar pair of edicts: \"I. — Ne nuis pas à ton voisin. II. — Ceci bien compris, fais ce qu'il te plaît.\" (\"Do not harm your neighbor; this being well understood, do that which pleases you.\") Although Gardner noted the similarity of the rede to King Pausole's words, Silver Ravenwolf believes it is more directly referencing Crowley. Another notable antecedent was put forth by the philosopher John Stuart Mill with his \"harm principle\" in the 19th century. \"Mill argues that the sole purpose of law should be to stop people from harming others and that should people want to participate in victimless crimes, crimes with no complaining witness, such as gambling, drug usage, engaging in prostitution, then they should not be encroached in doing so.\" In addition, the first part of the phrase is strikingly similar to the Latin maxim primum non nocere (first do no harm).\n\nIn 1974 a complete twenty-six line poem entitled \"The Wiccan Rede\" was published in the neo-Pagan magazine \"Earth Religion News\". Each line contained a rhymed couplet laid out as a single line, the last line being the familiar \"short rede\" couplet beginning \"Eight words...\".\n\nThis poem was shortly followed by another, slightly different, version, entitled the \"Rede Of The Wiccae\", which was published in \"Green Egg\" magazine by Lady Gwen Thompson. She ascribed it to her grandmother Adriana Porter, and claimed that the earlier published text was distorted from \"its original form\". The poem has since been very widely circulated and has appeared in other versions and layouts, with additional or variant passages. It is commonly known as the \"Long Rede\".\n\nAlthough Thompson wrote that this version of the Rede was in its original form, this declaration is disputed for several reasons, but primarily as the language of the poem refers to Wiccan concepts that are not known to have existed in her grandmother's lifetime. It is sometime ascribed to Thompson herself. Mathiesen and Theitic concluded that 18 to 20 of the verses are lore which would be common to the area of rural 17th to 19th century New England and compiled by the hand of someone who would have been born no later that the late 19th century, and that at least six of the verses which are deemed “The Wiccan Verses” were compiled and added by a second and later hand. Since Thompson was dispensing these 26 as a whole from around 1969 it is a reasonable assumption that hers was that second hand. Another claim is that it is adapted from a speech given by Doreen Valiente at a dinner sponsored by the Witchcraft Research Association and mentioned in volume one (1964) of the Pentagram, a United Kingdom pagan newsletter then being published. Valiente did publish a poem \"The Witches Creed\" in her 1978 book, \"Witchcraft for Tomorrow\", which contains some similar concepts.\n\nAccording to Don Frew, Valiente composed the couplet, following Gardner's statement that witches \"are inclined to the morality of the legendary Good King Pausol, 'Do what you like so long as you harm none'\"; he claims the common assumption that the Rede was copied from Crowley is misinformed, and has resulted in the words often being misquoted as \"an it harm none, do what thou wilt\" instead of \"do what you will\".\n\nThompson's attribution of the Long Rede to her grandmother has been disputed, since Adriana Porter died in 1946, well before Gerald Gardner published \"The Old Laws\", and no evidence for Porter's authorship exists other than Thompson's word. The poem refers to Wiccan concepts that, though ostensibly very old, have not been proven to pre-date the 1940s. Its attribution to Porter may have formed part of Thompson's claim to be an hereditary witch. Its precise origin has yet to be determined.\n\nAdrian Bott, in an article written in \"White Dragon\" magazine, 2003, argues that the Long Rede's creation can be placed somewhere between 1964 and 1975. Bott bases his argument on the alleged misuse of archaic English in the poem, in particular of \" an' \" as an abbreviation of \"and\", and of \"ye\" instead of \"the\". Bott states that the author of the poem was evidently unaware that this contraction of \"and\" is not an archaic, but a modern convention. According to Bott, in the \"eight words\" couplet originally cited by Valiente, \"an\" is used correctly, in the Middle English sense of \" 'in the event that', or simply 'if' \" (as in the Shakespearean \"an hadst thou not come to my bed\") and thus has no apostrophe. In the poem, this has been transformed into an abbreviated \"and\" and given an apostrophe, with every \"and\" in the poem's additional lines then being written \" an' \" as if to match. Accordingly, Bott concludes that the poem was an attempt to expand Valiente's couplet into a full Wiccan credo, written by someone who misunderstood the archaic language they attempted to imitate. Robert Mathiesen repeats Bott's objection to \"ye\", but argues that most other archaisms are used correctly. However, he states that they all derive from late 19th century revivalist usages. Based on this fact Mathiesen concludes that early twentieth century authorship of at least part of the poem is probable. He argues that its references to English folklore are consistent with Porter's family history. His provisional conclusion is that a folkloric form of the poem may have been written by Porter, but that it was supplemented and altered by Thompson to add specifically Wiccan material. Mathiessen also takes the view that the last line was probably a Thompson addition derived from Valiente. According to this account, the 1974 variant of the text, which was published by one of Thompson's former initiates, may represent one of the earlier drafts. Its publication prompted Thompson to publish what she – falsely, according to Mathiessen – claimed was Porter's \"original\" poem.\n\nThe Rede is similar to a consequentialist formulation of the Golden Rule, a belief that is found in nearly every religion. Not all traditional Wiccans follow the Rede; some Gardnerians (a sect under Wicca) espouse the Charge of the Goddess as a guide for morality. Its line \"Keep pure your highest ideal, strive ever towards it; let naught stop you or turn you aside, for mine is the secret door which opens upon the door of youth\" is used as a maxim for ethical dilemmas.\n\nThere is some debate in the neo-Pagan and Wiccan communities as to the meaning of the Rede. The debate centres on the concept of the Rede being advice, not a commandment. The rejection of specific exhortations and prohibitions of conduct such as those given in the Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments and emphasis on the consequences of one's actions makes the Rede's character somewhat different from major religious texts such as the Bible or the Qur'an. The Rede is only a guideline which the individual must interpret to fit each particular situation and unlike most religions, which actions \"do harm\" (and which do not) are not discussed in the Rede. What exactly does and does not do harm is therefore open to personal interpretation.\n\nThe concept of ethical reciprocity is not explicitly stated, but most Wiccans interpret the Rede to imply the Golden Rule in the belief that the spirit of the Rede is to actively do good for one's fellow humans as well as for oneself. Different sects of Wiccans read \"none\" differently. \"None\" can apply to only the self, or it may include animals and/or plants, and so forth. In essence, the Rede can be fully understood as meaning that one should always follow their true will instead of trying to obtain simple wants and to ensure that following one's will does not harm anyone or anything. In this light, the Rede can be seen as encouraging a Wiccan to take personal responsibility for his or her actions.\n\n\n"}
