{"id": "2974488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2974488", "title": "Anekantavada", "text": "Anekantavada\n\nAccording to Jainism, no single, specific statement can describe the nature of existence and the absolute truth. This knowledge (\"Kevala Jnana\"), it adds, is comprehended only by the Arihants. Other beings and their statements about absolute truth are incomplete, and at best a partial truth. All knowledge claims, according to the \"anekāntavāda\" doctrine must be qualified in many ways, including being affirmed and denied. Anekāntavāda is a fundamental doctrine of Jainism.\n\nThe origins of \"anekāntavāda \" can be traced back to the teachings of Mahāvīra (599–527 BCE), the 24th Jain . The dialectical concepts of \"syādvāda\" \"conditioned viewpoints\" and \"nayavāda\" \"partial viewpoints\" arose from \"anekāntavāda\" in the medieval era, providing Jainism with more detailed logical structure and expression. The details of the doctrine emerged in Jainism in the 1st millennium CE, from debates between scholars of Jain, Buddhist and Hindu schools of philosophies.\n\nThe word \"anekāntavāda\" is a compound of two Sanskrit words: \"anekānta\" and \"vāda\". The word \"anekānta\" itself is composed of three root words, \"an\" (not), \"eka\" (one) and \"anta\" (end, side), together it connotes \"not one ended, sided\", \"many-sidedness\", or \"manifoldness\". The word \"vāda\" means \"doctrine, way, speak, thesis\". The term \"anekāntavāda\" is translated by scholars as the doctrine of \"many-sidedness\", \"non-onesidedness\", or \"many pointedness\".\n\nThe term \"anekāntavāda\" is not found in early texts considered canonical by Svetambara tradition of Jainism. However, traces of the doctrines are found in comments of Mahavira in these Svetambara texts, where he states that the finite and infinite depends on one's perspective. The word anekantavada was coined by Acharya Siddhasen Divakar to significant the teaching of Mahavira that truth can be expressed in infinite ways. The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine is found in the \"Tattvarthasutra\" by Acharya Umaswami, and is considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects. In the Digambara tradition texts. The 'two-truths theory' of Kundakunda also provides the core of this doctrine.\n\nThe Jain doctrine of \"anekāntavāda\", also known as \"anekāntatva\", states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible to totally express it with language. Human attempts to communicate is \"naya\", or \"partial expression of the truth\". Language is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express truth. From truth, according to Māhavira, language returns and not the other way around. One can experience the truth of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempts to express the experience is \"syāt\", or valid \"in some respect\" but it still remains a \"perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete\". In the same way, spiritual truths are complex, they have multiple aspects, language cannot express their plurality, yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced.\n\nThe \"anekāntavāda\" premises of the Jains is ancient, as evidenced by its mention in Buddhist texts such as the \"Samaññaphala Sutta\". The Jain āgamas suggest that Māhavira's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a \"qualified yes\" (\"syāt\"). These texts identify \"anekāntavāda\" doctrine to be one of the key differences between the teachings of the Māhavira and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer \"it is\" or \"it is not\" to metaphysical questions. The Māhavira, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both \"it is\" and \"it is not\", with \"perhaps\" qualification and with reconciliation to understand the absolute reality. \"Syādvāda\" (predication logic) and \"Nayavāda\" (perspective epistemology) of Jainism expand on the concept of \"anekāntavāda\". \"Syādvāda\" recommends the expression of \"anekānta\" by prefixing the epithet \"syād\" to every phrase or expression describing the nature of existence.\n\nThe Jain doctrine of \"anekāntavāda\", according to Bimal Matilal, states that \"no philosophic or metaphysical proposition can be true if it is asserted without any condition or limitation\". For a metaphysical proposition to be true, according to Jainism, it must include one or more conditions (\"syadvada\") or limitations (\"nayavada\", standpoints).\n\n\"Syādvāda\" () is the theory of \"conditioned predication\", the first part of which is derived from the Sanskrit word \"syāt\" (), which is the third person singular of the optative tense of the Sanskrit verb \"as\" (), 'to be', and which becomes \"syād\" when followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant, in accordance with \"sandhi\". The optative tense in Sanskrit (formerly known as the 'potential') has the same meaning as the present tense of the subjunctive mood in most Indo-European languages, including Hindi, Latin, Russian, French, etc. It is used when there is uncertainty in a statement; not 'it is', but 'it may be', 'one might', etc. The subjunctive is very commonly used in Hindi, for example, in 'kya kahun?', 'what to say?'. The subjunctive is also commonly used in conditional constructions; for example, one of the few English locutions in the subjunctive which remains more or less current is 'were it ०, then ०', or, more commonly, 'if it were..', where 'were' is in the past tense of the subjunctive.\n\nSyat can be translated into English as meaning \"perchance, may be, perhaps\" (it is). The use of the verb 'as' in the optative tense is found in the more ancient Vedic era literature in a similar sense. For example, sutra 1.4.96 of Panini's Astadhyayi explains it as signifying \"a chance, maybe, probable\".\n\nIn Jainism, however, \"syadvada\" and \"anekanta\" is not a theory of uncertainty, doubt or relative probabilities. Rather, it is \"conditional yes or conditional approval\" of any proposition, state Matilal and other scholars. This usage has historic precedents in classical Sanskrit literature, and particularly in other ancient Indian religions (Buddhism and Hinduism) with the phrase \"syad etat\", meaning \"let it be so, but\", or \"an answer that is 'neither yes nor no', provisionally accepting an opponent's viewpoint for a certain premise\". This would be expressed in archaic English with the subjunctive: 'be it so', a direct translation of \"syad etat\". Traditionally, this debate methodology was used by Indian scholars to acknowledge the opponent's viewpoint, but disarm and bound its applicability to certain context and persuade the opponent of aspects not considered.\n\nAccording to Charitrapragya, in Jain context \"syadvada\" does not mean a doctrine of doubt or skepticism, rather it means \"multiplicity or multiple possibilities\". \"Syat\" in Jainism connotes something different from what the term means in Buddhism and Hinduism. In Jainism, it does not connote an answer that is \"neither yes nor no\", but it connotes a \"many sidedness\" to any proposition with a sevenfold predication.\n\n\"Syādvāda\" is a theory of qualified predication, states Koller. It states that all knowledge claims must be qualified in many ways, because reality is many-sided. It is done so systematically in later Jain texts through \"saptibhaṅgīnāya\" or \"the theory of sevenfold scheme\". These \"saptibhaṅgī\" seem to be have been first formulated in Jainism by the 5th or 6th century CE Svetambara scholar Mallavadin, and they are:\n\nEach of these seven predicates state the Jain viewpoint of a multifaceted reality from the perspective of time, space, substance and mode. The phrase \"syāt\" declares the standpoint of expression – affirmation with regard to own substance (\"dravya\"), place (\"kṣetra\"), time (\"kāla\"), and being (\"bhāva\"), and negation with regard to other substance (\"dravya\"), place (kṣetra), time (kāla), and being (\"bhāva\"). Thus, for a ‘jar’, in regard to substance (\"dravya\") – earthen, it simply is; wooden, it simply is not. In regard to place (\"kṣetra\") – room, it simply is; terrace, it simply is not. In regard to time (\"kāla\") – summer, it simply is; winter, it simply is not. In regard to being (\"bhāva\") – brown, it simply is; white, it simply is not. And the word ‘simply’ has been inserted for the purpose of excluding a sense not approved by the ‘nuance’; for avoidance of a meaning not intended.\n\nAccording to Samantabhadra's text \"Āptamīmāṁsā\" (Verse 105), \"\"Syādvāda\", the doctrine of conditional predications, and \"kevalajñāna\" (omniscience), are both illuminators of the substances of reality. The difference between the two is that while \"kevalajñāna\" illumines directly, \"syādvāda\" illumines indirectly\". \"Syadvada\" is indispensable and helps establish the truth, according to Samantabhadra.\n\n\"Nayavāda\" () is the theory of standpoints or viewpoints. \"Nayavāda\" is a compound of two Sanskrit words—\"naya\" (\"standpoint, viewpoint, interpretation\") and \"vāda\" (\"doctrine, thesis\"). Nayas are philosophical perspective about a particular topic, and how to make proper conclusions about that topic.\n\nAccording to Jainism, there are seven \"nayas\" or viewpoints through which one can make complete judgments about absolute reality using \"syadvada\". These seven \"naya\", according to Umaswati, are:\n\nThe \"naya\" theory emerged after about the 5th century CE, and underwent extensive development in Jainism. There are many variants of \"nayavada\" concept in later Jain texts.\n\nA particular viewpoint is called a \"naya\" or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, \"Nayavada\" does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A \"naya\" reveals only a part of the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (\"syādvāda\").\n\nAncient India, particularly the centuries in which the Mahavira and the Buddha lived, was a ground of intense intellectual debates, especially on the nature of reality and self or soul. Jain view of soul differs from those found in ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts, and Jain view about \"jiva\" and \"ajiva\" (self, matter) utilizes \"anekantavada\".\n\nThe Upanishadic thought (Hindu) postulated the impermanence of matter and body, but the existence of an unchanging, eternal metaphysical reality of \"Brahman\" and \"Ātman\" (soul, self). The Buddhist thought also postulated impermanence, but denied the existence of any unchanging, eternal soul or self and instead posited the concept of anatta (no-self). According to the vedāntin (Upanishadic) conceptual scheme, the Buddhists were wrong in denying permanence and absolutism, and within the Buddhist conceptual scheme, the vedāntins were wrong in denying the reality of impermanence. The two positions were contradictory and mutually exclusive from each other's point of view. The Jains managed a synthesis of the two uncompromising positions with \"anekāntavāda\". From the perspective of a higher, inclusive level made possible by the ontology and epistemology of \"anekāntavāda\" and \"syādvāda\", Jains do not see such claims as contradictory or mutually exclusive; instead, they are seen as \"ekantika\" or only partially true. The Jain breadth of vision embraces the perspectives of both Vedānta which, according to Jainism, \"recognizes substances but not process\", and Buddhism, which \"recognizes process but not substance\". Jainism, on the other hand, pays equal attention to both substance (\"dravya\") and process (\"paryaya\").\n\nThis philosophical syncretisation of paradox of change through \"anekānta\" has been acknowledged by modern scholars such as Arvind Sharma, who wrote:\nSome Indian writers state that Anekantavada is an inclusivist doctrine positing that Jainism accepts \"non-Jain teachings as partial versions of truth\", a form of sectarian tolerance. Others scholars state this is incorrect and a reconstruction of Jain history because Jainism has consistently seen itself in \"exclusivist term as the one true path\". Classical Jain scholars saw their premises and models of reality as superior than the competing spiritual traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism, both of which Jainism considered inadequate. For instance, the Jain text \"Uttaradhyayana Sutra\" in section 23.63 calls the competing Indian thought to be \"heterodox and heretics\" and that they \"have chosen a wrong path, the right path is that taught by the Jinas\". Similarly, the early Jain scholar Haribhadra, who likely lived between the 6th and 8th century, states that those who do not follow the teachings of Jainism cannot be \"approved or accommodated\".\n\nJohn Koller states \"anekāntavāda\" to be \"epistemological respect for view of others\" about the nature of existence whether it is \"inherently enduring or constantly changing\", but \"not relativism; it does not mean conceding that all arguments and all views are equal\".\n\nIn contemporary times, according to Paul Dundas, the \"Anekantavada\" doctrine has been interpreted by some Jains as intending to \"promote a universal religious tolerance\", and a teaching of \"plurality\" and \"benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions\". This is problematic and a misreading of Jain historical texts and Mahavira's teachings, states Dundas. The \"many pointedness, multiple perspective\" teachings of the Mahavira is a doctrine about the nature of Absolute Reality and human existence, and it is sometimes called \"non-absolutism\" doctrine. However, it is not a doctrine about tolerating or condoning activities such as sacrificing or killing animals for food, violence against disbelievers or any other living being as \"perhaps right\". The Five vows for Jain monks and nuns, for example, are strict requirements and there is no \"perhaps, just one perspective\". Similarly, since ancient times, Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism, according to Dundas, but Jainism was highly critical of the knowledge systems and ideologies of its rivals, and vice versa.\n\nThe principle of \"anekāntavāda\" is one of the foundational Jain philosophical concept. The development of \"anekāntavāda\" also encouraged the development of the dialectics of \"syādvāda\" (conditioned viewpoints) and \"nayavāda\" (partial viewpoints).\n\nAccording to Karl Potter, the Jain \"anekāntavāda\" doctrine emerged in a milieu that included Buddhists and Hindus in ancient and medieval India. The diverse Hindu schools such as Nyaya-Vaisheshika, Samkhya-Yoga and Mimamsa-Vedanta, all accepted the premise of Atman that \"unchanging permanent soul, self exists and is self-evident\", while various schools of early Buddhism denied it and substituted it with Anatta (no-self, no-soul). Further, for causation theories, Vedanta schools and Madhyamika Buddhists had similar ideas, while Nyaya-Vaisheshika and non-Madhyamika Buddhists generally agreed on the other side. Jainism, using its \"anekāntavāda\" doctrine occupied the center of this theological divide on soul-self (\"jiva\") and causation theories, between the various schools of Buddhist and Hindu thought.\n\nThe origins of \"anekāntavāda\" are traceable in the teachings of Mahāvīra, who used it effectively to show the relativity of truth and reality. Taking a relativistic viewpoint, Mahāvīra is said to have explained the nature of the soul as both permanent, from the point of view of underlying substance, and temporary, from the point of view of its modes and modification.\n\nEarly Jain texts were not composed in Vedic or classical Sanskrit, but in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit language. According to Matilal, the earliest Jain literature that present a developing form of a substantial \"anekantavada\" doctrine is found in Sanskrit texts, and after Jaina scholars had adopted Sanskrit to debate their ideas with Buddhists and Hindus of their era. These texts show a synthetic development, the existence and borrowing of terminology, ideas and concepts from rival schools of Indian thought but with innovation and original thought that disagreed with their peers.\n\nThe early Svetambara canons and teachings do not use the terms \"anekāntavāda\" and \"syādvāda\", but contain teachings in rudimentary form without giving it proper structure or establishing it as a separate doctrine. \"Śvētāmbara\" text, \"Sutrakritanga\" contains references to \"Vibhagyavāda\", which, according to Hermann Jacobi, is the same as \"syādvāda\" and \"saptibhaṅgī\". For example, Jacobi in his 1895 translation interpreted \"vibhagyavada\" as \"syadvada\", the former mentioned in the Svetambara Jain canonical text \"Sutrakritanga\". However, the Digambara Jains dispute this text is canonical or even authentic.\n\nAccording to Upadhyaye, the \"Bhagvatisūtra\" (also called Vyākhyāprajñapti) mentions three primary predications of the \"saptibhaṅgīnaya\". This too is a Svetambara text, and considered by Digambara Jains as unauthentic.\n\nThe earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine is found in the \"Tattvarthasutra\" of Umasvati, considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects including Svetambara and Digambara. The century in which Umaswati lived is unclear, but variously placed by contemporary scholars to sometime between 2nd and 5th century.\n\nThe Digambara scholar Kundakunda, in his mystical Jain texts, expounded on the doctrine of \"syādvāda\" and \"saptibhaṅgī\" in \"Pravacanasāra\" and \"Pancastikayasāra\". Kundakunda also used \"nayas\" to discuss the essence of the self in \"Samayasāra\". Kundakunda is believed in the Digambara tradition to have lived about the 1st-century CE, but has been placed by early modern era scholars to 2nd or 3rd century CE. In contrast, the earliest available secondary literature on Kundakunda appears in about the 10th century, which has led recent scholarship to suggest that he may have lived in or after 8th-century. This radical reassessment in Kundakunda chronology, if accurate, would place his comprehensive theories on \"anekantavada\" to the late 1st millennium CE.\n\nThe Jain texts explain the \"anekāntvāda\" concept using the parable of blind men and elephant, in a manner similar to those found in both Buddhist and Hindu texts about limits of perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows:\n\nThis parable is called \"Andha-gaja-nyaya\" maxim in Jain texts.\n\nTwo of the Jain references to this parable are found in \"Tattvarthaslokavatika\" of Vidyanandi (9th century) and it appears twice in the \"Syādvādamanjari\" of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). According to Mallisena, whenever anyone takes a partial, unconditional view of the ultimate reality, and denies the possibility of another aspect of that reality, it is an instance of the above parable and a defective view. Mallisena goes further in his second reference to the above parable and states that all reality has infinite aspects and attributes, all assertions can only be relatively true. This does not mean scepticism or doubt is the right path to knowledge, according to Mallisena and other Jain scholars, but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally, partially true. Any and all viewpoints, states Mallisena, that do not admit an exception are false views.\n\nWhile the same parable is found in Buddhist and Hindu texts to emphasize the need to be watchful for partial viewpoints of a complex reality, the Jain text apply it to isolated topic and all subjects. For example, the \"syadvada\" principle states that all the following seven predicates must be accepted as true for a cooking pot, according to Matilal:\n\n\nĀcārya Haribhadra (8th century CE) was one of the leading proponents of \"anekāntavāda\". He wrote a doxography, a compendium of a variety of intellectual views. This attempted to contextualise Jain thoughts within the broad framework, rather than espouse narrow partisan views. It interacted with the many possible intellectual orientations available to Indian thinkers around the 8th century.\n\nĀcārya Amrtacandra starts his famous 10th century CE work \"Purusathasiddhiupaya\" with strong praise for \"anekāntavāda\": \"I bow down to the principle of \"anekānta\", the source and foundation of the highest scriptures, the dispeller of wrong one-sided notions, that which takes into account all aspects of truth, reconciling diverse and even contradictory traits of all objects or entity.\"\n\nĀcārya Vidyānandi (11th century CE) provides the analogy of the ocean to explain the nature of truth in \"Tattvarthaslokavārtikka\", 116:\n\n, a 17th-century Jain monk, went beyond \"anekāntavāda\" by advocating \"madhāyastha\", meaning \"standing in the middle\" or \"equidistance\". This position allowed him to praise qualities in others even though the people were non-Jain and belonged to other faiths. There was a period of stagnation after Yasovijayaji, as there were no new contributions to the development of Jain philosophy.\n\nThe Jain philosophical concept of Anekantavada made important contributions to ancient Indian philosophy, in the areas of skepticism and relativity. The epistemology of \"anekāntavāda\" and \"syādvāda\" also had a profound impact on the development of ancient Indian logic and philosophy.\n\nWhile employing \"anekāntavāda\", the 17th century Jain scholar Yasovijaya stated that it is not \"anābhigrahika\" (indiscriminate attachment to all views as being true), which is effectively a kind of misconceived relativism. In Jain belief, \"anekāntavāda\" transcends the various traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism.\n\n\"Anekāntavāda\" played a role in the history of Jainism in India, during intellectual debates from Śaivas, Vaiṣṇavas, Buddhists, Muslims, and Christians at various times. According to John Koller, professor of Asian studies, \"anekāntavāda\" allowed Jain thinkers to maintain the validity of their doctrine, while at the same time respectfully criticizing the views of their opponents. In other cases, it was a tool used by Jaina scholars to confront and dispute Buddhist scholars in ancient India, or in the case of Haribhadra justify the retaliation of the killing of his two nephews by Buddhist monks, with capital punishment for all Buddhist monks in the suspected monastery, according to the Buddhist version of Haribhadra's biography.\n\nThere is historical evidence that along with intolerance of non-Jains, Jains in their history have also been tolerant and generous just like Buddhists and Hindus. Their texts have never presented a theory for holy war. Jains and their temples have historically procured and preserved the classic manuscripts of Buddhism and Hinduism, a strong indicator of acceptance and plurality. The combination of historic facts, states Cort, suggest that Jain history is a combination or tolerance and intolerance of non-Jain views, and that it is inappropriate to rewrite the Jainism past as a history of \"benevolence and tolerance\" towards others.\n\nMahatma Gandhi mentioned Anekantavada and Syadvada in the journal \"Young India – 21 Jan 1926\". According to Jeffery D. Long – a scholar of Hindu and Jain studies, the Jain Syadvada doctrine helped Gandhi explain how he reconciled his commitment to the \"reality of both the personal and impersonal aspects of Brahman\", and his view of \"Hindu religious pluralism\":\n\nReferring to the September 11 attacks, John Koller states that the threat to life from religious violence in modern society mainly exists due to faulty epistemology and metaphysics as well as faulty ethics. A failure to respect the life of other human beings and other life forms, states Koller, is \"rooted in dogmatic but mistaken knowledge claims that fail to recognize other legitimate perspectives\". Koller states that \"anekāntavāda\" is a Jain doctrine that each side commit to accepting truths of multiple perspectives, dialogue and negotiations.\n\nAccording to Sabine Scholz, the application of the \"Anekantavada\" as a religious basis for \"intellectual Ahimsa\" is a modern era reinterpretation, one attributed to the writings of A.B. Dhruva in 1933. This view states that \"Anekantavada\" is an expression of \"religious tolerance of other opinions and harmony\". In the 21st century, some writers have presented it as an intellectual weapon against \"intolerance, fundamentalism and terrorism\". Other scholars such as John E. Cort and Paul Dundas state that, while Jainism indeed teaches non-violence as the highest ethical value, the reinterpretation of \"Anekantavada\" as \"religious tolerance of other opinions\" is a \"misreading of the original doctrine\". In Jain history, it was a metaphysical doctrine and a philosophical method to formulate its distinct ascetic practice of liberation. Jain history shows, to the contrary, that it persistently was harshly critical and intolerant of Buddhist and Hindu spiritual theories, beliefs and ideologies. John Cort states that the \"Anekantavada\" doctrine in pre-20th century Jain literature had no relation to religious tolerance or \"intellectual Ahimsa\". Jain intellectual and social history toward non-Jains, according to Cort, has been contrary to the modern revisionist attempts, particularly by diaspora Jains, to present \"Jains having exhibited a spirit of understanding and tolerance toward non-Jains\", or that Jains were rare or unique in practicing religious tolerance in Indian intellectual history. According to Padmanabha Jaini, states Cort, indiscriminate open mindedness and the approach of \"accepting all religious paths as equally correct when in fact they are not\" is an erroneous view in Jainism and not supported by the \"Anekantavada\" doctrine.\n\nAccording to Paul Dundas, in and after the 12th century, the persecution and violence against Jains by Muslim state caused Jain scholars to revisit their theory of Ahimsa (non-violence). For example, Jinadatta Suri in 12th century, wrote during a time of widespread destruction of Jain temples and blocking of Jaina pilgrimage by Muslim armies, that \"anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody\" in self-defense would not lose any merit. N.L. Jain, quoting Acarya Mahaprajna, states \"Anekantavada\" doctrine is not a principle that can be applied to all situations or fields. In his view, the doctrine has its limits and \"Anekantavada\" doctrine does not mean intellectual tolerance or acceptance of religious violence, terrorism, taking of hostages, proxy wars such as in Kashmir, and that \"to initiate a conflict is as sinful as to tolerate or not oppose it\".\n\nThe reinterpretation of \"Anekantavada\" as a doctrine of religious tolerance is novel, popular but not unusual for contemporary Jains. It is a pattern of reinterpretation and reinvention to rebrand and reposition that is found in many religions, states Scholz.\n\nAccording to Bhagchandra Jain, one of the difference between the Buddhist and Jain views is that \"Jainism accepts all statements to possess some relative (\"anekāntika\") truth\" while for Buddhism this is not the case.\n\nIn Jainism, states Jayatilleke, \"no proposition could in theory be asserted to be categorically true or false, irrespective of the standpoint from which it was made, in Buddhism such categorical assertions were considered possible in the case of some propositions.\" Unlike Jainism, there are propositions that are categorically true in Buddhism, and there are others that are \"anekamsika\" (uncertain, indefinite). Examples of categorically true and certain doctrines are the Four Noble Truths, while examples of the latter in Buddhism are the avyakata-theses. Further, unlike Jainism, Buddhism does not have a Nayavāda doctrine.\n\nAccording to Karl Potter and other scholars, Hinduism developed various theory of relations such as \"satkaryavada\", \"asatkaryavada\", \"avirodhavada\" and others. The \"anekantavada\" overlaps with two major theories found in Hindu and Buddhist thought, according to James Lochtefeld. The \"Anekantavada\" doctrine is \"satkaryavada\" in explaining causes, and the \"asatkaryavada\" in explaining qualities or attributes in the effects. The different schools of Hindu philosophy further elaborated and refined the theory of \"pramanas\" and the theory of relations to establish correct means to structure propositions in their view.\n\nIndologists such as professor John E. Cort state that \"anekāntavāda\" is a doctrine that was historical used by Jain scholars not to accept other viewpoints, but to insist on the Jain viewpoint. Jain monks used \"anekāntavāda\" and \"syādvāda\" as debating weapons to silence their critics and defend the Jain doctrine. According to Paul Dundas, in Jain hands, this method of analysis became \"a fearsome weapon of philosophical polemic with which the doctrines of Hinduism and Buddhism could be pared down to their ideological bases of simple permanence and impermanence, respectively, and thus could be shown to be one-pointed and inadequate as the overall interpretations of reality they purported to be\". The Jain scholars, however, considered their own theory of \"Anekantavada\" self-evident, immune from criticism, needing neither limitations nor conditions.\n\nThe doctrines of \"anekāntavāda\" and \"syādavāda\" are often criticised to denying any certainty, or accepting incoherent contradictory doctrines. Another argument against it, posited by medieval era Buddhists and Hindus applied the principle on itself, that is if nothing is definitely true or false, is \"anekāntavāda\" true or false?\n\nAccording to Karl Potter, the \"Anekantavada\" doctrine accepts the norm in Indian philosophies that all knowledge is contextual, that object and subject are interdependent. However, as a theory of relations, it does not solve the deficiencies in other progress philosophies, just \"compounds the felony by merely duplicating the already troublesome notion of a dependence relation\".\n\nThe Nyaya school criticized the Jain doctrine of \"anekantavada\", states Karl Potter, as \"wanting to say one thing at one time, the other at another\", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction. The Naiyayikas states that it makes no sense to simultaneously say, \"jiva and ajiva are not related\" and \"jiva and ajiva are related\". Jains state that \"jiva\" attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of \"anekantavada\" makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya texts.\n\nThe Vaisheshika and Shaivism school scholar Vyomashiva criticized the \"Anekantavada\" doctrine because, according to him, it makes all moral life and spiritual pursuits for moksha meaningless. Any spiritually liberated person must be considered under \"Anekantavada\" doctrine to be [a] both liberated and not liberated from one point of view, and [b] simply not liberated from another point of view, since all assertions are to be qualified and conditional under it. In other words, states Vyomashiva, this doctrine leads to a paradox and circularity.\n\n\"Anekāntavāda\" was analyzed and critiqued by Adi Śankarācārya (~800 CE) in his \"bhasya\" on \"Brahmasutra\" (2:2:33–36): He stated that \"anekantavada\" doctrine when applied to philosophy suffers from two problems: \"virodha\" (contradictions) and \"samsaya\" (dubiety), neither of which it is able to reconcile with objectivity.\n\nShankara's criticism of \"anekantavada\" extended beyond the arguments of it being incoherent epistemology in ontological matters. According to Shankara, the goal of philosophy is to identify one's doubts and remove them through reason and understanding, not get more confused. The problem with \"anekantavada\" doctrine is that it compounds and glorifies confusion. Further, states Shankara, Jains use this doctrine to be \"certain that everything is uncertain\". According to Karl Potter, Shankara does not take Jains seriously and admits that he doesn't understand Jainism's theory of relations.\n\nContemporary scholars, states Piotr Balcerowicz, concur that the Jain doctrine of \"Anekantavada\" does reject some versions of the \"law of non-contradiction\", but it is incorrect to state that it rejects this law in all instances.\n\nThe Buddhist scholar Śāntarakṣita, and his student Kamalasila, criticized \"anekantavada\" by presenting his arguments that it leads to the Buddhist premise \"jivas (souls) do not exist\". That is, the two of the most important doctrines of Jainism are mutually contradictory premises. According to Santaraksita, Jains state that \"jiva is one considered collectively, and many considered distributively\", but if so debates Santaraksita, \"jiva cannot change\". He then proceeds to show that changing jiva necessarily means jiva appear and disappear every moment, which is equivalent to \"jiva don't exist\". According to Karl Potter, the argument posited by Śāntarakṣita is flawed, because it commits what is called in the Western logic as the \"fallacy of division\".\n\nThe Buddhist logician Dharmakirti critiqued \"anekāntavāda\" as follows:\nThe medieval era Jain logicians Akalanka and Vidyananda, who were likely contemporaries of Adi Shankara, acknowledged many issues with anekantavada in their texts. For example, Akalanka in his \"Pramanasamgraha\" acknowledges seven problems when \"anekantavada\" is applied to develop a comprehensive and consistent philosophy: dubiety, contradiction, lack of conformity of bases (\"vaiyadhi karanya\"), joint fault, infinite regress, intermixture and absence. Vidyananda acknowledged six of those in the Akalanka list, adding the problem of \"vyatikara\" (cross breeding in ideas) and \"apratipatti\" (incomprehensibility). Prabhācandra, who probably lived in the 11th-century, and several other later Jain scholars accepted many of these identified issues in \"anekantavada\" application.\n\n"}
{"id": "721235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=721235", "title": "Apologeticus", "text": "Apologeticus\n\nApologeticus ( or \"Apologeticus\") is Tertullian's most famous work, consisting of apologetic and polemic. In this work Tertullian defends Christianity, demanding legal toleration and that Christians be treated as all other sects of the Roman Empire. It is in this treatise that one finds the phrase: \"the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church\" (\"Apologeticus\", Chapter 50).\n\nThere is a similarity of content, if not of purpose, between this work and Tertullian's \"Ad nationes\"—published earlier in the same year—and it has been claimed that the latter is a finished draft of \"Apologeticus\". There arises also the question of similarity to Minucius Felix's dialogue \"Octavius\". Some paragraphs are shared by both texts; it is not known which predated the other.\n\nTertullian's brief \"De testimonio animae\" (\"Concerning the Evidences of the Soul\") is an appendix to the \"Apologeticus\", intended to illustrate the meaning of the phrase \"testimonium animae naturaliter christianae\" in chapter 17).\n\nNot much is known about the life of Quintus Septimus Florens Tertullian. Some scholars believe him to have been a presbyter (priest) of the Catholic Church, the son of a Roman centurion, and have him training to be a lawyer in Rome. Others, like David Wright, find that to be highly improbable. \"No firm evidence places him in Rome at all, or for that matter anywhere outside of Carthage… It is in the well-educated circles in Carthage,\" Wright argues, \"that Tertullian most securely belongs\". Sometime after his conversion to the Christian faith, Tertullian left the Catholic Church in favor of the Montanist movement, which he remained a part of for at least 10–15 years of his active life and whose influence can be seen in many of his later works.\n\n\"Apologeticus\", his most famous apologetic work, was written in Carthage in the summer or autumn of 197 AD, during the reign of :Septimius Severus. Using this date, most scholars agree that Tertullian's conversion to Christianity occurred sometime before 197, possibly around 195. It was written before the edict of Septimius Severus (202 AD), and consequently, the laws to which Tertullian took exception were those under which the Christians of the 1st and 2nd centuries had been convicted.\n\nThis work is ostensibly addressed to the provincial governors of the Roman Empire, more specifically the magistrates of Carthage- \"that the truth, being forbidden to defend itself publicly, may reach the ears of the rulers by the hidden path of letters\"— and thus bears resemblance to the Greek apologues. It is structured as an appeal on behalf of the Christians and pleads \"for toleration of Christianity, attacking pagan superstition, rebutting charges against Christian morality, and claiming that Christians are no danger to the State but useful citizens\". Its readership is likely to have been composed of Christians, whose faith was reinforced through Tertullian's defense against rationalizations and rumours and who \"would have been hugely enheartened by Tertullian’s matchless confidence in the superiority of the Christian religion\".\n\n\"Apologeticus\" has the typical concerns of other apologetic works of his time, though it is presented in a much more complex manner. According to Wright, the text is constantly shifting \"from the philosophical mode to the rhetorical and even juridical\". Drawing from his training in literature and law, Tertullian demonstrates his talents as a Latinist and a rhetorician in an attempt to defend his newfound Christian faith. Tertullian's modern editor :Otto Bardenhewer further contends that Apologeticus is calm in tone, \"a model of judicial discussion\". Unlike previous apologists of Christianity, whose appeals for tolerance were made in the name of reason and humanity, Tertullian, influenced by his legal training, spoke as a jurist convinced of the injustice of the laws under which the Christians were persecuted.\n\nThe following outline and summary is based on Robert D. Sider's translation of \"Apologeticus\".\n\nThe first section of Apology is concerned with the unjust treatment of the Christians, which Tertullian believes stems from the ignorance of the pagan populace. Simply put, he argues that people praise what they know and hate what they do not. To Tertullian this becomes evident in the cases of people who once hated because they were ignorant towards that they hated, and once their ignorance was gone, so was their hate. Their hatred prevents them from investigating more closely and acknowledging the goodness that is inherent in Christianity, and so they remain ignorant. And there is good in Christianity, Tertullian claims, despite the fact that people remain ignorant to it. Even when brought forth and accused, true Christians do not tremble with fear or deny their faith. It is the authorities that display bad behavior when they deny proper criminal treatment to the Christians. He argues that if Christians are to be treated as criminals, they should not be treated differently from ordinary criminals, who are free to answer to charges, to cross-question and defend themselves. In reality, the Christians are not free to say anything that will clear their name or ensure that the judge conducts a fair trial. If an individual says he is not a Christian, he is tortured until he says he is; if he admits to being a Christian, the authorities want to hear that he is not and torture him until he denies it. They resort to any means necessary to force them to either deny or confess, anything to acquit him. If all this done to someone simply for admitting to be a Christian, then they are surely making a mockery of Roman laws by basing all the charges on the name \"Christian\". Before hating the name, one must look at and study the founder and the school.\n\nIn addressing the charges, Tertullian plans to show the hypocrisy that surrounds these charges, demonstrating that those crimes exist among the pagan prosecutors as well. Then he analyzes the laws, claiming it suspicious that a law should refuse to be examined for error and worthless if it demands obedience without examination. If a law is found having an error and being unjust, should it not be reformed or even condemned? Faulty laws have no place in a just judicial system and should thus not be applied and observed. Here Tertullian mentions :Nero, and to a certain extent :Domitian, as examples of emperors who raged against the Christians through the use of unjust laws, simply for condemning \"some magnificent good\". He then brings up the good laws, and asks what has become of them; those that \"restrained extravagance and bribery\", \"protected their [women's] modesty and sobriety\", of the \"conjugal happiness so fostered by high moral living that for nearly six hundred years after Rome was founded no sued for divorce\". These traditions and laws are being ignored, neglected and destroyed and yet Rome chooses to concern itself with the \"crimes\" committed by the Christians.\n\nTertullian begins by addressing the charges based on rumors, charges that vary from murdering and eating babies to committing incestuous and adulterous acts. Ultimately, he argues, they are simply rumors, for no evidence has ever been brought forth. No one has ever seen believers gather and supposedly commit impure acts or heard the cry of a crying baby because meetings and rituals are rarely performed in front of non-believers. It's all just lies and rumors meant to slander the Christian faith. Tertullian then makes the claim that Romans themselves are guilty of the very crimes it claims the Christians do. People from every age are sacrificed to Saturn and Jupiter all throughout the empire. The arenas are filled with the blood of those that fight, and the Romans even consume the animals that eat the bloodied bodies of the dead. For the Christians, murder is strictly forbidden; there is to be no killing or spilling of human blood, and that includes the killing the baby in the womb, for it would be destroying its soul. Neither are Christians allowed to eat meat that still has blood. \n\nOf the charges of incest and adultery, Tertullian says that Christians are not guilty of them, for they refrain from adultery and from fornicating before marriage, thus ensuring that they are safe from incest. Such behavior is different from that of the Romans, who through their immoral acts commit incest. This comes about simply through the case of mistaken identity: men go off and commit adultery, begetting children all throughout the empire who later unknowingly have intercourse with their own kin by mistake. In his attempt to make the Romans acknowledge their engagement in these acts, Tertullian hopes to demonstrate that Christians behave much differently from what they are accused of and that the charges should not hold.\n\nOf the more \"manifest crimes\", as Tertullian refers to them, he first addresses the charges of sacrilege and says that Christians do not worship the pagan gods because the gods are not real, do not exist and thus hold no power or control over anything. Saturn, he claims, was once a mere man, as Roman lore and history will demonstrate. He then refutes further claims that the gods received their divinity through death, and wonders what business would the gods have with wanting ministers and assistants that are already dead. Such powerless beings cannot even be responsible for the rise and success of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the character and nature of the gods themselves leave much to be desired; they are filled with rage, incestuous thoughts, envy, and jealousy. Why then should such imperfect and wicked beings be worthy of praise? He makes an even greater argument in referring to the pagan gods as demons, whose sole purpose is the subversion and destruction of mankind. They corrupt the souls of men by passions and lusts and rather successfully procuring \"for themselves a proper diet of fumes and blood offered to their statues' images.\" In this way they draw attention to themselves and prevent people from turning to the true God. But even the demons acknowledge the power of God, and acknowledging this should be enough to clear the Christians of charges of sacrilege. For Tertullian, the Romans are at fault here for worshipping the wrong religion, not that of the one true God. But if the gods are real, and if the Christians are guilty of sacrilege, what does that say about Rome? The people all worship different gods and often treat their images with less respect than they deserve, using any opportunity to pawn their statues off and use them as sources of income. Tertullian further criticizes their literature, practices and ceremonies, calling them absurd and criticizing their philosophers’ disgraceful actions. Socrates would swear by dogs and Diogenes and Varro made less than respectful comments concerning the deities. The plays constantly make jokes about and mockery of the gods. Surely, he argue, the plays and the masks must be disrespectful to the gods. It is the Romans then that are guilty of sacrilege and impiety. \n\nChristians do not venerate these false and dead gods, nor do they treat them in such a casual and careless manner. They worship the One God, the Creator of the universe. Unlike the pagan gods, He is real and His very existence is proven by the testimony of the soul, which cries out \"God\" despite its weakened and fallen state. His works and the works of his prophets are preserved from Moses, who was 1000 years before the Trojan War and predates both Saturn and much of ancient Roman literature tradition, to many others key biblical figures. Tertullian goes on to briefly discuss the revelation of God through Christ. In order to do that, he speaks of the relationship between the Jewish people and God; they once enjoyed much favor from God but became \"so filled with presumptuous confidence in their ancestors that they strayed from their teaching into manners of the world\". Christ comes to re-establish the true doctrine; He is embodiment of Word and Reason, having been brought forth by God and thus having the title of Son of God. He adds, \"his ray of God, then, was ever foretold in the past descended into a certain virgin and, formed as flesh in her womb, and was born man mingled (later changed to ‘united’) with God\". Having given an explanation of the nature and divinity of Christ, Tertullian shifts to the charges of treason. \n\nTo the charges that Christians do not offer sacrifice to Caesar, Tertullian says that it is practically useless to do that, for it is not in their power to give Caesar health, wealth and power. What they can offer to him they do through the use of prayer, because only God has absolute power and from him comes the emperor. He alone brings up empires and takes them down and only he is responsible for granting Caesar power, health and wealth; \"We ask for them [emperors] a long life, undisturbed power, security at home, brave armies, a faithful Senate, an upright people, a peaceful world, and everything for which a man or a Caesar prays\". Tertullian affirms that by praying for him, Christians are effectively putting Roman interests in God’s hands as well as commending Caesar to God. In no way do their meetings endanger the state, nor do they involve plotting against the emperor, the senate, or the empire. Their treatment of the Roman Empire exhibits the same respect and well wishes that they display upon to their neighbor. Any other behavior would not be the sign of a good Christian.\n\nTertullian has addressed the charges and demonstrated that the charges faced by Christians are based on lies and rumors and that no such things have been committed. After all he has demonstrated, Tertullian marvels at how the pagan prosecutors still claim that being a Christian is a crime against the empire. Christianity in general presents no threat to public order and thus its members should be allowed to meet and live in peace.\n\nTertullian then proceeds to give an explanation of Christian life and practices. He describes the manner in which they come together to worship and please God; to pray for each other as well as for the emperor and the empire, to study and consider the Holy Scriptures, and to share food—but not before offering prayers and thanks to God. Afterwards everyone is free to share a song or something they learned from scripture, praising God all throughout the night. He continues by explaining the practice of tithing, the concept of loving one another and of being brothers and sisters, being united by their way of life under the teachings of Christ. And being part of this world, Christians have to interact with it and with others. They shop at meat markets and local shops, go to the baths and stay at inns just like everyone else, though in everything they do, they \"bear in mind that we owe thanks to the Lord our God who created us\". Despite this, the persecutors and accusers fail to recognize innocence when they see it, persecuting and treating the Christians unjustly. Christians know true innocence because they have learned and inherited it from God; they recognize and understand the eternal punishment that exists apart from God and acknowledge and fear the one who passes that real and true Judgment. Tertullian declares, \"in a word, we fear God, not the proconsul\". He also addresses the claim that Christianity is more than a philosophy, bringing up the philosophers that say, \"it [Christianity] teaches the virtues and profess morality, justice, patience, moderation, and chastity\". He makes the case that if Christianity is just another kind of philosophy, it should be treated the same way, granted with the freedom to teach and spread their beliefs and practice, customs and rituals.\n\nTertullian concludes his apology by likening the struggle of the Christians to a man fighting a battle. The Christians take no pleasure in being persecuted and enduring trials, but as soldiers of Christ they too must fight for the truth, all, of course, for the glory of God. Addressing the magistrates, he says \"Crucify us- torture us- condemn us- destroy us! Your injustice is the proof of our innocence... When we are condemned by you, we are acquitted by God\".\n\n\n"}

It is one of the earliest known written works from de Sade to be dated with certainty, and was first published in 1926 together with an edition of \"Historiettes, Contes et Fabliaux\" (written originally in 1788). It was subsequently published in English in 1927 by Pascal Covici in a limited, hand-numbered edition of 650 copies.\n\nThe work expresses the author's atheism by having a dying man (a libertine) tell a priest about what he views as the mistakes of a pious life.\n\nAccording to John Phillips, Emeritus Professor of French Literature and Culture at London Metropolitan University:\nOf all the direct expressions of atheism in Sade's work, the \"Dialogue\"... is probably the most incisive and, at the same time, the most artistically satisfying... The influence of Sade's Jesuit training in rhetorical debate is the mainspring of this brilliant dramatic essay, which, as the title suggests, is not so much theatre as philosophical dialogue. But what makes the work charming as well as persuasive is the impish humour that lies behind its characters and situation.\nHowever, Steven Barbone, of San Diego State University notes that:\nWe can postulate one of two things: Sade was entirely pleased with this manuscript and saw no reason to make any changes to it or Sade completely gave up on the dialogue and had decided to abandon it. The reason for either of these hypotheses is that the manuscript itself contains almost no trace of Sade’s editing. It is up to the reader to divine whether the “Dialogue between the Priest and a Dying Man” is Sade’s position or not. Either way, it is worth reading even in the very unlikely event that it presents a position Sade would have repudiated. (This may be the case: near the beginning of October 1788, Sade himself made a catalogue of his works, and the “Dialogue” is omitted.) \n\nSade completed the notebook which contains the Dialogue on 12 July 1782, while imprisoned at Château de Vincennes. He took the manuscript with him when he was transferred to the Bastille in 1784.\n\nFollowing the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, Sade's prison writings disappeared (Sade had been moved to Charenton on 4 July), the manuscript of the Dialogue among them. However, it survived in private collections and was sold on at auction a number of times during the nineteenth century. On 6 November 1920 it was bought by Maurice Heine at an auction at the Hôtel Drouot, Paris, and he oversaw its publication in France for the first time in 1926 in a limited edition of 500 copies for which he wrote an introduction.\n\nThe Dialogue has been republished in French several times since the 1950s, including in scholarly editions of the works of Sade edited by Gilbert Lely, Le Brun and Pauvert, and Michel Delon.\n\nThe first English translation was published in the United States by Pascal Covici in 1927, again in a limited edition of 650 numbered copies. The translator was Samuel Putnam. This edition was based on the first French edition and included a translation of Heine's introduction.\n\nIn 1929, Haldeman-Julius published the Putnam translation as Little Blue Book #1405, under the title \"Dialogue between a priest and a dying atheist\". A version of this edition (with a short extract from Heine's introduction) was republished in 1997 by Chaz Bufe's See Sharp Press.\n\nFurther original English translations have been produced by Leonard de Saint-Yves (1953 ), Paul Dinnage (1953, incomplete), Richard Seaver and Austryn Wainhouse (1965. For more on the Seaver/Wainhouse translations of de Sade, see Wyngaard (2013) ), Paul J. Gillett (1966 ), Nicolas Walter (1982, reprinted 2001), Margaret Crosland (1991 ), David Coward (1992 ) and Steven Barbone (2000 ).\n\nThe dialogue inspired a similar scene in Luis Buñuel's film \"Nazarín\" (1959), wherein a dying woman wards off a priest while on her deathbed. Buñuel had previously adapted \"The 120 Days of Sodom\" into a scene in his earlier \"L'Age d'Or\" (1930) and would go on to feature the Marquis himself as a character in \"La Voie Lactée\" (1969).\n\n"}
{"id": "212485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=212485", "title": "Earth religion", "text": "Earth religion\n\nEarth religion is a term used mostly in the context of neopaganism.\n\nEarth-centered religion or nature worship is a system of religion based on the veneration of natural phenomena. It covers any religion that worships the earth, nature, or fertility deity, such as the various forms of goddess worship or matriarchal religion. Some find a connection between earth-worship and the Gaia hypothesis. Earth religions are also formulated to allow one to utilize the knowledge of preserving the earth.\n\nAccording to Marija Gimbutas, pre-Indo-European societies lived in small-scale, family-based communities that practiced matrilineal succession and goddess-centered religion where creation comes from the woman. She is the Divine Mother who can give life and take it away. In Irish mythology she is Danu, in Slavic mythology she is Mat Zemlya, and in other cultures she is Pachamama, Ninsun, Terra Mater, Nüwa, Matres or Shakti.\n\nIn the late 1800s, James Weir wrote an article describing the beginnings and aspects of early religious feeling. According to Boyer, early man was forced to locate food and shelter in order to survive, while constantly being directed by his instincts and senses. Because man's existence depended on nature, men began to form their religion and beliefs on and around nature itself. It is evident that man's first religion would have had to develop from the material world, he argues, because man relied heavily on his senses and what he could see, touch, and feel. In this sense, the worship of nature formed, allowing man to further depend on nature for survival.\n\nNeopagans have tried to make claims that religion started in ways that correspond to earth religion. In one of their published works, \"The Urantia Book\", another reason for this worship of nature came from a fear of the world around primitive man. His mind lacked the complex function of processing and sifting through complex ideas. As a result, man worshiped the very entity that surrounded him every day. That entity was nature. Man experienced the different natural phenomena around him, such as storms, vast deserts, and immense mountains. Among the very first parts of nature to be worshiped were rocks and hills, plants and trees, animals, the elements, heavenly bodies, and even man himself. As primitive man worked his way through nature worship, he eventually moved on to incorporate spirits into his worship. Although these claims may have some merit, they are nonetheless presented from a biased position that cannot be authenticated by traditional and reliable sources. Therefore, their claims can not be relied upon.\n\nThe origins of religion can be looked at through the lens of the function and processing of the human mind. Pascal Boyer suggests that, for the longest period of time, the brain was thought of as a simple organ of the body. However, he claims that the more information collected about the brain indicates that the brain is indeed not a \"blank slate.\" Humans do not just learn any information from the environment and surroundings around them. They have acquired sophisticated cognitive equipment that prepares them to analyze information in their culture and determine which information is relevant and how to apply it. Boyer states that \"having a normal human brain does not imply that you have religion. All it implies is that people can acquire it, which is very different.\" He suggests that religions started for the reasons of providing answers to humans, giving comfort, providing social order to society, and satisfying the need of the illusion-prone nature of the human mind. Ultimately, religion came into existence because of our need to answer questions and hold together our societal order.\n\nAn additional idea on the origins of religion comes not from man's cognitive development, but from the ape. Barbara J. King argues that human beings have an emotional connection with those around them, and that that desire for a connection came from their evolution from apes. The closest relative to the human species is the African ape. At birth, the ape begins negotiating with its mother about what it wants and needs in order to survive. The world the ape is born into is saturated with close family and friends. Because of this, emotions and relationships play a huge role in the ape's life. Its reactions and responses to one another are rooted and grounded in a sense of belongingness, which is derived from its dependence on the ape's mother and family. Belongingness is defined as \"mattering to someone who matters to you ... getting positive feelings from our relationships.\" This sense and desire for belongingness, which started in apes, only grew as the hominid (a human ancestor) diverged from the lineage of the ape, which occurred roughly six to seven million years ago.\n\nAs severe changes in the environment, physical evolutions in the human body (especially in the development of the human brain), and changes in social actions occurred, humans went beyond trying to simply form bonds and relationships of empathy with others. As their culture and society became more complex, they began using practices and various symbols to make sense of the natural and spiritual world around them. Instead of simply trying to find belongingness and empathy from the relationships with others, humans created and evolved God and spirits in order to fulfil that need and exploration. King argued that \"an earthly need for belonging led to human religious imagination and thus to the otherworldly realm of relating to God, gods, and spirits.\"\n\nThe term \"earth religion\" encompasses any religion that worships the earth, nature or fertility gods or goddesses. There is an array of groups and beliefs that fall under earth religion, such as paganism, which is a polytheistic, nature based religion; animism, which is the worldview that all living entities (plants, animals, and humans) possess a spirit; Wicca, who hold the concept of an earth mother goddess as well as practice ritual magic; and druidism, which equates divinity with the natural world.\n\nAnother perspective of earth religion to consider is pantheism, which takes a varied approach to the importance and purpose of the earth, and man's relationship with the planet. Several of their core statements deal with the connectivity humans share with the planet, declaring that \"all matter, energy, and life are an interconnected unity of which we are an inseparable part\" and \"we are an integral part of Nature, which we should cherish, revere and preserve in all its magnificent beauty and diversity. We should strive to live in harmony with Nature locally and globally\".\n\nThe earth also plays a vital role to many Voltaic peoples, many of whom \"consider the Earth to be Heaven’s wife\", such as the Konkomba of northern Ghana, whose economic, social and religious life is heavily influenced by the earth. It is also important to consider various Native American religions, such as Peyote Religion, Longhouse Religion, and Earth Lodge Religion.\n\nApril 22 was established as International Mother Earth Day by the United Nations in 2009, but many cultures around the world have been celebrating the Earth for thousands of years. Winter solstice and Summer solstice are celebrated with holidays like Yule and Dongzhi in the winter and Tiregān and Kupala in the summer.\n\nAnimism is practiced among the Bantu peoples of Sub-Saharan Africa. The Dahomey mythology has deities like Nana Buluku, Gleti, Mawu, Asase Yaa, Naa Nyonmo and Xevioso.\n\nIn Baltic mythology, the sun is a female deity, Saule, a mother or a bride, and Mēness is the moon, father or husband, their children being the stars. In Slavic mythology Mokosh and Mat Zemlya together with Perun head up the pantheon. Celebrations and rituals are centered on nature and harvest seasons. Dragobete is a traditional Romanian spring holiday that celebrates \"the day when the birds are betrothed.\"\n\nIn Hindu philosophy, the yoni is the creative power of nature and the origin of life. In Shaktism, the yoni is celebrated and worshipped during the Ambubachi Mela, an annual fertility festival which celebrates the Earth's menstruation.\n\nAlthough the idea of earth religion has been around for thousands of years, it did not fully show up in popular culture until the early 1990s. \"The X-Files\" was one of the first nationally broadcast television programs to air witchcraft and Wicca (types of earth religion) content. On average, Wiccans - those who practice Wicca - were more or less pleased with the way the show had portrayed their ideals and beliefs. However, they still found it to be a little \"sensationalistic\". That same year, the movie \"The Craft\" was released - also depicting the art of Wicca. Unfortunately, this cinematic feature was not as happily accepted as \"The X-Files\" had been.\n\nA few years later, programs showcasing the aforementioned religious practices - such as \"Charmed\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" - became widely popular. Although \"Charmed\" focused mostly on witchcraft, the magic they practiced very closely resembled Wicca. Meanwhile, \"Buffy\" was one of the first shows to actually cast a Wiccan character. However, since the shows focus was primarily on vampires, the Wiccan was depicted as having supernatural powers, rather than being in-tuned with the Earth.\n\nOther movies and shows throughout the last few decades have also been placed under the genre of Earth Religion. Among them are two of director Hayao Miyazaki's most well known films - \"Princess Mononoke\" and \"My Neighbor Totoro\". Both movies present human interaction with land, animal, and other nature spirits. Speakers for Earth Religion have said that these interactions suggest overtones of Earth Religion themes.\n\nSome popular Disney movies have also been viewed as Earth Religion films. Among them are \"The Lion King\" and \"Brother Bear\". Those who practice Earth Religion view \"The Lion King\" as an Earth Religion film mainly for the \"interconnectedness\" and \"Circle of Life\" it shows between the animals, plants, and life in general. When that link is broken, viewers see chaos and despair spread throughout the once bountiful land. Congruently, \"Brother Bear\" portrays interactions and consequences when humans disobey or go against the animal and Earth spirits.\n\nOther earth religion movies include \"The 13th Warrior\", \"The Deceivers (film)\", \"Sorceress (1982 film)\", \"Anchoress (film)\", \"Eye of the Devil\", \"Agora (film)\", and \"The Wicker Man (1973 film)\". These movies all contain various aspects of earth religion and nature worship in general.\n\nMany religions have negative stereotypes of earth religion and neo-paganism in general. A common critique of the worship of nature and resources of \"Mother Earth\" is that the rights of nature and ecocide movements are inhibitors of human progress and development. This argument is fueled by the fact that those people socialized into 'western' world views believe the earth itself is not a living being. Wesley Smith believes this is “anti-humanism with the potential to do real harm to the human family.” According to Smith, earth worshipers are hindering large-scale development, and they are viewed as inhibitors of advancement.\n\nA lot of criticism of earth religion comes from the negative actions of a few people who have been chastised for their actions. One such negative representative of earth religion is Aleister Crowley. He is believed to be \"too preoccupied with awakening magical powers\" instead of putting the well-being of others in his coven. Crowley allegedly looked up to \"Old George\" Pickingill, who was another worshipper of nature who was viewed negatively. Critics regarded Pickingill as a Satanist and \"England’s most notorious Witch\".\n\nCrowley himself was \"allegedly expelled from the Craft because he was a pervert.\" He became aroused by torture and pain, and enjoyed being \"punished\" by women. This dramatically damaged Crowley’s public image, because of his lifestyle and actions. Many people regarded all followers of earth religion as perverted Satanists.\n\nFollowers of earth religion have suffered major opprobrium over the years for allegedly being Satanists. Some religious adherents can be prone to viewing religions other than their religion as being wrong sometimes because they perceive those religions as characteristic of their concept of Satan worship. To wit, Witchcraft, a common practice of Wiccans, is sometimes misinterpreted as Satan worship by members of these groups, as well as less-informed persons who may not be specifically religious but who may reside within the sphere-of-influence of pagan-critical religious adherents. From the Wiccan perspective, however, earth religion and Wicca lie outside of the phenomenological world that encompasses Satanism. An all-evil being does not exist within the religious perspective of western earth religions. Devotees worship and celebrate earth resources and earth-centric deities. Satanism and Wicca \"have entirely different beliefs about deity, different rules for ethical behavior, different expectations from their membership, different views of the universe, different seasonal days of celebration, etc.\"\n\nNeo-pagans, or earth religion followers, often claim to be unaffiliated with Satanism. Neo-pagans, Wiccans, and earth religion believers do not acknowledge the existence of a deity that conforms to the common Semitic sect religious concept of Satan. Satanism stems from Christianity, while earth religion stems from older religious concepts.\n\nSome earth religion adherents take issue with the religious harassment that is inherent in the social pressure that necessitates their having to distance themselves from the often non-uniform, Semitic sect religious concept of Satan worship. Having to define themselves as \"other\" from a religious concept that is not within their worldview implies a certain degree of outsider-facilitated, informal, but functional religious restriction that is based solely on the metaphysical and mythological religious beliefs of those outsiders. This is problematic because outsider initiated comparisons to Satanism with the intent of condemnation, even when easily refuted, can have the effect of social pressure on earth religion adherents to conform to outsider perception of acceptable customs, beliefs, and modes of religious behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a problem could arise with the \"other\" than Satanism argument if an earth centered belief system adopted a holiday that a critic considered to be similar or identical to a holiday that Satanists celebrate. Satanists have historically been prone to adopting holidays that have origins in various pagan traditions, ostensibly because these traditional holidays are amongst the last known vestiges of traditional pre-Semitic religious practice in the west. Satanists are, perhaps irrationally, prone to interpreting non-Semitic holidays as anti-Christian and therefore as implicitly representative of their worldview. This is not surprising given the fact that this is, in fact, how many Christians interpret holidays such as Samhain. In spite of any flawed perceptions or rationale held by any other group, earth centered religion adherents do not recognize misinterpretation of their customs made by outside religious adherents or critics inclusive of Satan worshippers.\n\nOrganized Satan worship, as defined by and anchored in the Semitic worldview, is characterized by a relatively disorganized and often disparate series of movements and groups that mostly emerged in the mid-20th century. Thus, their adopted customs have varied, continue to vary, and therefore this moving target of beliefs and customs can not be justifiably nor continuously accounted for by earth centered religious adherents. Once a Satanist group adopts a holiday, social stigma may unjustifiably taint the holiday and anyone who observes it without discrimination as to whence and for what purpose it was originally celebrated. Given these facts, many earth centered religion devotees find comparisons to Satanism intrinsically oppressive in nature. This logic transfers to any and all religious customs to include prayer, magic, ceremony, and any unintentional similarity in deity characteristics (an example is the horned traditional entity Pan having similar physical characteristics to common horned depictions of Satan).\n\nThe issue is further complicated by the theory that the intra and extra-biblical mythology of Satan that is present throughout various Semitic sects may have originally evolved to figuratively demonize the heathen religions of other groups. Thus, the concept of Satan, or \"the adversary\", would have been representative of all non-Semitic religions and, by extension, the people who believed in them. Although, at times, the concept of the \"other\" as demonic has also been used to characterize competing Semitic sects. Amongst other purposes, such belief would have been extraordinarily useful during the psychological and physical process of cleansing Europe of traditional tribal beliefs in favor of Christianity. This possibility would account for the historical tendency of Christian authorities, for example, to deem most pagan customs carried out in the pagan religious context as demonic. By any modern standard, such current beliefs would violate western concepts of religious tolerance as well as be inimical to the preservation of what remains of the culture of long-persecuted religious groups.\n\nBecause of the vast diversity of religions that fall under the title of \"earth religion\" there is no consensus of beliefs. However, the ethical beliefs of most religions overlap. The most well-known ethical code is the Wiccan Rede. Many of those who practice an earth religion choose to be environmentally active. Some perform activities such as recycling or composting while others feel it to be more productive to try and support the earth spiritually. These six beliefs about ethics seem to be universal.\n\n\"An [if] it harm none, do what ye will.\" Commonly worded in modern English as \"if it doesn't harm anyone, do what you want.\" This maxim was first printed in 1964, after being spoken by the priestess Doreen Valiente in the mid-20th century, and governs most ethical belief of Wiccans and some Pagans. There is no consensus of beliefs but this rede provides a starting point for most people's interpretation of what is ethical. The rede clearly states to do no harm but what constitutes as harm and what level of self-interest is acceptable is negotiable. Many Wiccans reverse the phrase into \"Do what ye will an it harm none,\" meaning \"Do what you want if it doesn't harm anyone.\" The difference may not seem significant but it is. The first implies that it is good to do no harm but does not say that it is necessarily unethical to do so, the second implies that all forms of harm are unethical. The second phrase is nearly impossible to follow. This shift occurred when trying to better adapt the phrase into modern English as well as to stress the \"harmlessness\" of Wiccans. The true nature of the rede simply implies that there is personal responsibility for your actions. You may do as you wish but there is a karma reaction from every action. Even though this is the most well-known rede of practice, it does not mean that those that choose not to follow it are unethical. There are many other laws of practice that other groups follow.\n\nThe Threefold Law is the belief that for all actions there is always a cause and effect. For every action taken either the good or ill intention will be returned to the action taker threefold. This is why the Wiccan Rede is typically followed because of fear of the threefold return from that harmful action.\n\nThis term is what Emma Restall Orr calls reverence for the earth in her book \"Living with Honour: A Pagan Ethics\". She separates the term into three sections: courage, generosity and loyalty, or honesty, respect and responsibility. There is no evil force in Nature. Nothing exists beyond the natural, therefore it is up to the individual to choose to be ethical not because of divine judgment. All beings are connected by the earth and so all should be treated fairly. There is a responsibility toward the environment and a harmony should be found with nature.\n\nThe following was written by the Church of All Worlds in 1988 and was affirmed by the Pagan Ecumenical Conferences of Ancient Ways (California, May 27–30) and Pagan Spirit Gathering (Wisconsin, June 17). The Pagan Community Council of Ohio then presented it to the Northeast Council of W.I.C.C.A.\n\n\"We, the undersigned, as adherents of Pagan and Old and Neo-Pagan Earth Religions, including Wicca or Witchcraft, practice a variety of positive, life affirming faiths that are dedicated to healing, both of ourselves and of the Earth. As such, we do not advocate or condone any acts that victimize others, including those proscribed by law. As one of our most widely accepted precepts is the Wiccan Rede's injunction to \"harm none,\" we absolutely condemn the practices of child abuse, sexual abuse and any other form of abuse that does harm to the bodies, minds or spirits of the victims of such abuses. We recognize and revere the divinity of Nature in our Mother the Earth, and we conduct our rites of worship in a manner that is ethical, compassionate and constitutionally protected. We neither acknowledge or worship the Christian devil, \"Satan,\" who is not in our Pagan pantheons.

{"id": "43874099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43874099", "title": "England's Triumph", "text": "England's Triumph\n\nEngland's Triumph, Or, The Kingdom's Joy for the proclaiming of King William and His Royal Consort, Queen Mary, in the Throne of England, on the 13th. of this instant February. 1688, or simply England's Triumph, is an English broadside ballad composed in 1689. As the title suggests, the ballad takes as its primary focus the coronation of William III of England and his consort Mary II of England, which took place in February 1689 (even though the ballad claims it took place in 1688. This is most likely a typographical error on the part of the composer or the printer). William III and Mary II's coregency marked the end of the Glorious Revolution and the reign of James II of England. The coregency also brought about a shift in the religious paradigm of 17th-century England, which was Roman Catholic when James II sat upon the throne. Indeed, the ballad comments on the \"vile pop'ry\" that ruled the throne prior to the rule of William III, which saw the restoration of Protestant liberty. Extant copies of the ballad are available at Magdelene College in the Pepys Library. Alternatively, online facsimiles of the ballad are available online for public consumption.\n\nSet to the tune of \"Hark the Thundering Cannons Roar,\" the ballad opens with an encomium directed toward King William III: \"Now the Royal deed is done, / King William’s seated on the Throne, / and we his Subjects justly own, / He was our preservation.\" The ballad goes on to explicate what it means for England's religious state now that William III is \"seated on the throne\": \"The Glories of our Court are clear, / Now Rome’s dark Clouds all disappear / And shall no more o’re-cast us here, / nor send their priests to fool us. ... [O]ur brave Prince William came, / Who smote the Babylonian Dame, / And brough her Tod-pole Tools to shame, / redeem’d us all from Slav’ry\" As the ballad makes clear, the ascension of William and Mary meant that Catholicism, the \"Babylonian Dame\" mentioned in these lines, was once again no longer the official religion of England. The ballad concludes as most encomium ballads do, which is to say with general praise of the subject: \"May they all delights obtain, / Prove happy in a prosp’rous Reign, / And e’ery thing they wish for gain, / and prove to them a blessing.\"\n\nThe ballad is broken up into eight octets with varying rhyme schemes. For instance, the first stanza has an \"AA BB CCC B\" rhyme scheme while the second stanza has an \"AAA B CCC B\" rhyme scheme.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "312809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312809", "title": "Ethics in religion", "text": "Ethics in religion\n\nEthics involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior. A central aspect of ethics is \"the good life\", the life worth living or life that is simply satisfying, which is held by many philosophers to be more important than traditional moral conduct.\n\nMost religions have an ethical component, often derived from purported supernatural revelation or guidance. Some assert that religion is necessary to live ethically. Blackburn states that there are those who \"would say that we can only flourish under the umbrella of a strong social order, cemented by common adherence to a particular religious tradition\".\n\nEthics in Buddhism are traditionally based on the enlightened perspective of the Buddha, or other enlightened beings who followed him. Moral instructions are included in Buddhist scriptures or handed down through tradition. Most scholars of Buddhist ethics thus rely on the examination of Buddhist scriptures, and the use of anthropological evidence from traditional Buddhist societies, to justify claims about the nature of Buddhist ethics.\n\nAccording to traditional Buddhism, the foundation of Buddhist ethics for laypeople is the Pancasila: no killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, or intoxicants. In becoming a Buddhist, or affirming one's commitment to Buddhism, a layperson is encouraged to vow to abstain from these negative actions. Buddhist monks and nuns take hundreds more such vows (see vinaya).\n\nThe sole reliance on traditional formulae or practices, however, can be questioned by Western Buddhists whose main concern is the practical solution of complex moral problems in the modern world. To find a justifiable approach to such problems it may be necessary not just to appeal to the precepts or the \"vinaya\", but to use more basic Buddhist teachings (such as the Middle Way) to aid interpretation of the precepts and find more basic justifications for their usefulness relevant to all human experience. This approach avoids basing Buddhist ethics solely on faith in the Buddha's enlightenment or Buddhist tradition, and may allow more universal non-Buddhist access to the insights offered by Buddhist ethics.\n\nThe Buddha provided some basic guidelines for acceptable behavior that are part of the Noble Eightfold Path. The initial percept is non-injury or non-violence to all living creatures from the lowest insect to humans. This precept defines a non-violent attitude toward every living thing. The Buddhist practice of this does not extend to the extremes exhibited by Jainism, but from both the Buddhist and Jain perspectives, non-violence suggests an intimate involvement with, and relationship to, all living things.\n\nTheravada monk Bhikkhu Bodhi has observed:\n\nChristian ethics in general has tended to stress the need for love, grace, mercy, and forgiveness because of sin. With divine assistance, the Christian is called to become increasingly virtuous in both thought and deed, see also the Evangelical counsels. Conversely, the Christian is also called to abstain from vice.\n\nChristian ethical principles are based on the teachings within the Bible. They begin with the notion of inherent sinfulness, which requires essential atonement. Sin is estrangement from God which is the result of not doing God's will. God's will can be summed up by the precept: \"Love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and your neighbor as yourself\", commonly called the Great Commandment. Christian ethics are founded upon the concept of grace which transforms a person's life and enable's one to choose and act righteously. As sin is both individual and social, so is grace applied to both the individual and society. Christian ethics has a teleological aspect—all ethical behavior is oriented towards a vision of the Kingdom of God—a righteous society where all live in peace and harmony with God and nature, as envisioned in the Book of Isaiah. Specific ethical behaviors originate in the Old Testament’s Ten Commandments, and are enriched by teachings in the Psalms and morals contained in historical accounts, see also Biblical law in Christianity.\n\nChristian ethics is not substantially different from Jewish ethics, except in the exhortation to love one's enemy. Perhaps the greatest contribution of Christian ethics is this command to love one's enemies. It has been argued (see Ched Myers's \"Binding the Strong Man\", and John Howard Yoder's \"The Politics of Jesus\") that Jesus was waging a non-violent campaign against the Roman oppressors and many of his sayings relate to this campaign--turn the other cheek, go the second mile, etc. Understanding these commands as part of a larger campaign makes it impossible to interpret Christian ethics as an individual ethic. It is both an individual and a social ethic concerned with life here on earth.\n\nOther tenets include maintaining personal integrity and the absence of hypocrisy, as well as honesty and loyalty, mercy and forgiveness, rejection of materialism and the desire for wealth and power, and teaching others in your life through personal joy, happiness and Godly devotion.\n\nThere are several different schema of vice and virtue. Aquinas adopted the four cardinal virtues of Aristotle (justice, courage, temperance and prudence), and added to them the Christian virtues of faith, hope and charity (from St.Paul, ). Other schema include the Seven Deadly Sins and the Seven virtues. For more see Christian philosophy and Biblical law in Christianity.\n\nConfucianism and Neo-Confucianism emphasize the maintenance and propriety of relationships as the most important consideration in ethics. To be ethical is to do what one's relationships require. Notably, though, what you owe to another person is inversely proportional to their distance from you. In other words, you owe your parents everything, but you are not in any way obligated towards strangers. This can be seen as a recognition of the fact that it is impossible to love the entire world equally and simultaneously. This is called relational ethics, or situational ethics. The Confucian system differs very strongly from Kantian ethics in that there are rarely laws or principles which can be said to be true absolutely or universally.\n\nThis is not to say that there has never been any consideration given to universalist ethics. In fact, in Zhou Dynasty China, the Confucians' main opponents, the followers of Mozi argued for universal love (). The Confucian view eventually held sway, however, and continues to dominate many aspects of Chinese thought. Many have argued, for example, that Mao Zedong was more Confucian than Communist.\nConfucianism, especially of the type argued for by Mencius (), argued that the ideal ruler is the one who (as Confucius put it) \"acts like the North Star, staying in place while the other stars orbit around it\". In other words, the ideal ruler does not go out and force the people to become good, but instead leads by example. The ideal ruler fosters harmony rather than laws.\n\nConfucius stresses honesty above all. His concepts of lĭ (), yì (), and rén () can be seen as deeper expressions of honesty () and fidelity () to the ones to whom one owes one's existence (parents) and survival (one's neighbours, colleagues, inferiors in rank). He codified traditional practice and actually changed the meaning of the prior concepts that those words had meant. His model of the Confucian family and Confucian ruler dominated Chinese life into the early 20th century. This had ossified by then into an Imperial hierarchy of rigid property rights, hard to distinguish from any other dictatorship. Traditional ethics had been perverted by legalism.\n\nBuddhism, and specifically Mahayana Buddhism, brought a cohesive metaphysic to Chinese thought and a strong emphasis on universalism. Neo-Confucianism was largely a reaction to Buddhism's dominance in the Tang dynasty, and an attempt at developing a native Confucian metaphysical/analytical system.\n\nLaozi (Lao Tzu) and other Taoist (Daoist) authors argued for an even greater passivity on the part of rulers than did the Confucians. For Laozi, (Lao Tzu) the ideal ruler is one who does virtually nothing that can be directly identified as ruling. Clearly, both Daoism and Confucianism presume that human nature is basically good. The main branch of Confucianism, however, argues that human nature must be nurtured through ritual (\"li\" 禮), culture (\"wen\" 文) and other things, while the Daoists (Taoists) argued that the trappings of society were to be gotten rid of.\n\nTaoist ethics ask for a greater \"sense of being\" and less identification with \"the act of\" \"doing\". Taoist \"passivity\" nurtures, cultivates and prepares an atmosphere that allows \"the majestic\" and \"the real\" to shine, which influences society for the better. - \"If you want to awaken all of humanity, then awaken all of yourself; if you want to eliminate the suffering in the world, then eliminate all that is dark and negative in yourself. Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation.\" - Lao Tzu\n\nEthics is called Nitisastra (Sanskrit: नीतिशास्त्र) in ancient texts of Hinduism. Ethics and virtue are a much debated and an evolving concept in ancient scriptures of Hinduism. Virtue, right conduct, ethics and morality are part of the complex concept Hindus call Dharma - everything that is essential for people, the world and nature to exist and prosper together, in harmony. As P.V. Kane, the author of the History of Dharmasastra said, the term \"Dharma\" does not have a synonym in English language. While it is often interpreted as meaning \"duty\", it can mean justice, right, moral, good, and much more.\n\nEthics are explained in Hindu philosophy as something that cannot be imposed, but something that is realized and voluntarily lived up to by each individual. For example, Apastamba explained it thus: \"virtue and vice do not go about saying - here we are!; neither the Gods, Gandharvas, nor ancestors can convince us - this is right, this is wrong; virtue is an elusive concept, it demands careful and sustained reflection by every man and woman before it can become part of one's life.\n\nEthics that constitute a dharmic life - that is a moral, ethical, virtuous life - evolve in vedas and upanishads. Ethical subjects and questions are debated by various schools of Hinduism, quite extensively, in numerous texts on what is right conduct, when, how and why. Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added by ancient Hindu scholars, some replaced, others merged. For example, Manusamhita initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a \"dharmic\" life: \"Dhriti\" (courage), \"Kshama\" (forgiveness), \"Dama\" (temperance), \"Asteya\" (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), \"Saucha\" (inner purity), \"Indriyani-graha\" (control of senses), \"dhi\" (reflective prudence), \"vidya\" (wisdom), \"satyam\" (truthfulness), \"akrodha\" (freedom from anger). In later verses, this list was reduced to five virtues by the same scholar, by merging and creating a more broader concept. The shorter list of virtues became: \"Ahimsa\" (Non-violence), \"Dama\" (self restraint), \"Asteya\" (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), \"Saucha\" (inner purity), \"Satyam\" (truthfulness).\n\nThe Persian historian Al Biruni who visited and lived in India for 16 years in the early 11th century, describes the concept of ethics and virtuous behavior among Hindus of his times. Of ethical mandates among Hindus, a literal translation of his Persian language manuscript includes (1) A man shall not kill; (2) nor lie; (3) nor steal; (4) nor whore; (5) nor hoard up treasures. These correspond to five \"Yamas\" of ancient Hindu ethics: Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth, non-falsehood), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (celibacy if unmarried and non-cheating on one's partner if married), and Aparigraha (non-possessiveness). In addition to these five negative things to abstain from, Hindu ethics also recommends five positive things to strive for as \"Niyamas\": \"Śauca\" (purity in body, speech and mind), \"Santosha\" (contentment, acceptance of circumstances with optimism), \"Tapas\" (perseverance, meditation, austerity), \"Swadhyaya\" (lifelong learning) and \"Pranidhan\" (right attitude, contemplation). An ethical life in Hinduism is essential for a liberated life, one without craving, one that is content, attained through knowledge and by abstaining from evil.\n\nHindu literature variously discuss ethics as one or more of four topics: (1) \"Gunas\" that is inner tendencies of conduct found in every individual (in large measure, psychology); (2) \"Purushartha\" that is proper aims of life for every individual for self-development and happiness (dharma, artha, kama and moksha); (3) \"Ashramas\" that is ethics for an individual in different periods of one's lifetime (ethical expectations for a child are distinguished from those for adults, old age); and (4) \"Varnasramas\" that is ethics and conduct for every individual in relation to society. Ancient literature at the foundation of various Hindu traditions primarily discuss the first three, while the last has attracted greater attention since the 18th century. Some early 20th century literature wondered if ethics was ever a serious topic of study in Hinduism. Later studies have yielded the above four approaches to ethics in different schools of Hinduism, tied together with three common themes: (1) ethics is an essential part of dharma concept, (2) Ahimsa (non-violence) is the foundational premise without which - suggests Hinduism - ethics and any consistent ethical theory is impossible, and (3) Ethics cannot always be dualistically or non-dualistically reduced from first principles, ethics is closely related to moksha (self realization and spiritual freedom) with Vivekacudamani stating, \"individuals with self knowledge and spiritual freedom are inherently self examining and ethical\" and \"ethics, freedom and knowledge require each other\". In addition to the above four topics in Hindu ethics, scholars state that the karma doctrine of Hinduism is part of its ethical theory compendium.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita—considered one of the epitomes of historic Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate on what is right and what is wrong—argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational; for example, it explains a virtue such as Ahimsa must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity or ignorance of others.\n\nThe foundational source in the gradual codification of Islamic ethics was the Muslim understanding and interpretations of the mankind has been granted the faculty to discern God's will and to abide by it. This faculty most crucially involves reflecting over the meaning of existence, which, as John Kelsay in the \"Encyclopedia of Ethics\" phrases, \"ultimately points to the reality of God.\" Therefore, regardless of their environment, humans are believed to have a moral responsibility to submit to God's will and to follow Islam (as demonstrated in the Qur'an and the Sunnah, or the sayings of Muhammad) ).\n\nThis natural inclination is, according to the Qur'an, subverted by mankind's focus on material success: such focus first presents itself as a need for basic survival or security, but then tends to manifest into a desire to become distinguished among one's peers. Ultimately, the focus on materialism, according to the Islamic texts, hampers with the innate reflection as described above, resulting in a state of \"jahiliyya\" or \"ignorance.\"\n\nMuslims believe that Muhammad, like other prophets in Islam, was sent by God to remind human beings of their moral responsibility, and challenge those ideas in society which opposed submission to God. According to Kelsay, this challenge was directed against five main characteristics of pre-Islamic Arabia:\n\n\nThese changes lay in the reorientation of society as regards to identity and life of the Muslim belief, world view, and the hierarchy of values. From the viewpoint of subsequent generations, this caused a great transformation in the society and moral order of life in the Arabian Peninsula. For Muhammad, although pre-Islamic Arabia exemplified \"heedlessness,\" it was not entirely without merit. Muhammad approved and exhorted certain aspects of the Arab pre-Islamic tradition, such as the care for one's near kin, for widows, orphans, and others in need and for the establishment of justice. However, these values would be re-ordered in importance and placed in the context of strict monotheism.\n\nFurthermore, a Muslim should not only follow these five main characteristics, but also be more broad about his morals. Therefore, the more the Muslim is applying these rules, the better that person is morally. For example,Islamic ethics can be applied by important verses in the Quran . The most fundamental characteristics of a Muslim are piety and humility. A Muslim must be humble with God and with other people:\n\n“And turn not your face away from people (with pride), nor walk in insolence through the earth. Verily, God likes not each arrogant boaster. And be moderate (or show no insolence) in your walking, and lower your voice. Verily, the harshest of all voices is the voice (braying) of the ass.” (Quran 31:18-19)\n\nMuslims must be in controls of their passions and desires.\n\nA Muslim should not be vain or attached to the ephemeral pleasures of this world. While most people allow the material world to fill their hearts, Muslims should keep God in their hearts and the material world in their hand. Instead of being attached to the car and the job and the diploma and the bank account, all these things become tools to make us better people.\nMorality in Islam addresses every aspect of a Muslim's life, from greetings to international relations. It is universal in its scope and in its applicability. Morality reigns in selfish desires, vanity and bad habits. Muslims must not only be virtuous, but they must also enjoin virtue. They must not only refrain from evil and vice, but they must also forbid them. In other words, they must not only be morally healthy, but they must also contribute to the moral health of society as a whole.\n\n“You are the best of the nations raised up for (the benefit of) men; you enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and believe in God; and if the followers of the Book had believed it would have been better for them; of them (some) are believers and most of them are transgressors.” (Quran: 3:110)\n\nMuhammad summarized the conduct of a Muslim when he said:\n\n“My Sustainer has given me nine commands: to remain conscious of God, whether in private or in public; to speak justly, whether angry or pleased; to show moderation both when poor and when rich, to reunite friendship with those who have broken off with me; to give to him who refuses me; that my silence should be occupied with thought; that my looking should be an admonition; and that I should command what is right.”\n\nJewish ethics may be said to originate with the Hebrew Bible, its broad legal injunctions, wisdom narratives and prophetic teachings. Most subsequent Jewish ethical claims may be traced back to the texts, themes and teachings of the written Torah.\n\nIn early rabbinic Judaism, the Oral Torah both interprets the Hebrew Bible and delves afresh into many other ethical topics. The best known rabbinic text associated with ethics is the non-legal Mishnah tractate of \"Avot\", popularly translated as \"Ethics of the Fathers\". Generally, ethics is a key aspect of non-legal rabbinic literature, known as aggadah, and ethical teachings are found throughout the more legal (halakhic) portions of the Mishnah, Talmud and other rabbinic literature. This early Rabbinic ethics shows signs of cross-fertilization and polemical exchange with both the Greek (Western philosophical) ethical tradition and early Christian tradition.\n\nIn the medieval period, direct Jewish responses to Greek ethics may be seen in major rabbinic writings. Notably, Maimonides offers a Jewish interpretation of Aristotle (e.g., \"Nicomachean Ethics\"), who enters into Jewish discourse through Islamic writings. Maimonides, in turn, influences Thomas Aquinas, a dominant figure in Catholic ethics and the natural law tradition of moral theology. The relevance of natural law to medieval Jewish philosophy is a matter of dispute among scholars.\n\nEthics in systematic form, and apart from religious belief, is as little found in apocryphal or Judæo-Hellenistic literature as in the Bible. However, Greek philosophy greatly influenced Alexandrian writers such as the authors of IV Maccabees, the Book of Wisdom, and Philo.\n\nMuch progress in theoretical ethics came as Jews came into closer contact with the Hellenic world. Before that period the Wisdom literature shows a tendency to dwell solely on the moral obligations and problems of life as appealing to man as an individual, leaving out of consideration the ceremonial and other laws which concern only the Jewish nation. From this point of view Ben Sira's collection of sayings and monitions was written, translated into Greek, and circulated as a practical guide. The book contains popular ethics in proverbial form as the result of everyday life experience, without higher philosophical or religious principles and ideals.\n\nMore developed ethical works emanated from Hasidean circles in the Maccabean time, such as are contained in Tobit, especially in Chapter IV. Here the first ethical will or testament is found, giving a summary of moral teachings, with the Golden Rule, \"Do that to no man which thou hatest!\" as the leading maxim. There are even more elaborate ethical teachings in the \"Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs\", in which each of the twelve sons of Jacob, in his last words to his children and children's children, reviews his life and gives them moral lessons, either warning them against a certain vice he had been guilty of, so that they may avoid divine punishment, or recommending them to cultivate a certain virtue he had practised during life, so that they may win God's favor. The chief virtues recommended are love for one's fellow man, industry, especially in agricultural pursuits, simplicity, sobriety, benevolence toward the poor, compassion even for the brute and avoidance of all passion, pride, and hatred. Similar ethical farewell monitions are attributed to Enoch in the Ethiopic Enoch (xciv. et seq.) and the Slavonic Enoch (lviii. et seq.) and to the three patriarchs.\n\nThe Hellenistic Jewish propaganda literature made the propagation of Jewish ethics taken from the Bible its main object for the sake of winning the pagan world to pure monotheism. It was owing to this endeavor that certain ethical principles were laid down as guiding maxims for the Gentiles, first of all the three capital sins, idolatry, murder, and incest, were prohibited (see Sibyllines, iii. 38, 761; iv. 30 et seq.). In later Jewish rabbinic literature these Noachide Laws were gradually developed into six, seven, and ten, or thirty laws of ethics binding upon every human being.\n\nGermanic Neopagans, including followers of both Asatru and Theodism, try to emulate the ethical values of the ancient Germanic peoples (Norse or Anglo-Saxon) through the form of the Nine Noble Virtues.\n\nScientology ethics is based upon the concepts of good and evil. Ethics may be defined as the actions an individual takes on itself to ensure its continued survival across the dynamics.\n\nSecular ethics is a moral philosophy in which ethics are based solely on human faculties such as scientific reason, sociobiological composition, or ethical intuition, and not derived from purported supernatural revelation or guidance. Secular ethics comprise a wide variety of moral and ethical systems including consequentialism, freethinking, humanism, secular humanism, and utilitarianism, among others.\n\nThe majority of secular moral concepts are based on the acceptance of natural rights and social contracts, and on a more individual scale of either some form of attribution of intrinsic value to things, Kantianesque ethical intuitionism or of a logical deduction that establishes a preference for one thing over another, as with Occam's razor. Approaches such as ethical egoism, moral relativism, moral skepticism, and moral nihilism are also considered.\n\nShinto beliefs start with an assumption of the inherent goodness of humans as descendants of the \"kami\". By the 6th century CE, Shinto had drawn from a Chinese idea that good people will adhere to societal norms, and emperors have a divine mandate to bring about the \"desirable and required order\". Shinto adherents are to \"realize and carry out the will of the \"kami\" and the ancestors in the family, the community, and the nation\".\n\nAlthough State Shinto reinforced subordination to the emperor and the state, Shrine Shinto is a situation-based ethical system that emphasizes right actions toward others, versus adherence to a specific belief system. Shrine Shinto also stresses gratefulness for \"blessings of the \"kami\"\", and maintaining harmony with the emperor and the world.\n\nWiccan morality is largely based on the Wiccan Rede: 'An' it harm none, do what ye will' -- old-fashioned language for 'as long as you aren't harming anyone, do as you wish'. While this could be interpreted to mean \"do no harm at all\", it is usually interpreted as a declaration of the freedom to act, along with the necessity of thinking through and taking responsibility for the consequences of one's actions.\n\nAnother element of Wiccan Morality comes from the Law of Threefold Return, which is understood to mean that whatever one does to another person or thing (benevolent or otherwise) returns with triple force.\n\nMany Wiccans also seek to cultivate a set of eight virtues mentioned in Doreen Valiente's \"Charge of the Goddess\", these being mirth, reverence, honour, humility, strength, beauty, power and compassion. In Valiente's poem they are ordered in pairs of complementary opposites, reflecting a dualism that is common throughout Wiccan philosophy.\n\nGoing for Refuge & Taking the Precepts\" (The Wheel Publication No. 282/284).

Schmidt argues that the theory of evolution does not prescribe a particular set of moral values but it does require people to consider their moral principles free from religious beliefs. Belief in evolution should be combined with a modern humanist philosophy.\n\nAnother theory of 'Evolutionary Humanism' is being developed by self-styled philosopher, Roland Herrmann, which holds that human behaviors, emotions, morals, feelings, and thought processes can be traced backward along the human evolutionary tree, rising in earlier animals. The theory holds that these emotions and behaviors are present on a variety of levels in various other species of animals, not only in primates and cetaceans in which these behaviors are most obvious. By recognizing that other animals can be sentient and can have complex thought processes and relationships, a closer bond and stewardship of the planet is necessary.

{"id": "10837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10837", "title": "Faith and rationality", "text": "Faith and rationality\n\nFaith and rationality are two ideologies that exist in varying degrees of conflict or compatibility. Rationality is based on reason or facts. Faith is belief in inspiration, revelation, or authority. The word \"faith\" sometimes refers to a belief that is held with lack of reason or evidence, a belief that is held in spite of or against reason or evidence, or it can refer to belief based upon a degree of evidential warrant.\n\nAlthough the words \"faith\" and \"belief\" are sometimes erroneously conflated and used as synonyms, \"faith\" properly refers to a particular type (or subset) of \"belief,\" as defined above.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two categories of views regarding the relationship between faith and rationality:\n\nThe Catholic Church also has taught that true faith and correct reason can and must work together, and, viewed properly, can never be in conflict with one another, as both have their origin in God, as stated in the Papal encyclical letter issued by Pope John Paul II, \"Fides et Ratio\" (\"[On] Faith and Reason\").\n\nFrom at least the days of the Greek Philosophers, the relationship between faith and reason has been hotly debated. Plato argued that knowledge is simply memory of the eternal. Aristotle set down rules by which knowledge could be discovered by reason.\n\nRationalists point out that many people hold irrational beliefs, for many reasons. There may be evolutionary causes for irrational beliefs — irrational beliefs may increase our ability to survive and reproduce. Or, according to Pascal's Wager, it may be to our advantage to have faith, because faith may promise infinite rewards, while the rewards of reason are seen by many as finite. One more reason for irrational beliefs can perhaps be explained by operant conditioning. For example, in one study by B. F. Skinner in 1948, pigeons were awarded grain at regular time intervals regardless of their behaviour. The result was that each of pigeons developed their own idiosyncratic response which had become associated with the consequence of receiving grain.\n\nBelievers in faith — for example those who believe salvation is possible through faith alone — frequently suggest that everyone holds beliefs arrived at by faith, not reason. The belief that the universe is a sensible place and that our minds allow us to arrive at correct conclusions about it, is a belief we hold through faith. Rationalists contend that this is arrived at because they have observed the world being consistent and sensible, not because they have faith that it is.\n\nBeliefs held \"by faith\" may be seen existing in a number of relationships to rationality:\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, the most important doctor of the Catholic Church, was the first to write a full treatment of the relationship, differences, and similarities between faith—an intellectual assent—and reason, predominately in his \"Summa Theologica\", \"De Veritate\", and \"Summa contra Gentiles\".\n\nThe Council of Trent's catechism—the \"Roman Catechism\", written during the Catholic Church's Counter-Reformation to combat Protestantism and Martin Luther's antimetaphysical tendencies.\n\n\"Dei Filius\" was a dogmatic constitution of the First Vatican Council on the Roman Catholic faith. It was adopted unanimously on 24 April 1870 and was influenced by the philosophical conceptions of Johann Baptist Franzelin, who had written a great deal on the topic of faith and rationality.\n\nBecause the Roman Catholic Church does not disparage reason, but rather affirms its veracity and utility, there have been many Catholic scientists over the ages.\n\nTwentieth-century Thomist philosopher Étienne Gilson wrote about faith and reason in his 1922 book \"Le Thomisme\". His contemporary Jacques Maritain wrote about it in his \"The Degrees of Knowledge\".\n\n\"Fides et Ratio\" is an encyclical promulgated by Pope John Paul II on 14 September 1998. It deals with the relationship between faith and reason.\n\nPope Benedict XVI's 12 September 2006 Regensburg Lecture was about faith and reason.\n\nSome have asserted that Martin Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship however has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each understand. Bernhard Lohse for example has demonstrated in his classic work \"Fides Und Ratio\" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently Hans-Peter Großhans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Bibilical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible be reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible make sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than Reason which for Luther denoted science, philosophy, history and empirical observation. Here a differing picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason, and held them in dialectical partnership. Luther's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres.\n\nThe view that faith underlies all rationality holds that rationality is dependent on faith for its coherence. Under this view, there is no way to comprehensively \"prove\" that we are actually seeing what we appear to be seeing, that what we remember actually happened, or that the laws of logic and mathematics are actually real. Instead, all beliefs depend for their coherence on \"faith\" in our senses, memory, and reason, because the foundations of rationalism cannot be proven by evidence or reason. Rationally, you can not prove anything you see is real, but you can prove that you yourself are real, and rationalist belief would be that you can believe that the world is consistent until something demonstrates inconsistency. This differs from faith based belief, where you believe that your world view is consistent no matter what inconsistencies the world has with your beliefs.\n\nIn this view, there are many beliefs that are held by faith alone, that rational thought would force the mind to reject. As an example, many people believe in the Biblical story of Noah's flood: that the entire Earth was covered by water for forty days. But objected that most plants cannot survive being covered by water for that length of time, a boat of that magnitude could not have been built by wood, and there would be no way for two of every animal to survive on that ship and migrate back to their place of origin. (such as penguins), Although Christian apologists offer answers to these and such issues, under the premise that such responses are insufficient, then one must choose between accepting the story on faith and rejecting reason, or rejecting the story by reason and thus rejecting faith.\n\nWithin the rationalist point of view, there remains the possibility of multiple rational explanations. For example, considering the biblical story of Noah's flood, one making rational determinations about the probability of the events does so via interpretation of modern evidence. Two observers of the story may provide different plausible explanations for the life of plants, construction of the boat, species living at the time, and migration following the flood. Some see this as meaning that a person is not strictly bound to choose between faith and reason.\n\nAmerican biblical scholar Archibald Thomas Robertson stated that the Greek word \"pistis\" used for faith in the New Testament (over two hundred forty times), and rendered \"assurance\" in Acts 17:31 (KJV), is \"an old verb to furnish, used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence.\" Likewise Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [pistis] which means \"to be persuaded.\"\n\nIn contrast to faith meaning blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence, Alister McGrath quotes Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith-Thomas, (1861-1924), who states faith is \"not blind, but intelligent\" and \"commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence...\", which McGrath sees as \"a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith.\"\n\nAlvin Plantinga upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source of truth claims, but although it may involve this, he sees faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe. \"Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith.\"\n\nThe 14th Century Jewish philosopher Levi ben Gerson tried to reconcile faith and reason. He wrote, \"The Torah cannot prevent us from considering to be true that which our reason urges us to believe.\" His contemporary Hasdai ben Abraham Crescas argued the contrary view, that reason is weak and faith strong, and that only through faith can we discover the fundamental truth that God is love, that through faith alone can we endure the suffering that is the common lot of God's chosen people.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2262129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2262129", "title": "False prophet", "text": "False prophet\n\nIn religion, a false prophet is one who falsely claims the gift of prophecy or divine inspiration, or who uses that gift for evil ends. Often, someone who is considered a \"true prophet\" by some people is simultaneously considered a \"false prophet\" by others, even within the same religion as the \"prophet\" in question. The term is sometimes applied outside religion to describe someone who fervently promotes a theory that the speaker thinks is false.\n\nThroughout the New Testament, there are warnings of both false prophets and false Messiahs, and believers are adjured to be vigilant. The following verses (Matthew ) are from the Sermon on the Mount:\n\nThe New Testament addresses the same point of a false prophet predicting correctly and Jesus predicted the future appearance of false Christs and false prophets, affirming that they can perform great signs and miracles. The following verses are from the Olivet Discourse:\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke, Jesus brought out an ethical application for his disciples using the analogy of false prophets in the Old Testament:\n\nIn the Acts of the Apostles, Paul and Barnabas encountered a false prophet named Elymas Bar-Jesus on the island of Cyprus:\n\nThis particular story likewise best matches the model found in Deuteronomy. The claim here is that Elymas is trying to turn Sergius Paulus from the true faith, just like the false prophet described in the preceding verses. In these verses, we do not see Elymas prophesying as the term is popularly understood, so the model seems to fit this scenario best.\n\nThe Second Epistle of Peter makes a comparison between false teachers and false prophets and how the former will bring in false teachings, just like the false prophets of old:\n\nThe First Epistle of John warns those of the Christian faith to test every spirit because of these false prophets:\n\nOne well-known New Testament false prophet is the false prophet mentioned in the Book of Revelation. The Apocalypse's false prophet is the agent of the Beast, the Antichrist, and he is ultimately cast with the Beast into the lake of \"fire and brimstone\" (Revelation , ). Another mention of a false prophet in the New Testament is an antichrist spirit which denies the Son.\n\nThe Quran portrays Muhammad as the Seal of the Prophets, which is understood by mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims to mean that anyone who claims to be a new prophet after him is a false prophet. All mainstream Muslim scholars' perspectives from both Sunni and Shia denominations do not see the second coming of the Messiah as the coming of a new prophet, as the Islamic Messiah Jesus had already been an existing prophet, and will rule by the Qur'an and Sunnah of Muhammad, bringing no new revelation or prophecy.\n\nThawban ibn Kaidad narrated that Muhammad said;\nAbu Hurairah narrated that Muhammad said;\nMuhammad also stated that the last of these Dajjals would be the False Messiah, al-Masih ad-Dajjal (Antichrist):\n\nSamra ibn Jundab reported once Muhammad (while delivering a ceremonial speech at an occasion of a solar eclipse) said;\nAnas ibn Malik narrated that Muhammad said;\nImam Mahdi, the redeemer according to Islam, will appear on Earth before the Day of Judgment. At the time of the Second Coming of Christ, the Prophet 'Isa (Jesus Christ son of Mary) will kill al-Masih ad-Dajjal (The Antichrist).\nMuslims believe that both Jesus and Mahdi will rid the world of wrongdoing, injustice and tyranny, ensuring peace and tranquility.\n\nJesus is rejected in Judaism as a failed Jewish Messiah claimant and a false prophet.\n\nThe Books of Kings records a story where, under duress from Ahab, the prophet Micaiah depicts God as requesting information from his heavenly counsel as to what he should do with a court of false prophets. This depiction is recorded in 1 Kings 22:19–23:\n\nIt is possible that Micaiah meant to depict the false prophets as a test from YHWH. It is also possible that it was meant as a slur on Ahab's prophets, such as Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah.\n\nThe penalty for false prophecy, including speaking in the name of a god other than YHWH or speaking presumptuously in YHWH's name, is capital punishment. Likewise, if a prophet makes a prophecy in the name of YHWH that does not come to pass, that is another sign that he is not commissioned of YHWH and that the people need not fear the false prophet.\n\nThe Jewish Koine Greek term \"pseuoprophetes\" occurs in the Septuagint Jeremiah 6:13, 33:8,11 34:7, 36:1,8, Zechariah 13:2, Josephus' Antiquities 8-13-1,10-7-3, War of the Jews 6-5-2, and Philo Specific Laws 3:8. Classical pagan writers use the term \"pseudomantis\".\n\nThe term \"false prophet\" is sometimes applied outside religion, to describe promoters of scientific, medical, or political theories which the author of the phrase thinks are false. Paul Offit's 2008 book \"Autism's False Prophets\" applied the phrase to promoters of unproven theories and therapies such as the thiomersal controversy and chelation therapy. Ronald Bailey's 1993 book \"Ecoscam: The False Prophets of Ecological Apocalypse\" applied the phrase to promoters of the global warming hypothesis; however, by 2005 Bailey had changed his mind, writing \"Anyone still holding onto the idea that there is no global warming ought to hang it up.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "25955086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25955086", "title": "Jews", "text": "Jews\n\nJews ( , ) or Jewish people are an ethnoreligious group and a nation, originating from the Israelites and Hebrews of historical Israel and Judah. Jewish ethnicity, nationhood, and religion are strongly interrelated, as Judaism is the traditional faith of the Jewish people, while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance.\n\nJews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE, in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel. The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE (Late Bronze Age). The Israelites, as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population, consolidated their hold with the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews'. Though few sources mention the exilic periods in detail, the experience of diaspora life, from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant, to Assyrian captivity and exile, to Babylonian captivity and exile, to Seleucid Imperial rule, to the Roman occupation and exile, and the historical relations between Jews and their homeland thereafter, became a major feature of Jewish history, identity and memory. Prior to World War II, the worldwide Jewish population reached a peak of 16.7 million, representing around 0.7% of the world population at that time. Approximately 6 million Jews were systematically murdered during the Holocaust. Since then the population has slowly risen again, and was estimated at 14.4 million by the Berman Jewish DataBank, less than 0.2% of the total world population.\n\nThe modern State of Israel is the only country where Jews form a majority of the population. It defines itself as a Jewish and democratic state in the Basic Laws, in particular, which is based on the Declaration of Independence. Israel's Law of Return grants the right of citizenship to any Jew who requests it.\n\nDespite their small percentage of the world's population, Jews have significantly influenced and contributed to human progress in many fields, both historically and in modern times, including philosophy, ethics, literature, politics, business, fine arts and architecture, music, theatre and cinema, medicine, and science and technology, as well as religion; Jews authored the Bible, founded Early Christianity and had a profound influence on Islam. Jews have also played a significant role in the development of Western Civilization.\n\nThe English word \"Jew\" continues Middle English '. These terms derive from Old French ', earlier ', which through elision had dropped the letter \"d\" from the Medieval Latin \"Iudaeus\", which, like the New Testament Greek term \"Ioudaios\", meant both \"Jew\" and \"Judean\" / \"of Judea\". The Greek term was a loan from Aramaic ', corresponding to Hebrew , originally the term for a member of the tribe of Judah or the people of the kingdom of Judah. According to the Hebrew Bible, the name of both the tribe and kingdom derive from Judah, the fourth son of Jacob. Genesis 29:35 and 49:8 connect the name \"Judah\" with the verb , meaning \"praise\", but scholars generally agree that the name of both the patriarch and the kingdom instead have a geographic origin—possibly referring to the gorges and ravines of the region.\n\nThe Hebrew word for \"Jew\" is , with the plural . Endonyms in other Jewish languages include the Ladino (plural , ) and the Yiddish (plural ).\n\nThe etymological equivalent is in use in other languages, e.g., يَهُودِيّ \"yahūdī\" (sg.), \"al-yahūd\" (pl.), in Arabic, \"Jude\" in German, \"judeu\" in Portuguese, \"Juif\" (m.)/\"Juive\" (f.) in French, \"jøde\" in Danish and Norwegian, \"judío/a\" in Spanish, \"jood\" in Dutch, \"żyd\" in Polish etc., but derivations of the word \"Hebrew\" are also in use to describe a Jew, e.g., in Italian (\"Ebreo\"), in Persian (\"Ebri/Ebrani\" ()) and Russian (\"Еврей, Yevrey\"). The German word \"Jude\" is pronounced , the corresponding adjective \"jüdisch\" (Jewish) is the origin of the word \"Yiddish\".\n\nAccording to \"The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\", fourth edition (2000),\nIt is widely recognized that the attributive use of the noun \"Jew\", in phrases such as \"Jew lawyer\" or \"Jew ethics\", is both vulgar and highly offensive. In such contexts \"Jewish\" is the only acceptable possibility. Some people, however, have become so wary of this construction that they have extended the stigma to any use of \"Jew\" as a noun, a practice that carries risks of its own. In a sentence such as \"There are now several Jews on the council\", which is unobjectionable, the substitution of a circumlocution like \"Jewish people\" or \"persons of Jewish background\" may in itself cause offense for seeming to imply that Jew has a negative connotation when used as a noun.\n\nJudaism shares some of the characteristics of a nation, an ethnicity, a religion, and a culture, making the definition of who is a Jew vary slightly depending on whether a religious or national approach to identity is used. Generally, in modern secular usage Jews include three groups: people who were born to a Jewish family regardless of whether or not they follow the religion, those who have some Jewish ancestral background or lineage (sometimes including those who do not have strictly matrilineal descent), and people without any Jewish ancestral background or lineage who have formally converted to Judaism and therefore are followers of the religion.\n\nHistorical definitions of Jewish identity have traditionally been based on \"halakhic\" definitions of matrilineal descent, and halakhic conversions. These definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the Oral Torah into the Babylonian Talmud, around 200 CE. Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as Deuteronomy 7:1–5, by Jewish sages, are used as a warning against intermarriage between Jews and Canaanites because \"[the non-Jewish husband] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others.\" says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an Egyptian man is \"of the community of Israel.\" This is complemented by , where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their gentile wives and their children. A popular theory is that the rape of Jewish women in captivity brought about the law of Jewish identity being inherited through the maternal line, although scholars challenge this theory citing the Talmudic establishment of the law from the pre-exile period. Another argument is that the rabbis changed the law of patrilineal descent to matrilineal descent due to the widespread rape of Jewish women by Roman soldiers. Since the anti-religious \"Haskalah\" movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries, \"halakhic\" interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.\n\nAccording to historian Shaye J. D. Cohen, the status of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined patrilineally in the Bible. He brings two likely explanations for the change in Mishnaic times: first, the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to other mixtures (\"Kil'ayim\"). Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey, and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally. Second, the Tannaim may have been influenced by Roman law, which dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, offspring would follow the mother. Rabbi Rivon Krygier follows a similar reasoning, arguing that Jewish descent had formerly passed through the patrineal descent and the law of matrilineal descent had its roots in the Roman legal system.\n\nA factual reconstruction for the origin of the Jews is a difficult and complex endeavor. It requires examining at least 3,000 years of ancient human history using documents in vast quantities and variety written in at least ten near Eastern languages. As archaeological discovery relies upon researchers and scholars from diverse disciplines, the goal is to interpret all of the factual data, focusing on the most consistent theory. The prehistory and ethnogenesis of the Jews are closely intertwined with archaeology, biology, and historical textual records, as well as religious literature and mythology. The ethnic stock to which Jews originally trace their ancestry was a confederation of Iron Age semitic-speaking tribes known as the Israelites that inhabited a part of Canaan during the tribal and monarchic periods. Modern Jews are named after and also descended from the southern Israelite Kingdom of Judah.\n\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible narrative, Jewish ancestry is traced back to the Biblical patriarchs such as Abraham, his son Isaac, Isaac's son Jacob, and the Biblical matriarchs Sarah, Rebecca, Leah, and Rachel, who lived in Canaan. The Twelve Tribes are described as descending from the twelve sons of Jacob. Jacob and his family migrated to Ancient Egypt after being invited to live with Jacob's son Joseph by the Pharaoh himself. The patriarchs' descendants were later enslaved until the Exodus led by Moses, after which the Israelites conquered Canaan under Moses' successor Joshua, went through the period of the Biblical judges after the death of Joshua, then through the mediation of Samuel became subject to a king, Saul, who was succeeded by David and then Solomon, after whom the United Monarchy ended and was split into a separate Kingdom of Israel and a Kingdom of Judah. The Kingdom of Judah is described as comprising the Tribe of Judah, the Tribe of Benjamin, partially the Tribe of Levi, and later adding remnants of other tribes who migrated there from the Kingdom of Israel. Modern Jews claim lineage from those tribes since the ten northern tribes were lost following Assyrian captivity.\n\nModern archaeology has largely discarded the historicity of this narrative, with it being reframed as constituting the Israelites' inspiring national myth narrative. The Israelites and their culture, according to the modern archaeological account, did not overtake the region by force, but instead branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatristic—and later monotheistic—religion centered on Yahweh. The growth of Yahweh-centric belief, along with a number of cultic practices, gradually gave rise to a distinct Israelite ethnic group, setting them apart from other Canaanites.\n\nThe Israelites become visible in the historical record as a people between 1200 and 1000 BCE. It is not certain if a period like that of the Biblical judges occurred nor if there was ever a United Monarchy. There is well accepted archeological evidence referring to \"Israel\" in the Merneptah Stele, which dates to about 1200 BCE, and the Canaanites are archeologically attested in the Middle Bronze Age. There is debate about the earliest existence of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah and their extent and power, but historians agree that a Kingdom of Israel existed by ca. 900 BCE and that a Kingdom of Judah existed by ca. 700 BCE. It is widely accepted that the Kingdom of Israel was destroyed around 720 BCE, when it was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire.\n\nThe term Jew originated from the Roman \"Judean\" and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BCE Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah.\n\nAccording to the Book of Ezra, the Persian Cyrus the Great ended the Babylonian exile in 538 BCE, the year after he captured Babylon. The exile ended with the return under Zerubbabel the Prince (so-called because he was a descendant of the royal line of David) and Joshua the Priest (a descendant of the line of the former High Priests of the Temple) and their construction of the Second Temple in the period 521–516 BCE. The Cyrus Cylinder, an ancient tablet on which is written a declaration in the name of Cyrus referring to restoration of temples and repatriation of exiled peoples, has often been taken as corroboration of the authenticity of the biblical decrees attributed to Cyrus, but other scholars point out that the cylinder's text is specific to Babylon and Mesopotamia and makes no mention of Judah or Jerusalem. Professor Lester L. Grabbe asserted that the \"alleged decree of Cyrus\" regarding Judah, \"cannot be considered authentic\", but that there was a \"general policy of allowing deportees to return and to re-establish cult sites\". He also stated that archaeology suggests that the return was a \"trickle\" taking place over decades, rather than a single event.\n\nAs part of the Persian Empire, the former Kingdom of Judah became the province of Judah (\"Yehud Medinata)\" with different borders, covering a smaller territory. The population of the province was greatly reduced from that of the kingdom, archaeological surveys showing a population of around 30,000 people in the 5th to 4th centuries BCE. The region was under control of the Achaemenids until the fall of their empire in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great. Jews were also politically independent during the Hasmonean dynasty spanning from 110 to 63 BCE and to some degree under the Herodian dynasty from 37 BCE to 6 CE. Since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, most Jews have lived in diaspora.\n\nGenetic studies on Jews show that most Jews worldwide bear a common genetic heritage which originates in the Middle East, and that they share certain genetic traits with other Gentile peoples of the Fertile Crescent. The genetic composition of different Jewish groups shows that Jews share a common gene pool dating back four millennia, as a marker of their common ancestral origin. Despite their long-term separation, Jewish communities maintained their unique commonalities, propensities, and sensibilities in culture, tradition, and language.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Second Temple, Judaism lost much of its sectarian nature. Nevertheless, a significant Hellenized Diaspora remained, centered in Alexandria, at the time the largest urban Jewish community in the world. Hellenism was a force not just in the Diaspora but also in the Land of Israel over a long period of time. Generally, scholars view Rabbinic Judaism as having been meaningfully influenced by Hellenism.\n\nWithout a Temple, Greek-speaking Jews no longer looked to Jerusalem in the way they had before. Judaism separated into a linguistically Greek and a Hebrew / Aramaic sphere. The theology and religious texts of each community were distinctively different. Hellenized Judaism never developed yeshivas to study the Oral Law. Rabbinic Judaism (centered in the Land of Israel and Babylon) almost entirely ignores the Hellenized Diaspora in its writings. Hellenized Judaism eventually disappeared as its practitioners assimilated into Greco-Roman culture, leaving a strong Rabbinic eastern Diaspora with large centers of learning in Babylon.\n\nBy the first century, the Jewish community in Babylonia, to which Jews were exiled after the Babylonian conquest as well as after the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, already held a speedily growing population of an estimated one million Jews, which increased to an estimated two million between the years 200 CE and 500 CE, both by natural growth and by immigration of more Jews from the Land of Israel, making up about one-sixth of the world Jewish population at that era. The 13th-century author Bar Hebraeus gave a figure of 6,944,000 Jews in the Roman world; Salo Wittmayer Baron considered the figure convincing. The figure of seven million within and one million outside the Roman world in the mid-first century became widely accepted, including by Louis Feldman. However, contemporary scholars now accept that Bar Hebraeus based his figure on a census of total Roman citizens, the figure of 6,944,000 being recorded in Eusebius' Chronicon. Louis Feldman, previously an active supporter of the figure, now states that he and Baron were mistaken. Feldman's views on active Jewish missionizing have also changed. While viewing classical Judaism as being receptive to converts, especially from the second century BCE through the first century CE, he points to a lack of either missionizing tracts or records of the names of rabbis who sought converts as evidence for the lack of active Jewish missionizing. Feldman maintains that conversion to Judaism was common and the Jewish population was large both within the Land of Israel and in the Diaspora. Other historians believe that conversion during the Roman era was limited in number and did not account for much of the Jewish population growth, due to various factors such as the illegality of male conversion to Judaism in the Roman world from the mid-second century. Another factor that made conversion difficult in the Roman world was the halakhic requirement of circumcision, a requirement that proselytizing Christianity quickly dropped. The Fiscus Judaicus, a tax imposed on Jews in 70 CE and relaxed to exclude Christians in 96 CE, also limited Judaism's appeal.\n\nThe Jewish people and the religion of Judaism are strongly interrelated. Converts to Judaism typically have a status within the Jewish \"ethnos\" equal to those born into it. However, several converts to Judaism, as well as ex-Jews, have claimed that converts are treated as second-class Jews by many born Jews.\nConversion is not encouraged by mainstream Judaism, and it is considered a difficult task. A significant portion of conversions are undertaken by children of mixed marriages, or would-be or current spouses of Jews.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible, a religious interpretation of the traditions and early history of the Jews, established the first of the Abrahamic religions, which are now practiced by 54% of the world. Judaism guides its adherents in both practice and belief, and has been called not only a religion, but also a \"way of life,\" which has made drawing a clear distinction between Judaism, Jewish culture, and Jewish identity rather difficult. Throughout history, in eras and places as diverse as the ancient Hellenic world, in Europe before and after The Age of Enlightenment (see Haskalah), in Islamic Spain and Portugal, in North Africa and the Middle East, India, China, or the contemporary United States and Israel, cultural phenomena have developed that are in some sense characteristically Jewish without being at all specifically religious. Some factors in this come from within Judaism, others from the interaction of Jews or specific communities of Jews with their surroundings, and still others from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community, as opposed to from the religion itself. This phenomenon has led to considerably different Jewish cultures unique to their own communities.\n\nHebrew is the liturgical language of Judaism (termed \"lashon ha-kodesh\", \"the holy tongue\"), the language in which most of the Hebrew scriptures (Tanakh) were composed, and the daily speech of the Jewish people for centuries. By the 5th century BCE, Aramaic, a closely related tongue, joined Hebrew as the spoken language in Judea. By the 3rd century BCE, some Jews of the diaspora were speaking Greek. Others, such as in the Jewish communities of Babylonia, were speaking Hebrew and Aramaic, the languages of the Babylonian Talmud. These languages were also used by the Jews of Israel at that time.\n\nFor centuries, Jews worldwide have spoken the local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to, often developing distinctive dialectal forms or branches that became independent languages. Yiddish is the Judæo-German language developed by Ashkenazi Jews who migrated to Central Europe. Ladino is the Judæo-Spanish language developed by Sephardic Jews who migrated to the Iberian peninsula. Due to many factors, including the impact of the Holocaust on European Jewry, the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries, and widespread emigration from other Jewish communities around the world, ancient and distinct Jewish languages of several communities, including Judæo-Georgian, Judæo-Arabic, Judæo-Berber, Krymchak, Judæo-Malayalam and many others, have largely fallen out of use.\n\nFor over sixteen centuries Hebrew was used almost exclusively as a liturgical language, and as the language in which most books had been written on Judaism, with a few speaking only Hebrew on the Sabbath. Hebrew was revived as a spoken language by Eliezer ben Yehuda, who arrived in Palestine in 1881. It had not been used as a mother tongue since Tannaic times. Modern Hebrew is now one of the two official languages of the State of Israel along with Modern Standard Arabic.\n\nDespite efforts to revive Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people, knowledge of the language is not commonly possessed by Jews worldwide and English has emerged as the lingua franca of the Jewish diaspora. Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars.\nThe three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel.\nIn some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted English, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted English rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities. Today, Russian is the first language for many Jewish communities in a number of Post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan, as well as for Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. Although communities in North Africa today are small and dwindling, Jews there had shifted from a multilingual group to a monolingual one (or nearly so), speaking French in Algeria, Morocco, and the city of Tunis, while most North Africans continue to use Arabic or Berber as their mother tongue.\n\nThere is no single governing body for the Jewish community, nor a single authority with responsibility for religious doctrine. Instead, a variety of secular and religious institutions at the local, national, and international levels lead various parts of the Jewish community on a variety of issues.\n\nWithin the world's Jewish population there are distinct ethnic divisions, most of which are primarily the result of geographic branching from an originating Israelite population, and subsequent independent evolutions. An array of Jewish communities was established by Jewish settlers in various places around the Old World, often at great distances from one another, resulting in effective and often long-term isolation. During the millennia of the Jewish diaspora the communities would develop under the influence of their local environments: political, cultural, natural, and populational. Today, manifestations of these differences among the Jews can be observed in Jewish cultural expressions of each community, including Jewish linguistic diversity, culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, as well as degrees and sources of genetic admixture.\n\nJews are often identified as belonging to one of two major groups: the \"Ashkenazim\" and the \"Sephardim\". Ashkenazim, or \"Germanics\" (Ashkenaz meaning \"Germany\" in Hebrew), are so named denoting their German Jewish cultural and geographical origins, while Sephardim, or \"Hispanics\" (Sefarad meaning \"Spain/Hispania\" or \"Iberia\" in Hebrew), are so named denoting their Spanish/Portuguese Jewish cultural and geographic origins. The more common term in Israel for many of those broadly called Sephardim, is \"Mizrahim\" (lit. \"Easterners\", Mizrach being \"East\" in Hebrew), that is, in reference to the diverse collection of Middle Eastern and North African Jews who are often, as a group, referred to collectively as \"Sephardim\" (together with Sephardim proper) for liturgical reasons, although Mizrahi Jewish groups and Sephardi Jews proper are ethnically distinct.\n\nSmaller groups include, but are not restricted to, Indian Jews such as the Bene Israel, Bnei Menashe, Cochin Jews, and Bene Ephraim; the Romaniotes of Greece; the Italian Jews (\"Italkim\" or \"Bené Roma\"); the Teimanim from Yemen; various African Jews, including most numerously the Beta Israel of Ethiopia; and Chinese Jews, most notably the Kaifeng Jews, as well as various other distinct but now almost extinct communities.\n\nThe divisions between all these groups are approximate and their boundaries are not always clear. The Mizrahim for example, are a heterogeneous collection of North African, Central Asian, Caucasian, and Middle Eastern Jewish communities that are no closer related to each other than they are to any of the earlier mentioned Jewish groups. In modern usage, however, the Mizrahim are sometimes termed \"Sephardi\" due to similar styles of liturgy, despite independent development from Sephardim proper. Thus, among Mizrahim there are Egyptian Jews, Iraqi Jews, Lebanese Jews, Kurdish Jews, Moroccan Jews, Libyan Jews, Syrian Jews, Bukharian Jews, Mountain Jews, Georgian Jews, Iranian Jews, Afghan Jews, and various others. The Teimanim from Yemen are sometimes included, although their style of liturgy is unique and they differ in respect to the admixture found among them to that found in Mizrahim. In addition, there is a differentiation made between Sephardi migrants who established themselves in the Middle East and North Africa after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and Portugal in the 1490s and the pre-existing Jewish communities in those regions.\n\nAshkenazi Jews represent the bulk of modern Jewry, with at least 70% of Jews worldwide (and up to 90% prior to World War II and the Holocaust). As a result of their emigration from Europe, Ashkenazim also represent the overwhelming majority of Jews in the New World continents, in countries such as the United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and Brazil. In France, the immigration of Jews from Algeria (Sephardim) has led them to outnumber the Ashkenazim. Only in Israel is the Jewish population representative of all groups, a melting pot independent of each group's proportion within the overall world Jewish population.\n\nY DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East.\nConversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. The populations of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities \"showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect.\" Subsequent studies carried out by Feder et al. confirmed the large portion of non-local maternal origin among Ashkenazi Jews. Reflecting on their findings related to the maternal origin of Ashkenazi Jews, the authors conclude \"Clearly, the differences between Jews and non-Jews are far larger than those observed among the Jewish communities. Hence, differences between the Jewish communities can be overlooked when non-Jews are included in the comparisons.\" A study showed that 7% of Ashkenazi Jews have the haplogroup G2c, which is mainly found in Pashtuns and on lower scales all major Jewish groups, Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese.\nStudies of autosomal DNA, which look at the entire DNA mixture, have become increasingly important as the technology develops. They show that Jewish populations have tended to form relatively closely related groups in independent communities, with most in a community sharing significant ancestry in common. For Jewish populations of the diaspora, the genetic composition of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi Jewish populations show a predominant amount of shared Middle Eastern ancestry. According to Behar, the most parsimonious explanation for this shared Middle Eastern ancestry is that it is \"consistent with the historical formulation of the Jewish people as descending from ancient Hebrew and Israelite residents of the Levant\" and \"the dispersion of the people of ancient Israel throughout the Old World\". North African, Italian and others of Iberian origin show variable frequencies of admixture with non-Jewish historical host populations among the maternal lines. In the case of Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews (in particular Moroccan Jews), who are closely related, the source of non-Jewish admixture is mainly southern European, while Mizrahi Jews show evidence of admixture with other Middle Eastern populations. Behar \"et al.\" have remarked on a close relationship between Ashkenazi Jews and modern Italians. A 2001 study found that Jews were found to be more closely related to groups of the Fertile Crescent (Kurds, Turks, and Armenians) than to their Arab neighbors, the geographic distribution of whose genetic signature was found to correlate with the pattern of the Islamic conquests.\n\nThe studies also show that persons of Sephardic Bnei Anusim origin (those who are descendants of the \"anusim\" who were forced to convert to Catholicism) throughout today's Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and Ibero-America (Hispanic America and Brazil), estimated at up to 19.8% of the modern population of Iberia and at least 10% of the modern population of Ibero-America, have Sephardic Jewish ancestry within the last few centuries. The Bene Israel and Cochin Jews of India, Beta Israel of Ethiopia, and a portion of the Lemba people of Southern Africa, meanwhile, despite more closely resembling the local populations of their native countries, also have some more remote ancient Jewish descent.\n\nAlthough historically, Jews have been found all over the world, in the decades since World War II and the establishment of Israel, they have increasingly concentrated in a small number of countries. In 2013, the United States and Israel were collectively home to more than 80% of the global Jewish population, each country having approximately 41% of the world's Jews.\n\nAccording to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics there were 13,421,000 Jews worldwide in 2009, roughly 0.19% of the world's population at the time.\n\nAccording to the 2007 estimates of The Jewish People Policy Planning Institute, the world's Jewish population is 13.2 million. Adherents.com cites figures ranging from 12 to 18 million. These statistics incorporate both practicing Jews affiliated with synagogues and the Jewish community, and approximately 4.5 million unaffiliated and secular Jews.\n\nAccording to Sergio DellaPergola, a demographer of the Jewish population, in 2015 there were about 6.3 million Jews in Israel, 5.7 million in the United States, and 2.3 million in the rest of the world.\n\nIsrael, the Jewish nation-state, is the only country in which Jews make up a majority of the citizens. Israel was established as an independent democratic and Jewish state on 14 May 1948. Of the 120 members in its parliament, the Knesset, as of 2016, 14 members of the Knesset are Arab citizens of Israel (not including the Druze), most representing Arab political parties. One of Israel's Supreme Court judges is also an Arab citizen of Israel.\n\nBetween 1948 and 1958, the Jewish population rose from 800,000 to two million. Currently, Jews account for 75.4% of the Israeli population, or 6 million people. The early years of the State of Israel were marked by the mass immigration of Holocaust survivors in the aftermath of the Holocaust and Jews fleeing Arab lands. Israel also has a large population of Ethiopian Jews, many of whom were airlifted to Israel in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Between 1974 and 1979 nearly 227,258 immigrants arrived in Israel, about half being from the Soviet Union. This period also saw an increase in immigration to Israel from Western Europe, Latin America, and North America.\n\nA trickle of immigrants from other communities has also arrived, including Indian Jews and others, as well as some descendants of Ashkenazi Holocaust survivors who had settled in countries such as the United States, Argentina, Australia, Chile, and South Africa. Some Jews have emigrated from Israel elsewhere, because of economic problems or disillusionment with political conditions and the continuing Arab–Israeli conflict. Jewish Israeli emigrants are known as yordim.\n\nThe waves of immigration to the United States and elsewhere at the turn of the 19th century, the founding of Zionism and later events, including pogroms in Russia, the massacre of European Jewry during the Holocaust, and the founding of the state of Israel, with the subsequent Jewish exodus from Arab lands, all resulted in substantial shifts in the population centers of world Jewry by the end of the 20th century.\n\nMore than half of the Jews live in the Diaspora (see Population table). Currently, the largest Jewish community outside Israel, and either the largest or second-largest Jewish community in the world, is located in the United States, with 5.2 million to 6.4 million Jews by various estimates. Elsewhere in the Americas, there are also large Jewish populations in Canada (315,000), Argentina (180,000–300,000), and Brazil (196,000–600,000), and smaller populations in Mexico, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Colombia and several other countries (see History of the Jews in Latin America). According to a 2010 Pew Research Center study, about 470,000 people of Jewish heritage live in Latin-America and the Caribbean. Demographers disagree on whether the United States has a larger Jewish population than Israel, with many maintaining that Israel surpassed the United States in Jewish population during the 2000s, while others maintain that the United States still has the largest Jewish population in the world. Currently, a major national Jewish population survey is planned to ascertain whether or not Israel has overtaken the United States in Jewish population.\n\nWestern Europe's largest Jewish community, and the third-largest Jewish community in the world, can be found in France, home to between 483,000 and 500,000 Jews, the majority of whom are immigrants or refugees from North African countries such as Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia (or their descendants). The United Kingdom has a Jewish community of 292,000. In Eastern Europe, the exact figures are difficult to establish. The number of Jews in Russia varies widely according to whether a source uses census data (which requires a person to choose a single nationality among choices that include \"Russian\" and \"Jewish\") or eligibility for immigration to Israel (which requires that a person have one or more Jewish grandparents). According to the latter criteria, the heads of the Russian Jewish community assert that up to 1.5 million Russians are eligible for aliyah. In Germany, the 102,000 Jews registered with the Jewish community are a slowly declining population, despite the immigration of tens of thousands of Jews from the former Soviet Union since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Thousands of Israelis also live in Germany, either permanently or temporarily, for economic reasons.\n\nPrior to 1948, approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands which now make up the Arab world (excluding Israel). Of these, just under two-thirds lived in the French-controlled Maghreb region, 15–20% in the Kingdom of Iraq, approximately 10% in the Kingdom of Egypt and approximately 7% in the Kingdom of Yemen. A further 200,000 lived in Pahlavi Iran and the Republic of Turkey. Today, around 26,000 Jews live in Arab countries and around 30,000 in Iran and Turkey. A small-scale exodus had begun in many countries in the early decades of the 20th century, although the only substantial aliyah came from Yemen and Syria. The exodus from Arab and Muslim countries took place primarily from 1948. The first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s, primarily in Iraq, Yemen and Libya, with up to 90% of these communities leaving within a few years. The peak of the exodus from Egypt occurred in 1956. The exodus in the Maghreb countries peaked in the 1960s. Lebanon was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period, due to an influx of refugees from other Arab countries, although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled. In the aftermath of the exodus wave from Arab states, an additional migration of Iranian Jews peaked in the 1980s when around 80% of Iranian Jews left the country.\n\nOutside Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and the rest of Asia, there are significant Jewish populations in Australia (112,500) and South Africa (70,000). There is also a 7,500-strong community in New Zealand..\n\nSince at least the time of the Ancient Greeks, a proportion of Jews have assimilated into the wider non-Jewish society around them, by either choice or force, ceasing to practice Judaism and losing their Jewish identity. Assimilation took place in all areas, and during all time periods, with some Jewish communities, for example the Kaifeng Jews of China, disappearing entirely. The advent of the Jewish Enlightenment of the 18th century (see Haskalah) and the subsequent emancipation of the Jewish populations of Europe and America in the 19th century, accelerated the situation, encouraging Jews to increasingly participate in, and become part of, secular society. The result has been a growing trend of assimilation, as Jews marry non-Jewish spouses and stop participating in the Jewish community.\n\nRates of interreligious marriage vary widely: In the United States, it is just under 50%, in the United Kingdom, around 53%; in France; around 30%, and in Australia and Mexico, as low as 10%. In the United States, only about a third of children from intermarriages affiliate with Jewish religious practice. The result is that most countries in the Diaspora have steady or slightly declining religiously Jewish populations as Jews continue to assimilate into the countries in which they live.\n\nThe Jewish people and Judaism have experienced various persecutions throughout Jewish history. During Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages the Roman Empire (in its later phases known as the Byzantine Empire) repeatedly repressed the Jewish population, first by ejecting them from their homelands during the pagan Roman era and later by officially establishing them as second-class citizens during the Christian Roman era.\n\nAccording to James Carroll, \"Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the Roman Empire. By that ratio, if other factors had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million.\"\n\nLater in medieval Western Europe, further persecutions of Jews by Christians occurred, notably during the Crusades—when Jews all over Germany were massacred—and a series of expulsions from the Kingdom of England, Germany, France, and, in the largest expulsion of all, Spain and Portugal after the Reconquista (the Catholic Reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula), where both unbaptized Sephardic Jews and the ruling Muslim Moors were expelled.\n\nIn the Papal States, which existed until 1870, Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called ghettos.\n\nIslam and Judaism have a complex relationship. Traditionally Jews and Christians living in Muslim lands, known as dhimmis, were allowed to practice their religions and administer their internal affairs, but they were subject to certain conditions. They had to pay the jizya (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to the Islamic state. Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal disabilities such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims. Many of the disabilities were highly symbolic. The one described by Bernard Lewis as \"most degrading\" was the requirement of distinctive clothing, not found in the Quran or hadith but invented in early medieval Baghdad; its enforcement was highly erratic. On the other hand, Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession.\n\nNotable exceptions include the massacre of Jews and forcible conversion of some Jews by the rulers of the Almohad dynasty in Al-Andalus in the 12th century, as well as in Islamic Persia, and the forced confinement of Moroccan Jews to walled quarters known as mellahs beginning from the 15th century and especially in the early 19th century. In modern times, it has become commonplace for standard antisemitic themes to be conflated with anti-Zionist publications and pronouncements of Islamic movements such as Hezbollah and Hamas, in the pronouncements of various agencies of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and even in the newspapers and other publications of Turkish Refah Partisi.\"\n\nThroughout history, many rulers, empires and nations have oppressed their Jewish populations or sought to eliminate them entirely. Methods employed ranged from expulsion to outright genocide; within nations, often the threat of these extreme methods was sufficient to silence dissent. The history of antisemitism includes the First Crusade which resulted in the massacre of Jews; the Spanish Inquisition (led by Tomás de Torquemada) and the Portuguese Inquisition, with their persecution and \"autos-da-fé\" against the New Christians and Marrano Jews; the Bohdan Chmielnicki Cossack massacres in Ukraine; the Pogroms backed by the Russian Tsars; as well as expulsions from Spain, Portugal, England, France, Germany, and other countries in which the Jews had settled. According to a 2008 study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, 19.8% of the modern Iberian population has Sephardic Jewish ancestry, indicating that the number of conversos may have been much higher than originally thought.\nThe persecution reached a peak in Nazi Germany's Final Solution, which led to the Holocaust and the slaughter of approximately 6 million Jews. Of the world's 15 million Jews in 1939, more than a third were killed in the Holocaust. The Holocaust—the state-led systematic persecution and genocide of European Jews (and certain communities of North African Jews in European controlled North Africa) and other minority groups of Europe during World War II by Germany and its collaborators remains the most notable modern-day persecution of Jews. The persecution and genocide were accomplished in stages. Legislation to remove the Jews from civil society was enacted years before the outbreak of World War II. Concentration camps were established in which inmates were used as slave labour until they died of exhaustion or disease. Where the Third Reich conquered new territory in Eastern Europe, specialized units called Einsatzgruppen murdered Jews and political opponents in mass shootings. Jews and Roma were crammed into ghettos before being transported hundreds of miles by freight train to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, the majority of them were killed in gas chambers. Virtually every arm of Germany's bureaucracy was involved in the logistics of the mass murder, turning the country into what one Holocaust scholar has called \"a genocidal nation.\"\n\nThroughout Jewish history, Jews have repeatedly been directly or indirectly expelled from both their original homeland, the Land of Israel, and many of the areas in which they have settled. This experience as refugees has shaped Jewish identity and religious practice in many ways, and is thus a major element of Jewish history. The patriarch Abraham is described as a migrant to the land of Canaan from Ur of the Chaldees after an attempt on his life by King Nimrod. His descendants, the Children of Israel, in the Biblical story (whose historicity is uncertain) undertook the Exodus (meaning \"departure\" or \"exit\" in Greek) from ancient Egypt, as recorded in the Book of Exodus.\n\nCenturies later, Assyrian policy was to deport and displace conquered peoples, and it is estimated some 4,500,000 among captive populations suffered this dislocation over 3 centuries of Assyrian rule. With regard to Israel, Tiglath-Pileser III claims he deported 80% of the population of Lower Galilee, some 13,520 people. Some 27,000 Israelites, 20–25% of the population of the Kingdom of Israel, were described as being deported by Sargon II, and were replaced by other deported populations and sent into permanent exile by Assyria, initially to the Upper Mesopotamian provinces of the Assyrian Empire, Between 10,000 and 80,000 people from the Kingdom of Judah were similarly exiled by Babylonia, but these people were then returned to Judea by Cyrus the Great of the Persian Achaemenid Empire.\n\nMany Jews were exiled again by the Roman Empire. The 2,000 year dispersion of the Jewish diaspora beginning under the Roman Empire, as Jews were spread throughout the Roman world and, driven from land to land, settled wherever they could live freely enough to practice their religion. Over the course of the diaspora the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia to the Iberian Peninsula to Poland to the United States and, as a result of Zionism, back to Israel.\n\nThere were also many expulsions of Jews during the Middle Ages and Enlightenment in Europe, including: 1290, 16,000 Jews were expelled from England, see the \"(Statute of Jewry)\"; in 1396, 100,000 from France; in 1421 thousands were expelled from Austria. Many of these Jews settled in Eastern Europe, especially Poland. Following the Spanish Inquisition in 1492, the Spanish population of around 200,000 Sephardic Jews were expelled by the Spanish crown and Catholic church, followed by expulsions in 1493 in Sicily (37,000 Jews) and Portugal in 1496. The expelled Jews fled mainly to the Ottoman Empire, the Netherlands, and North Africa, others migrating to Southern Europe and the Middle East.\n\nDuring the 19th century, France's policies of equal citizenship regardless of religion led to the immigration of Jews (especially from Eastern and Central Europe). This contributed to the arrival of millions of Jews in the New World. Over two million Eastern European Jews arrived in the United States from 1880 to 1925.\n\nIn summary, the pogroms in Eastern Europe, the rise of modern antisemitism, the Holocaust, and the rise of Arab nationalism all served to fuel the movements and migrations of huge segments of Jewry from land to land and continent to continent, until they arrived back in large numbers at their original historical homeland in Israel.\n\nIn the latest phase of migrations, the Islamic Revolution of Iran caused many Iranian Jews to flee Iran. Most found refuge in the US (particularly Los Angeles, California and Long Island, New York) and Israel. Smaller communities of Persian Jews exist in Canada and Western Europe. Similarly, when the Soviet Union collapsed, many of the Jews in the affected territory (who had been refuseniks) were suddenly allowed to leave. This produced a wave of migration to Israel in the early 1990s.\n\nIsrael is the only country with a Jewish population that is consistently growing through natural population growth, although the Jewish populations of other countries, in Europe and North America, have recently increased through immigration. In the Diaspora, in almost every country the Jewish population in general is either declining or steady, but Orthodox and Haredi Jewish communities, whose members often shun birth control for religious reasons, have experienced rapid population growth.\n\nOrthodox and Conservative Judaism discourage proselytism to non-Jews, but many Jewish groups have tried to reach out to the assimilated Jewish communities of the Diaspora in order for them to reconnect to their Jewish roots. Additionally, while in principle Reform Judaism favors seeking new members for the faith, this position has not translated into active proselytism, instead taking the form of an effort to reach out to non-Jewish spouses of intermarried couples.\n\nThere is also a trend of Orthodox movements reaching out to secular Jews in order to give them a stronger Jewish identity so there is less chance of intermarriage. As a result of the efforts by these and other Jewish groups over the past 25 years, there has been a trend (known as the Baal teshuva movement) for secular Jews to become more religiously observant, though the demographic implications of the trend are unknown. Additionally, there is also a growing rate of conversion to Jews by Choice of gentiles who make the decision to head in the direction of becoming Jews.\n\nJews have made a myriad of contributions to humanity in a broad and diverse range of fields, including the sciences, arts, politics, and business. Although Jews comprise only 0.2% of the world's population, over 20% of Nobel Prize laureates have been Jewish or of Jewish descent, with multiple winners in each category.\n\n\n\n"}

He stated that \"to learn about religion we have to come to our senses. Literally. We have to begin to discover... that we cannot know the worlds of any other culture, let alone our own, unless we get inside the sensational operations of human bodies.\"\n\nThe material religion framework has been promoted by the scholars such as Birgit Meyer, Sally Promey, S.

The religion is also called Hmongism by a Hmong American church established in 2012 to organise it among Hmong people in the United States.\n\nIt has a pantheist theology, centered on worship of deities and progenitors of the Miao peoples. Throughout its history it has incorporated theoretical and ritual elements from Taoism, and broader Chinese religion, especially the emphasis on the pattern of the forces of the natural universe and the need of human life to be in accordance with these forces.\n\nMost Hmong continue to practice the traditional religion, although many Hmong in Asia have converted to Buddhism or have mixed it with Buddhism, and many Hmong Americans and Hmong Australians have adopted Christianity or Buddhism.\n\nThe highest god of Hmong traditional religion is called \"Saub\" or \"Yawm Saub\", who endows the shamans with their abilities. The Saub god may be called in times of need and he can manifest in points of crisis throughout the course of history. The first shaman was \"Siv Yis\": Hmong shamans refer to themselves as \"Siv Yis\" when they are in ecstasy. The gods of cosmic nature are simply called \"dab\", while \"dab neeb\" or \"qhua neeb\" are shamanic spirits that float through the worlds and work with the shamans operating within a specific sphere which is their domain. The shamanic spirits include wild spirits of untamed nature and the tamed and friendly spirits of the house. Ancestral spirits (\"Xwm Kab\") who reside in the world of the dead form another category, though also involved in shamanic practice.\n\nThe frog god \"Nplooj Lwg\" is considered the creator of humans. \"Ntxwj Nyug\" and \"Nyuj Vaj Tuam Teem\" are the lords of the otherworld, determining life, death and reincarnation or rest in heaven. While \"Ntxwj Nyug\" is an indigenous deity, \"Nyuj Vaj Tuam Teem\" is thought to derive from the Jade Lord of Taoism. Every house has an altar for the \"Dab Xwm Kab\" (god of good fortune). \"Dab Pog\" is the goddess of babies. \"Zaj Laug\" is the \"Old Dragon\" or \"Dragon King\". \"Poj Ntxoog\" is a fearful female spirit associated with the tiger. \"Yaj Yuam\" is an ancestral hero, the \"Heavenly Archer\", corresponding to the Chinese Houyi. Other gods are of nature, such as \"Xob\", the god of thunder and lightning, and \"Nkauj Hnub\" and \"Nraug Hlis\", \"Lady Sun\" and \"Lord Moon\". Chiyou (or Txiv Yawg) is worshipped as an ancestral god of the Hmong nation.\n\nThe Hmong house is a reflection of the cosmos. It is constructed around a central post (\"ncej tas\") representing the world tree, axis of the spirits, which god is \"Dab Ncej Tas\". The roofs represent the heaven (the spiritual world) and the floor symbolises nature (the world of men). The axis of the building represents the male head of the household and his ancestral spirit, the ancestral unity. Man is in the between of heaven and earth. The Hmong believe in various household spirits called \"dab nyeg\", meaning \"tamed spirits\", such as \"Dab Qhovcub\" (the god of the main hearth), \"Dab Qhovtxos\" (the god of the ritual hearth), \"Dab Nthab\" (the god of the loft), \"Dab Roog\" (the god of the framework of the front door). The \"Dab Txhiaj Meej\" is the god of wealth and richness. Spirits of nature are called \"dab qus\", \"wild spirits\".\n\n\"Yeeb and Yaj\" is the Hmong equivalent of the yin and yang found in Chinese traditional religion and Taoism. Differently from the context of Chinese thought, the Hmong \"yeeb and yaj\" is not represented by symbols such as the \"taijitu\". The concept represents the world of the living and the world of the gods: \"yeeb ceeb\" is the spiritual world, while \"yaj ceeb\" is the world of material nature. The Hmong also practice \"looj mem\", the Chinese feng shui.\n\nShaman practice is called \"ua neeb\" (ua: \"to heal through the, \"neeb: the spirit world\", the \"dab neeb\" being specifically shamanic gods), while the shaman is called \"txiv neeb\", meaning \"father of the \"neeb\"\".\n\nThe position of a shaman is not inherited as shamans are chosen by the \"neeb\" class of gods, manifesting through trails experienced by those chosen. Chosen people are guided by elder shamans until they are able to perform the healing rituals themselves. A shaman has control on his spirits helpers.\n\nIn the spirit journey, the shaman calls on his helpers who are spirits to guide or assist him in the spirit world. He moves and sing on a spiritual horse (\"nees\") represented in the living world by a shaman's bench (\"rooj neeb\"). He also calls on the forces of the cosmos to help him, such as the highest god \"Saub\", the First Couple, \"Pog Ntxoog\", Lady Sun and Lord Moon, the seven stars of the Pleiades, and many animal spirits. Divination horns (\"kwam\") is one form or means of communication with the gods, and they are used in many rituals.\n\nThe shamans perform two sessions of healing rituals: the diagnostic rituals (\"ua neeb saib\") and subsequently the healing rituals (\"ua neeb kho\"), only if the patient shows no signs of recovery after the first ritual.\n\nThe Hmong household altar is dedicated primarily to the \"Dab Xwm Kab\" (god of good fortune). It is placed on the wall of the main room of the house. On the altar people make offerings of rice, chicken, soup and rice served in bamboo, with incense and joss paper. \"Txi dab\" is the general term for the sacrifice to the gods, while \"laib dab\" is the ritual of sacrifice to the ancestors. On the last day of the Old Year rice is offered to the ancestors, with a sacrificed chicken, and a soul-calling (\"hu plig\") ritual is held.\n\nThe shaman's altar is a special hanging or standing altar, with two or three tiers depending on the status of the shaman. It is believed to represent Siv Yis' grotto near the top of the holy mountain, above a pool near of which grows the flower of immortality. This pool is represented by a bowl of water placed upon the altar. From the altar depart several cotton threads resulting attached to the central housepost, and it is along these threads that the \"neeb\" travel when they visit the altar.\n\nA third type of Hmong altar is devoted to a special category of gods known as the \"dab tshuaj\", or gods of medicine, which are generally worshipped by women, since in Hmong culture they specialise in the knowledge of herbalism.\n\nJoss papers are a central element of Hmong altars. There are both joss paper used as offerings and decorative joss papers. The second ones are used as symbols connecting with the gods, and they are usually composed of large white sheets, with smaller yellow or silver sheets, and sometimes little red squares.\n\nMiao religious rituals involving the worship of gods and ancestors are performed by the patriarch of each family or the spiritual leader of a clan or a cluster of male relatives. More difficult ceremonies such as soul-calling (\"hu plig\") are performed by ritual experts the shaman (\"txiv neeb\") for spiritual healing, and various experts in funeral rites like the reed pipe player (\"txiv qeej\"), the soul chanter (\"nkauj plig\") and the blessing singers (\"txiv xaiv\"). The soul is believed to reincarnate. The body (\"cev\") is a microcosm believed to be constructed by a number of souls (\"plig\" or \"ntsuj\") that mirror the macrocosm.\n\nHmong religion includes specific rituals for the milestones of the life cycle: there are rituals for birth and baby naming, marriage, rename after marriage, trauma and sickness, extending the mandate of life for sick elderly, death and funeral. There are also festivals with corresponding ceremonies: the New Year (\"Lwm Qaib\" or \"Ntoo Xeeb\", or also \"Noj Peb Caug\") in mid-November, \"Nyuj Dab\" (Ox Festival), \"Dab Roog\" (Door Festival) and \"Npua Tai\" (Pig Festival).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1137789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1137789", "title": "Noaidi", "text": "Noaidi\n\nA noaidi (, , , , , ) is a shaman of the Sami people in the Nordic countries representing an indigenous nature religion. Most \"noaidi\" practices died out during the 17th century, most likely because they resisted Christianisation and the king's authority. Their actions were referred to in courts as \"magic\" or \"sorcery\" (cf. witchcraft). Several Sámi shamanistic beliefs and practices were similar to those of some Siberian cultures.\n\nNoaidis, Sámi shamans, were traditionally the healers and protectors. Noaidis are said to have the role of mediator between humans and the spirits. To undertake this mediation, the noaidi communicated with the spirit world, asking what sacrifice needed to be made by a person so that they might return to good health, be successful in their hunt for food, and even for good weather. Sacrifices were designed by the noaidi to reestablish the balance between the mortal and immortal worlds. Using a traditional drum, which is the most important symbol and tool of the Sámi shaman, the noaide invoked assistance from benevolent spirits and conducted out-of-body travel via the “free soul” with the help of other siida members. The Sámi distinguish between the “free soul” versus the more mundane “body soul”; the “body soul” is unable to traverse the divide separating the spiritual netherworld from the more mundane, corporeal, real world.\n\nA noaidi could engage in any kind of affair that demanded wisdom; it is said they took payments for their services. The activities included healing people, helping children, making decisions and protecting reindeer, which represented the most important source of food and were also used as tribute payment.\n\nThe sources from which we learn about noaidi are court protocols, tales, excavated tools (such as belts), and missionary reports. That noaidis were punished and in some cases sentenced to death for their \"sorcery\" should perhaps rather be interpreted as an attempt to obliterate opposition to the crown. There was by law no freedom of religion during most of the 19th century and before, as the Lutheran Swedish church was the only allowed religion (except for some foreign temporary residents). Swedish priests supported conviction of noaidis for sorcery.\n\nIn the Sami shamanistic form of worship drumming and traditional chanting (joiking) were of singular importance. Some of joiks were sung on shamanistic rites; this memory is conserved also in a folklore text (a shaman story).\n\nRecently, joiks have been sung in two different styles, one of which is sung only by young people. The other joik may be identified with the “mumbling” joik, resembling chants or magic spells.\n\nSeveral surprising characteristics of joiks can be explained by comparing the music ideals, as observed in joiks and contrasted to music ideals of other cultures. In some instances, joiks mimic natural sounds. This can be contrasted to other goals, namely overtone singing and bel canto, both of which exploit human speech organs to achieve “superhuman” sounds. Overtone singing and the imitation of sounds in shamanism are present in many other cultures as well. Sound imitation may serve other purposes such as games and other entertainment as well as important practical purposes such as luring animals during hunts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43712", "title": "Parsi", "text": "Parsi\n\nA Parsi () or Parsee (\"Persian\" in the Persian language) refers to a member of the Zoroastrian community who migrated to India (mainly; including present day Pakistan) from Persia during the Arab invasion of 636–651 AD; one of two (the other being Iranis) mainly located in India, with a few in Pakistan. According to the \"Qissa-i Sanjan\", Parsis migrated from Greater Iran to Gujarat, where they were given refuge, between the 8th and 10th century AD to avoid persecution following the Muslim conquest of Persia.\n\nAt the time of the Muslim conquest of Persia, the dominant religion of the region (which was ruled by the Sasanian Empire) was Zoroastrianism. Iranians rebelled against Muslim conquerors for almost 200 years. During this time many Iranians (who are now called Parsis) chose to preserve their religious identity by fleeing from Persia to India.\n\nThe word , pronounced \"Parsian\", i.e., \"Parsi\" in the Persian language, literally means \"Persian\". Farsi is the official language of modern Iran, which was formerly known as Persia, and the Persian language's endonym is \"Farsi\", an arabization of the word \"Parsi\".\n\nThe long presence of the Parsis in the Indian subcontinent distinguishes them from the smaller Zoroastrian Indian community of Iranis, who are much more recent arrivals, mostly descended from Zoroastrians fleeing the repression of the Qajar dynasty and the general social and political tumult of late 19th- and early 20th-century Iran.\n\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica,Parsi, also spelled Parsee, member of a group of followers in India of the Persian prophet Zoroaster. The Parsis, whose name means \"Persians\", are descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to India to avoid religious persecution by the Muslims. They live chiefly in Mumbai and in a few towns and villages mostly to the south of Mumbai, but also a few minorities near by in Karachi (Pakistan) and Bangalore (Karnataka, India). There is a sizeable Parsee population in Pune as well in Hyderabad. A few Parsee families also reside in Kolkata and Chennai. Although they are not, strictly speaking, a caste, since they are not Hindus, they form a well-defined community. The exact date of the Parsi migration is unknown. According to tradition, the Parsis initially settled at Hormuz on the Persian Gulf, but finding themselves still persecuted they set sail for India, arriving in the 8th century. The migration may in fact have taken place as late as the 10th century, or in both. They settled first at Diu in Kathiawar but soon moved to south Gujarāt, where they remained for about 800 years as a small agricultural community.\n\nThe term \"Pārsi\", which in the Persian language is a demonym meaning \"inhabitant of Pārs\" and hence \"ethnic Persian\", is not attested in Indian Zoroastrian texts until the 17th century. Until that time, such texts consistently use the Persian-origin terms \"Zartoshti\" \"Zoroastrian\" or \"Vehdin\" \"[of] the good religion\". The 12th-century \"Sixteen Shlokas\", a Sanskrit text in praise of the Parsis, is the earliest attested use of the term as an identifier for Indian Zoroastrians.\nThe first reference to the Parsis in a European language is from 1322, when a French monk, Jordanus, briefly refers to their presence in Thane and Bharuch. Subsequently, the term appears in the journals of many European travelers, first French and Portuguese, later English, all of whom used a Europeanized version of an apparently local language term. For example, Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta observed in 1563 that \"there are merchants ... in the kingdom of Cambaia ... known as Esparcis. We Portuguese call them Jews, but they are not so. They are Gentios.\" In an early 20th-century legal ruling (see self-perceptions, below), Justices Davar and Beaman asserted (1909:540) that \"Parsi\" was also a term used in Iran to refer to Zoroastrians. notes that in much the same way as the word \"Hindu\" was used by Iranians to refer to anyone from the Indian subcontinent, \"Parsi\" was used by the Indians to refer to anyone from Greater Iran, irrespective of whether they were actually ethnic Persian people. In any case, the term \"Parsi\" itself is \"not necessarily an indication of their Iranian or 'Persian' origin, but rather as indicator – manifest as several properties – of ethnic identity\" . Moreover, if heredity were the only factor in a determination of ethnicity, the Parsis would count as Parthians according to the \"Qissa-i Sanjan\". \n\nThe term \"Parseeism\" or \"Parsiism\" is attributed to Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron, who in the 1750s, when the word \"Zoroastrianism\" had yet to be coined, made the first detailed report of the Parsis and of Zoroastrianism, therein mistakenly assuming that the Parsis were the only remaining followers of the religion.\n\nIn addition to above, the Parsi identity was well truly an identity even before they moved to India:\n\nIn ancient Persia, Zoroaster taught that good (Ohrmazd) and evil (Angra Mainyu) were opposite forces and the battle between them is more or less evenly matched. A person should always be vigilant to align with forces of light. According to the \"asha\" or the righteousness and \"druj\" or the wickedness, the person has chosen in his life they will be judged at the Chinvat bridge to grant passage to Paradise, Hammistagan (A limbo area) or Hell by a sword. A personified form of the soul that represents the person’s deeds takes the adjudged to their destination and they will abide there until the final apocalypse. After the final battle between good and evil, every soul’s walk through a river of fire ordeal for burning of their dross and together they receive a post resurrection paradise. The Zoroastrian holy book, called the \"Avesta\", was written in the Avestan language, which is closely related to Vedic Sanskrit.\n\nThe \"Qissa-i Sanjan\" is a tale of the journey of the Parsis to India from Iran. It says they fled for reasons of religious freedom and they were allowed to settle in India thanks to the goodwill of a local prince. However, the Parsi community had to abide by three rules: they had to speak the local language, follow local marriage customs, and not carry any weapons. After showing the many similarities between their faith and local beliefs, the early community was granted a plot of land on which to build a fire temple.\n\nOver the centuries since the first Zoroastrians arrived in India, the Parsis have integrated themselves into Indian society while simultaneously maintaining or developing their own distinct customs and traditions (and thus ethnic identity). This in turn has given the Parsi community a rather peculiar standing: they are Indians in terms of national affiliation, language and history, but not typically Indian in terms of consanguinity or ethnicity, cultural, behavioural and religious practices. \nGenealogical DNA tests to determine purity of lineage have brought mixed results. One study supports the Parsi contention that they have maintained their Persian roots by avoiding intermarriage with local populations. In that 2002 study of the Y-chromosome (patrilineal) DNA of the Parsis of Pakistan, it was determined that Parsis are genetically closer to Iranians than to their neighbours .\n\nA 2004 study in which Parsi mitochondrial DNA (matrilineal) was compared with that of the Iranians and Gujaratis determined that Parsis (in Gujarat, but not in other parts of India) are genetically closer to Gujaratis than to Iranians. Taking the 2002 study into account, the authors of the 2004 study suggested \"a male-mediated migration of the ancestors of the present-day Parsi population, where they admixed with local females [...] leading ultimately to the loss of mtDNA of Iranian origin\" . To put all the doubts to rest a deeper study was conducted in 2017 “Like sugar in milk”: reconstructing the genetic history of the Parsi population which confirms that Parsis are genetically closer to Neolithic Iranians than to modern Iranians, who have witnessed a more recent wave of admixture from the Near East.\n\nThe definition of who is, and is not, a Parsi is a matter of great contention within the Zoroastrian community in India. It is generally accepted that a Parsi is a person who:\n\nIn this sense, \"Parsi\" is an ethno-religious designator, whose definition is of contention among its members, similar to the contention over who is a Jew in the West.\n\nSome members of the community additionally contend that a child must have a Parsi father to be eligible for introduction into the faith, but this assertion is considered by most to be a violation of the Zoroastrian tenets of gender equality and may be a remnant of an old legal definition of the term Parsi.\n\nAn oft-quoted legal definition of Parsi is based on a 1909 ruling (since nullified) that not only stipulated that a person could not become a Parsi by converting to the Zoroastrian faith but also noted:\n\nThis definition was overturned several times. The equality principles of the Indian Constitution void the patrilineal restrictions expressed in the third clause. The second clause was contested and overturned in 1948. On appeal in 1950, the 1948 ruling was upheld and the entire 1909 definition was deemed an obiter dictum – a collateral opinion and not legally binding (re-affirmed in 1966). (; ).\n\nNonetheless, the opinion that the 1909 ruling is legally binding continues to persist, even among the better-read and moderate Parsis.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census of India, there are 57,264 Parsis in India. According to the National Commission for Minorities, there are a \"variety of causes that are responsible for this steady decline in the population of the community\", the most significant of which were childlessness and migration (). Demographic trends project that by the year 2020 the Parsis will number only 23,000. The Parsis will then cease to be called a community and will be labeled a 'tribe'. ().\n\nOne-fifth of the decrease in population is attributed to migration (). A slower birthrate than deathrate accounts for the rest: as of 2001, Parsis over the age of 60 make up for 31% of the community. Only 4.7% of the Parsi community are under 6 years of age, which translates to 7 births per year per 1000 individuals (). Concerns have been raised in recent years over the rapidly declining population of the Parsi community in India.\n\nThere are various factors that have led to the decline in Parsi community a few are listed below:\n\n1.Late Marriage \n\nAs most of the Parsi women, usually go abroad to seek higher education and are usually more qualified than Parsi men. They would like to stand up on their own- two feet and fetch for themselves. Causing them to get married late as a result of their work. \n\n2. Fertility Rate\n\nDue to getting married late, the fertility rate decreases in women and their chances of conceiving decreases. \n\n3. Conversion\n\nParsi religion doesn't allow inter- caste marriage, only intra-caste. Hence, if a women gets married to a non- Parsi she is not sought to be a part of the community and is often discarded. She is not allowed to visit the fire temple, not allowed to attended her fathers funeral, do her childs Navjote Ceremony and is often neglected by her parents. \n\n4. Illnesses\n\nDue to getting married in their own community since decades, the Parsi gene pool is rather weak and more prone to illness such as cancer, osteoporosis etc. Hence, they are more susceptible to illnesses and their death rates are higher than birth rates. \n\nThe gender ratio among Parsis is unusual: as of 2001, the ratio of males to females was 1000 males to 1050 females (up from 1024 in 1991), due primarily to the high median age of the population (elderly women are more common than elderly men). As of 2001 the national average in India was 1000 males to 933 females.\n\nParsis have a high literacy rate; as of 2001, the literacy rate is 97.9%, the highest of any Indian community (the national average was 64.8%). 96.1% of Parsis reside in urban areas (the national average is 27.8%).\n\nIn the Greater Mumbai area, where the density of Parsis is highest, about 10% of Parsi females and about 20% of Parsi males do not marry.()\n\nAccording to the Qissa-i Sanjan, the only existing account of the early years of Zoroastrian refugees in India composed at least six centuries after their tentative date of arrival, the first group of immigrants originated from Greater Khorasan. This historical region of Central Asia is in part in northeastern Iran, where it constitutes modern Khorasan Province, part of western/northern Afghanistan, and in part in three Central-Asian republics namely Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\n\nAccording to the \"Qissa\", the immigrants were granted permission to stay by the local ruler, Jadi Rana, on the condition that they adopt the local language (Gujarati) and that their women adopt local dress (the \"sari\"). The refugees accepted the conditions and founded the settlement of Sanjan, which is said to have been named after the city of their origin (Sanjan, near Merv, modern Turkmenistan). This first group was followed by a second group from Greater Khorasan within five years of the first, and this time having religious implements with them (the \"alat\"). In addition to these \"Khorasani\"s or \"Kohistani\"s \"mountain folk\", as the two initial groups are said to have been initially called, at least one other group is said to have come overland from Sari, Iran.\nAlthough the Sanjan group are believed to have been the first permanent settlers, the precise date of their arrival is a matter of conjecture. All estimates are based on the \"Qissa\", which is vague or contradictory with respect to some elapsed periods. Consequently, three possible dates – 716, 765, and 936 – have been proposed as the year of landing, and the disagreement has been the cause of \"many an intense battle ... amongst Parsis\". Since dates are not specifically mentioned in Parsi texts prior to the 18th century, any date of arrival is perforce a matter of speculation. The importance of the \"Qissa\" lies in any case not so much in its reconstruction of events than in its depiction of the Parsis – in the way they have come to view themselves – and in their relationship to the dominant culture. As such, the text plays a crucial role in shaping Parsi identity. But, \"even if one comes to the conclusion that the chronicle based on verbal transmission is not more than a legend, it still remains without doubt an extremely informative document for Parsee historiography.\"\n\nThe Sanjan Zoroastrians were certainly not the first Zoroastrians on the subcontinent. Sindh touching Balochistan, the easternmost periphery of the Iranian world, too had once been under coastal administration of the Sasanian Empire (226-651), which consequently maintained outposts there. Even following the loss of Sindh, the Iranians continued to play a major role in the trade links between the east and west. The 9th-century Arab historiographer Al-Masudi briefly notes Zoroastrians with fire temples in al-Hind and in al-Sindh. There is evidence of individual Parsis residing in Sindh in the tenth and twelfth centuries, but the current modern community is thought to date from British arrival in Sindh. Moreover, for the Iranians, the harbours of Gujarat lay on the maritime routes that complemented the overland Silk Road and there were extensive trade relations between the two regions. The contact between Iranians and Indians was already well established even prior to the Common Era, and both the Puranas and the \"Mahabharata\" use the term \"Parasikas\" to refer to the peoples west of the Indus River.\n\n\"Parsi legends regarding their ancestors' migration to India depict a beleaguered band of religious refugees escaping the new rule post the Muslim conquests in order to preserve their ancient faith.\" ) However, while Parsi settlements definitely arose along the western coast of the Indian subcontinent following the Arab conquest of Iran, it is not possible to state with certainty that these migrations occurred as a result of religious persecution against Zoroastrians. If the \"traditional\" 8th century date (as deduced from the \"Qissa\") is considered valid, it must be assumed \"that the migration began while Zoroastrianism was still the predominant religion in Iran [and] economic factors predominated the initial decision to migrate.\" This would have been particularly the case if – as the \"Qissa\" suggests – the first Parsis originally came from the north-east (i.e. Central Asia) and had previously been dependent on Silk Road trade . Even so, in the 17th century, Henry Lord, a chaplain with the British East India Company, noted that the Parsis came to India seeking \"liberty of conscience\" but simultaneously arrived as \"merchantmen bound for the shores of India, in course of trade and merchandise.\" The fact that Muslims charged non-Muslims higher duties when trading from Muslim-held ports may be interpreted to be a form of religious persecution, but this being the only reason to migrate appears unlikely.\n\nThe \"Qissa\" has little to say about the events that followed the establishment of Sanjan, and restricts itself to a brief note on the establishment of the \"Fire of Victory\" (Middle Persian: \"Atash Bahram\") at Sanjan and its subsequent move to Navsari. According to Dhalla, the next several centuries were \"full of hardships\" (\"sic\") before Zoroastrianism \"gained a real foothold in India and secured for its adherents some means of livelihood in this new country of their adoption\".\n\nTwo centuries after their landing, the Parsis began to settle in other parts of Gujarat, which led to \"difficulties in defining the limits of priestly jurisdiction.\" These problems were resolved by 1290 through the division of Gujarat into five \"panthak\"s (districts), each under the jurisdiction of one priestly family and their descendants. (Continuing disputes regarding jurisdiction over the \"Atash Bahram\" led to the fire being moved to Udvada in 1742, where today jurisdiction is shared in rotation among the five \"panthak\" families.)\n\nInscriptions at the Kanheri Caves near Mumbai suggest that at least until the early 11th century, Middle Persian was still the literary language of the hereditary Zoroastrian priesthood. Nonetheless, aside from the \"Qissa\" and the Kanheri inscriptions, there is little evidence of the Parsis until the 12th and 13th century, when \"masterly\" Sanskrit translations and transcriptions of the Avesta and its commentaries began to be prepared. From these translations Dhalla infers that \"religious studies were prosecuted with great zeal at this period\" and that the command of Middle Persian and Sanskrit among the clerics \"was of a superior order\"..\n\nFrom the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Zoroastrian priests of Gujarat sent (in all) twenty-two requests for religious guidance to their co-religionists in Iran, presumably because they considered the Iranian Zoroastrians \"better informed on religious matters than themselves, and must have preserved the old-time tradition more faithfully than they themselves did\" . These transmissions and their replies – assiduously preserved by the community as the \"rivayat\"s (epistles) – span the years 1478–1766 and deal with both religious and social subjects. From a superficial 21st century point of view, some of these \"ithoter\" (\"questions\") are remarkably trivial – for instance, \"Rivayat\" 376: whether ink prepared by a non-Zoroastrian is suitable for copying Avestan language texts – but they provide a discerning insight into the fears and anxieties of the early modern Zoroastrians. Thus, the question of the ink is symptomatic of the fear of assimilation and the loss of identity, a theme that dominates the questions posed and continues to be an issue into the 21st century. So also the question of conversion of \"Juddin\"s (non-Zoroastrians) to Zoroastrianism, to which the reply (R237, R238) was: acceptable, even meritorious.\n\nNonetheless, \"the precarious condition in which they lived for a considerable period made it impracticable for them to keep up their former proselytizing zeal. The instinctive fear of disintegration and absorption in the vast multitudes among whom they lived created in them a spirit of exclusiveness and a strong desire to preserve the racial characteristics and distinctive features of their community. Living in an atmosphere surcharged with the Hindu caste system, they felt that their own safety lay in encircling their fold by rigid caste barriers\" . Even so, at some point (possibly shortly after their arrival in India), the Zoroastrians – perhaps determining that the social stratification that they had brought with them was unsustainable in the small community – did away with all but the hereditary priesthood (called the \"asronih\" in Sassanid Iran). The remaining estates – the \"(r)atheshtarih\" (nobility, soldiers, and civil servants), \"vastaryoshih\" (farmers and herdsmen), \"hutokshih\" (artisans and labourers) – were folded into an all-comprehensive class today known as the \"behdini\" (\"followers of \"daena\"\", for which \"good religion\" is one translation). This change would have far reaching consequences. For one, it opened the gene pool to some extent since until that time inter-class marriages were exceedingly rare (this would continue to be a problem for the priesthood until the 20th century). For another, it did away with the boundaries along occupational lines, a factor that would endear the Parsis to the 18th- and 19th-century British colonial authorities who had little patience for the unpredictable complications of the Hindu caste system (such as when a clerk from one caste would not deal with a clerk from another).\n\nFollowing the commercial treaty in the early 17th century between Mughal emperor Jahangir and James I of England, the East India Company obtained the exclusive rights to reside and build factories in Surat and other areas. Many Parsis, who until then had been living in farming communities throughout Gujarat, moved to the English-run settlements to take the new jobs offered. In 1668 the English East India Company leased the Seven Islands of Bombay from Charles II of England. The company found the deep harbour on the east coast of the islands to be ideal for setting up their first port in the sub-continent, and in 1687 they transferred their headquarters from Surat to the fledgling settlement. The Parsis followed and soon began to occupy posts of trust in connection with government and public works.\n\nWhere literacy had previously been the exclusive domain of the priesthood, in the era of the British Raj the British schools in India provided the new Parsi youth with the means not only to learn to read and write but also to be educated in the greater sense of the term and become familiar with the quirks of the British establishment. These capabilities were enormously useful to Parsis since they allowed them to \"represent themselves as being like the British,\" which they did \"more diligently and effectively than perhaps any other South Asian community\". While the British saw the other Indians \"as passive, ignorant, irrational, outwardly submissive but inwardly guileful\", the Parsis were seen to have the traits that the colonial authorities tended to ascribe to themselves. Johan Albrecht de Mandelslo (1638) saw them as \"diligent\", \"conscientious\", and \"skillful\" in their mercantile pursuits. Similar observations would be made by James Mackintosh, Recorder of Bombay from 1804 to 1811, who noted that \"the Parsees are a small remnant of one of the mightiest nations of the ancient world, who, flying from persecution into India, were for many ages lost in obscurity and poverty, till at length they met a just government under which they speedily rose to be one of the most popular mercantile bodies in Asia\".\n\nOne of these was an enterprising agent named Rustom Maneck. In 1702, Maneck, who had probably already amassed a fortune under the Dutch and Portuguese, was appointed the first broker to the East India Company (acquiring the name \"Seth\" in the process), and in the following years \"he and his Parsi associates widened the occupational and financial horizons of the larger Parsi community\". Thus, by the mid-18th century, the brokerage houses of the Bombay Presidency were almost all in Parsi hands. As James Forbes, the Collector of Broach (now Bharuch), would note in his \"Oriental Memoirs\" (1770): \"many of the principal merchants and owners of ships at Bombay and Surat are Parsees.\" \"Active, robust, prudent and persevering, they now form a very valuable part of the Company's subjects on the western shores of Hindustan where they are highly esteemed\".In the 18th century, Parsis with their skills in ship building and trade greatly benefited with trade between India and China.The trade was mainly in timber, silk, cotton and opium. For example Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy acquired most of his wealth through trade in cotton and opium Gradually certain families \"acquired wealth and prominence (Sorabji, Modi, Cama, Wadia, Jeejeebhoy, Readymoney, Dadyseth, Petit, Patel, Mehta, Allbless, Tata, etc.), many of which would be noted for their participation in the public life of the city, and for their various educational, industrial, and charitable enterprises.\").\n\nThrough his largesse, Maneck helped establish the infrastructure that was necessary for the Parsis to set themselves up in Bombay and in doing so \"established Bombay as the primary centre of Parsi habitation and work in the 1720s\". Following the political and economic isolation of Surat in the 1720s and 1730s that resulted from troubles between the (remnant) Mughal authorities and the increasingly dominant Marathas, a number of Parsi families from Surat migrated to the new city. While in 1700 \"fewer than a handful of individuals appear as merchants in any records; by mid-century, Parsis engaged in commerce constituted one of important commercial groups in Bombay\". Maneck's generosity is incidentally also the first documented instance of Parsi philanthropy. In 1689, Anglican chaplain John Ovington reported that in Surat the family \"assist the poor and are ready to provide for the sustenance and comfort of such as want it. Their universal kindness, either employing such as are ready and able to work, or bestowing a seasonable bounteous charity to such as are infirm and miserable, leave no man destitute of relief, nor suffer a beggar in all their tribe\".\nIn 1728 Rustom's eldest son Naoroz (later Naorojee) founded the \"Bombay Parsi Panchayat\" (in the sense of an instrument for self-governance and not in the sense of the trust it is today) to assist newly arriving Parsis in religious, social, legal and financial matters. Using their vast resources, the Maneck Seth family gave their time, energy and not inconsiderable financial resources to the Parsi community, with the result that by the mid-18th century, the Panchayat was the accepted means for Parsis to cope with the exigencies of urban life and the recognized instrument for regulating the affairs of the community. Nonetheless, by 1838 the Panchayat was under attack for impropriety and nepotism. In 1855 the \"Bombay Times\" noted that the Panchayat was utterly without the moral or legal authority to enforce its statutes (the \"Bundobusts\" or codes of conduct) and the council soon ceased to be considered representative of the community. In the wake of a July 1856 ruling by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that it had no jurisdiction over the Parsis in matters of marriage and divorce, the Panchayat was reduced to little more than a Government-recognized \"Parsi Matrimonial Court\". Although the Panchayat would eventually be reestablished as the administrator of community property, it ultimately ceased to be an instrument for self-governance.\n\nAt about the same time as the role of the Panchayat was declining, a number of other institutions arose that would replace the Panchayat's role in contributing to the sense of social cohesiveness that the community desperately sought. By the mid-19th century, the Parsis were keenly aware that their numbers were declining and saw education as a possible solution to the problem. In 1842 Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy established the Parsi Benevolent Fund with the aim of improving, through education, the condition of the impoverished Parsis still living in Surat and its environs. In 1849 the Parsis established their first school (co-educational, which was a novelty at the time, but would soon be split into separate schools for boys and girls) and the education movement quickened. The number of Parsi schools multiplied, but other schools and colleges were also freely attended. Accompanied by better education and social cohesiveness, the community's sense of distinctiveness grew, and in 1854 Dinshaw Maneckji Petit founded the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund with the aim of improving conditions for his less fortunate co-religionists in Iran. The fund succeeded in convincing a number of Iranian Zoroastrians to emigrate to India (where they are known today as Iranis) and the efforts of its emissary Maneckji Limji Hataria may have been instrumental in obtaining a remission of the jizya for their co-religionists in 1882.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the Parsis had emerged as \"the foremost people in India in matters educational, industrial, and social. They came in the vanguard of progress, amassed vast fortunes, and munificently gave away large sums in charity\". By the close of the 19th century, the total number of Parsis in colonial India was 85,397, of which 48,507 lived in Bombay, constituting 6% of the total population of the city (Census, 1881). This would be the last time that the Parsis would be considered a numerically significant minority in the city.\n\nNonetheless, the legacy of the 19th century was a sense of self-awareness as a community. The typically Parsi cultural symbols of the 17th and 18th centuries such as language (a Parsi variant of Gujarati), arts, crafts, and sartorial habits developed into Parsi theatre, literature, newspapers, magazines, and schools. The Parsis now ran community medical centres, ambulance corps, Scouting troops, clubs, and Masonic Lodges. They had their own charitable foundations, housing estates, legal institutions, courts, and governance. They were no longer weavers and petty merchants, but now were established and ran banks, mills, heavy industry, shipyards, and shipping companies. Moreover, even while maintaining their own cultural identity they did not fail to recognize themselves as nationally Indian, as Dadabhai Naoroji, the first Asian to occupy a seat in the British Parliament would note: \"Whether I am a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a Parsi, a Christian, or of any other creed, I am above all an Indian. Our country is India; our nationality is Indian\".\n\nThe main components of Zoroastrianism as practiced by the Parsi community are the concepts of purity and pollution (nasu), initiation (navjot), daily prayers, worship at Fire Temples, marriage, funerals, and general worship.\n\nThe balance between good and evil is correlated to the idea of purity and pollution. Purity is held to be of the very essence of godliness. Pollution's very point is to destroy purity through the death of a human. In order to adhere to purity it is the duty of Parsis to continue to preserve purity within their body as God created them. A Zoroastrian priest spends his entire life dedicated to following a holy life.\n\nZoroastrians are not initiated by infant baptism. Normally, a child is initiated into the faith when he or she is old enough to choose to enter into the faith. The initiation begins with a ritual bath, then a spiritual cleansing prayer; the child changes into white pajama pants, a shawl, and a small cap. Following introductory prayers, the child is given the sacred items that are associated with Zoroastrianism: a sacred shirt and cord, sudre, and kusti. The child then faces the main priest and fire is brought in to represent God. Once the priest finishes with the prayers, the child’s initiation is complete and he or she is now a part of the community and religion.\n\nMarriage is very important to the members of the Parsi community, believing that, in order to continue the expansion of God’s kingdom, they must procreate. Up until the mid-19th century child marriages were common even though the idea of child marriage was not part of the religious doctrine. Consequently, when social reform started happening in India, the Parsi community discontinued the practice. There are, however, rising problems over the availability of brides. More and more women in the Parsi community are becoming well educated and are therefore either delaying marriage or not partaking at all. Women within the Parsi community in India are ninety-seven percent literate; forty-two percent have completed high school or college and twenty-nine percent have an occupation in which they earn a substantial amount of money. The wedding ceremony begins much like the initiation with a cleansing bath. The bride and groom then travel to the wedding in florally decorated cars. The priests from both families facilitate the wedding. The couple begins by facing one another with a sheet to block their view of one another. Wool is passed over the two seven times to bind them together. The two are then supposed to throw rice to their partner symbolizing dominance. The religious element comes in next when the two sit side by side to face the priest.\n\nThe pollution that is associated with death has to be handled carefully. A separate part of the home is designated to house the corpse for funeral proceedings before being taken away. The priest comes to say prayers that are for the cleansing of sins and to affirm the faith of the deceased. Fire is brought to the room and prayers are begun. The body is washed and inserted clean within a sudre and kusti. The ceremony then begins, and a circle is drawn around the body into which only the bearers may enter. As they proceed to the cemetery they walk in pairs and are connected by white fabric. A dog is essential in the funeral process because it is able to see death. The body is taken to the tower of death where the vultures feed on it. Once the bones are bleached by the sun they are pushed into the circular opening in the center. The mourning process is four days long, and rather than creating graves for the dead, charities are established in honor of the person.\n\nZoroastrian festivals were originally held outside in the open air; temples were not common until later. Most of the temples were built by wealthy Parsis who needed centers that housed purity. As stated before, fire is considered to represent the presence of Ahura Mazda, and there are two distinct differences for the types of fire for the different temples. The first type of temple is the Atash Behram, which is the highest level of fire. The fire is prepared for an entire year before it can be installed, and once it is, it is cared for to the highest possible degree. There are only eight such temples located within India. The second type of fire temple is called a Dar-i Mihr, and the preparation process is not as intense. There are about 160 of these located throughout India.\n\n\"This section contains information specific to the Parsi calendar. For information on the calendar used by the Zoroastrians for religious purposes, including details on its history and its variations, see Zoroastrian calendar.\"\n\nUntil about the 12th century, all Zoroastrians followed the same 365-day religious calendar, which had remained largely unmodified since the calendar reforms of Ardashir I (\"r.\" 226-241 AD). Since that calendar did not compensate for the fractional days that go to make up a full solar year, with time it was no longer accordant with the seasons.\n\nSometime between 1125 and 1250 (\"cf.\" ), the Parsis inserted an embolismic month to level out the accumulating fractional days. However, the Parsis were the only Zoroastrians to do so (and did it only once), with the result that, from then on, the calendar in use by the Parsis and the calendar in use by Zoroastrians elsewhere diverged by a matter of thirty days. The calendars still had the same name, \"Shahenshahi\" (imperial), presumably because none were aware that the calendars were no longer the same.\n\nIn 1745 the Parsis in and around Surat switched to the \"Kadmi\" or \"Kadimi\" calendar on the recommendation of their priests who were convinced that the calendar in use in the ancient homeland must be correct. Moreover, they denigrated the \"Shahenshahi\" calendar as being \"royalist\".\n\nIn 1906 attempts to bring the two factions together resulted in the introduction of a third calendar based on an 11th-century Seljuk model: the \"Fasili\", or \"Fasli\", calendar had leap days intercalated every four years and it had a New Year's day that fell on the day of the vernal equinox. Although it was the only calendar always in harmony with the seasons, most members of the Parsi community rejected it on the grounds that it was not in accord with the injunctions expressed in Zoroastrian tradition (\"Dēnkard\" 3.419).\n\nToday the majority of Parsis are adherents of the Parsi version of the \"Shahenshahi\" calendar although the \"Kadmi\" calendar does have its adherents among the Parsi communities of Surat and Bharuch. The \"Fasli\" calendar does not have a significant following among Parsis, but, by virtue of being compatible with the \"Bastani\" calendar (an Iranian development with the same salient features as the \"Fasli\" calendar), it is predominant among the Zoroastrians of Iran.\n\nSince some of the Avesta prayers contain references to the names of the months, and some other prayers are used only at specific times of the year, the issue of which calendar is \"correct\" also has theological ramifications.\n\nTo further complicate matters, in the late 18th century (or early 19th century) a highly influential head-priest and staunch proponent of the \"Kadmi\" calendar, Phiroze Kaus Dastur of the Dadyseth Atash-Behram in Bombay, became convinced that the pronunciation of prayers as recited by visitors from Iran was correct, while the pronunciation as used by the Parsis was not. He accordingly went on to alter some (but not all) of the prayers, which in due course came to be accepted by all adherents of the \"Kadmi\" calendar as the more ancient (and thus presumably correct). However, scholars of Avestan language and linguistics attribute the difference in pronunciation to a vowel-shift that occurred only in Iran and that the Iranian pronunciation as adopted by the \"Kadmi\"s is actually more recent than the pronunciation used by the non-\"Kadmi\" Parsis.\n\nThe calendar disputes were not always purely academic, either. In the 1780s, emotions over the controversy ran so high that violence occasionally erupted. In 1783 a \"Shahenshahi\" resident of Bharuch named Homaji Jamshedji was sentenced to death for kicking a young \"Kadmi\" woman and so causing her to miscarry.\n\nOf the eight Atash-Behrams (the highest grade of fire temple) in India, three follow the \"Kadmi\" pronunciation and calendar, the other five are \"Shahenshahi\". The \"Fassali\"s do not have their own Atash-Behram.\n\nThe \"Ilm-e-Kshnoom\" ('science of ecstasy', or 'science of bliss') is a school of Parsi-Zoroastrian philosophy based on a mystic and esoteric, rather than literal, interpretation of religious texts. According to adherents of the sect, they are followers of the Zoroastrian faith as preserved by a clan of 2000 individuals called the \"Saheb-e-Dilan\" ('Masters of the Heart') who are said to live in complete isolation in the mountainous recesses of the Caucasus (alternatively, in the Alborz range, around Mount Damavand).\n\nThere are few obvious indications that a Parsi might be a follower of the Kshnoom. Although their \"Kusti\" prayers are very similar to those used by the \"Fassali\"s, like the rest of the Parsi community the followers of Kshnoom are divided with respect to which calendar they observe. There are also other minor differences in their recitation of the liturgy, such as repetition of some sections of the longer prayers. Nonetheless, the Kshnoom are extremely conservative in their ideology and prefer isolation even with respect to other Parsis.\n\nThe largest community of followers of the Kshnoom lives in Jogeshwari, a suburb of Bombay, where they have their own fire temple (Behramshah Nowroji Shroff Daremeher), their own housing colony (Behram Baug) and their own newspaper (\"Parsi Pukar\"). There is a smaller concentration of adherents in Surat, where the sect was founded in the last decades of the 19th century.\n\nIt has been traditional, in Mumbai and Karachi at least, for dead Parsis to be taken to the Towers of Silence where the corpses are quickly eaten by the city's vultures. The reason given for this practice is that earth, fire, and water are considered sacred elements which should not be defiled by the dead. Therefore, burial and cremation have always been prohibited in Parsi culture. However, in modern day Mumbai and Karachi the population of vultures has drastically reduced due to extensive urbanization and the unintended consequence of treating humans and livestock with antibiotics, and the anti-inflammatory diclofenac, both of which harm vultures. This issue led to the Indian vulture crisis, which led to the ban of the drug diclofenac. As a result, the bodies of the deceased are taking much longer to decompose. Solar panels have been installed in the Towers of Silence to speed up the decomposition process, but this has been only partially successful especially during monsoons. In Peshawar a Parsi graveyard was established in the late 19th century, which still exists; this cemetery is unique as there is no Tower of Silence. Nevertheless, the majority of Parsis still use the traditional method of disposing off their loved ones and consider this as the last act of charity by the deceased on earth.\n\nThe Tower of Silence in Mumbai is located at Malabar Hill. In Karachi, the Tower of Silence is located in Parsi Colony, near the Chanesar Goth and Mehmoodabad localities.\n\nThe genetic studies of Parsis of Pakistan show sharp contrast between genetic data obtained from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosome DNA (Y-DNA), different from most populations. Historical records suggests that they had moved from Iran to Gujarat, India and then to Mumbai and Karachi, Pakistan. According to Y-DNA, they resemble the Iranian population, which supports historical records. When the mtDNA pool is compared to Iranians and Gujaratis (their putative parental populations), it contrasted Y-DNA data. About 60% of their maternal gene pool originates from South Asian haplogroups, which is just 7% in Iranians. Parsis have a high frequency of haplogroup M (55%), similar to Indians, which is just 1.7% in combined Iranian sample. The studies suggest sharp contrast between the maternal and paternal component of Parsis. Due to high diversity in Y-DNA and mtDNA lineages, the strong drift effect is unlikely even though they had a small population. The studies suggest a male-mediated migration of Parsi ancestors from Iran to Gujarat where they admixed with the local female population during initial settlements, which ultimately resulted in loss of Iranian mtDNA.\n\nA study published in \"Genome Biology\" based on high density SNP data has shown that the Parsis are genetically closer to Iranian and Caucasus populations than to their South Asian neighbours. They also share the highest number of haplotypes with present-day Iranians; the admixture of the Parsis with Indian populations was estimated have occurred approximately 1,200 years ago. It is also found that Parsis are genetically closer to Neolithic Iranians than to modern Iranians who had recently received the genes from the Near East.\n\nParsis have been shown to have unusually high rates of breast cancer bladder cancer, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe Parsis have made considerable contributions to the history and development of India, all the more remarkable considering their small numbers. As the maxim \"Parsi, thy name is charity\" alludes to, their most prominent contribution is their philanthropy.\n\nAlthough their people's name Parsi comes from the Persian-language word for a Persian person, in Sanskrit the term means \"one who gives alms\". Mahatma Gandhi would note in a much misquoted statement, \"I am proud of my country, India, for having produced the splendid Zoroastrian stock, in numbers beneath contempt, but in charity and philanthropy perhaps unequaled and certainly unsurpassed.\"\n\nSeveral landmarks in Mumbai are named after Parsis, including Nariman Point. The Malabar Hill in Mumbai, is a home to several prominent Parsis. Parsis prominent in the Indian independence movement include Pherozeshah Mehta, Dadabhai Naoroji, and Bhikaiji Cama.\n\nParticularly notable Parsis in the fields of science and industry include physicist Homi J. Bhabha, Homi N. Sethna, J. R. D. Tata and Jamsetji Tata, regarded as the \"Father of Indian Industry\". Karachi-based businessman Byram Dinshawji Avari is the founder of Avari Group of companies, and is a twice Asian Games gold medalist. The families Godrej, Tata, Petit, Cowasjee and Wadia are important industrial Parsi families.\n\nOther Parsi businessmen are Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, J. R. D. Tata, Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, Ness Wadia, Neville Wadia, Jehangir Wadia and Nusli Wadiaall of them related through marriage to Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan. Mohammad Ali Jinnah's wife Rattanbai Petit, was born into two of the Parsi PetitTata families, and their daughter Dina Jinnah was married to Parsi industrialist Neville Wadia, the scion of the Wadia family. The husband of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and son-in-law of Jawaharlal Nehru, Feroze Gandhi, was a Parsi with ancestral roots in Bharuch.\n\nThe Parsi community has given India several distinguished military officers. Field Marshal Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw, Military Cross, the architect of India's victory in the 1971 war, was the first officer of the Indian Army to be appointed a Field Marshal. Admiral Jal Cursetji was the first Parsi to be appointed Chief of the Naval Staff of the Indian Navy. Air Marshal Aspy Engineer served as India's second Chief of Air Staff, post independence, and Air Chief Marshal. Fali Homi Major served as the 18th Chief of Air Staff. Vice Admiral RF Contractor served as the 17th Chief of the Indian Coast Guard. Lieutenant Colonel Ardeshir Burjorji Tarapore was killed in action in the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war and was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military award for gallantry in action. Lieutenant General FN Bilimoria was a senior officer of the Indian Army and the father of Lord Karan Bilimoria, founder of the Cobra Beer company.\n\nParticularly notable Parsis in other areas of achievement include cricketers Farokh Engineer and Polly Umrigar, rock star Freddie Mercury, composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji and conductor Zubin Mehta; cultural studies theorist Homi K. Bhabha; screenwriter and photographer Sooni Taraporevala; authors Rohinton Mistry, Firdaus Kanga, Bapsi Sidhwa, Ardashir Vakil and Pakistani investigative journalist Ardeshir Cowasjee; actor Boman Irani; educator Jamshed Bharucha, India's first woman photo-journalist Homai Vyarawalla; Actresses Nina Wadia, Sanaya Irani and Persis Khambatta are Parsi who appear primarily in Bollywood films and television serials. Naxalite leader and intellectual Kobad Ghandy is a Parsi. Dorab Patel was Pakistan's first Parsi Supreme Court Justice. Fali S Nariman is a constitutional expert and noted jurist. Rattana Pestonji was a Parsi living in Thailand who helped develop Thai cinema. Firdaus Kharas is a Parsi humanitarian and activist who has helped pioneer the use of animation in social entrepreneurship.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49895", "title": "Piety", "text": "Piety\n\nIn spiritual terminology, piety is a virtue that may include religious devotion, spirituality, or a mixture of both. A common element in most conceptions of piety is humility.\n\nThe word piety comes from the Latin word \"pietas\", the noun form of the adjective \"pius\" (which means \"devout\" or \"dutiful\"). \n\n\"Pietas\" in traditional Latin usage expressed a complex, highly valued Roman virtue; a man with \"pietas\" respected his responsibilities to gods, country, parents, and kin. In its strictest sense it was the sort of love a son ought to have for his father. Aeneas's consistent epithet in Virgil and other Latin authors is \"pius\", a term that connotes reverence toward the gods and familial dutifulness. At the fall of Troy, Aeneas carries to safety his father, the lame Anchises, and the Lares and Penates, the statues of the household gods.\n\nIn addressing whether children have an obligation to provide support for their parents, Aquinas quotes, Cicero, \"...\"piety gives both duty and homage\": \"duty\" referring to service, and \"homage\" to reverence or honor.\" Filial piety is central to Confucian ethics.\n\nIn Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, and Anglicanism, piety is one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. \"It engenders in the soul a filial respect for God, a generous love toward him, and an affectionate obedience that wants to do what he commands because it loves the one who commands.\" \n\nPiety belongs to the virtue of Religion, which the concordant judgment of theologians put among the moral virtues, as a part of the cardinal virtue Justice, since by it one tenders to God what is due to him.\n\nPope Francis described piety as recognizing “our belonging to God, our deep bond with him, a relationship that gives meaning to our whole life and keeps us resolute, in communion with him, even during the most difficult and troubled moments” in life.\n\n"}

Usually the expression is used to invoke a precautionary principle or to suggest that someone should refrain from a controversial action.\n\nPhilip Ball wrote an article saying that \"playing God\" is a meaningless and dangerous cliché, in the sense that it has no basis in theology. Instead it was adopted by theocons from the 1931 film version of \"Frankenstein\", and has been used by journalists to refer to things with which they do not agree. The idea is further discussed in Practical Ethics, a blog linked to Oxford University.\n\n"}

The oldest indigenous religion of Korea is Korean shamanism, which has been passed down from prehistory to the present. Buddhism was introduced to Korea from China during the Three Kingdoms era in the 4th century, and the religion flourished until the Joseon Dynasty, when Korean Confucianism became the state religion. During the Late Joseon Dynasty, in the 19th century, Christianity began to gain a foothold in Korea. While both Christianity and Buddhism would play important roles in the resistance to the Japanese occupation of Korea in the first half of the 20th century, only about 4% of Koreans were members of a religious organization in 1940.\n\nSince the division of Korea into two sovereign states in 1945—North Korea and South Korea—religious life in the two countries has diverged, shaped by different political structures. Religion in South Korea has been characterized by a rise of Christianity and a revival of Buddhism, though the majority of South Koreans have no religious affiliation. Religion in North Korea is characterized by state atheism in which freedom of religion is nonexistent. \"Juche\" ideology, which promotes the North Korean cult of personality, is regarded by experts as the national religion.\n\n"}
{"id": "214954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214954", "title": "Religion in ancient Rome", "text": "Religion in ancient Rome\n\nReligion in Ancient Rome includes the ancestral ethnic religion of the city of Rome that the Romans used to define themselves as a people, as well as the religious practices of peoples brought under Roman rule, in so far as they became widely followed in Rome and Italy. The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success as a world power to their collective piety \"(pietas)\" in maintaining good relations with the gods. The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored, a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists.\n\nThe presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks (\"interpretatio graeca\"), adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art, as the Etruscans had. Etruscan religion was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of augury. According to legends, most of Rome's religious institutions could be traced to its founders, particularly Numa Pompilius, the Sabine second king of Rome, who negotiated directly with the gods. This archaic religion was the foundation of the \"mos maiorum\", \"the way of the ancestors\" or simply \"tradition\", viewed as central to Roman identity.\nRoman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of \"do ut des\", \"I give that you might give\". Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs. Even the most skeptical among Rome's intellectual elite such as Cicero, who was an augur, saw religion as a source of social order. As the Roman Empire expanded, migrants to the capital brought their local cults, many of which became popular among Italians. Christianity was in the end the most successful of these, and in 380 became the official state religion.\n\nFor ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life. Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances. Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported Vestals, who tended Rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until disbanded under Christian domination.\n\nThe priesthoods of public religion were held by members of the elite classes. There was no principle analogous to separation of church and state in ancient Rome. During the Roman Republic (509–27 BC), the same men who were elected public officials might also serve as augurs and pontiffs. Priests married, raised families, and led politically active lives. Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul.\n\nThe augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order, thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny. The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods, especially Jupiter, who embodied just rule. As a result of the Punic Wars (264–146 BC), when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power, many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success.\n\nAs the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world, their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them, since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability. One way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage, building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods.\n\nBy the height of the Empire, numerous international deities were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote provinces, among them Cybele, Isis, Epona, and gods of solar monism such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. Foreign religions increasingly attracted devotees among Romans, who increasingly had ancestry from elsewhere in the Empire. Imported mystery religions, which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife, were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one's family rites and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of \"magic\", conspiratorial (\"coniuratio\"), or subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity, as with the senate's efforts to restrict the Bacchanals in 186 BC. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing monotheistic systems. The monotheistic rigor of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions, but sometimes to intractable conflict. For example, religious disputes helped cause the First Jewish–Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt.\n\nIn the wake of the Republic's collapse, state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors. Augustus, the first Roman emperor, justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform. Public vows formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the well-being of the emperor. So-called \"emperor worship\" expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman veneration of the ancestral dead and of the \"Genius\", the divine tutelary of every individual. The Imperial cult became one of the major ways in which Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire. Rejection of the state religion was tantamount to treason. This was the context for Rome's conflict with Christianity, which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and novel \"superstitio\". Ultimately, Roman polytheism was brought to an end with the adoption of Christianity as the official religion of the empire.\n\nThe Roman mythological tradition is particularly rich in historical myths, or legends, concerning the foundation and rise of the city. These narratives focus on human actors, with only occasional intervention from deities but a pervasive sense of divinely ordered destiny. For Rome's earliest period, history and myth are difficult to distinguish.\n\nAccording to mythology, Rome had a semi-divine ancestor in the Trojan refugee Aeneas, son of Venus, who was said to have established the nucleus of Roman religion when he brought the Palladium, Lares and Penates from Troy to Italy. These objects were believed in historical times to remain in the keeping of the Vestals, Rome's female priesthood. Aeneas, according to classical authors, had been given refuge by King Evander, a Greek exile from Arcadia, to whom were attributed other religious foundations: he established the \"Ara Maxima\", \"Greatest Altar\", to Hercules at the site that would become the Forum Boarium, and, so the legend went, he was the first to celebrate the Lupercalia, an archaic festival in February that was celebrated as late as the 5th century of the Christian era.\n\nThe myth of a Trojan founding with Greek influence was reconciled through an elaborate genealogy (the Latin kings of Alba Longa) with the well-known legend of Rome's founding by Romulus and Remus. The most common version of the twins' story displays several aspects of hero myth. Their mother, Rhea Silvia, had been ordered by her uncle the king to remain a virgin, in order to preserve the throne he had usurped from her father. Through divine intervention, the rightful line was restored when Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god Mars. She gave birth to twins, who were duly exposed by order of the king but saved through a series of miraculous events.\n\nRomulus and Remus regained their grandfather's throne and set out to build a new city, consulting with the gods through augury, a characteristic religious institution of Rome that is portrayed as existing from earliest times. The brothers quarrel while building the city walls, and Romulus kills Remus, an act that is sometimes seen as sacrificial. Fratricide thus became an integral part of Rome's founding myth.\n\nRomulus was credited with several religious institutions. He founded the Consualia festival, inviting the neighbouring Sabines to participate; the ensuing rape of the Sabine women by Romulus's men further embedded both violence and cultural assimilation in Rome's myth of origins. As a successful general, Romulus is also supposed to have founded Rome's first temple to Jupiter Feretrius and offered the \"spolia opima\", the prime spoils taken in war, in the celebration of the first Roman triumph. Spared a mortal's death, Romulus was mysteriously spirited away and deified.\nHis Sabine successor Numa was pious and peaceable, and credited with numerous political and religious foundations, including the first Roman calendar; the priesthoods of the Salii, flamines, and Vestals; the cults of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus; and the Temple of Janus, whose doors stayed open in times of war but in Numa's time remained closed. After Numa's death, the doors to the Temple of Janus were supposed to have remained open until the reign of Augustus.\n\nEach of Rome's legendary or semi-legendary kings was associated with one or more religious institutions still known to the later Republic. Tullus Hostilius and Ancus Marcius instituted the fetial priests. The first \"outsider\" Etruscan king, Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, founded a Capitoline temple to the triad Jupiter, Juno and Minerva which served as the model for the highest official cult throughout the Roman world. The benevolent, divinely fathered Servius Tullius established the Latin League, its Aventine Temple to Diana, and the Compitalia to mark his social reforms. Servius Tullius was murdered and succeeded by the arrogant Tarquinius Superbus, whose expulsion marked the beginning of Rome as a republic with annually elected magistrates.\n\nRoman historians regarded the essentials of Republican religion as complete by the end of Numa's reign, and confirmed as right and lawful by the Senate and people of Rome: the sacred topography of the city, its monuments and temples, the histories of Rome's leading families, and oral and ritual traditions. According to Cicero, the Romans considered themselves the most religious of all peoples, and their rise to dominance was proof they received divine favor in return.\n\nRome offers no native creation myth, and little mythography to explain the character of its deities, their mutual relationships or their interactions with the human world, but Roman theology acknowledged that \"di immortales\" (immortal gods) ruled all realms of the heavens and earth. There were gods of the upper heavens, gods of the underworld and a myriad of lesser deities between. Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them, but none were intrinsically, irredeemably foreign or alien. The political, cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad, inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults. At different times and in different places, the sphere of influence, character and functions of a divine being could expand, overlap with those of others, and be redefined as Roman. Change was embedded within existing traditions.\n\nSeveral versions of a semi-official, structured pantheon were developed during the political, social and religious instability of the Late Republican era. Jupiter, the most powerful of all gods and \"the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested\", consistently personified the divine authority of Rome's highest offices, internal organization and external relations. During the archaic and early Republican eras, he shared his temple, some aspects of cult and several divine characteristics with Mars and Quirinus, who were later replaced by Juno and Minerva. A conceptual tendency toward triads may be indicated by the later agricultural or plebeian triad of Ceres, Liber and Libera, and by some of the complementary threefold deity-groupings of Imperial cult. Other major and minor deities could be single, coupled, or linked retrospectively through myths of divine marriage and sexual adventure. These later Roman pantheistic hierarchies are part literary and mythographic, part philosophical creations, and often Greek in origin. The Hellenization of Latin literature and culture supplied literary and artistic models for reinterpreting Roman deities in light of the Greek Olympians, and promoted a sense that the two cultures had a shared heritage.\n\nThe impressive, costly, and centralised rites to the deities of the Roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual's domestic and personal deities, the patron divinities of Rome's various neighborhoods and communities, and the often idiosyncratic blends of official, unofficial, local and personal cults that characterised lawful Roman religion. In this spirit, a provincial Roman citizen who made the long journey from Bordeaux to Italy to consult the Sibyl at Tibur did not neglect his devotion to his own goddess from home:\n\"I wander, never ceasing to pass through the whole world, but I am first and foremost a faithful worshiper of Onuava. I am at the ends of the earth, but the distance cannot tempt me to make my vows to another goddess. Love of the truth brought me to Tibur, but Onuava's favorable powers came with me. Thus, divine mother, far from my home-land, exiled in Italy, I address my vows and prayers to you no less.\"\nThroughout the life of Rome, a numerous array of \"mystery cults\" appeared. These cults were generally founded upon legends or sacred stories, such as the tale of Orpheus. Several had a basis in other cultures, such as the Cult of Isis, and Egyptian goddess. The members generally knew the stories were pure legend, but they provided a model for their followers to obey. These cults had often expensive, long, or trying initiation processes, which differed between cults, but prospective members were promised with a path to a better atmosphere and an atmosphere that fostered social bonds, known as \"mystai\". These bonds were generated due to the fact that most of these cults regularly practiced common meals among members, dances, ceremonies and rituals, and the aforementioned initiations. The focus of the cult, such as the focus on Orpheus among Orphic cults, did not necessarily dictate the theology of its members. The legendary tales were meant to guide members, but the deities involved tended to be a lesser focus. Mystery cults were present and generally accepted throughout much of Rome and provided a unique theological experience for their members. \n\nRoman calendars show roughly forty annual religious festivals. Some lasted several days, others a single day or less: sacred days (\"dies fasti\") outnumbered \"non-sacred\" days (\"dies nefasti\"). A comparison of surviving Roman religious calendars suggests that official festivals were organized according to broad seasonal groups that allowed for different local traditions. Some of the most ancient and popular festivals incorporated \"ludi\" (\"games\", such as chariot races and theatrical performances), with examples including those held at Palestrina in honour of Fortuna Primigenia during Compitalia, and the Ludi Romani in honour of Liber. Other festivals may have required only the presence and rites of their priests and acolytes, or particular groups, such as women at the Bona Dea rites.\n\nOther public festivals were not required by the calendar, but occasioned by events. The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows, though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event. During the late Republic, the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display, and the \"ludi\" attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests. Under the Principate, all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control: the most lavish were subsidised by emperors, and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office. Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries. Others, such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era (\"saeculum\"), became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity. That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part.\n\nThe meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even Rome's intellectual elite, but the more obscure they were, the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation – a fact lost neither on Augustus in his program of religious reform, which often cloaked autocratic innovation, nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era, Ovid. In his \"Fasti\", a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June, Ovid presents a unique look at Roman antiquarian lore, popular customs, and religious practice that is by turns imaginative, entertaining, high-minded, and scurrilous; not a priestly account, despite the speaker's pose as a \"vates\" or inspired poet-prophet, but a work of description, imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the Saturnalia, Consualia, and feast of Anna Perenna on the Ides of March, where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people. But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events, indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances. In the later Empire under Christian rule, the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the Roman calendar, alongside at least some of the traditional festivals.\n\nPublic religious ceremonies of the official Roman religion took place outdoors, and not within the temple building. Some ceremonies were processions that started at, visited, or ended with a temple or shrine, where a ritual object might be stored and brought out for use, or where an offering would be deposited. Sacrifices, chiefly of animals, would take place at an open-air altar within the \"templum\" or precinct, often to the side of the steps leading up to the raised portico. The main room \"(cella)\" inside a temple housed the cult image of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated, and often a small altar for incense or libations. It might also display art works looted in war and rededicated to the gods. It is not clear how accessible the interiors of temples were to the general public.\n\nThe Latin word \"templum\" originally referred not to the temple building itself, but to a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually through augury: \"The architecture of the ancient Romans was, from first to last, an art of shaping space around ritual.\" The Roman architect Vitruvius always uses the word \"templum\" to refer to this sacred precinct, and the more common Latin words \"aedes\", \"delubrum\", or \"fanum\" for a temple or shrine as a building. The ruins of temples are among the most visible monuments of ancient Roman culture.\n\nTemple buildings and shrines within the city commemorated significant political settlements in its development: the Aventine Temple of Diana supposedly marked the founding of the Latin League under Servius Tullius. Many temples in the Republican era were built as the fulfillment of a vow made by a general in exchange for a victory.\n\nAll sacrifices and offerings required an accompanying prayer to be effective. Pliny the Elder declared that \"a sacrifice without prayer is thought to be useless and not a proper consultation of the gods.\" Prayer by itself, however, had independent power. The spoken word was thus the single most potent religious action, and knowledge of the correct verbal formulas the key to efficacy. Accurate naming was vital for tapping into the desired powers of the deity invoked, hence the proliferation of cult epithets among Roman deities. Public prayers (\"prex\") were offered loudly and clearly by a priest on behalf of the community. Public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly; a mistake might require that the action, or even the entire festival, be repeated from the start. The historian Livy reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the Latin festival forgot to include the \"Roman people\" among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer; the festival had to be started over. Even private prayer by an individual was formulaic, a recitation rather than a personal expression, though selected by the individual for a particular purpose or occasion.\n\nOaths—sworn for the purposes of business, clientage and service, patronage and protection, state office, treaty and loyalty—appealed to the witness and sanction of deities. Refusal to swear a lawful oath \"(sacramentum)\" and breaking a sworn oath carried much the same penalty: both repudiated the fundamental bonds between the human and divine. A \"votum\" or vow was a promise made to a deity, usually an offer of sacrifices or a votive offering in exchange for benefits received.\n\nIn Latin, the word \"sacrificium\" means the performance of an act that renders something \"sacer\", sacred. Sacrifice reinforced the powers and attributes of divine beings, and inclined them to render benefits in return (the principle of \"do ut des\").\n\nOfferings to household deities were part of daily life. Lares might be offered spelt wheat and grain-garlands, grapes and first fruits in due season, honey cakes and honeycombs, wine and incense, food that fell to the floor during any family meal, or at their Compitalia festival, honey-cakes and a pig on behalf of the community. Their supposed underworld relatives, the malicious and vagrant Lemures, might be placated with midnight offerings of black beans and spring water.\n\nThe most potent offering was animal sacrifice, typically of domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep and pigs. Each was the best specimen of its kind, cleansed, clad in sacrificial regalia and garlanded; the horns of oxen might be gilded. Sacrifice sought the harmonisation of the earthly and divine, so the victim must seem willing to offer its own life on behalf of the community; it must remain calm and be quickly and cleanly dispatched.\n\nSacrifice to deities of the heavens (\"di superi\", \"gods above\") was performed in daylight, and under the public gaze. Deities of the upper heavens required white, infertile victims of their own sex: Juno a white heifer (possibly a white cow); Jupiter a white, castrated ox (\"bos mas\") for the annual oath-taking by the consuls. \"Di superi\" with strong connections to the earth, such as Mars, Janus, Neptune and various \"genii\" – including the Emperor's – were offered fertile victims. After the sacrifice, a banquet was held; in state cults, the images of honoured deities took pride of place on banqueting couches and by means of the sacrificial fire consumed their proper portion (\"exta\", the innards). Rome's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own.\nChthonic gods such as Dis pater, the \"di inferi\" (\"gods below\"), and the collective shades of the departed \"(di Manes)\" were given dark, fertile victims in nighttime rituals. Animal sacrifice usually took the form of a holocaust or burnt offering, and there was no shared banquet, as \"the living cannot share a meal with the dead\". Ceres and other underworld goddesses of fruitfulness were sometimes offered pregnant female animals; Tellus was given a pregnant cow at the Fordicidia festival. Color had a general symbolic value for sacrifices. Demigods and heroes, who belonged to the heavens and the underworld, were sometimes given black-and-white victims. Robigo (or Robigus) was given red dogs and libations of red wine at the Robigalia for the protection of crops from blight and red mildew.\nA sacrifice might be made in thanksgiving or as an expiation of a sacrilege or potential sacrilege (\"piaculum\");\na \"piaculum\" might also be offered as a sort of advance payment; the Arval Brethren, for instance, offered a \"piaculum\" before entering their sacred grove with an iron implement, which was forbidden, as well as after.\nThe pig was a common victim for a \"piaculum\".\n\nThe same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it, and so might be placated in advance. Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey, or encounters with banditry, piracy and shipwreck, with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return. In times of great crisis, the Senate could decree collective public rites, in which Rome's citizens, including women and children, moved in procession from one temple to the next, supplicating the gods.\n\nExtraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see \"ver sacrum\"), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The \"contract\" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.\nThe \"exta\" were the entrails of a sacrificed animal, comprising in Cicero's enumeration the gall bladder (\"fel\"), liver (\"iecur\"), heart (\"cor\"), and lungs (\"pulmones\"). The \"exta\" were exposed for litatio (divine approval) as part of Roman liturgy, but were \"read\" in the context of the \"disciplina Etrusca\". As a product of Roman sacrifice, the \"exta\" and blood are reserved for the gods, while the meat \"(viscera)\" is shared among human beings in a communal meal. The \"exta\" of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot (\"olla\" or \"aula\"), while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers. When the deity's portion was cooked, it was sprinkled with \"mola salsa\" (ritually prepared salted flour) and wine, then placed in the fire on the altar for the offering; the technical verb for this action was \"porricere\".\n\nHuman sacrifice in ancient Rome was rare but documented. After the Roman defeat at Cannae two Gauls and two Greeks were buried under the Forum Boarium, in a stone chamber \"which had on a previous occasion [228 BC] also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings\". Livy avoids the word \"sacrifice\" in connection with this bloodless human life-offering; Plutarch does not. The rite was apparently repeated in 113 BC, preparatory to an invasion of Gaul. Its religious dimensions and purpose remain uncertain.\n\nIn the early stages of the First Punic War (264 BC) the first known Roman gladiatorial \"munus\" was held, described as a funeral blood-rite to the \"manes\" of a Roman military aristocrat. The gladiator \"munus\" was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice, probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose. Even so, the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods, and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the \"di manes\" or other gods. The event was therefore a \"sacrificium\" in the strict sense of the term, and Christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice.\n\nThe small woollen dolls called \"Maniae\", hung on the Compitalia shrines, were thought a symbolic replacement for child-sacrifice to Mania, as Mother of the Lares. The Junii took credit for its abolition by their ancestor L. Junius Brutus, traditionally Rome's Republican founder and first consul. Political or military executions were sometimes conducted in such a way that they evoked human sacrifice, whether deliberately or in the perception of witnesses; Marcus Marius Gratidianus was a gruesome example.\n\nOfficially, human sacrifice was obnoxious \"to the laws of gods and men\". The practice was a mark of the barbarians, attributed to Rome's traditional enemies such as the Carthaginians and Gauls. Rome banned it on several occasions under extreme penalty. A law passed in 81 BC characterised human sacrifice as murder committed for magical purposes. Pliny saw the ending of human sacrifice conducted by the druids as a positive consequence of the conquest of Gaul and Britain. Despite an empire-wide ban under Hadrian, human sacrifice may have continued covertly in North Africa and elsewhere.\n\nThe \"mos maiorum\" established the dynastic authority and obligations of the citizen-\"paterfamilias\" (\"the father of the family\" or the \"owner of the family estate\"). He had priestly duties to his \"lares\", domestic \"penates\", ancestral \"Genius\" and any other deities with whom he or his family held an interdependent relationship. His own dependents, who included his slaves and freedmen, owed cult to his \"Genius\".\n\n\"Genius\" was the essential spirit and generative power – depicted as a serpent or as a perennial youth, often winged – within an individual and their clan (gens (pl. \"gentes\"). A \"paterfamilias\" could confer his name, a measure of his \"genius\" and a role in his household rites, obligations and honours upon those he fathered or adopted. His freed slaves owed him similar obligations.\n\nA \"pater familias\" was the senior priest of his household. He offered daily cult to his \"lares\" and \"penates\", and to his \"di parentes\"/\"divi parentes\" at his domestic shrines and in the fires of the household hearth. His wife (\"mater familias\") was responsible for the household's cult to Vesta. In rural estates, bailiffs seem to have been responsible for at least some of the household shrines (lararia) and their deities. Household cults had state counterparts. In Vergil's \"Aeneid\", Aeneas brought the Trojan cult of the \"lares\" and \"penates\" from Troy, along with the Palladium which was later installed in the temple of Vesta.\n\nRoman \"religio\" (religion) was an everyday and vital affair, a cornerstone of the \"mos maiorum\", Roman tradition or ancestral custom.\nCare for the gods, the very meaning of \"religio\", had therefore to go through life, and one might thus understand why Cicero wrote that religion was \"necessary\". Religious behavior – \"pietas\" in Latin, \"eusebeia\" in Greek – belonged to action and not to contemplation. Consequently religious acts took place wherever the faithful were: in houses, boroughs, associations, cities, military camps, cemeteries, in the country, on boats. 'When pious travelers happen to pass by a sacred grove or a cult place on their way, they are used to make a vow, or a fruit offering, or to sit down for a while' (Apuleius, \"Florides\" 1.1).\nReligious law centered on the ritualised system of honours and sacrifice that brought divine blessings, according to the principle \"do ut des\" (\"I give, that you might give\"). Proper, respectful \"religio\" brought social harmony and prosperity. Religious neglect was a form of atheism: impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were \"vitia\" (impious errors). Excessive devotion, fearful grovelling to deities and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were \"superstitio\". Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger (\"ira deorum\") and therefore harm the State. The official deities of the state were identified with its lawful offices and institutions, and Romans of every class were expected to honour the beneficence and protection of mortal and divine superiors. Participation in public rites showed a personal commitment to their community and its values.\n\nOfficial cults were state funded as a \"matter of public interest\" (\"res publica\"). Non-official but lawful cults were funded by private individuals for the benefit of their own communities. The difference between public and private cult is often unclear. Individuals or collegial associations could offer funds and cult to state deities. The public Vestals prepared ritual substances for use in public and private cults, and held the state-funded (thus public) opening ceremony for the Parentalia festival, which was otherwise a private rite to household ancestors. Some rites of the \"domus\" (household) were held in public places but were legally defined as \"privata\" in part or whole. All cults were ultimately subject to the approval and regulation of the censor and \"pontifices\".\n\nRome had no separate priestly caste or class. The highest authority within a community usually sponsored its cults and sacrifices, officiated as its priest and promoted its assistants and acolytes. Specialists from the religious colleges and professionals such as \"haruspices\" and oracles were available for consultation. In household cult, the \"paterfamilias\" functioned as priest, and members of his \"familia\" as acolytes and assistants. Public cults required greater knowledge and expertise. The earliest public priesthoods were probably the \"flamines\" (the singular is \"flamen\"), attributed to king Numa: the major \"flamines\", dedicated to Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus, were traditionally drawn from patrician families. Twelve lesser \"flamines\" were each dedicated to a single deity, whose archaic nature is indicated by the relative obscurity of some. \"Flamines\" were constrained by the requirements of ritual purity; Jupiter's \"flamen\" in particular had virtually no simultaneous capacity for a political or military career.\n\nIn the Regal era, a \"rex sacrorum\" (king of the sacred rites) supervised regal and state rites in conjunction with the king (\"rex\") or in his absence, and announced the public festivals. He had little or no civil authority. With the abolition of monarchy, the collegial power and influence of the Republican \"pontifices\" increased. By the late Republican era, the flamines were supervised by the pontifical \"collegia\". The \"rex sacrorum\" had become a relatively obscure priesthood with an entirely symbolic title: his religious duties still included the daily, ritual announcement of festivals and priestly duties within two or three of the latter but his most important priestly role – the supervision of the Vestals and their rites – fell to the more politically powerful and influential \"pontifex maximus\".\n\nPublic priests were appointed by the \"collegia\". Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain.\n\nPriesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the \"Cursus honorum\", permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia \"seviri\" offered a high local profile, and opportunities in local politics; and therefore business.\n\nDuring the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was the first step in a provincial \"cursus honorum\". In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren, once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. Every 3 January they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year, provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time.\n\nThe Vestals were a public priesthood of six women devoted to the cultivation of Vesta, goddess of the hearth of the Roman state and its vital flame. A girl chosen to be a Vestal achieved unique religious distinction, public status and privileges, and could exercise considerable political influence. Upon entering her office, a Vestal was emancipated from her father's authority. In archaic Roman society, these priestesses were the only women not required to be under the legal guardianship of a man, instead answering directly to the Pontifex Maximus.\n\nA Vestal's dress represented her status outside the usual categories that defined Roman women, with elements of both virgin bride and daughter, and Roman matron and wife. Unlike male priests, Vestals were freed of the traditional obligations of marrying and producing children, and were required to take a vow of chastity that was strictly enforced: a Vestal polluted by the loss of her chastity while in office was buried alive. Thus the exceptional honor accorded a Vestal was religious rather than personal or social; her privileges required her to be fully devoted to the performance of her duties, which were considered essential to the security of Rome.\n\nThe Vestals embody the profound connection between domestic cult and the religious life of the community. Any householder could rekindle their own household fire from Vesta's flame. The Vestals cared for the Lares and Penates of the state that were the equivalent of those enshrined in each home. Besides their own festival of Vestalia, they participated directly in the rites of Parilia, Parentalia and Fordicidia. Indirectly, they played a role in every official sacrifice; among their duties was the preparation of the \"mola salsa\", the salted flour that was sprinkled on every sacrificial victim as part of its immolation.\n\nOne mythological tradition held that the mother of Romulus and Remus was a Vestal virgin of royal blood. A tale of miraculous birth also attended on Servius Tullius, sixth king of Rome, son of a virgin slave-girl impregnated by a disembodied phallus arising mysteriously on the royal hearth; the story was connected to the \"fascinus\" that was among the cult objects under the guardianship of the Vestals.\n\nAugustus' religious reformations raised the funding and public profile of the Vestals. They were given high-status seating at games and theatres. The emperor Claudius appointed them as priestesses to the cult of the deified Livia, wife of Augustus. They seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century, after political power within the Empire had shifted to the Christians. When the Christian emperor Gratian refused the office of \"pontifex maximus\", he took steps toward the dissolution of the order. His successor Theodosius I extinguished Vesta's sacred fire and vacated her temple.\n\nPublic religion took place within a sacred precinct that had been marked out ritually by an augur. The original meaning of the Latin word \"templum\" was this sacred space, and only later referred to a building. Rome itself was an intrinsically sacred space; its ancient boundary \"(pomerium)\" had been marked by Romulus himself with oxen and plough; what lay within was the earthly home and protectorate of the gods of the state. In Rome, the central references for the establishment of an augural \"templum\" appear to have been the Via Sacra (Sacred Way) and the pomerium. Magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed official acts through an augur, who read the divine will through observations made within the \"templum\" before, during and after an act of sacrifice.\n\nDivine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice, errant rites (\"vitium\") or an unacceptable plan of action. If an unfavourable sign was given, the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen, consult with his augural colleagues, or abandon the project. Magistrates could use their right of augury (\"ius augurum\") to adjourn and overturn the process of law, but were obliged to base their decision on the augur's observations and advice. For Cicero, himself an augur, this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Late Republic. By his time (mid 1st century BC) augury was supervised by the college of \"pontifices\", whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the \"cursus honorum\".\n\nHaruspicy was also used in public cult, under the supervision of the augur or presiding magistrate. The haruspices divined the will of the gods through examination of entrails after sacrifice, particularly the liver. They also interpreted omens, prodigies and portents, and formulated their expiation. Most Roman authors describe haruspicy as an ancient, ethnically Etruscan \"outsider\" religious profession, separate from Rome's internal and largely unpaid priestly hierarchy, essential but never quite respectable. During the mid-to-late Republic, the reformist Gaius Gracchus, the populist politician-general Gaius Marius and his antagonist Sulla, and the \"notorious Verres\" justified their very different policies by the divinely inspired utterances of private diviners. The senate and armies used the public haruspices: at some time during the late Republic, the Senate decreed that Roman boys of noble family be sent to Etruria for training in haruspicy and divination. Being of independent means, they would be better motivated to maintain a pure, religious practice for the public good. The motives of private haruspices – especially females – and their clients were officially suspect: none of this seems to have troubled Marius, who employed a Syrian prophetess.\n\nOmens observed within or from a divine augural templum – especially the flight of birds – were sent by the gods in response to official queries. A magistrate with \"ius augurium\" (the right of augury) could declare the suspension of all official business for the day (\"obnuntiato\") if he deemed the omens unfavourable. Conversely, an apparently negative omen could be re-interpreted as positive, or deliberately blocked from sight.\n\nProdigies were transgressions in the natural, predictable order of the cosmos – signs of divine anger that portended conflict and misfortune. The Senate decided whether a reported prodigy was false, or genuine and in the public interest, in which case it was referred to the public priests, augurs and haruspices for ritual expiation. In 207 BC, during one of the Punic Wars' worst crises, the Senate dealt with an unprecedented number of confirmed prodigies whose expiation would have involved \"at least twenty days\" of dedicated rites.\n\nLivy presents these as signs of widespread failure in Roman \"religio\". The major prodigies included the spontaneous combustion of weapons, the apparent shrinking of the sun's disc, two moons in a daylit sky, a cosmic battle between sun and moon, a rain of red-hot stones, a bloody sweat on statues, and blood in fountains and on ears of corn: all were expiated by sacrifice of \"greater victims\". The minor prodigies were less warlike but equally unnatural; sheep become goats, a hen become a cock (and vice versa) – these were expiated with \"lesser victims\". The discovery of an androgynous four-year-old child was expiated by its drowning and the holy procession of 27 virgins to the temple of Juno Regina, singing a hymn to avert disaster: a lightning strike during the hymn rehearsals required further expiation. Religious restitution is proved only by Rome's victory.\n\nIn the wider context of Graeco-Roman religious culture, Rome's earliest reported portents and prodigies stand out as atypically dire. Whereas for Romans, a comet presaged misfortune, for Greeks it might equally signal a divine or exceptionally fortunate birth. In the late Republic, a daytime comet at the murdered Julius Caesar's funeral games confirmed his deification; a discernible Greek influence on Roman interpretation.\n\nRoman beliefs about an afterlife varied, and are known mostly for the educated elite who expressed their views in terms of their chosen philosophy. The traditional care of the dead, however, and the perpetuation after death of their status in life were part of the most archaic practices of Roman religion. Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased, an expectation of afterlife and their association with the gods. As Roman society developed, its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead, and more on monumental endowments to the community, such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name. Persons of low or negligible status might receive simple burial, with such grave goods as relatives could afford.\nFuneral and commemorative rites varied according to wealth, status and religious context. In Cicero's time, the better-off sacrificed a sow at the funeral pyre before cremation. The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre, Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar, and the family at the site of the cremation. For the less well-off, inhumation with \"a libation of wine, incense, and fruit or crops was sufficient\". Ceres functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead: the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living. The ashes (or body) were entombed or buried. On the eighth day of mourning, the family offered further sacrifice, this time on the ground; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed entirely into the underworld. They had become one of the \"di Manes\", who were collectively celebrated and appeased at the Parentalia, a multi-day festival of remembrance in February.\n\nA standard Roman funerary inscription is \"Dis Manibus\" (to the Manes-gods). Regional variations include its Greek equivalent, \"theoîs katachthoníois\" and Lugdunum's commonplace but mysterious \"dedicated under the trowel\" \"(sub ascia dedicare)\".\n\nIn the later Imperial era, the burial and commemorative practises of Christian and non-Christians overlapped. Tombs were shared by Christian and non-Christian family members, and the traditional funeral rites and feast of \"novemdialis\" found a part-match in the Christian \"Constitutio Apostolica\". The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued; St Augustine (following St Ambrose) feared that this invited the \"drunken\" practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor. Christians attended Parentalia and its accompanying Feralia and Caristia in sufficient numbers for the Council of Tours to forbid them in AD 567. Other funerary and commemorative practices were very different. Traditional Roman practice spurned the corpse as a ritual pollution; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life. The Christian Church fostered the veneration of saintly relics, and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to \"new life\".\n\nMilitary success was achieved through a combination of personal and collective \"virtus\" (roughly, \"manly virtue\") and the divine will: lack of \"virtus\", civic or private negligence in \"religio\" and the growth of \"superstitio\" provoked divine wrath and led to military disaster. Military success was the touchstone of a special relationship with the gods, and to Jupiter Capitolinus in particular; triumphal generals were dressed as Jupiter, and laid their victor's laurels at his feet.\n\nRoman commanders offered vows to be fulfilled after success in battle or siege; and further vows to expiate their failures. Camillus promised Veii's goddess Juno a temple in Rome as incentive for her desertion \"(evocatio)\", conquered the city in her name, brought her cult statue to Rome \"with miraculous ease\" and dedicated a temple to her on the Aventine Hill.\n\nRoman camps followed a standard pattern for defense and religious ritual; in effect they were Rome in miniature. The commander's headquarters stood at the centre; he took the auspices on a dais in front. A small building behind housed the legionary standards, the divine images used in religious rites and in the Imperial era, the image of the ruling emperor. In one camp, this shrine is even called Capitolium. The most important camp-offering appears to have been the \"suovetaurilia\" performed before a major, set battle. A ram, a boar and a bull were ritually garlanded, led around the outer perimeter of the camp (a \"lustratio exercitus\") and in through a gate, then sacrificed: Trajan's column shows three such events from his Dacian wars. The perimeter procession and sacrifice suggest the entire camp as a divine \"templum\"; all within are purified and protected.\nEach camp had its own religious personnel; standard bearers, priestly officers and their assistants, including a haruspex, and housekeepers of shrines and images. A senior magistrate-commander (sometimes even a consul) headed it, his chain of subordinates ran it and a ferocious system of training and discipline ensured that every citizen-soldier knew his duty. As in Rome, whatever gods he served in his own time seem to have been his own business; legionary forts and \"vici\" included shrines to household gods, personal deities and deities otherwise unknown.\n\nFrom the earliest Imperial era, citizen legionaries and provincial auxiliaries gave cult to the emperor and his \"familia\" on Imperial accessions, anniversaries and their renewal of annual vows. They celebrated Rome's official festivals \"in absentia\", and had the official triads appropriate to their function – in the Empire, Jupiter, Victoria and Concordia were typical. By the early Severan era, the military also offered cult to the Imperial \"divi\", the current emperor's \"numen\", \"genius\" and \"domus\" (or \"familia\"), and special cult to the Empress as \"mother of the camp\". The near ubiquitous legionary shrines to Mithras of the later Imperial era were not part of official cult until Mithras was absorbed into Solar and Stoic Monism as a focus of military \"concordia\" and Imperial loyalty.\nThe \"devotio\" was the most extreme offering a Roman general could make, promising to offer his own life in battle along with the enemy as an offering to the underworld gods. Livy offers a detailed account of the \"devotio\" carried out by Decius Mus; family tradition maintained that his son and grandson, all bearing the same name, also devoted themselves. Before the battle, Decius is granted a prescient dream that reveals his fate. When he offers sacrifice, the victim's liver appears \"damaged where it refers to his own fortunes\". Otherwise, the haruspex tells him, the sacrifice is entirely acceptable to the gods. In a prayer recorded by Livy, Decius commits himself and the enemy to the \"dii Manes\" and Tellus, charges alone and headlong into the enemy ranks, and is killed; his action cleanses the sacrificial offering. Had he failed to die, his sacrificial offering would have been tainted and therefore void, with possibly disastrous consequences. The act of \"devotio\" is a link between military ethics and those of the Roman gladiator.\n\nThe efforts of military commanders to channel the divine will were on occasion less successful. In the early days of Rome's war against Carthage, the commander Publius Claudius Pulcher (consul 249 BC) launched a sea campaign \"though the sacred chickens would not eat when he took the auspices\". In defiance of the omen, he threw them into the sea, \"saying that they might drink, since they would not eat. He was defeated, and on being bidden by the senate to appoint a dictator, he appointed his messenger Glycias, as if again making a jest of his country's peril.\" His impiety not only lost the battle but ruined his career.\n\nRoman women were present at most festivals and cult observances. Some rituals specifically required the presence of women, but their active participation was limited. As a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice, the central rite of most major public ceremonies. In addition to the public priesthood of the Vestals, some cult practices were reserved for women only. The rites of the Bona Dea excluded men entirely. Because women enter the public record less frequently than men, their religious practices are less known, and even family cults were headed by the \"paterfamilias\". A host of deities, however, are associated with motherhood. Juno, Diana, Lucina, and specialized divine attendants presided over the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby at a time when the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent.\n\nLiterary sources vary in their depiction of women's religiosity: some represent women as paragons of Roman virtue and devotion, but also inclined by temperament to self-indulgent religious enthusiasms, novelties and the seductions of \"superstitio\".\n\nExcessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance were \"superstitio\", in the sense of \"doing or believing more than was necessary\", to which women and foreigners were considered particularly prone. The boundaries between \"religio\" and \"superstitio\" are perhaps indefinite. The famous tirade of Lucretius, the Epicurean rationalist, against what is usually translated as \"superstition\" was in fact aimed at excessive \"religio\". Roman religion was based on knowledge rather than faith, but \"superstitio\" was viewed as an \"inappropriate desire for knowledge\"; in effect, an abuse of \"religio\".\n\nIn the everyday world, many individuals sought to divine the future, influence it through magic, or seek vengeance with help from \"private\" diviners. The state-sanctioned taking of auspices was a form of public divination with the intent of ascertaining the will of the gods, not foretelling the future. Secretive consultations between private diviners and their clients were thus suspect. So were divinatory techniques such as astrology when used for illicit, subversive or magical purposes. Astrologers and magicians were officially expelled from Rome at various times, notably in 139 BC and 33 BC. In 16 BC Tiberius expelled them under extreme penalty because an astrologer had predicted his death. \"Egyptian rites\" were particularly suspect: Augustus banned them within the \"pomerium\" to doubtful effect; Tiberius repeated and extended the ban with extreme force in AD 19. Despite several Imperial bans, magic and astrology persisted among all social classes. In the late 1st century AD, Tacitus observed that astrologers \"would always be banned and always retained at Rome\".\n\nIn the Graeco-Roman world, practitioners of magic were known as \"magi\" (singular \"magus\"), a \"foreign\" title of Persian priests. Apuleius, defending himself against accusations of casting magic spells, defined the magician as \"in popular tradition \"(more vulgari)\"... someone who, because of his community of speech with the immortal gods, has an incredible power of spells (\"vi cantaminum\") for everything he wishes to.\" Pliny the Elder offers a thoroughly skeptical \"History of magical arts\" from their supposed Persian origins to Nero's vast and futile expenditure on research into magical practices in an attempt to control the gods. Philostratus takes pains to point out that the celebrated Apollonius of Tyana was definitely not a \"magus\", \"despite his special knowledge of the future, his miraculous cures, and his ability to vanish into thin air\".\n\nLucan depicts Sextus Pompeius, the doomed son of Pompey the Great, as convinced \"the gods of heaven knew too little\" and awaiting the Battle of Pharsalus by consulting with the Thessalian witch Erichtho, who practices necromancy and inhabits deserted graves, feeding on rotting corpses. Erichtho, it is said, can arrest \"the rotation of the heavens and the flow of rivers\" and make \"austere old men blaze with illicit passions\". She and her clients are portrayed as undermining the natural order of gods, mankind and destiny. A female foreigner from Thessaly, notorious for witchcraft, Erichtho is the stereotypical witch of Latin literature, along with Horace's Canidia.\nThe Twelve Tables forbade any harmful incantation (\"malum carmen\", or 'noisome metrical charm'); this included the \"charming of crops from one field to another\" (\"excantatio frugum\") and any rite that sought harm or death to others. Chthonic deities functioned at the margins of Rome's divine and human communities; although sometimes the recipients of public rites, these were conducted outside the sacred boundary of the \"pomerium\". Individuals seeking their aid did so away from the public gaze, during the hours of darkness. Burial grounds and isolated crossroads were among the likely portals. The barrier between private religious practices and \"magic\" is permeable, and Ovid gives a vivid account of rites at the fringes of the public Feralia festival that are indistinguishable from magic: an old woman squats among a circle of younger women, sews up a fish-head, smears it with pitch, then pierces and roasts it to \"bind hostile tongues to silence\". By this she invokes Tacita, the \"Silent One\" of the underworld.\n\nArchaeology confirms the widespread use of binding spells (\"defixiones\"), magical papyri and so-called \"voodoo dolls\" from a very early era. Around 250 \"defixiones\" have been recovered just from Roman Britain, in both urban and rural settings. Some seek straightforward, usually gruesome revenge, often for a lover's offense or rejection. Others appeal for divine redress of wrongs, in terms familiar to any Roman magistrate, and promise a portion of the value (usually small) of lost or stolen property in return for its restoration. None of these \"defixiones\" seem produced by, or on behalf of the elite, who had more immediate recourse to human law and justice. Similar traditions existed throughout the empire, persisting until around the 7th century AD, well into the Christian era.\n\nRome's government, politics and religion were dominated by an educated, male, landowning military aristocracy. Approximately half Rome's population were slave or free non-citizens. Most others were plebeians, the lowest class of Roman citizens. Less than a quarter of adult males had voting rights; far fewer could actually exercise them. Women had no vote. However, all official business was conducted under the divine gaze and auspices, in the name of the senate and people of Rome. \"In a very real sense the senate was the caretaker of the Romans’ relationship with the divine, just as it was the caretaker of their relationship with other humans\".\n\nThe links between religious and political life were vital to Rome's internal governance, diplomacy and development from kingdom, to Republic and to Empire. Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite: kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices. In the early Republic, as presumably in the regal era, plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office, and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge. They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office, public priesthood, and knowledge of civil and religious law. The senate appointed Camillus as dictator to handle the emergency; he negotiated a settlement, and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to Concordia. The religious calendars and laws were eventually made public. Plebeian tribunes were appointed, with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate. In principle, the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians. In reality, the patrician and to a lesser extent, plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond.\n\nWhile the new plebeian nobility made social, political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves, their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults. During the Punic crisis, popular cult to Dionysus emerged from southern Italy; Dionysus was equated with Father Liber, the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms, and with Roman Bacchus. Official consternation at these enthusiastic, unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion, and was followed by ferocious suppression. Much later, a statue of Marsyas, the \"silen\" of Dionysus flayed by Apollo, became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus' censorship. Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo; but his settlement appealed to all classes. Where loyalty was implicit, no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced; Liber's festival continued.\n\nThe Augustan settlement built upon a cultural shift in Roman society. In the middle Republican era, even Scipio's tentative hints that he might be Jupiter's special protege sat ill with his colleagues. Politicians of the later Republic were less equivocal; both Sulla and Pompey claimed special relationships with Venus. Julius Caesar went further; he claimed her as his ancestress, and thus an intimate source of divine inspiration for his personal character and policies. In 63 BC, his appointment as \"pontifex maximus\" \"signaled his emergence as a major player in Roman politics\". Likewise, political candidates could sponsor temples, priesthoods and the immensely popular, spectacular public \"ludi\" and \"munera\" whose provision became increasingly indispensable to the factional politics of the Late Republic. Under the principate, such opportunities were limited by law; priestly and political power were consolidated in the person of the princeps (\"first citizen\").\n\n\"Because of you we are living, because of you we can travel the seas, because of you we enjoy liberty and wealth.\" \"A thanksgiving prayer offered in Naples' harbour to the princeps Augustus, on his return from Alexandria in 14 AD, shortly before his death.\"\nBy the end of the regal period Rome had developed into a city-state, with a large plebeian, artisan class excluded from the old patrician \"gentes\" and from the state priesthoods. The city had commercial and political treaties with its neighbours; according to tradition, Rome's Etruscan connections established a temple to Minerva on the predominantly plebeian Aventine; she became part of a new Capitoline triad of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, installed in a Capitoline temple, built in an Etruscan style and dedicated in a new September festival, \"Epulum Jovis\". These are supposedly the first Roman deities whose images were adorned, as if noble guests, at their own inaugural banquet.\n\nRome's diplomatic agreement with its neighbours of Latium confirmed the Latin league and brought the cult of Diana from Aricia to the Aventine. and established on the Aventine in the \"commune Latinorum Dianae templum\": At about the same time, the temple of Jupiter Latiaris was built on the Alban mount, its stylistic resemblance to the new Capitoline temple pointing to Rome's inclusive hegemony. Rome's affinity to the Latins allowed two Latin cults within the \"pomoerium\": and the cult to Hercules at the \"ara maxima\" in the Forum Boarium was established through commercial connections with Tibur. and the Tusculan cult of Castor as the patron of cavalry found a home close to the Forum Romanum: Juno Sospita and Juno Regina were brought from Italy, and Fortuna Primigenia from Praeneste. In 217, Venus was brought from Sicily and installed in a temple on the Capitoline hill.\n\nThe disasters of the early part of Rome's second Punic War were attributed, in Livy's account, to a growth of superstitious cults, errors in augury and the neglect of Rome's traditional gods, whose anger was expressed directly in Rome's defeat at Cannae (216 BC). The Sibilline books were consulted. They recommended a general vowing of the \"ver sacrum\" and in the following year, the burial of two Greeks and two Gauls; not the first or the last of its kind, according to Livy.\n\nThe introduction of new or equivalent deities coincided with Rome's most significant aggressive and defensive military forays. In 206 BC the Sibylline books commended the introduction of cult to the aniconic Magna Mater (Great Mother) from Pessinus, installed on the Palatine in 191 BC. The mystery cult to Bacchus followed; it was suppressed as subversive and unruly by decree of the Senate in 186 BC. Greek deities were brought within the sacred pomerium: temples were dedicated to Juventas (Hebe) in 191 BC, Diana (Artemis) in 179 BC, Mars (Ares) in 138 BC), and to Bona Dea, equivalent to Fauna, the female counterpart of the rural Faunus, supplemented by the Greek goddess Damia. Further Greek influences on cult images and types represented the Roman Penates as forms of the Greek Dioscuri. The military-political adventurers of the Later Republic introduced the Phrygian goddess Ma (identified with Roman Bellona, the Egyptian mystery-goddess Isis and Persian Mithras.)\nThe spread of Greek literature, mythology and philosophy offered Roman poets and antiquarians a model for the interpretation of Rome's festivals and rituals, and the embellishment of its mythology. Ennius translated the work of Graeco-Sicilian Euhemerus, who explained the genesis of the gods as apotheosized mortals. In the last century of the Republic, Epicurean and particularly Stoic interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite, most of whom held – or had held – high office and traditional Roman priesthoods; notably, Scaevola and the polymath Varro. For Varro – well versed in Euhemerus' theory – popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction; what the people believed was not itself the truth, but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with. Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives, the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals, and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult.\n\nJust as Rome itself claimed the favour of the gods, so did some individual Romans. In the mid-to-late Republican era, and probably much earlier, many of Rome's leading clans acknowledged a divine or semi-divine ancestor and laid personal claim to their favour and cult, along with a share of their divinity. Most notably in the very late Republic, the Julii claimed Venus Genetrix as ancestor; this would be one of many foundations for the Imperial cult. The claim was further elaborated and justified in Vergil's poetic, Imperial vision of the past.\nIn the late Republic, the Marian reforms lowered an existing property bar on conscription and increased the efficiency of Rome's armies but made them available as instruments of political ambition and factional conflict. The consequent civil wars led to changes at every level of Roman society. Augustus' principate established peace and subtly transformed Rome's religious life – or, in the new ideology of Empire, restored it (see below).\n\nTowards the end of the Republic, religious and political offices became more closely intertwined; the office of \"pontifex maximus\" became a \"de facto\" consular prerogative. Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of \"pontifex maximus\"; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient Arvales, his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality. Augustus obtained the \"pax deorum\", maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors.\n\nThe Roman Empire expanded to include different peoples and cultures; in principle, Rome followed the same inclusionist policies that had recognised Latin, Etruscan and other Italian peoples, cults and deities as Roman. Those who acknowledged Rome's hegemony retained their own cult and religious calendars, independent of Roman religious law. Newly municipal Sabratha built a Capitolium near its existing temple to Liber Pater and Serapis. Autonomy and concord were official policy, but new foundations by Roman citizens or their Romanised allies were likely to follow Roman cultic models. Romanisation offered distinct political and practical advantages, especially to local elites. All the known effigies from the 2nd century AD forum at Cuicul are of emperors or Concordia. By the middle of the 1st century AD, Gaulish Vertault seems to have abandoned its native cultic sacrifice of horses and dogs in favour of a newly established, Romanised cult nearby: by the end of that century, Sabratha's so-called tophet was no longer in use. Colonial and later Imperial provincial dedications to Rome's Capitoline Triad were a logical choice, not a centralised legal requirement. Major cult centres to \"non-Roman\" deities continued to prosper: notable examples include the magnificent Alexandrian Serapium, the temple of Aesculapeus at Pergamum and Apollo's sacred wood at Antioch.\n\nThe overall scarcity of evidence for smaller or local cults does not always imply their neglect; votive inscriptions are inconsistently scattered throughout Rome's geography and history. Inscribed dedications were an expensive public declaration, one to be expected within the Graeco-Roman cultural ambit but by no means universal. Innumerable smaller, personal or more secretive cults would have persisted and left no trace.\n\nMilitary settlement within the empire and at its borders broadened the context of \"Romanitas\". Rome's citizen-soldiers set up altars to multiple deities, including their traditional gods, the Imperial genius and local deities – sometimes with the usefully open-ended dedication to the \"diis deabusque omnibus\" (all the gods and goddesses). They also brought Roman \"domestic\" deities and cult practices with them. By the same token, the later granting of citizenship to provincials and their conscription into the legions brought their new cults into the Roman military.\n\nTraders, legions and other travellers brought home cults originating from Egypt, Greece, Iberia, India and Persia. The cults of Cybele, Isis, Mithras, and Sol Invictus were particularly important. Some of those were initiatory religions of intense personal significance, similar to Christianity in those respects.\n\nIn the early Imperial era, the princeps (lit. \"first\" or \"foremost\" among citizens) was offered \"genius\"-cult as the symbolic \"paterfamilias\" of Rome. His cult had further precedents: popular, unofficial cult offered to powerful benefactors in Rome: the kingly, god-like honours granted a Roman general on the day of his triumph; and in the divine honours paid to Roman magnates in the Greek East from at least 195 BC.\n\nThe deification of deceased emperors had precedent in Roman domestic cult to the \"dii parentes\" (deified ancestors) and the mythic apotheosis of Rome's founders. A deceased emperor granted apotheosis by his successor and the Senate became an official State \"divus\" (divinity). Members of the Imperial family could be granted similar honours and cult; an Emperor's deceased wife, sister or daughter could be promoted to \"diva\" (female divinity).\n\nThe first and last Roman known as a living \"divus\" was Julius Caesar, who seems to have aspired to divine monarchy; he was murdered soon after. Greek allies had their own traditional cults to rulers as divine benefactors, and offered similar cult to Caesar's successor, Augustus, who accepted with the cautious proviso that expatriate Roman citizens refrain from such worship; it might prove fatal. By the end of his reign, Augustus had appropriated Rome's political apparatus – and most of its religious cults – within his \"reformed\" and thoroughly integrated system of government. Towards the end of his life, he cautiously allowed cult to his \"numen\". By then the Imperial cult apparatus was fully developed, first in the Eastern Provinces, then in the West. Provincial Cult centres offered the amenities and opportunities of a major Roman town within a local context; bathhouses, shrines and temples to Roman and local deities, amphitheatres and festivals. In the early Imperial period, the promotion of local elites to Imperial priesthood gave them Roman citizenship.\n\nIn an empire of great religious and cultural diversity, the Imperial cult offered a common Roman identity and dynastic stability. In Rome, the framework of government was recognisably Republican. In the Provinces, this would not have mattered; in Greece, the emperor was \"not only endowed with special, super-human abilities, but... he was indeed a visible god\" and the little Greek town of Akraiphia could offer official cult to \"liberating Zeus Nero for all eternity\".\n\nIn Rome, state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional. As princeps (first citizen) he must respect traditional Republican mores; given virtually monarchic powers, he must restrain them. He was not a living \"divus\" but father of his country (\"pater patriae\"), its pontifex maximus (greatest priest) and at least notionally, its leading Republican. When he died, his ascent to heaven, or his descent to join the \"dii manes\" was decided by a vote in the Senate. As a \"divus\", he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine, garlands, incense, hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals. What he did in return for these favours is unknown, but literary hints and the later adoption of \"divus\" as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor. In Rome, official cult to a living emperor was directed to his \"genius\"; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that. In the crises leading up to the Dominate, Imperial titles and honours multiplied, reaching a peak under Diocletian. Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous.\n\nFor at least a century before the establishment of the Augustan principate, Jews and Judaism were tolerated in Rome by diplomatic treaty with Judaea's Hellenised elite. Diaspora Jews had much in common with the overwhelmingly Hellenic or Hellenised communities that surrounded them. Early Italian synagogues have left few traces; but one was dedicated in Ostia around the mid-1st century BC and several more are attested during the Imperial period. Judaea's enrollment as a client kingdom in 63 BC increased the Jewish diaspora; in Rome, this led to closer official scrutiny of their religion. Their synagogues were recognised as legitimate \"collegia\" by Julius Caesar. By the Augustan era, the city of Rome was home to several thousand Jews. In some periods under Roman rule, Jews were legally exempt from official sacrifice, under certain conditions. Judaism was a \"superstitio\" to Cicero, but the Church Father Tertullian described it as \"religio licita\" (an officially permitted religion) in contrast to Christianity.\n\nRoman investigations into early Christianity found it an irreligious, novel, disobedient, even atheistic sub-sect of Judaism: it appeared to deny all forms of religion and was therefore \"superstitio\". By the end of the Imperial era, Nicene Christianity was the one permitted Roman \"religio\"; all other cults were heretical or pagan \"superstitiones\".\n\nAfter the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, Emperor Nero accused the Christians as convenient scapegoats, who were later persecuted and killed. From that point on, Roman official policy towards Christianity tended towards persecution. During the various Imperial crises of the 3rd century, \"contemporaries were predisposed to decode any crisis in religious terms\", regardless of their allegiance to particular practices or belief systems. Christianity drew its traditional base of support from the powerless, who seemed to have no religious stake in the well-being of the Roman State, and therefore threatened its existence. The majority of Rome's elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive Hellenistic monism; Neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional Graeco-Roman cultic framework. Christians saw these practices as ungodly, and a primary cause of economic and political crisis.\n\nIn the wake of religious riots in Egypt, the emperor Decius decreed that all subjects of the Empire must actively seek to benefit the state through witnessed and certified sacrifice to \"ancestral gods\" or suffer a penalty: only Jews were exempt. Decius' edict appealed to whatever common \"mos maiores\" might reunite a politically and socially fractured Empire and its multitude of cults; no ancestral gods were specified by name. The fulfillment of sacrificial obligation by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as Roman. Apostasy was sought, rather than capital punishment. A year after its due deadline, the edict expired.\n\nValerian singled out Christianity as a particularly self-interested and subversive foreign cult, outlawed its assemblies and urged Christians to sacrifice to Rome's traditional gods. In another edict, he described Christianity as a threat to Empire – not yet at its heart but close to it, among Rome's equites and Senators. Christian apologists interpreted his eventual fate – a disgraceful capture and death – as divine judgement. The next forty years were peaceful; the Christian church grew stronger and its literature and theology gained a higher social and intellectual profile, due in part to its own search for political toleration and theological coherence. Origen discussed theological issues with traditionalist elites in a common Neoplatonist frame of reference – he had written to Decius' predecessor Philip the Arab in similar vein – and Hippolytus recognised a \"pagan\" basis in Christian heresies. The Christian churches were disunited; Paul of Samosata, Bishop of Antioch was deposed by a synod of 268 both for his doctrines, and for his unworthy, indulgent, elite lifestyle. Meanwhile, Aurelian (270-75) appealed for harmony among his soldiers (\"concordia militum\"), stabilised the Empire and its borders and successfully established an official, Hellenic form of unitary cult to the Palmyrene \"Sol Invictus\" in Rome's Campus Martius.\n\nIn 295, Maximilian of Tebessa refused military service; in 298 Marcellus renounced his military oath. Both were executed for treason; both were Christians. At some time around 302, a report of ominous haruspicy in Diocletian's \"domus\" and a subsequent (but undated) dictat of placatory sacrifice by the entire military triggered a series of edicts against Christianity. The first (303 AD) \"ordered the destruction of church buildings and Christian texts, forbade services to be held, degraded officials who were Christians, re-enslaved imperial freedmen who were Christians, and reduced the legal rights of all Christians... [Physical] or capital punishments were not imposed on them\" but soon after, several Christians suspected of attempted arson in the palace were executed. The second edict threatened Christian priests with imprisonment and the third offered them freedom if they performed sacrifice. An edict of 304 enjoined universal sacrifice to traditional gods, in terms that recall the Decian edict.\n\nIn some cases and in some places the edicts were strictly enforced: some Christians resisted and were imprisoned or martyred. Others complied. Some local communities were not only pre-dominantly Christian, but powerful and influential; and some provincial authorities were lenient, notably the Caesar in Gaul, Constantius Chlorus, the father of Constantine I. Diocletian's successor Galerius maintained anti-Christian policy until his deathbed revocation in 311, when he asked Christians to pray for him. \"This meant an official recognition of their importance in the religious world of the Roman empire, although one of the tetrarchs, Maximinus Daia, still oppressed Christians in his part of the empire up to 313.\"\n\nThe conversion of Constantine I ended the Christian persecutions. Constantine successfully balanced his own role as an instrument of the \"pax deorum\" with the power of the Christian priesthoods in determining what was (in traditional Roman terms) auspicious – or in Christian terms, what was orthodox. The edict of Milan (313) redefined Imperial ideology as one of mutual toleration. Constantine had triumphed under the \"signum\" (sign) of the Christ: Christianity was therefore officially embraced along with traditional religions and from his new Eastern capital, Constantine could be seen to embody both Christian and Hellenic religious interests. He passed laws to protect Christians from persecution; he also funded the building of churches, including Saint Peter's basilica. He may have officially ended – or attempted to end – blood sacrifices to the \"genius\" of living emperors, though his Imperial iconography and court ceremonial outstripped Diocletian's in their supra-human elevation of the Imperial hierarch.\n\nConstantine promoted orthodoxy in Christian doctrine, so that Christianity might become a unitary force, rather than divisive. He summoned Christian bishops to a meeting, later known as the First Council of Nicaea, at which some 318 bishops (mostly easterners) debated and decided what was orthodox, and what was heresy. The meeting reached consensus on the Nicene Creed. At Constantine's death, he was honored as a Christian and as an Imperial \"divus\". Later, Philostorgius would criticize those Christians who offered sacrifice at statues of the \"divus\" Constantine.\n\nChristianity and traditional Roman religion proved incompatible. From the 2nd century onward, the Church Fathers had condemned the diverse non-Christian religions practiced throughout the Empire as \"pagan\". Constantine's actions have been regarded by some scholars as causing the rapid growth of Christianity, though revisionist scholars disagree. Constantine's unique form of Imperial orthodoxy did not outlast him. After his death in 337, two of his sons, Constantius II and Constans, took over the leadership of the empire and re-divided their Imperial inheritance. Constantius was an Arian and his brothers were Nicene Christians.\n\nConstantine's nephew Julian rejected the \"Galilean madness\" of his upbringing for an idiosyncratic synthesis of neo-Platonism, Stoic asceticism and universal solar cult. Julian became Augustus in 361 and actively but vainly fostered a religious and cultural pluralism, attempting a restitution of non-Christian practices and rights. He proposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem's temple as an Imperial project and argued against the \"irrational impieties\" of Christian doctrine. His attempt to restore an Augustan form of principate, with himself as \"primus inter pares\" ended with his death in 363 in Persia, after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned. The empire once again fell under Christian control, this time permanently.\n\nIn 380, under Theodosius I, Nicene Christianity became the official state religion of the Roman Empire. Christian heretics as well as non-Christians were subject to exclusion from public life or persecution, though Rome's original religious hierarchy and many aspects of its ritual influenced Christian forms, and many pre-Christian beliefs and practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions.\n\nThe Western emperor Gratian refused the office of \"pontifex maximus\", and against the protests of the senate, removed the altar of Victory from the senate house and began the disestablishment of the Vestals. Theodosius I briefly re-united the Empire: in 391 he officially adopted Nicene Christianity as the Imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults. He not only refused to restore Victory to the senate-house, but extinguished the Sacred fire of the Vestals and vacated their temple: the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus to the Western and Eastern emperors. Ambrose, the influential Bishop of Milan and future saint, wrote urging the rejection of Symmachus's request for tolerance. Yet Theodosius accepted comparison with Hercules and Jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of Pacatus, and despite his active dismantling of Rome's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly Hellenic senate in traditional Hellenic terms. He was the last emperor of both East and West.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6330872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6330872", "title": "Religious satire", "text": "Religious satire\n\nReligious satire is a form of satire targeted at religious beliefs. From the earliest times, at least since the plays of Aristophanes, religion has been one of the three primary topics of literary satire, along with politics and sex. Satire which targets the clergy is a type of political satire, while religious satire is that which targets religious beliefs.\n\nReligious satire is also sometimes called philosophical satire. Religious satire can be the result of agnosticism or atheism. Religious satire surfaced during the Renaissance, with works by Chaucer, Erasmus and Durer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReligious satire has been criticised by those who feel that sincerely held religious views should not \nbe subject to ridicule. In some cases religious satire has been censored - for example, Molière's play \"Tartuffe\" was banned in 1664.\n\nThe film \"Life of Brian\" was initially banned in Ireland, Norway, some states of the US, and some towns and councils of the United Kingdom. In an interesting case of life mirroring art, activist groups who protested the film during its release bore striking similarities to some bands of religious zealots within the film itself. Like much religious satire, the intent of the film has been misinterpreted and distorted by protesters. According to the Pythons, \"Life of Brian\" is not a critique of religion so much as an indictment of the hysteria and bureaucratic excess that often surrounds it.\n\nThe issue of freedom of speech was hotly debated by the UK Parliament during the passing of the Religious Hatred Bill in January 2006. Critics of the original version of the Bill (such as comedian Rowan Atkinson) feared that satirists could be prosecuted, but an amendment by the House of Lords making it clear that this was not the case was passed - by just one vote.\n\nIn 2006, Rachel Bevilacqua, a member of the Church of the SubGenius, known as Rev. Magdalen in the SubGenius hierarchy, lost custody and contact with her son after a district court judge took offense at her participation in the Church's X-Day festival.\n\nRichard Dawkins frequently points out that there is no reason to exclude religion from objective studying like any other social phenomena.\n\n"}
{"id": "354220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=354220", "title": "Religious studies", "text": "Religious studies\n\nReligious studies, alternately known as the study of religion, is an academic field devoted to research into religious beliefs, behaviors, and institutions. It describes, compares, interprets, and explains religion, emphasizing systematic, historically based, and cross-cultural perspectives.\n\nWhile theology attempts to understand the nature of transcendent or supernatural forces (such as deities), religious studies tries to study religious behavior and belief from outside any particular religious viewpoint. Religious studies draws upon multiple disciplines and their methodologies including anthropology, sociology, psychology, philosophy, and history of religion.\n\nReligious studies originated in the 19th century, when scholarly and historical analysis of the Bible had flourished, and Hindu and Buddhist texts were first being translated into European languages. Early influential scholars included Friedrich Max Müller, in England, and Cornelius P. Tiele, in the Netherlands. Today religious studies is practiced by scholars worldwide. In its early years, it was known as \"comparative religion\" or the science of religion and, in the USA, there are those who today also know the field as the History of religion (associated with methodological traditions traced to the University of Chicago in general, and in particular Mircea Eliade, from the late 1950s through to the late 1980s). \n\nThe religious studies scholar Walter Capps described the purpose of the discipline as to provide \"training and practice... in directing and conducting inquiry regarding the subject of religion\". At the same time, Capps stated that its other purpose was to use \"prescribed modes and techniques of inquiry to make the subject of religion intelligible.\"\nReligious studies scholar Robert A. Segal characterised the discipline as \"a subject matter\" that is \"open to many approaches\", and thus it \"does not require either a distinctive method or a distinctive explanation to be worthy of disciplinary status.\"\n\nDifferent scholars operating in the field have different interests and intentions; some for instance seek to defend religion, while others seek to explain it away, and others wish to use religion as an example with which to prove a theory of their own. Some scholars of religious studies are interested in primarily studying the religion to which they belong.\n\nScholars of religion have argued that a study of the subject is useful for individuals because it will provide them with knowledge that is pertinent in inter-personal and professional contexts within an increasingly globalised world. It has also been argued that studying religion is useful in appreciating and understanding sectarian tensions and religious violence.\n\nThe term \"religion\" originated from the Latin noun \"religio\", that was nominalized from one of three verbs: \"relegere\" (to turn to constantly/observe conscientiously); \"religare\" (to bind oneself [back]); and \"reeligere\" (to choose again). Because of these three different potential meanings, an etymological analysis alone does not resolve the ambiguity of defining religion, since each verb points to a different understanding of what religion is. During the Medieval Period, the term \"religious\" was used as a noun to describe someone who had joined a monastic order (a \"religious\").\n\nThroughout the history of religious studies, there have been many attempts to define the term \"religion\". Many of these have been \"monothetic\", seeking to determine a key, essential element which all religions share, which can be used to define \"religion\" as a category, and which must be necessary in order for something to be classified as a \"religion\". There are two forms of monothetic definition; the first are \"substantive\", seeking to identify a specific core as being at the heart of religion, such as a belief in a God or gods, or an emphasis on power. The second are \"functional\", seeking to define \"religion\" in terms of what it does for humans, for instance defining it by the argument that it exists to assuage fear of death, unite a community, or reinforce the control of one group over another. Other forms of definition are \"polythetic\", producing a list of characteristics that are common to religion. In this definition there is no one characteristic that need be common to every form of religion.\n\nCausing further complications is the fact that there are various secular world views, such as nationalism and Marxism, which bear many of the same characteristics that are commonly associated with religion, but which rarely consider themselves to be religious.\n\nConversely, other scholars of religious studies have argued that the discipline should reject the term \"religion\" altogether and cease trying to define it. In this perspective, \"religion\" is argued to be a Western concept that has been forced upon other cultures in an act of intellectual imperialism. According to scholar of religion Russell T. McCutcheon, \"many of the peoples that we study by means of this category have no equivalent term or concept whatsoever\". There is, for instance, no word for \"religion\" in languages like Sanskrit.\n\nBefore religious studies became a field in its own right, flourishing in the United States in the late 1960s, several key intellectual figures explored religion from a variety of perspectives. One of these figures was the famous pragmatist William James. His 1902 Gifford lectures and book \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\" examined religion from a psychological-philosophical perspective and is still influential today. His essay \"The Will to Believe\" defends the rationality of faith.\n\nMax Weber studied religion from an economic perspective in \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\" (1904-1905), his most famous work. As a major figure in sociology, he has no doubt influenced later sociologists of religion.\nÉmile Durkheim also holds continuing influence as one of the fathers of sociology. He explored Protestant and Catholic attitudes and doctrines regarding suicide in his work \"Suicide\". In 1912, he published his most memorable work on religion, \"The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life\".\n\nInterest in the general study of religion dates back to at least Hecataeus of Miletus (ca. 550 BCE – ca. 476 BCE) and Herodotus (ca. 484 BCE – 425 BCE). Later, during the Middle Ages, Islamic scholars such as Ibn Hazm (d. 1064 CE) studied Persian, Jewish, Christian, and Indian religions, among others. The first history of religion was the \"Treatise on the Religious and Philosophical Sects\" (1127 CE), written by the Muslim scholar Muhammad al-Shahrastani. Peter the Venerable, also working in the twelfth century, studied Islam and made possible a Latin translation of the Qur'an.\nNotwithstanding the long interest in the study of religion, the academic discipline Religious Studies is relatively new. Dr. Chris Partridge notes that the \"first professorships were established as recently as the final quarter of the nineteenth century.\"\nIn the nineteenth century, the study of religion was done through the eyes of science. Max Müller was the first Professor of Comparative Philology at Oxford University, a chair created especially for him. In his \"Introduction to the Science of Religion\" (1873) he wrote that it is \"the duty of those who have devoted their life to the study of the principal religions of the world in their original documents, and who value and reverence it in whatever form it may present itself, to take possession of this new territory in the name of true science.\"\n\nMany of the key scholars who helped to establish the study of religion did not regard themselves as scholars of religious studies, but rather as theologians, philosophers, anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and historians.\n\nPartridge writes that \"by the second half of the twentieth century the study of religion had emerged as a prominent and important field of academic enquiry.\" He cites the growing distrust of the empiricism of the nineteenth century and the growing interest in non-Christian religions and spirituality coupled with convergence of the work of social scientists and that of scholars of religion as factors involved in the rise of Religious Studies.\n\nOne of the earliest academic institutions where Religious Studies was presented as a distinct subject was University College Ibadan, now the University of Ibadan, where Geoffrey Parrinder was appointed as lecturer in Religious Studies in 1949.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the term \"religious studies\" became common and interest in the field increased. New departments were founded and influential journals of religious studies were initiated (for example, \"Religious Studies and Religion\"). In the forward to \"Approaches to the Study of Religion\", Ninian Smart wrote that \"in the English-speaking world [religious studies] basically dates from the 1960s, although before then there were such fields as 'the comparative study of religion', the 'history of religion', the 'sociology of religion' and so on...\"\n\nIn the 1980s, in both Britain and America, \"the decrease in student applications and diminishing resources in the 1980s led to cut backs affecting religious studies departments.\" (Partridge) Later in the decade, religious studies began to pick up as a result of integrating religious studies with other disciplines and forming programs of study that mixed the discipline with more utilitarian study.\n\nPhilosophy of religion uses philosophical tools to evaluate religious claims and doctrines. Western philosophy has traditionally been employed by English speaking scholars. (Some other cultures have their own philosophical traditions including Indian, Muslim, and Jewish.) Common issues considered by the (Western) philosophy of religion are the existence of God, belief and rationality, cosmology, and logical inferences of logical consistency from sacred texts.\n\nAlthough philosophy has long been used in evaluation of religious claims (\"e.g.\" Augustine and Pelagius's debate concerning original sin), the rise of scholasticism in the 11th century, which represented \"the search for order in intellectual life\" (Russell, 170), more fully integrated the Western philosophical tradition (with the introduction of translations of Aristotle) in religious study.\n\nThere is some amount of overlap between subcategories of religious studies and the discipline itself. Religious studies seeks to study religious phenomena as a whole, rather than be limited to the approaches of its subcategories.\n\nThe anthropology of religion is principally concerned with the common basic human needs that religion fulfills.\n\nThe cultural anthropology of religion is principally concerned with the cultural aspects of religion. Of primary concern to the cultural anthropologist of religions are rituals, beliefs, religious art, and practices of piety.\n\nGallup surveys have found that the world's poorest countries may be the most religious. Of those countries with average per-capita incomes under $2000, 95% reported that religion played an important role in their daily lives. This is contrasted by the average of 47% from the richest countries, with incomes over $25000 (with the United States breaking the trend by reporting at 65%).\nSocial scientists have suggested that religion plays a functional role (helping people cope) in poorer nations.\nThe New York Times offers a graphic illustrating the correlation (not necessarily causation) between religion and poverty.\n\nThe geography of religion is principally concerned with the spatial elements of religious practice and embodiment. In the 1960s and 1970s, geographers of religion such as Wilbur Zelinsky and David Sopher were mostly associated with the \"Berkeley school\" of cultural geography and focused mostly on the cultural imprints of religion on the landscape. \nSince the turn in the new cultural geography of religion through the work of James Duncan on the City as Text, geographers of religion have focused on what Lily Kong has called the \"politics and poetics\" of religion, especially in relation to the political geographies of secular nation-states. Recent interest in the geography of religion has focused on how religious practitioners enact sacred space through their embodied sacred practices as well as the relationship between religion and geopolitics.\n\nThe history of religions is not concerned with theological claims apart from their historical significance. Some topics of this discipline are the historicity of religious figures, events, and the evolution of doctrinal matters.\n\nThere are many approaches to the study of sacred texts. One of these approaches is to interpret the text as a literary object. Metaphor, thematic elements, and the nature and motivations of the characters are of interest in this approach. An example of this approach is \"\", by Jack Miles.\n\nThe temporal lobe has been of interest which has been termed the \"God center\" of the brain. (Ramachandran, ch. 9) Neurological findings in regard to religious experience is not a widely accepted discipline within religious studies. Scientific investigators have used a SPECTscanner to analyze the brain activity of both Christian contemplatives and Buddhist meditators, finding them to be quite similar.\n\nThe \"origin of religion\" refers to the emergence of religious behavior in prehistory, before written records.\n\nThe psychology of religion is concerned with the psychological principles operative in religious communities and practitioners. William James's The Varieties of Religious Experience analyzed personal experience as contrasted with the social phenomenon of religion. Some issues of concern to the psychologist of religions are the psychological nature of religious conversion, the making of religious decisions, religion and happiness, and the psychological factors in evaluating religious claims.\n\nSigmund Freud was another figure in the field of psychology and religion. He used his psychoanalytic theory to explain religious beliefs, practices, and rituals, in order to justify the role of religion in the development of human culture.\n\nThe sociology of religion concerns the dialectical relationship between religion and society; the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles of religion in society. There is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history. The sociology of religion is distinguished from the philosophy of religion in that it does not set out to assess the validity of religious beliefs, though the process of comparing multiple conflicting dogmas may require what Peter L. Berger has described as inherent \"methodological atheism\". Whereas the sociology of religion broadly differs from theology in assuming the invalidity of the supernatural, theorists tend to acknowledge socio-cultural reification of religious practise.\n\nIt may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology \"began\" with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 study of suicide rates amongst Catholic and Protestant populations. The works of Max Weber emphasised the relationship between religious belief and the economic foundations of society. Contemporary debates have centred on issues such as secularization, civil religion, and the cohesiveness of religion in the context of globalization and multiculturalism.\n\nThe sociology of religion also deals with how religion impacts society regarding the positive and negatives of what happens when religion is mixed with society. Theorist such as Marx states that “religion is the opium of the people” - the idea that religion has become a way for people to deal with their problems. At least one comprehensive study refutes this idea. Research has found that secular democracies like France or Scandinavia outperform more theistic democracies on various measures of societal health. The authors explains, \"Pressing questions include the reasons, whether theistic or non-theistic, that the exceptionally wealthy U.S. is so inefficient that it is experiencing a much higher degree of societal distress than are less religious, less wealthy prosperous democracies. Conversely, how do the latter achieve superior societal health while having little in the way of the religious values or institutions?\"\n\nVogel reports that in the 1970s a new \"law and religion\" approach has progressively built its own contribution to religious studies. Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the \"Journal of Law and Religion\" first published that year and the \"Ecclesiastical Law Journal\" opened in 1999. Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. As of 2012, major Law and Religion organizations in the U.S. included 500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles. Scholars are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective. Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love. Common topics on interest include marriage and the family, and human rights. Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion interrelations in law and religion in the Muslim Middle East, and pagan Rome.\n\nThe earliest serious writing on the interface between religion and film appeared in the work of film critics like Jean Epstein in the 1920s.\nThe subject has grown in popularity with students and is cited as having particular relevance given the pervasiveness of film in modern culture. Approaches to the study of religion and film differ among scholars; functionalist approaches for instance view film as a site in which religion is manifested, while theological approaches examine film as a reflection of God's presence in all things.\n\nA number of methodologies are used in Religious Studies. Methodologies are hermeneutics, or interpretive models, that provide a structure for the analysis of religious phenomena.\n\nPhenomenology is \"arguably the most influential approach to the study of religion in the twentieth century.\" (Partridge) The term is first found in the title of the work of the influential philosopher of German Idealism, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, entitled The Phenomenology of Spirit. Phenomenology had been practiced long before its being made explicit as a philosophical method by Edmund Husserl, who is considered to be its founder. In the context of Phenomenology of religion however, the term was first used by Pierre Daniel Chantepie de la Saussaye in his work \"Lehrbuch der Religiongeschichte\" (1887). Chantepie's phenomenology catalogued observable characteristics of religion much like a zoologist would categorize animals or an entomologist would categorize insects.\n\nIn part due to Husserl's influence, \"phenomenology\" came to \"refer to a method which is more complex and claims rather more for itself than did Chantepie’s mere cataloguing of facts.\" (Partridge) Husserl argued that the foundation of knowledge is consciousness. He recognized \"how easy it is for prior beliefs and interpretations to unconsciously influence one’s thinking, Husserl’s phenomenological method sought to shelve all these presuppositions and interpretations.\" (Partridge) Husserl introduced the term \"eidetic vision\" to describe the ability to observe without \"prior beliefs and interpretations\" influencing understanding and perception.\n\nHis other main conceptual contribution is the idea of the epoche: setting aside metaphysical questions and observing phenomena in and of themselves, without any bias or commitments on the part of the investigator. The epoche, also known as phenomenological reduction or bracketing, involves approaching a phenomenon or phenomena from a neutral standpoint, instead of with our own particular attitudes. In performing this reduction, whatever phenomenon or phenomena we approach are understood in themselves, rather than from our own perspectives. In the field of religious studies, a contemporary advocate of the phenomenological method is Ninian Smart. He suggests that we should perform the epoche as a means to engage in cross-cultural studies. In doing so, we can take the beliefs, symbols, rituals etc. of the other from within their own perspective, rather than imposing ours on them. Another earlier scholar who employs the phenomenological method for studying religion is Gerardus van der Leeuw. In his \"Religion in Essence and Manifestation\" (1933), he outlines what a phenomenology of religion should look like:\n\nThe subjectivity inherent to the phenomenological study of religion makes complete and comprehensive understanding highly difficult. However, phenomenologists aim to separate their formal study of religion from their own theological worldview and to eliminate, as far as possible, any personal biases (e.g., a Christian phenomenologist would avoid studying Hinduism through the lens of Christianity).\n\nThere are a number of both theoretical and methodological attitudes common among phenomenologists:source\n\nMany scholars of religious studies argued that phenomenology was \"the distinctive method of the discipline\".\nIn 2006, the phenomenologist of religion Thomas Ryba noted that this approach to the study of religion had \"entered a period of dormancy\".\nPhenomenological approaches were largely taxonomical, with Robert A. Segal stating that it amounted to \"no more than data gathering\" alongside \"the classification of the data gathered\".\n\nFunctionalism, in regard to religious studies, is the analysis of religions and their various communities of adherents using the functions of particular religious phenomena to interpret the structure of religious communities and their beliefs. The approach was introduced by British anthropologist Alfred Radcliffe-Brown. A major criticism of functionalism is that it lends itself to teleological explanations. An example of a functionalist approach is understanding the dietary restrictions contained in the Pentateuch as having the function of promoting health or providing social identity (\"i.e.\" a sense of belonging though common practice).\n\nLived religion is the ethnographic and holistic framework for understanding the beliefs, practices, and everyday experiences of religious and spiritual persons in religious studies. The name lived religion comes from the French tradition of sociology of religion \"la religion vécue\".\n\nThe concept of lived religion was popularized in the late 20th century by religious study scholars like Robert A. Orsi and David Hall. The study of lived religion has come to include a wide range of subject areas as a means of exploring and emphasizing what a religious person does and what they believe. Today, the field of lived religion is expanding to include many topics and scholars.\n\nWestern philosophy of religion, as the basic ancestor of modern religious studies, is differentiated from theology and the many Eastern philosophical traditions by generally being written from a third party perspective. The scholar need not be a believer. Theology stands in contrast to the philosophy of religion and religious studies in that, generally, the scholar is first and foremost a believer employing both logic \"and\" scripture as evidence. Theology according to this understanding fits with the definition which Anselm of Canterbury gave to it in the 11th century, credo ut intelligam, or faith seeking understanding (literally, \"I believe so that I may understand\"). The theologian then has the task of making intelligible, or clarifying, the religious commitments to which he or she subscribes. The scholar of religious studies has no such allegiances.\n\nA group of scholars have criticized religious studies beginning in the 1990s as a theological project which actually imposes views onto the people it aims to survey. Prominent voices in this critical view include Jonathan Z. Smith, Timothy Fitzgerald, Talal Asad, Tomoko Masuzawa, Geoffrey A. Oddie, Richard E. King, Russell T. McCutcheon, and Daniel Dubuisson. Their areas of research overlap heavily with postcolonial studies.\n\nMuch of the latest scholarship appears in the scholarly journals, which also typically review and evaluate new monographs. There are a large numbers of peer-reviewed scholarly journals in the discipline of Religious Studies. Many journals focus on historical or sociological topics or concentrate on particular religious traditions, such as Judaism or Islam. Religious studies journals have been laggard in gaining accessibility through the Internet, but libraries specializing in religious history have started to catch up. Among the prominent journals published in English are:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31782623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31782623", "title": "Religious symbolism in the United States military", "text": "Religious symbolism in the United States military\n\nReligious symbolism in the United States military includes the use of religious symbols for military chaplain insignia, uniforms, emblems, flags, and chapels; symbolic gestures, actions, and words used in military rituals and ceremonies; and religious symbols or designations used in areas such as headstones and markers in national cemeteries, and military ID tags (\"dog tags\").\n\nSymbolism sometimes includes specific images included or excluded because of religious reasons, choices involving colors with religious significance, and \"religious accommodation\" policies regarding the wear of \"religious apparel\" and \"grooming\" (such as \"unshorn\" hair and beards worn for religious reasons) with military uniforms. Additionally, military chaplains themselves are sometimes regarded as \"symbols of faith\" for military personnel who face challenges to their faith and values.\n\nOn July 29, 1775, the Continental Congress established the military chaplaincy, but chaplains did not wear insignia until 1880.\n\nAlthough the Latin cross has long been the symbol for the majority of United States military chaplains, this first official chaplain insignia was the \"shepherd's crook\" (staff). Authorized in General Order Number 10, and remaining in force for the period February 13, 1880 – May 5, 1888, it was described as \"embroidered frosted silver bullion in center of black velvet shoulder straps, and was considered appropriate for both the frock coat or undress uniform.\" The plain \"Latin cross\" (silver on dark-blue shoulder straps) became the authorized chaplain insignia in 1898, replacing the shepherd's crook. Today, despite the fact that the shepherd's crook is no longer used as an insignia for individual chaplains, it is included in the design of the Chaplain Corps regimental insignia in honor of its place in Army Chaplain Corps history.\n\nJewish chaplains were first authorized to serve during the Civil War, but it was during World War I that the issue of insignia reached the army, when Congressman Isaac Siegel from New York petitioned the army that rabbis serving in uniform be permitted to wear \"some other insignia in place of the cross.\"\n\nWithin two weeks of receiving this request, the army issued a directive stating that \"Objections having been made to Jewish Chaplains wearing the prescribed insignia, you are authorized by the Secretary of War to omit the prescribed insignia\" (the cross).\n\nHowever, after battlefront reports indicated that difficulties arose from the fact that Jewish chaplains wore no insignia, the army began to look into various proposals, including a continuation of the practice of having Jewish chaplains wear no insignia, to the creation of a separate insignia for them, to a return to the shepherd's crook as a shared symbol for all chaplains. General Henry Jerver, acting assistant chief of staff for the army favored the third alternative, and within weeks of his decision this became the official policy for the Army. However, many Christian chaplains opposed this change of policy, and in August 1918 General Pershing cabled the War Department to inform it of this opposition. Not all Christian chaplains opposed the idea of a universal symbol, and some went on record agreeing with the statement of one chaplain that \"I am a chaplain of the Christian faith, but I welcome the change. The shepherd's crook is symbolic of the chaplain's work.\"\n\nReturning to a consideration of the three options of no insignia for Jewish chaplains, a shared insignia, or a separate insignia, the army opted for a separate Jewish chaplain insignia that included an image of the two tablets of the Ten Commandments, using Roman numerals to indicate the commandments, with a small six-pointed Jewish star on top of the tablets. Other symbols considered included a six-pointed star (hexagram), which was rejected by the army because it could too easily be confused with the 5-pointed star worn by generals; a seven-branched candelabra (Menorah); and two \"Lions of Judah\" supporting the six-pointed star.\n\nThis symbol would remain the insignia for Jewish chaplains until 1981, when the navy changed its insignia to include the first ten letters of the Hebrew alphabet—to replace the Roman numerals—and both the army and the air force followed suit. While the official change to Hebrew letters became official November 9, 1981 Jewish chaplains were not required to make the uniform change until January 1, 1983.\n\nInsignia decisions for chaplains representing faith groups other than Christianity and Judaism have not been made unilaterally by the army, but instead have been joint decisions for all military chaplains.\n\nThe Continental Navy, predecessor of the United States Navy, was approved by the United States Congress on October 13, 1775, with navy regulations (adopted November 28, 1775) that included as its second article: \"The Commanders of the ships of the thirteen United Colonies are to take care that divine service be performed twice a day on board, and a sermon preached on Sundays, unless bad weather or other extraordinary accidents prevent.\" But, while the need for navy chaplains was recognized from the beginning, attitudes and policies toward navy uniforms or insignia for its chaplains went through many changes before final decisions were made. 1847 navy regulations did authorize chaplains to wear a blue uniform with black collar and cuffs with no insignia, and later, in 1864, chaplains were provided the same uniform as other staff officers, with the use of a silver cross as a corps device.\n\nHowever, regulations for navy chaplain uniforms and insignias changed a number of times over the following years: 1869–1876, when chaplains were considered as officers without rank, they wore the cross without any additional \"sleeve lace\"; in 1876, uniforms were no longer authorized for chaplains, who were to wear either civilian clothing or the vestments appropriate to their faith group; in 1883, the uniform became an option for chaplains, with the cross; and then in 1894, the epaulets and passants were removed so that chaplain uniforms had no insignia at all, neither any that indicated they were officers nor even the cross signifying that they were chaplains.\n\nIt was not until 1905 that the navy uniform code included a permanent regulation for chaplains: along with ranks equivalent to line officers, they were to wear naval officer's uniforms with the sleeve braid in \"lustrous black\" (not gold, like that of other officers), and to wear both the officer rank insignia and a gold cross. In 1918, naval staff corps rules were changed, and the distinctive black braid of chaplains was replaced by the same gold braid worn by other officers, along with the Latin cross.\n\nThe navy policy on insignia for Jewish chaplains was not resolved as quickly as it was in the army. When Rabbi David Goldberg entered the navy October 30, 1917, receiving orders after basic training to report to the , he asked a senior chaplain about the fact that he was told to wear the Latin cross, receiving the response that \"the men understood that he wore the insignia of the corps and not his faith group.\" Goldberg wore the cross throughout the time he served on the ship, but after reporting to his next assignment ashore the combination of his shipboard experience and the number of letters he received from rabbinic colleagues objecting to his wearing a cross finally led to his petitioning the navy in 1918 to allow him to wear the Star of David instead.\n\nWhen Goldberg's request to wear the six-pointed star was rejected—based on the same fears the army had that a six-pointed star would be too similar to the five-pointed star worn by flag officers—he recommended the shepherd's crook as a universal symbol, a recommendation that met with opposition from many Christian chaplains. However, the Navy did authorize Goldberg to wear that symbol himself, in place of the cross. Goldberg wore this insignia until the end of World War II, when navy policy eventually changed to allow navy Jewish chaplains to wear the tablets and the star, the same insignia worn by Jewish chaplains in the army. This change took place in 1941, after only two Jewish chaplains (Goldberg and Harold Strauss) had worn the Shepherd's Crook insignia.\n\nAlthough the shepherd's crook has not been used as a chaplain insignia since that time, the term used for the active duty chaplain with the earliest appointment is the \"Gray Shepherd.\"\n\nAs in the case of the army, decisions about chaplain faith group insignia after those made regarding Jewish chaplains (the original decision and the later decision to change Roman numerals to Hebrew letters) have not been made unilaterally by the navy, but instead have been joint decisions for all military chaplains.\n\nNavy chaplains also serve Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine. Although they have the option of wearing marine corps or coast guard uniforms when assigned to their respective units, the chaplain corps insignia remain that of the navy.\n\nThe United States Merchant Marine is a civilian auxiliary of the United States Navy, but in accordance with the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 its members are considered military personnel during times of war when the merchant marine comes under the navy. Until World War I, merchant mariners did not wear uniforms, but they were introduced in 1919, because \"young Americans now entering the merchant service have more regards for themselves and their job when wearing a uniform, and that the merchant sailor commands greater respect when ashore, either at home or in foreign ports, if in uniform. The uniform introduced in 1919 was based on U.S. Navy uniforms with enough differences to distinguish between the two services, including wreaths for officers on cap and sleeve insignia and shoulder boards. Chaplain insignia with the wreaths were created around 1943, at a time when merchant marine officers were drawn from the civilian population, including many retired coast guard and navy officers.\nToday, when active-duty Navy chaplains serve with the USMM, such as the two stationed at the United States Merchant Marine Academy, they wear standard navy uniforms and insignia\n\nOn July 28, 1942, Chaplain Charles Carpenter was appointed to the newly created position of air chaplain for the Army Air Force, within the larger United States Army organization. Later, when the United States Air Force was established as a separate service on September 18, 1947, the original plan was that chaplain support would continue to be provided by Army chaplains. However, on May 10, 1949, the decision was made that the still new branch of the military would have its own chaplains. At that point, chaplains serving with the Air Force began to wear Air Force uniforms, but continued to use the same Jewish and Christian Chaplain Corps insignia that had been used by the Army. In 1981, when the Navy approved the change to the Jewish chaplain insignia, from Roman numerals to Hebrew letters, both the Army and Air Force made the same change soon thereafter. Since then, the approval of insignia to represent chaplains of other faith groups has been made jointly by of all branches of the United States Armed Forces. However, while the designs for the insignia are the same for all services, the Air Force categorizes the insignia as \"occupational badges,\" with different \"wear use\" rules than the other services.\n\nAdditionally, while the Civil Air Patrol chaplain program is a separate organization than the USAF Chaplain Corps, it was established in 1950 under the guidance of the Air Force chief of chaplains and \"is modeled after the Air Force Chaplain Service,\" and follows the same rules for faith group insignia.\n\nOther than the short period 1880–1888 when all army chaplains wore the Shepherd's Crook, the Latin cross (also referred to as the \"Christian cross\") has been the symbol for all Christian chaplains, regardless of denomination, although in some other nation's military forces, separate symbols are used for some Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant Chaplains, and sometimes for specific groups within the larger Protestant faith group, such as Calvinist Chaplains, and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs includes a number of different denominational versions of the cross on gravestones in veterans cemeteries.\n\nSome Christian groups, like The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), do not normally use the symbol of the cross—but do accept it as the uniform insignia for Christian military chaplains. So for example, the LDS Church teaches that its members \"remember with reverence the suffering of the Savior. But because the Savior lives, we do not use the symbol of His death as the symbol of our faith,\" and therefore \"The only members of the Church who wear the symbol of the cross are Latter-day Saint chaplains, who wear it on their military uniforms to show that they are Christian chaplains.\" Similarly, because the cross is not normally a symbol used by the Unitarian Universalist Church (UU), an article on military chaplains written for members of that religious group had to explain that \"UUs in the military are considered Protestants, and wear crosses.\"\n\nIn 2008, Michael Hiles, a clergyman reporting for training as a Navy chaplain candidate identified himself as a Messianic Jew (a Jew who accepts Christian theological views regarding Jesus, including the changes to Judaism such beliefs entail), requesting that he still be permitted to wear the insignia of a Jewish chaplain. The November 26, 2008 decision from Vice Admiral Mark E. Ferguson, president of the Navy Uniform Board and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Manpower, Personnel, Training, and Education, was that Hiles would be required to wear the cross linked to his Christian (and non-Jewish) faith beliefs. Given the choice of wearing the cross or given the right to withdraw from training, he chose the latter.\n\nThe Jewish Chaplain insignia made up of two tablets of the Ten Commandments, with ten Roman numerals symbolizing the commandments, and with the six-pointed Star of David above the tablets, was adopted for Jewish army chaplains in 1917, and for Jewish naval chaplains in 1941. The original Army description did not specifically reference a star \"per se\", but instead read \"a double Tablet bearing numerals from I to X, surmounted by two equilateral Triangles interlaced.\"\n\nBefore the tablets-and-star design was approved for United States Navy Jewish chaplains, only two Jewish chaplains wore the Shepherd's Crook insignia: Chaplain David Goldberg, during WWI, and Chaplain Harold Strauss, 1931–1941. Beginning in 1917, Goldberg first wore the cross—the original symbol for all navy chaplains—until receiving permission to wear the Shepherd's Crook instead.\n\nOn August 5, 1980, Navy Chief of Chaplains Rear Admiral Ross Trower convened a blue ribbon panel made up of Jewish chaplains to consider the \"beneficial suggestion\" made to the Navy to change the Roman numerals to Hebrew letters. The question had been raised before and not all Jewish authorities were in favor of the change because of the concern that the insignia might be considered \"holy\"—\"even mildly holy\"—because of the presence of Hebrew writing. In fact, in a 1972 responsum from the National Jewish Welfare Board authored by Rabbi Solomon Freehof, he recommended maintaining Roman numerals although he did state that when it came to using Hebrew letters simply to indicate numbers, \"there is no strict law against it.\" Nevertheless, based on the panel's unanimous 1980 recommendation to make the change, Chaplain Trower made the formal recommendation to the President of the Navy Uniform Board that the Navy should make the change unilaterally, without the additional time that would be required for all services to study the question. Included in his recommendation was the statement that\nThe President of the Navy Uniform Board approved the change on December 17, 1980, with the army and air force quickly approving the change as well. (Note that the Roman numeral version read left to right, with the first five numerals on the left tablet and the second five on the right; the Hebrew reads right to left, with the first five numerals on the right and the second five on the left, as per Jewish tradition. Jewish tradition states that the tablets had flat tops and may even have been square instead of rectangular, but the Christian-influenced rectangular tablets with round tops is nonetheless very frequently found in Jewish art and synagogues, and was not objected to here either.) The new insignia was authorized for wear from 1981, with a grace period authorized to allow Jewish chaplains to make the required uniform changes by January 1, 1983.\n\nOn December 14, 1992, the Army Chief of Chaplains requested that an insignia be created for future Muslim chaplains, and the design (a crescent) was completed January 8, 1993.\n\nIn 1990 the Army made the decision to create an insignia for future Buddhist chaplains, and the Armed Forces Chaplains Board (the board made up of the three Chiefs of Chaplains and active-duty Deputy Chiefs of Chaplains for the Army, Navy, and Air Force) began working with the Army's Institute of Heraldry. The design was completed in August 1990, representing the dharmacakra (the \"wheel of dharma\" or sometimes, \"wheel of law\"), an eight-spoked wheel \"representative of religious observances.\"\n\nAs of 2011, a Hindu faith community endorsing agency was approved by the Department of Defense and began to seek volunteers to serve as Hindu chaplains in the United States military. Military officials, including the members of the Armed Forces Chaplains Board, worked to consider possible insignias, while members of the Hindu community did so as well. According to Hindu Air Force officer Ravi Chaudhary, one of the officers involved in the effort, individuals and groups throughout the country, including the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, were contacted.\n\nAs part of the study, insignias used by Hindu chaplains in other militaries were studied, such as the insignia authorized August 22, 1996 for the first Hindu chaplain to serve in the South African military: a lamp (deepa) and flame. The first insignia ever developed for Hindu military chaplains, it shows a clay lamp representing the human body into which \"the oil of devotion to God\" must be introduced, symbolizing \"the perennial quest of all Hindus: Tamaso ma jyotir gamaya\" – \"O Lord, lead us from darkness to Light.\" However, the recommendation made to the Pentagon was the \"om,\" a symbol that Chaudhary said means \"truth and peace.\"\n\nAccording to Chaudhary, the first Hindu chaplain was army Captain Pratima Dharm, who holds degrees in psychology and theology, and is already serving on active duty at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. In addition to being the first Hindu chaplain in the United States military, she will also be the first female of Indian descent to serve as a United States Army chaplain. According to an article in the \"Stars and Stripes\" Dharm has worn the cross on her uniform with the endorsement with the Pentecostal Church of God, but has now been endorsed by the Hindu endorsing agency, Chinmaya Mission West.\n\nIn an official statement, United States Army Chief of Chaplains Douglas Carver confirmed the appointment of Dharm as the army's first Hindu chaplain: \"The Chief of Chaplains is pleased to announce the endorsement of the Army’s first Hindu chaplain by Chinmaya Mission West. This continues our Army’s enduring commitment to the free exercise of religion for our Nation’s sons and daughters, including the hundreds of Hindu soldiers serving in our ranks.\"\n\nEnlisted personnel who serve as assistants to chaplains do not wear any specific faith group symbols, but they have military branch or occupational insignia/badges identifying them as army chaplain assistants/chapel activities specialists, navy religious program specialists, and air force chaplain assistants, that incorporate broader symbols of faith and care.\n\nThe Army Chaplain Assistant Badge was authorized in 1984, incorporating cupped hands representing support given to the chapel and its programs, and a chapel door symbolizing \"a welcome to all worshippers.\"\n\nThe rating badge for navy religious program specialists (RP) includes a compass rose, a globe, and an anchor. The RP rating was established January 15, 1979, and the insignia (which has never changed) was approved by the Chief of Naval Operations on May 9, 1979. According to navy documents, the compass symbolizes that religion can give direction to life; the globe is a symbol of the fact that religious program specialists work throughout the world; and the anchor is a symbol of Navy heritage.\n\nThe air force has three levels of badges: other than the basic badge, there is a Chaplain Assistant Badge-Senior, and a Chaplain Assistant Badge-Master. Each one is based on level of training and qualifications. The badge was established September 1, 1994, and the design was based on the 1990 USAF chaplain theme, \"Live by faith.\" According to \"A History of the Chaplain Assistant,\" \"The badge symbolizes the career field mission of supporting the religious needs of the Air Force community in peace, war, national emergencies, and military contingencies.\"\n\nIn addition to chaplain insignia, Department of Defense instructions on the \"Accommodation of religious practices within the military services\" state that \"chaplains may wear any religious apparel or accouterments with the uniform while conducting worship services and during the performance of rites and rituals associated with their religious faith.\" In addition to allowing religious apparel drawn from civilian faith group sources, some religious apparel has been issued by the military, sometimes with military service, Chaplain Corps, or chaplain religious symbols included in the design. While in the past, religious items to support chaplains and chapel programs were made available by individual service organizations such as the Army Service Forces, today a chaplain is attached full-time to the Defense Logistics Agency, with a mission statement that reads: \n\nIn addition to military-issue religious vestments to be worn by chaplains during worship services or religious rites, United States Army Chief of Chaplains Charles Brown had a lapel pin created during the 1960s showing the Army Chaplain Corps seal (then with symbols of Christian and Jewish chaplains) for chaplains to wear with civilian clothing, in the same way some civilians wore lapel pins with their college seals. However, it turned out that government funding was not authorized for the production of a civilian clothing accessory, so production was halted and wear was discontinued.\n\n<gallery widths=100px heights=150px perrow=6 caption=\"Military issued scarves/stoles\">\nImage:Army Christian scarf.jpg|Army-issued scarf/stole for Christian chaplains\nImage:Army Christian stole.jpg|More modern \"camouflage\" scarf/stole for Christian chaplains\nImage:Army Jewish prayer shawl.jpg|Army-issued prayer shawl (tallit) for Jewish chaplains\nImage:Army camouflage prayer shawl.jpg|More modern prayer shawl (tallit) for Jewish chaplains\nImage:USAF Christian Chaplain scarf.jpg|Air Force-issued scarf/stole for Christian chaplains\nImage:USAF Jewish Chaplain prayer shawl.jpg|Air Force-issued prayer shawl (tallit) for Jewish chaplains\n</gallery>\n\nIn addition to special religious apparel rules for chaplains and worshipers during religious services or rites, military instructions also authorize all military personnel to wear \"articles of clothing worn as part of the doctrinal or traditional observance of the religious faith practiced by the member,\" as long as they are worn under the uniform in a way that makes them \"not visible or apparent\" (such as some Mormon undergarments or Jewish apparel that can be worn under outer clothing); or, if they are visible, the articles of clothing must be \"neat and conservative.\" Some military regulations, such as Army Regulation 670-1, expand the phrase to \"neat, conservative, and discreet,\" and the latest revised version of the Department of Defense Instruction (1300.17) which lays the foundation for all religious accommodation policies in the United States military now defines \"neat and conservative\" as (in part) \"discreet, tidy, and not dissonant or showy in style, size, design, brightness, or color.\" This exact wording has also been incorporated into Secretary of the Navy Instruction 1730.7C, which establishes policy for the Department of the Navy, noting that it applies not only to the Navy and Marine Corps but also to the coast guard \"when operating as a service in the navy under Title 14, U.S. Code, Section 3.\"\n\nProcedures for considering requests for waivers to allow religious apparel have been established by each service, such as the \"Religious Apparel Waivers\" table published in Air Force Instruction 36-2903, \"Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel.\"\n\nThe various branches of the military have added different color requirements for religious head coverings, sometimes so that they blend more with uniform colors. For example, the air force requires that approved religious head coverings must be either \"dark blue or black,\", the navy and coast guard requirement is that it must be \"either black or hair-colored\" (that is, as spelled out in coast guard policies, \"black or match the hair color of the wearer\")\n\nJewelry with religious meaning or symbolism is also authorized, providing it meets the \"neat, conservative, and discreet\" requirement, and generally follows the rules for any jewelry that can be worn with a military uniform.\n\nTattoos that \"advocate religious discrimination\" are listed among prohibited tattoos for military personnel.\n\nAll branches of the United States military currently prohibit beards, although some mustaches are allowed, based on policies that were initiated during the period of World War I. If mustaches are worn, they cannot be \"handlebar\" mustaches; they must be \"neatly trimmed, tapered, and tidy,\" not presenting \"a chopped off or busy appearance\"; and \"no portion of the mustache will cover the upper lip line or extend sideways beyond a vertical line drawn upward from the corners of the mouth.\"\n\nAccording to Professor Penny Jolly, who has studied \"social trends in appearance,\" beards \"were eliminated in the US military in WWI due to the need to wear gas masks. Razors were issued in GI kits, so men could shave themselves on the battlefield.\" However, the link between the requirement to shave and the use of gas masks has been called only one of \"several theories.\" Other theories include the fact that the massive build-up of the military for WWI brought with it many men from rural areas, and this \"sudden concentration of recruits in crowded army induction centers brought with it disease, including head lice. Remedial action was taken by immediately shaving the faces and cutting the hair of all inductees upon their arrival.\"\n\nHistorically beards were commonplace in the United States military, and as one report states \"it is harder to find a picture of a general from the American Civil War \"without a beard than with one.\" But beginning with World War I and clearly by World War II, beards were universally prohibited, with the military citing concerns that included the need for \"uniformity, hygiene, discipline, or tactical demands—such as the proper fitting and seal of a gas mask.\"\n\nFrom 1970–1984, the United States Navy briefly restored beards. The temporary change began on November 10, 1970, when then-Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Elmo Zumwalt explicitly authorized beards for active duty naval personnel, in his \"Z-gram\" number 57, \"Elimination of Demeaning or Abrasive Regulation,\" although his position was that they were already implicitly allowed based on policy changes made by his predecessor, Thomas H. Moorer.\nThe navy ban on beards was reinstated in 1984 by CNO James D. Watkins.\n\nReligious laws and traditions regarding grooming have made both hair and beards visible religious symbols for many faith groups, including Sikhs for whom \"Kesh,\" \"unshorn hair,\" is one of the \"Five Ks\"—5 compulsory \"articles of faith\" for baptized Sikhs. Other faith groups, including Judaism and Islam, include certain groups that believe shaving is permitted and other groups that believe it is not. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is an example of a faith group that takes the opposite approach, strongly encouraging some or all of its members to shave. In some cases shaving is mandated for some members, including those engaging in their missionary service, or studying or working at the church-sponsored Brigham Young University.\n\nUnited States military instructions note that \"hair and grooming practices required or observed by religious groups are not included within the meaning of religious apparel,\" and therefore do not fall under the overall religious accommodation guidance that authority to approve requests are normally given to individual commands, as specified by each service (although denials of requests are subject to review at the \"Service Headquarters level\"). Instead, requests for grooming waivers based on religion have been decided at the highest levels of each branch of the military, with the United States Army approving new waivers in 2009 for the first time in more than twenty years. However, the Army stresses that such waivers are \"temporary\" and \"assignment specific,\" and that it can rescind the waivers at any time \"in the interest of military necessity.\"\n\nBeards have been authorized for non-religious reasons in today's military, including medical reasons related to skin conditions, with Army directives noting that \"soldiers will keep the growth trimmed to the level specified by appropriate medical authority,\" and Air Force Instructions limiting the length of a beard approved for medical reasons to 1/4 inch.\" Other examples include waivers for some members of the military's Special Forces, based on the rationale that \"in hot spots such as Afghanistan, many members of those elite units grow beards to make themselves less conspicuous to locals.\" The policy for beards lasted for almost a decade and according to some reports was also (at least in part) \"a show of deep respect for Afghanistan's male-dominated, bearded tribal culture.\" However, as of noon September 7, 2010 (based on an order issued the previous day) beards for Special Forces troops in Afghanistan were \"deauthorized\" due to \"a vastly changed operational environment.\" Because DOD Instructions on religious accommodation note that \"precedents\" for non-religious reasons should be taken into account when considering religious accommodation requests, those in favor of additional waivers for beards for religious reasons hope such precedents—in addition to precedents of waivers issued for religious reasons—will help support additional religious accommodation waivers.\n\nSome military spokespersons have cited concerns that beards might interfere with gas masks, but those in favor of beards have challenged those concerns, and some experts note that the application of vaseline to the beard can provide the mask's required seal. In one case, before being allowed to deploy to the First Gulf War, Jewish Chaplain Jacob Goldstein (an army reservist who has been granted a waiver to wear a beard) had to prove that he could don his mask safely and securely within the same 8-second time period given to others—and Goldstein (who says \"the mask issue is bogus\") showed that he could. Gas masks do vary from one nation to another, and it has been reported that even masks manufactured in Israel, a nation where they are routinely distributed to citizens, may not work properly for men with facial hair. While special \"beard-friendly\" masks that cover the entire head of the wearer are manufactured there, a reported shortage has driven that nation's Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi to rule that ultra-orthodox Jews can shave or trim their beards in order to ensure that their masks fit, and urged them to carry scissors with them so that they can shave quickly in the event of a chemical or biological gas attack.\n\nOther military representatives have said that religious accommodation requests to waive the prohibition for beards could be considered on a case-by-case basis, but only from those already in the military. However, critics have noted that such a policy would require an applicant to be a hypocrite: requesting a shaving waiver based on the fact that he cannot shave, but first shaving in order to enlist and qualify to submit a request. According to some commentators, the real reason beards have been prohibited is the feeling that they \"are unseemly and make service members appear sloppy.\" Army Regulation 670-1 states that \"personal appearance\"—including \"strict grooming standards\"—is an \"essential part of discipline\" and \"a neat and well-groomed appearance by all soldiers is fundamental to the Army and contributes to building the pride and esprit essential to an effective military force.\"\n\nSome changes in military regulations are making it easier for civilian clergy with beards who hold reserve commissions as chaplains to report for short periods of active duty without shaving off their beards. For example, Air Force Instruction 36-2903, revised July 18, 2011, directs that \"During tours of less than 30 days, Air Force Reserve (AFR) and Air National Guard (ANG) chaplains not on extended active duty may request a beard waiver for religious observance when consistent with their faith.\"\n\nOne example of visible religious apparel cited in the instructions as authorized, provided it passes the \"neat and conservative\" test, is the kippah (skullcap) worn by some Jewish personnel, referred to in some military directives by the Yiddish word, \"yarmulke.\" The modern history of authorizing the kippa under the rubric of \"religious accommodation\" began with a 1986 Supreme Court case (Goldman v. Weinberger) involving an orthodox rabbi who was serving in the air force as a psychologist, not a chaplain, who had been told to remove his kippa. When the court affirmed that existing military regulations did give the military the right to prohibit the kippa if it so chose—and deferred to Congress to decide whether to change the situation—Congress attempted to introduce the \"neat and conservative\" approval rule in a proposed \"Religious Apparel Amendment.\" That proposed amendment failed to pass for two years, ultimately passing after a story about two navy chaplains present during the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing was read into the \"Congressional Record.\" The story focused on Catholic Chaplain George Pucciarelli, who tore off a piece of his Marine Corps uniform to replace Jewish Chaplain Arnold Resnicoff's kippah, bloodied after being used to wipe the faces of wounded Marines. This amendment passed, and was eventually incorporated into the newer DOD religious accommodation directive, which now exists in revised form as DOD Instruction 1300.17.\n\nResnicoff's report of the bombing, written at the request of the White House, and read in April 1984 as a keynote speech by President Ronald Reagan, explained the symbolism of Pucciarelli's actions and this kippah:\nThis story of this \"camouflage kippah\"—its symbolism in terms of Judaism as a sign of reverence and its symbolism in the military as a sign of interfaith cooperation and respect—was retold at many levels, including another occasion involving President Reagan, during a White House visit of the \"American Friends of Lubavitch.\" After telling them the Beirut story, Reagan asked them about the meaning of the kippah. Rabbi Abraham Shemtov responded, \"Mr. President, the kippah to us is a sign of reverence,\" and one of his colleagues, Rabbi Feller, continued, 'We place the kippah on the very highest point of our being—on our head, the vessel of our intellect—to tell ourselves and the world that there is something which is above man's intellect—the infinite Wisdom of God.\"\n\nAlthough a number of military instructions use the Jewish headcovering as an example—noting factors that must be met to qualify under the \"neat and conservative\" requirement—the same criteria for permission apply to head coverings regardless of the faith of the military person requesting permission: \"Religious headgear that meets these criteria is authorized irrespective of the faith group from which it originates.\"\n\nSikh turban and grooming requirements have a unique history in terms of religious accommodation because they were allowed, then disallowed, and finally allowed once again, at least for some specific individual cases, as of 2010. Since 1948, Sikh men had served in the military with uniform policy waivers that allowed them to follow their faith group requirements for beards and long hair, with the hair covered by turbans, until the army eliminated such religious accommodation policies in 1984, when then-army Chief of Staff John A. Wickham, Jr. eliminated the exception for Sikhs and others who wore \"conspicuous\" items of faith. All this was in parallel with regulations within the United States Navy, as from the time of Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt's service, through the issuance of his \"Z-grams\" numbers 57 and 70, in early November 1970 and late January 1971 respectively, permitting well-groomed facial hair on all United States Navy personnel until the timeframe of Ronald Reagan's presidency.\n\nUnited States Army Regulation 600-20 grants permission to personnel who received waivers to grooming standards for beards or long hair prior to January 1, 1986 to continue on active duty for as long as they are \"otherwise qualified for retention.\" However, these individuals \"will not be assigned permanent change of station or temporary duty outside of CONUS [the Continental United States] due to health and safety considerations.\" Two Sikhs in the Army's medical field, doctor (Colonel) Arjinderpal Singh Sekhon, and dentist (Colonel) G. B. Singh, continued under this \"grandfather clause\" until their retirements in 2009 (for Sekhon) and 2007 (for Singh).\n\nHowever, in March 2010 United States Army Captain Tejdeep Singh Rattan graduated United States Army Officer Training at Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas, to become the first new Sikh officer allowed to serve with a beard and turban in more than 25 years. According to news reports, \"Rattan wears a fatigue-colored turban, and when he needs to wear a helmet, he puts on a mini-turban underneath it. He says he's gotten a positive response from other officers in training.\"\nOther Sikhs have since been granted permission as well, including Captain Kamaljeet Singh Kalsi, an Army doctor who told the story of how his first sergeant \"pulled him out of the crowd\" on his first day of training at Fort Sam Houston, to tell the other soldiers about the \"long ordeal\" Kalsi endured in order to enlist. He quoted the First Sergeant as saying that \"The Army is made up of different shades of green, and if you have any objection to him being here, you need to tell me now,\" at which point all the other soldiers applauded him.\n\nWhile Rattan and Kalsi are both officers, in 2011, Army Specialist Simranpreet Lamba became the first enlisted man to be granted a waiver for his beard and turban as Sikh \"articles of faith\" in 26 years. Despite the fact that his education would have qualified him for service as an officer, his status as a non-United States citizen barred him from officer status, so he enlisted under \"the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest recruiting program, which enlists legal non-citizens with critical language skills, such as Lamba's knowledge of Punjabi and Hindi.\" During Combat Basic Training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, Lamba was naturalized as a United States citizen, saying that becoming a United States citizen and a United States soldier were always part of his \"childhood dream\": \"I believe that I already have the warrior ethos in me and the warrior blood in me. That's why it's been my childhood dream to always be in the armed forces. And I'm really happy that my childhood dream came true. And I'm a proud U.S. Army Soldier today.\" Now that he is a United States citizen, Lamba plans to continue to serve as a soldier, but hopes to apply to Officer Candidate School (OCS) sometime in the future.\n\nArmy spokesperson Major General Gina Farrisse stated that each religious accommodation request regarding grooming will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, rather than considering the right \"a blanket accommodation for any other individual\" Speaking of the permission given to Kalsi, Major General Farrisse noted that Kalsi's \"beard, shorn hair, and turban will be neat and well maintained at all times.\" She said the exception could be revoked \"due to changed conditions.\"\n\nAs of June 2011, similar waivers of military grooming policies, allowing beards, have been granted to at least two Muslim soldiers.\n\nThe right of Muslims to keep beards is an issue that has been discussed in other nations, including India. Maulana Hasan Mehndi, a Shia cleric in Calcutta, someone who has advocated for Muslim rights in that nation, has stated that \"Shaving is forbidden in Islam. But that doesn’t mean the beard has to be of an inordinate length. Individual institutions may have its own rules, but we cannot neglect our allegiance to the Almighty.\" On the other hand, some Muslim scholars believe that the beard is not a requirement for Muslim men, but that it is certainly \"encouraged\" according to Islamic law.\n\nBeginning in 2009, Orthodox rabbi Menachem Stern has requested similar permission to wear a beard to allow him to serve as a Jewish chaplain, ultimately filing suit December 8, 2010, in Federal Court in Washington, D.C. (\"Stern v. Secretary of the Army\", 1:2010cv02077) alleging discrimination on the part of the Army for refusing to allow him to serve as a chaplain without shaving his beard. Stern's suit includes documentation that shows he informed the army that he could not shave, but was nevertheless granted a commission as an Army Reserve 1st lieutenant. The commission was rescinded the day after it was granted, based on an army decision that it was granted based on an \"administrative error\" that did not take into account the \"no beard policy.\"\nNathan Lewin, the lead counsel for Stern's lawsuit, had represented Rabbi Michell Geller, an Air Force chaplain, in a similar case in 1976. Lewin notes that the military was directed to permit Geller to keep his beard, and did not appeal that decision. In the Stern lawsuit, as in the earlier Geller lawsuit, Lewin's position on behalf of his client is that \"Even if the military thinks regular servicemen should be clean-shaven, clearly chaplains who are teaching religion are in a different category.\"\n\nAn \"Army Times\" editorial praised military decisions regarding religious needs in the case of Sikhs and Muslims, and strongly urged the Army to take the same policy regarding Jews for whom a beard was a faith requirement:\nOne waiver for beards has been granted to Army Reserve Chaplain (Rabbi) Jacob Goldstein (originally granted when he served as a chaplain for the New York Army National Guard and continued after his transfer to the United States Army Reserve), who has served since 1977 on deployments to areas including Bosnia, South Korea, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He also served on the staff of the United States Army Chief of Chaplains, and after the Sept. 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, he served for five months as the senior chaplain for all military branches at Ground Zero. He was the only Jewish chaplain in Grenada in 1983, and during a two-month deployment to Iraq in 2003, he helped set up a sukkah (a religious requirement for the Jewish festival of Sukkot), in Saddam Hussein’s palace. Goldstein served with the National Guard, wearing the beard as a result of the waiver he received until he reached mandatory retirement age, when the U.S. Army Reserve approved his application to serve as a reserve chaplain, agreeing to retain the waiver.\n\nGoldstein's nephew, Rabbi Chesky Tenenbaum, was granted a 2007 waiver to serve in the Maryland Defense Force, a state military organization that primarily provides support to the Maryland National Guard. Tenenbaum said that he was thankful that, like his uncle, he successfully passed the \"beard threshold.\" In March 2008, the Georgia State Defense Force also approved its first waiver for a beard when Rabbi Zalman Lipskier was commissioned as a chaplain.\nMany observant Jews follow opinions by religious authorities who do not see beards as an absolute religious requirement, and at least one Orthodox rabbi, Shmuel Felzenberg, from the community known as Chabad—a group for whom beards are normally considered required—made the decision to shave (a very difficult decision for him, he admits) in order to serve as a military chaplain after discussing the matter with the rabbi he considers his teacher and mentor. Even though he says that shaving—even with the approval of his teacher—\"was ultimately a strong, bitter pill to swallow\", he does it in order to be \"afforded the opportunity to serve.\" However, he says he uses an electric razor, the approach to shaving that is least objectionable in terms of Jewish law (rather than a razor, which all rabbinic authorities agree is prohibited based on traditional Jewish law), and \"from the moment\" he goes on leave to \"the moment\" he must return to duty, he does not shave.\n\nHowever, for many other religiously observant Jews, even such compromises are unacceptable—because for them the prohibition is \"non-negotiable\". They base their beliefs on the ruling of rabbis such as the \"Tzemach Tzedek\", a past leader of the Chabad movement, who wrote that \"any means of removing hair from a man’s face is forbidden.\" That is the position taken by Menachem Stern—that he is \"strictly prohibited from shaving or removing\" his facial hair \"in any manner.\" In his original application for the chaplaincy, he wrote that \"by not trimming my beard, I represent the unadulterated view of the holy Torah, the way we believe a person should live.\"\n\nThe Army had argued that religious accommodation non-shaving waivers that have been granted since 2009 to Sikhs and Muslims cannot serve as precedents for Stern's request because the former are \"temporary\" and \"assignment specific\", can be rescinded at any time based on military necessity, and were granted to applicants who had already begun military service, whereas Stern is requesting a \"blanket waiver\" as a prerequisite for his service as a chaplain.\nHowever, in December 2011, news reports indicated that the suit against the army had been won, and Rabbi Stern would be allowed to serve without shaving his beard. Stern was sworn in and began serving as an Army chaplain in 2013, followed a year later by USAF chaplain, Rabbi Elie Estrin.\n\nThe basic Department of Defense Instruction on accommodation of military practices in the United States military was amended as of January 22, 2014. For the first time, \"grooming\" rules such as the wearing of beards, was brought under the rubric of \"religious accommodation,\" with procedures instituted for individual requests to wear beards for religious reasons.\n\nIn addition to religious apparel worn based on faith group requirements, the military ID tag, nicknamed \"dog tag,\" is the one government-issued uniform item that indicates the religion of military personnel. Two tags, each on a separate chain, are worn around the neck under the uniform, and in the case of death one is removed for record keeping and one is left on the body. While the tag helps to identify the body after loss of consciousness or death, and provides some immediate help to medical personnel (such as blood type), it includes religious affiliation (unless the individual has chosen to have \"no religious preference\" listed) so that, when possible, a chaplain of that person's faith group could respond, especially when specific religious rituals or ministrations such as \"last rites\" are indicated. Religious information also aids in decisions regarding care of the body, including arrangements for burial. Individuals can also wear a small religious symbol, such as a cross or Star of David (either personal or government-issue), on the ID chain, for personal reasons or to make speedy religious identification easier. Additionally, some religious groups supply small items for the chain as well, such as the mezuzah supplied to WWII Jewish personnel by the National Jewish Welfare Board.\nThe practice of keeping some tag or mark for identification in case of serious injury or death seems to have begun in the Civil War, when Americans first made them themselves and later were able to purchase commercially made tags, when civilian groups realized there might be a \"market\" for such items. In 1906 the Army made the tags official and required and ten years later, July 6, 1916, changed to the two tag requirement.\n\nDuring World War II, a dog tag could indicate only one of three religions through the inclusion of one letter: \"P\" for Protestant, \"C\" for Catholic, or \"H\" for Jewish (from the word \"Hebrew,\" for \"Hebrew faith\"), or \"NO\" or \"NONE\" (or just no religious designation letter) to indicate no religious preference. Army Regulation 606-5 soon included X and Y in addition to P, C, and H: the X indicating any religion not included in the first three, and the Y indicating either no religion or a choice not to list religion. In 1953, there was an effort to persuade the White House to have the military add a religious designation for Muslims on military tags, when WWII Army veteran Abdullah Igram wrote to President Dwight D. Eisenhower to say that he had tried unsuccessfully to have an \"M\" (for Muslim) added to his dog tags, and recommending that \"M\" for \"Muslim\" or \"I\" for \"Islam\" be added to the religious choices for future soldiers. The story of his efforts is retold in an article in the Toledo, Ohio \"Toledo Blade,\" with the headline, \"Vet leads U.S. Moslems in fight for recognition.\" According to Igram's family, the White House sent a letter thanking him for his suggestion, but Igram's widow confirmed that her late husband's efforts were not successful.\n\nBy the time of the Vietnam War, IDs spelled out the broad religious choices such as PROTESTANT and CATHOLIC, rather than using initials, and also began to show individual denominations such as \"METHODIST\" or \"BAPTIST.\" Tags did vary by service, however, such as the use of \"CATH,\" not \"CATHOLIC\" on some Navy tags. For those with no religious affiliation and those who chose not to list an affiliation, either the space for religion was left blank or the words \"NO PREFERENCE\" (or some variation, such as \"NO RELIGIOUS PREF\") were included.\n\nToday, military personnel can list any religion on their ID tags, and today's tags spell out religions and belief systems such as Wicca that would have fallen under the \"X\" (\"other\") category on WWII tags or \"Atheist,\"\n\nSome churches, like the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), provide information to members entering the military, stressing the importance of listing their religions correctly on ID tags. For LDS members, the Church's \"Military Relations Committee\" notes that some military reps might try to record their religion as \"Protestant,\" but directs that \"if anyone tries to list you as 'Protestant,' do not permit it.\" Members are told to ensure that the church's full name is recorded in their records and that \"Latter-Day Saints\" is embossed on their ID tags.\n\nWhile tags can be purchased commercially, military personnel programs allow only for certain selections. The Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers (MAAF) calls the regulations pertaining to religion on ID tags \"an immediate and constant source of discrimination in the military for many soldiers.\" MAAF has previously suggested administrative adjustments, but has most recently advised that the question be removed from the mandatory inprocessing and required that it be instead an optional selection.\n\nIronically, although the ID tags include religion as a way of ensuring that religious needs will be met, some personnel have them issued or reissued without religious affiliation listed—or keep two sets, one with the designation and one without—out of fear that identification as a member of a particular religion could increase the danger to their welfare or their lives if they fell into enemy hands. Some Jewish personnel avoided flying over German lines during WWII with ID tags that indicated their religion, and some Jewish personnel avoid the religious designation today out of concern that they could be captured by extremists who are anti-semitic. Additionally, when American troops were first sent to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War there were allegations that some United States military authorities were encouraging Jewish military personnel to avoid listing their religions on their ID tags. (It has been reported that Jewish personnel, along with others, were encouraged to \"use discretion\" when practicing their religion while deployed to Saudi Arabia). However, the story that some Jews were given military ID tags during the Gulf War with the designation \"Protestant-B\" as a code name for Jewish (a story included in one civilian writer's anthology of military stories she had been told by others, and then that one story was reprinted or quoted in many other in-print or online locations including Hadassah Magazine) has been the subject of much debate as to its veracity, with some military personnel stating that the story is \"absolutely false.\" There is at least one official record of a Jewish Marine requesting guidance from a Jewish organization about whether he should list his religion as Jewish on his tags, receiving a response strongly encouraging him to keep the designation on the tags.\n\nIn the Navy, when a chaplain leads a shipboard worship service, a \"worship pennant\" showing the Chaplain insignia of that chaplain's faith group is flown, over the United States flag. According to the United States Flag Code, \"No other flag or pennant should be placed above or, if on the same level, to the right of the flag of the United States of America, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains at sea, when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church services for the personnel of the Navy.\"\n\nThe original worship pennant (Church Pennant) displayed a cross but in 1975 the Secretary of the Navy approved a \"Jewish worship pennant,\" displaying the Jewish Chaplain insignia, originally with Roman numerals and later redesigned to include Hebrew letters within the design. While the worship pennants may also be flown ashore during worship services, they are only flown over the American flag when flown on a ship.\n\nThe Marine Corps Flag Manual authorizes the use of Navy worship pennants \"as authorized by commanding officers to designate the time and place of divine service, and in the field to indicate the chaplain's quarters or office.\" \n\nThe Army authorizes the use of official Chapel flags for display in Army military chapels, and very similar Chaplain flags (smaller than Chapel Flags and with no fringe) to mark the location of worship services led by a chaplain in the field. Chapel and Chaplain flags are dark blue with the appropriate chaplain insignia centered in white, and available as of 2011 for Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist chapel use.\n\nAdditionally, the Army has a number of other flags. There is a \"regimental color,\" housed at the United States Army Chaplain Center and School, that shows the emblem of the Chaplain Corps against a dark blue background, with a banner reading \"Chaplain Corps\" underneath it. There is also a \"positional color,\" housed in the Office of the Chief of Chaplains, showing the emblem of the Chaplain Corps against a white background, with a banner reading \"United States Army\" underneath it. Also, like all flag and general officers, both the Army Chief and Deputy Chief of Chaplains are authorized personal flags with one or two stars respectively, in accordance with their rank—but unlike most other Army general officer flags that have the white stars shown against a scarlet background, as of 1952 the color of the Chaplain Corps general officer flag background is \"ecclesiastical purple.\" The Chief and Deputy Chief of Chaplains of the Navy do not have distinctive flags, but instead use flags with blue stars superimposed on a white background along with other staff corps officers not eligible for command at sea, while line officers (those eligible for command at sea) use flags with white stars against a blue background. In the Air Force, all general officers including the Chief and Deputy Chief of Chaplains use the same individual (rank) flags, with white stars indicating rank against a blue background.\n\nThe Navy has a flag with the Chaplain Corps emblem against a white background, which is housed in the office of the United States Navy Chief of Chaplains.\n\nThe Air Force has a Chaplain Corps (formerly, Chaplain Service) Flag, also referred to as a \"Religious Flag.\"\nThe flag has the Chaplain Corps emblem against a blue background, with 2-inch yellow fringe along three edges, and is manufactured in two sizes—4 feet 4 inches by 5 feet 6 inches, and 3 feet by 4 feet. According to USAF Instruction (AFI 34-1201), the flag\n\nFlags with the emblem of the Army and Air Force are official flags, referenced in official documents, and in the case of the Army, produced by the Institute of Heraldry. The flag with the emblem of the United States Navy Chaplain Corps does not appear to have official status, but has rather been locally produced by the office of the Chief of Navy Chaplains.\n\nChapel and Chaplain flags are identical in design (except for the fringe on the chapel flag), but differ in size, with the Chapel flag's measuring 4 foot 4 inch hoist by 5 foot 6 inch fly, with a 2.5 inch white fringe, and the Chaplain's flag measuring a 2-foot hoist by 3 foot fly. Both Chapel and Chaplain flags incorporate the faith group insignia of the chaplain for whom the flag is flown. The Chapel flag is authorized to be flown only in military chapels, while the Chaplain's flag is \"used as authorized by commanders to designate the time and place of religious service and in the field to indicate the chaplain’s quarters or office.\"\n\nThe Army Chaplain School flag is an official flag, produced by The Institute of Heraldry. The flag for the Navy Chaplaincy School and Center is locally produced without official standing.The Air Force does not appear to use a Chaplain School flag.\n\nBeginning in 1940, the policy was established that military chapels would be constructed with no permanent religious symbols, exterior or interior:\n\nAlthough some older military chapels still include religious symbols, and some older military installations (including United States Service academies) maintain chapels dedicated for specific religious worship, all current instructions and design manuals for new chapel construction and chapel usage follow this 1940 policy, explicitly prohibiting the use of permanent religious symbols, and even direct that temporary religious symbols should be displayed only during scheduled religious services. So, for example, Army regulations state that:\n\nThe naval facilities design manual for chapels and religious educational facilities includes the following directions:\n\nSimilarly, training manuals for religious program specialists prescribe that chapels should be set up with no religious symbols except when the spaces are prepared for religious services:\nAir force design policies include the statement, \"Do not use religious symbols,\" in the section on \"Exterior elements,\" and continue the theme in various sections that deal with interior elements as well. For example, in the section on stained glass windows, instructions state \"Use stained glass windows in the sanctuary, the blessed sacrament and reconciliation room, and the all faiths room. Ensure they do not contain religious symbols.\" On the other hand, \"The chapel should be easily identifiable with a high, steeply pitched roof over the primary worship space. The use of stained glass sets chapel facilities apart as places of beauty and spiritual inspiration.\" The overall policy for religious symbols in air force chapels is summed up in the statement that \"Because of their multi-faith use, these facilities must be religiously neutral in design, as well as flexible in their programming. Liturgical furnishings specific to individual faith groups must therefore be moveable and architectural form, images and permanent ornamentation acceptable to all users.\"\n\nPolicies vary among military services when it comes to removing permanent religious symbols from the building or grounds of military chapels that are inconsistent with these policies, and decisions to remove existing symbols have sometimes been met with controversy.\n\nFor example, there was some controversy in 2008 when the army announced plans to remove three wooden crosses outside the chapel serving military personnel in Kosovo’s \"Camp Bondsteel,\" replacing them with a monument displaying the Chaplain Corps seal. In an interview with Fox News Channel, Lieutenant Colonel William D. Jenkins of the 35th Infantry Division's Kosovo Force 9 said that the Base Camp Planning Board approved the removal of the crosses in accordance with army regulations, which require the exterior to be free of any specific faith group symbols. Jenkins said that \"The interior of each U.S. Army chapel reflects faith-specific signs, symbols, etc., during each faith group's service so that their faith is fully represented during their service...[but]The exterior of Army chapels is a different matter since the chapels are used by many different faith groups.\" He said that the crosses would still be used during special services, such as the Easter Sunrise Service.\n\nSimilarly, a cross was removed from a military chapel in Afghanistan in November 2011, at the \"remote post\" of Marmal, based on the army regulations prohibiting permanent symbols of any religion or faith group.\nOn the other hand, in June 1998, the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland added a crescent to the exterior wall of its chapel, where a cross and Star of David were already displayed, rather than removing all symbols and replacing them with a more inclusive symbol. As of 2011, the new symbol for Buddhist chaplains has not been added.\n\nIn at least one case a religious symbol has been removed from a chapel and then reinstated when local base leadership changed. In 1994, the commander of Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut, at the recommendation of the base chaplain, had a cross removed from the top of the \"Chapel on the Thames,\" also known as the \"Sailors' Chapel\" and the \"Submarine Memorial Chapel.\" The cross, which was not part of the original chapel construction, but had been added some years later, was to be relocated within the chapel area where other religious symbols were kept. That action drew criticism from some individuals, including letters to the editor in the local civilian paper, and finally elicited an editorial in that paper defending the decision: \"Men of many faiths lost their lives on submarines...The changes being made to Navy places of worship are part of a larger effort to become sensitive to the dignity of all people who serve in the military... The Navy is a Navy not just of Christians, but of Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, and others.\" Despite positions articulated in statements such as this one, the next commanding officer had the cross replaced.\n\nBased on conversations in 2008 regarding crosses outside the chapel at Naval Air Station Atsugi in Japan, Navy policy sets a higher priority on removing permanent religious symbols from a chapel when it is the only chapel on a base. Where more than one chapel exists, Navy policy may be more lenient when it comes to existing symbols on one particular chapel. One example is Naval Station Norfolk's Frazier Hall, one of the Navy's oldest chapel complexes, where separate Catholic and Protestant chapels are co-located with Jewish and Muslim Chapels.\n\nThe rule requiring chapels to be religiously neutral except during a religious worship service also applies to Veterans Administration chapels. In 2008, the chaplain of the Veterans Affairs hospital in Fayetteville, North Carolina resigned when Christian symbols were removed from the hospital chapel—after complaints of religious insensitivity regarding chapel symbols were lodged following a non-denominational ceremony in that chapel to remember victims of the September 11 attacks.\n\nA slightly different issue involving a cross on a military base—but erected separately from a chapel as a memorial to marines killed in Afghanistan—involves a 13-foot cross erected on top of a hill at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, in California. The American Center for Law & Justice is arguing on the part of those who erected the cross that it should be allowed to stay because \"crosses are used as a widespread and universal symbol of remembrance,\" not just as religious symbols, while other groups, such as the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers, are arguing that the cross should not be allowed to remain. A similar cross was erected in 2003, but was destroyed in a fire, so the new cross has been created with \"fire-retardant\" material. A spokesman for Camp Pendleton was quoted as saying that the Camp Pendleton \"legal staff is carefully researching and reviewing the topic in order to make a balanced and unbiased command recommendation that is ultimately supported by the law.\"\n\nIn 2010, vandals used a religious symbol in a negative way, adding a wooden cross to a non-Christian military worship area as an apparent attempt to make an anti-religious statement against the \"Earth-centered\" worship area (\"stone circle\") set aside at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) for the use of adherents of faith groups that identify themselves as \"Pagans,\" such as Wiccans or Druids. According to the local Colorado Springs gazette, \"Whoever left the cross exploited the most sacred object of Christianity for an act of confrontation.\"\n\nLieutenant General Michael C. Gould, USAFA Superintendent, said that it was important that the academy support the religious needs of all cadets, and that USAF Instruction 36-2706 gives air force leaders guidance in terms of defining \"religion\" as \"a personal set or institutional system of attitudes, moral or ethical beliefs and practices held with the strength of traditional religious views, characterized by ardor and faith and generally evidenced through specific religious observances.\"\n\nGould said that the incident was being taken very seriously, because respect for the religious beliefs of others is an especially important lesson for USAFA cadets, who \"learn that to succeed as an Air Force officer we must be able to support and respect the people who we lead, serve with and fight alongside even if they do not share our personal beliefs... Cadets learn that every servicemember is charged with defending freedom for all Americans and that includes the freedom to practice a religion of their choice or to not practice any religion at all.\"\n\nAcademy officials took actions to send a clear message that the \"Cadet Chapel Falcon Circle,\" the area set aside for Earth-centered worship, \"is to be treated with respect and dignity, just as any other religious structure or location.\"\n\nIt has been pointed out that in some ways the lack of permanent symbols itself becomes a symbol: \"a visible symbol of how people of different beliefs can not only tolerate one another, they can live in the same house.\"\n\nThe history of government issued headstones predates the Veterans Administration and the National Cemetery Administration, with roots that can be traced back to America's frontier days, when garrison commanders took on the responsibility of burying their soldiers. However, it was not until the creation of the national army that was established at the beginning of the Civil War that army regulations (General Orders Number 75, September 11, 1861) assigned the national commanders of the military with the responsibility for burials and grave markings—and the Quartermaster General of the Army was tasked with providing the actual \"headboards.\" Much later, following World War I, a board of officers approved the white marble headstone, slightly rounded at the top—and for the first time, two specific religious markings (the Latin Cross for Christians, and the Star of David for Jews) were authorized for use. Changes in construction and designed continued to be made, and in February 1951, he Secretary of the Army approved the addition of a Buddhist emblem in addition to the Cross and the Star.\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) establishes policies for religious symbols on headstones and markers in United States National Cemeteries, although the US Department of the Army continues to oversee two of them, including Arlington National Cemetery. In contrast with the small number of religious symbols that have been approved by DOD over the years for chaplain insignia, the VA has approved over forty five separate religious symbols for use on cemetery headstones and markers (those used in national cemeteries and those issued to families of eligible veterans for use in private cemeteries) and has a process in place to consider and approve additional religious symbols based on requests by the next of kin of the deceased.\n\nAlthough current procedures allow for speedy approvals of new religious symbols, the pentacle (the pentagram within a circle), the symbol now used for Wiccan headstones and markers, was approved only after ten years of efforts that concluded with a lawsuit against the VA, resulting in a settlement that accorded that symbol the same status as any other religious or belief system allowed.\n\nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State represented the plaintiffs, saying that \"we uncovered evidence that the reason the pentagram hadn't been approved was straightforward religious bias... The Justice Department knew that if they didn't do the right thing, then a federal judge would tell them to and, in the process, would state very publicly all the things they've done wrong over the past decade.\"\n\nThe first \"interfaith\" headstone—including a Wiccan Pentacle for Jan Deanna O'Rourke and a Christian Cross for her husband—was installed at Arlington National Cemetery on May 1, 2007, and dedicated on July 4, 2007.\n\nIn addition to individual gravesites, a number of memorials to United States military chaplains who died while on active duty have been or are in the process of being erected at Arlington National Ceremony, in an area called \"Chaplains Hill,\" to symbolize the ultimate sacrifice of military chaplains. Before 2011, three chaplain memorials existed at Arlington: one for all chaplains who died on active duty during WWI, and two others for chaplains who have died since then—one for Roman Catholic chaplains and one for Protestant chaplains.\n\nOn October 24, 2011, a fourth memorial was unveiled during a dedication ceremony at the cemetery, listing the names of the fourteen Jewish chaplains who have died on active duty.\n\nThe first memorial, remembering twenty-three chaplains who died during WWI, was dedicated on May 5, 1926. The memorial includes two quotations: \"Greater Love Hath No Man Than This, That A Man Lay Down His Life For His Friends,\" and \"To You From Falling Hands We Throw The Torch – Be Yours To Hold It High.\"\n\nThe memorial to 134 Protestant chaplains who lost their lives in WWI and WWII was dedicated in Arlington Cemetery on October 26, 1981 (although according to the information on its plaque, it had been created earlier and located in the Washington, D.C. Memorial Chapel of the General Commission on Chaplains and Armed Forces Personnel Building) and bears the words \"To the Glory of God and the Memory of the Chaplains Who Died in Services Of Their Country.\" On May 21, 1989, the third memorial—in memory of 83 Catholic chaplains who died in WWII, in the Korean War, and in the Vietnam War—was dedicated, with the inscription \"May God Grant Peace to Them and to the Nation They Served So Well.\"\n\nThe fourth chaplain memorial to be approved is the memorial for thirteen fallen Jewish chaplains, approved by the United States House of Representatives on May 24, 2011, Although designed and paid for with private funds, congressional authorization was required for the memorial to be created and installed.\n\nRetired navy Chaplain Harold Robinson, current Director of the JWB Jewish Chaplains Council (a part of the \"Jewish Community Centers Association\" (JCCA)), was one of the leaders in the effort to establish the Jewish Chaplains Memorial. Speaking of the need to add the memorial to those already present to honor fallen Protestant and Catholic chaplains, Robinson said that \"It's a matter of principle. It's a matter of keeping faith with those who kept faith with us. There are about 255 chaplains who died in active service; 242 of them are memorialized on Chaplains Hill. From my perspective that's wrong.\"\n\nThe idea for the memorial was the brainchild of Ken Kraetzer, a member of the Sons of the American Legion, who learned that three of the famous four chaplains who died on board the troop transport were immortalized at Arlington, but not the Jewish chaplain, Rabbi Goode. He helped mobilize other individuals and groups, including the Jewish Federations of North America, the Jewish War Veterans, and the JCCA, to help work toward the memorial's creation.\n\nThe monument was designed by New York artist Deborah Jackson, with the understanding that the design had to be approved by both the Secretary of the Army and the United States Commission of Fine Arts (which met in June 2011) after which time fabrication of the monument plaque began. Before the actual installation and dedication at Arlington Cemetery, creators and backers of the monument first arranged for it to \"go on tour to different communities, giving people a chance to see it and learn more about the role of Jewish chaplains.\" According to the JWB Jewish Chaplains Council the plan is to dedicate the monument during the fall of 2011, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Jewish chaplaincy, based on the Civil War commissioning of the first Jewish chaplain. In addition to the names of the thirteen fallen Jewish chaplains, the memorial will include the words of a Jewish folk proverb, \"I ask not for a lighter burden, but for broader shoulders.\"\n\nIn a ceremony \"steeped in Hebrew prayers and military hymns,\" the fourth memorial was unveiled and dedicated on October 24, 2011.\n\nAlthough no symbol incorporated into the design of the American flag has ever officially been given religious meaning by the United States government, there is a military ceremony of folding the flag into a triangle before presenting it during military ceremonies—including ceremonies such as official retirements or the retirement portion of a \"change of command,\" or the military portion of a burial ceremony—that has sometimes been associated with religious symbolism.\n\nThe exact origin of the tradition or the words that accompany it is uncertain, although it is believed that it most likely began during World War I \"when patriotism was high and the United States Flag was universally embraced as a national symbol\".\n\nOver the years, various \"scripts\" have been developed for such ceremonies, to be read at each step of the folding, and some of these have linked the flag to religion in general or to a specific religious faith group in particular. Because such scripts can give the impression that either Congress or the military (or a specific branch of the military) had assigned a specific religious significance to the military tradition of folding the flag, military efforts have been made to ensure that any words recited during the ceremony avoid giving such an impression. So, for example, the Air Force issued an official flag folding script in 2006 which ends with these words:\nAir Force Instruction 34-1201 includes the following guidance:\nThe Veterans Administration has published guidance that the reading of religious words to accompany the folding of the flags at burials within V.A. cemeteries will be allowed when requested by the family of the deceased. Groups such as the American Legion offer versions of the script that include religious meanings, and current V.A. policy is that \"Volunteer honor guards will accept requests for recitations that reflect any or no religious traditions, on an equal basis.\" However, the volunteers should be relatives or friends, rather than \"federal employees\" of the Veterans Administration.\n\nThe \"National Flag Foundation,\" a group that describes itself as \"America's leading non-profit patriotic educational organization promoting respect for our nation's most important symbol: The Flag of the United States of America,\" has developed a script that it recommends for use during a twelve-step flag-folding ceremony at burials. Its script links to the folds to \"national virtues,\" including those attributed to the colors of the Flag as specified in 1782 by Charles Thomson, then Secretary of Congress. The virtues linked to the folds of the flag in the National Flag Foundation script include: liberty, unity, justice, perseverance, hardiness, valor, purity, innocence, sacrifice, honor, independence, and truth.\n\nAt the United States Naval Academy, a tradition developed that included marching flags, including the American flag, up the aisle of the chapel during Protestant services, briefly dipping the flags toward the altar. According to an academy spokesman quoted in a 2006 article, this flag-dipping ritual at the USNA Protestant chapel \"is the only one throughout the Navy where the flag has been incorporated in that way.\"\n\nIn the Fall of 2007, when complaints were made that dipping the flag toward a religious altar was inappropriate, then-academy Superintendent Vice Admiral Jeffrey Fowler directed that the practice be discontinued. However, after some controversy, the practice was reinstated.\nClark Rogers, Director of educational programs for the National Flag Foundation, was quoted as saying that he realizes that different branches of the military have their own traditions, but \"the United States Flag Code says the flag should not be dipped for any person or thing.\" The practice of refusing to dip the flag based on the flag code is most well known in regards to the world Olympic Games, where the United States team has refused to dip the flag toward any nation's leaders since 1936. Some United States naval officers have pointed out that \"Naval Telecommunications Procedures: Flags, Pennants and Customs\" states that the \"Navy allows American ships to lower their flags if returning a salute, but not to be the first one to dip their colors.\" Dipping first is a sign of disrespect as stated in the Flag Code: \"No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing.\"\n\nIn January 2010 news reports revealed that Trijicon, a Wixom, Michigan-based contractor used by the United States military, had been inscribing \"secret codes\" for New Testament Bible verses on rifle scopes used by United States Army and Marine Corps forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. Citations included references to Jesus as \"the light of the world\", and were added without United States military approval or knowledge. So, for example, the code \"2COR4:6\", located near the string of letters and numerals used for other manufacturing information such as serial numbers, was a reference to verse 4:6 in the New Testament book Second Corinthians: \"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.\"\nUnited States military leaders reacted with surprise, expressing concern based on the fact that \"U.S. military rules specifically prohibit the proselytizing of any religion in Iraq or Afghanistan and were drawn up in order to prevent criticism that the U.S. was embarked on a religious 'Crusade' in its war against al Qaeda and Iraqi insurgents.\" Defense Department photos revealed that the rifles that included the verses were being used by Iraqi forces that included Muslims who had no knowledge of the Christian Bible verses on the sights. The Al Jazeera news service reported that the fact that weapons with \"Christian references\" had been distributed to Afghan soldiers would provide the Taliban with a \"propaganda coup.\" Similarly, the United States-based \"Muslim Public Affairs Council\" warned that this practice \"would stoke the fires of extremists who accuse the United States of carrying out a religious crusade in Asia and the Middle East.\"\n\nABC news consultant and retired army Major General William Nash was quoted by ABC news as saying he had \"no problem\" with organizations providing Bibles and other religious tracts to United States troops. \"But I do have a problem,\" said Nash, \"with military equipment being labeled in a way where it seems like it's our god against their god.\" Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) president Mikey Weinstein said that a private company can do whatever it wants to, but when a company becomes a defense contractor, responsibilities change. MRFF, one of the lead organizations in publicizing the problem—helping to break the stories on ABC news and \"Nightline\"—was initially criticized by Trijicon as a \"non-Christian\" group, but criticism of the verses on military weapons was quickly leveled by numerous secular and religious groups, including Christian and interfaith organizations. In fact, the reaction to the discovery was referred to as \"a maelstrom of media attention and criticism.\"\n\nSome initial military reactions seemed to dismiss the news as if it were of little importance, with one spokesperson comparing the verses to the presence of the phrase \"In God we Trust\" on United States currency. However General David Petraeus left no doubt that senior commanders, once apprised of the situation, considered the situation to be extremely serious. Delivering what news reports called a \"stinging criticism of the contractor,\" Petraeus said that \"It is disturbing. This is a serious concern to me and to the other commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan because it indeed conveys a perception that is absolutely contrary to what we have sought to do.\" Petraeus added that \"There’s a reason that we put people through cultural awareness training...I can assure you that there is much greater sensitivity among our troops about this sort of thing than apparently there is from the contractor.\"\n\nTrijicon's sales director reported that the practice of putting Bible references on their products, including gun scopes, had been continuing for almost 30 years, begun by Glyn Bindon, the founder of the company, and continued by his son Stephen after Glyn Bindon's death. The company said it had sold similar rifle sights to militaries in Australia, New Zealand, and Great Britain. However, \"bowing to Pentagon concerns and an international outcry,\" Trijicon announced that it would \"immediately\" stop embossing the verses on products produced for any military. Additionally, it was providing \"modification kits\" to remove the inscriptions from weapons already purchased. The Trijicon website (FAQs section) includes a note that their products for consumers other than the military will continue to be inscribed with the Bible references.\n\nIn 2009, military leaders discarded and burned \"unsolicited\" Bibles sent to a soldier in Afghanistan by a United States church that had located Bibles translated into Dari and Pashto, \"the two most common Afghan languages.\" Military spokespersons said that the Bibles could be used for proselytization of Muslims (or contribute to the perception that United States troops were engaged in proselytization), actions which are strictly against United States policy for deployed troops. Central Command \"General Order Number 1\" (updated as General Order Number 1B), specifically prohibits \"proselytizing of any faith, religion, or practice,\" and military representatives say that \"\"if actions were perceived in this manner,\" they could \"endanger American troops and civilians in the devoutly Muslim nation.\" According to Afghan law, it is a crime to try to convert a Muslim to another faith.\"\n\nNews about the Bibles had reached the Al Jezeera network, which had broadcast a story about the possibility that American troops were violating anti-proselytization rules. The report included video footage of U.S. Army Chaplain (Lieutenant Colonel) Gary Hensley telling soldiers that they had a responsibility to \"hunt people for Jesus\": \"The special forces guys—they hunt men basically. We do the same things as Christians, we hunt people for Jesus. We do, we hunt them down... Get the hound of heaven after them, so we get them into the kingdom. That's what we do, that's our business.\" The footage shows a discussion between soldiers and their chaplain discussing how the Bibles might be distributed without violating the military's general order against proselytization, \"although they don't arrive at any clear plan.\" When a reporter from Al Jazeera brought up the issue of using the Bibles to proselytize Afghans during a May 4, 2009, Pentagon news conference, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen stated that \"from the United States military's perspective,\" it is \"not our position to ever push any specific kind of religion. Period.\"\n\nBibles and other religious materials have been provided to support the free exercise of religion on the part of military personnel for many years, including some distributed at no cost or reduced cost by organizations such as the American Bible Society (ABS), often using approaches by these groups that \"partnered with Chaplains for distribution to troops and sailors, airmen and marines.\" In fact, \"Upon its founding the ABS immediately began distributing Bibles to military servicemen, with sailors of the USS \"John Adams\" being the first recipients in 1817.\" During World War II, the military supply system began to include religious materials for military personnel, and at the request of then-Army Chief of Chaplains (Major General) William R. Arnold, the Government Printing Office (GPO) began printing various versions of the Bible: a Roman Catholic version of the New Testament in 1941–42, a Protestant version in 1942, and a Jewish version of the Hebrew Scriptures in 1941–42. (According to Bible scholar John D. Laing, it is possible that the reason that only Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish holy books were printed was that those were the three faith groups represented by chaplains at that time.)\n\nFor a number of reasons, including the fact that \"one Bible does not fit all\", and different chaplains and religious communities preferred different versions of the Bible, such items are no longer printed by the GPO, but \"instead publishers may apply for a national stock number their items and chaplains can order the supplies they wish to use or have on hand for distribution to their service members.\" Through this process, \"there are numerous versions of the Bible available for order through official channels with government funds.\"\nSome civilian groups, like the \"Military Bible Association\", work to produce and distribute Bibles to military personnel as part of their mission statements. The Military Bible Association advertises that it has produced a \"Leader's Bible\" that is \"an update of the King James Bible created by \"military chaplains\": \"The Military Bible Association was founded to provide military men and women with The Leader’s Bible, an update of the King James Version by Military Chaplains. The Military Bible Association realizes the need to reach out to the military, because military personnel are often a forgotten group, who need the love of Christ.\" Although \"military chaplains\" are credited with helping to create the Bible, and the cover of the book includes the words \"translated by military chaplains,\" chaplains actually mentioned by name on the website—either endorsing the Bible or as members of the organization—are retired from the military.\n\nHowever, while many groups work to provide Bibles for the military, sometimes promoting their relationships with retired or active duty chaplains, the actual use of military symbols—the emblem of the Department of Defense or emblems for one or more branches of the military—on Bibles available for purchase became a source of controversy in 2005. Some of these Bibles—printed and published by civilian publishing houses or churches—bear titles such as \"The Soldier’s Bible\" or \"The Airman’s Bible,\" which (according to critics) when linked to the symbols might give the impression that the military is endorsing (or even \"establishing\") religion in general, or the specific religion or faith group for whom one particular version of the Bible is considered holy.\n\nAccording to news reports, the army’s position is that official military symbols can only be used with the permission of \"The Institute of Heraldry\", which authorizes usage on publications of \"an official or quasi-official nature.\" Critics claimed that Holman Bible Publishers (owned by the Southern Baptist Convention), the publisher of many versions of military Bibles that feature official emblems, was using the emblems without authorization, but Ricky King, Holman’s product development manager, said that the company has \"written permission on file from each branch of the military service.\" Additionally, the Bibles do include a statement, \"set in small type on the third page at the front,\" that \"The seal of the Army is used by permission but in no way carries the endorsement of this product by the U.S. Army, the Department of Defense or the government of the United States.\" Some constitutional lawyers point out that a disclaimer \"is not a sure-fire means to avoid First Amendment litigation. Ronald Eades, University of Louisville School of Law explains that \"disclaimers help, but they're not a perfect solution.\" However, because permission to use the emblems was on file, the publisher has continued to print the Bibles.\n\nHowever, National Public Radio published an article in its on-line edition, written by Jeff Brady and entitled \"’The Soldier’s Bible’ draws fire,\" which said that the emblems make the Bibles appear to be \"official government publications.\" In addition to the emblems, \"inspirational words\" from a number of military leaders are included on the back cover. Barry Lind, representing Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said that the Bibles could give the impression that the military is \"promoting a particular evangelical religious viewpoint.\"\n\nEarlier, in April 2003, the American Bible Society had already published an edition of the Bible titled \"The Holy Bible (Good News Translation/GNT): Armed Forces Edition\" which also had official military emblems on the front and back covers: the emblems of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Chaplain Corps on the front, and the emblems of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard on the back. The ABS describes this work as \"A historic Military Bible developed with the Chiefs of Chaplains of the Armed Services. Easy to read and understand Good News Translation in Desert camouflage cover. Includes photos of military personnel from all branches, familiar hymns, inspirational quotations.\" According to news reports, the practice of having chaplains distribute Bibles to those who desire them is a long-standing tradition in the military, but \"showing favoritism [by the military or the Chaplain Corps] toward a particular religion would constitute establishment.\" Therefore, although this edition of the Bible includes a welcome letter from the three military Chiefs of Chaplains at the time it was published—Major General Gaylord T. Gunhus, United States Army, Rear Admiral Barry C. Black, United States Navy, and Lorraine K. Potter, United States Air Force—that letter notes that \"Department of Defense chaplains represent the American landscape of faith groups and religious communities,\" and that because the Bible is both \"the most influential book in all human history\" and \"for many a constant companion to aid in directing one's life\":\n\nJune 2012 news sources announced that permission granted to use military emblems on Bibles had been revoked, with publishers notified in 2011 that the decision was made based on new military trademark licensing issues. One navy spokesman quoted in a Fox News online report stated that the decision was a \"trademark issue,\" and \"not a matter of religion.\" Additionally, the Department of Defense announced that all Bibles with military emblems must be removed from military stores. The Military Religious Freedom Foundation had threatened to sue the government if permission to use military emblems on Bibles was not revoked, noting that the Bibles were both an \"unconstitutional government endorsement of religion\" and a \"national security threat.\"\n\nThe use of military emblems on \"prayer coins\" created by the \"American Defenders of Freedom\" (ADOF), distributed at no charge to military chaplains only if the chaplains clearly indicate on the order forms \"how tracts/coins will be used for evangelism\"\nis another example of a controversy regarding military symbols and religious materials. ADOF materials state that: \"To obtain our materials without charge the Chaplain must describe in his/her order how our materials will be used in an evangelism process to share the Gospel message of Jesus Christ. Chaplains will be required to pay for Prayer Coins used for other than ministry purposes, such as awards, recognitions, remembrances, etc.\" Additionally, ADOF notes that \"Prayer Tracts and Prayer Reminder Coins are provided without charge to Chaplains for evangelistic Christian Ministry to troops, sailors, airmen and marines. Coins may also be purchased for special uses other than ministry…\"\n\nWhile coins had the emblems of the army, navy, and air force until 2008, Secretary of the Navy Donald C. Winter withdrew Navy permission to use its seal, necessitating a redesign of the coins to include army and air force emblems—announced in ADOF's January 2008 newsletter with the following statement: \"\"The Navy Prayer Reminder Coin was completely re-designed (an improvement) because the Secretary of the Navy would not give permission to use the official Navy seal on the Navy Prayer Reminder Coin – Satan is always at work.\"\n\nWhile most issues involving the military and religious apparel involve requests from service personnel for permission to wear apparel required by their own religions, in December 2001 air force Lieutenant Colonel Martha McSally (a graduate of the Air Force Academy, and then the highest-ranking female fighter pilot in the air force) sued the air force because of the policy that required female military personnel assigned to bases in Saudi Arabia to wear the Muslim abaya, a \"head-to-toe\" robe, whenever they were off base. McSally's suit alleged that \"the regulations required her to send the message that she believes women are subservient to men.\" In addition to the issue of religious garb, McSally noted that policies also included other requirements:\n\nGeneral Tommy Franks, head of the United States Central Command, announced in 2002 that women would no longer be required to wear the abaya, although they would be \"encouraged\" to do so as a show of respect for local customs. Commenting on the change—which was strongly criticized by Saudi officials as both a violation of Islamic law and Saudi sovereignty—Central Command spokesman Colonel Rick Thomas said it was not made because of McSally's lawsuit, but had already been \"under review\" before the lawsuit was filed. News reports noted that McSally had been fighting for a change in the policy for seven years, and had filed the lawsuit after she had been threatened with a court martial if she did not comply and wear the abaya.\n\nCritics of the policy noted that while female military personnel had been required to wear the abaya, the situation was not the same for \"women diplomats\" assigned to the United States Embassy in Riyadh, who were actually encouraged not to wear the abaya when they were involved in official business, \"because they are representing the United States.\" Embassy officials stated that \"in their personal time, embassy employees can choose how to dress.\" According to these United States officials, \"the Saudi government does not require non-Muslim women to wear a dark robe known as an abaya... The official guidance, issued by the Saudi Embassy in Washington, says that foreigners should dress conservatively but they are not required to wear the robe.\"\n\nEventually Congress \"approved legislation that prohibited anyone in the military from requiring or encouraging servicewomen to put on abayas in Saudi Arabia or to use taxpayers’ money to buy them.\"\n\nNearly a decade after the abaya requirement was rescinded in Saudi Arabia, \"strong encouragement\" to wear the hijab, a female headscarf, was the military policy in force for female personnel stationed in Afghanistan. Some female personnel wear it over their helmets and some chose to wear the scarves in place of their helmets. According to McSally, \"Some servicewomen have taken off the regulation helmet and worn just the scarf, even when on patrol outside, in their combat uniforms and body armor, M-4s slung over their shoulders. The more common practice is to wear the scarf under one’s helmet or around the neck, pulling it on as the servicewoman removes her Kevlar helmet upon entering a village or building.\"\n\nWhile the military defends the policy of encouragement to wear the hijab as a \"sign of respect\" to the local culture that \"\"can help promote greater trust and a fuller interaction with the local population,\" McSally, who retired from the air force as a colonel, said that \"especially in combat settings,\" when a superior tells a military subordinate that a practice is encouraged, \"the very mention of the practice creates pressure to comply.\" In a February 18, 2011 op-ed in \"The Washington Post,\" she said that the policy of encouraging women to wear the \"Muslim headscarves\" is \"appeasement, not respect\" and that \"American servicewomen will continue to be viewed as second-class warriors if leaders push them to take up the customs of countries where women are second-class citizens.\" She wrote that \"Top military leaders should issue guidance that U.S. servicewomen are not authorized to wear a Muslim headscarf while in their uniform conducting military duties. If they don't, Congress should intervene again, as they did on the abaya, and prohibit its wear.\"\n\nThe basic words \"chaplain\" and \"chapel\" are derived from an ancient story about symbols of religion and faith:\n\nChaplains no longer guard a \"relic\" like St. Martin's cloak, but they themselves have been called symbols of service, faith, hope, and cooperation across faith lines, and even reminders of \"the presence of God\" in stories such as that of the \"Four Chaplains\" (sometimes referred to as the \"Immortal Chaplains\")—two ministers, a Catholic priest, and a rabbi—who each gave up his life jacket to save others when the was torpedoed during WWII, and the four Army chaplains ministered to the wounded and dying until they themselves died. That story, told in print, art, and film has become a symbol of \"interfaith in action,\" the phrase used by the Four Chaplains Memorial Foundation, and included on the 1948 postage stamp dedicated to their memory. Vassar College professor Deborah Dash Moore has referred to the story of the Four Chaplains by saying that \"The symbolism of their deaths exemplified faith confronting diversity, the triumph of cooperation over religious competition, the ultimate sacrifice by officers for their men, the power of duty over death.\"\n\nUniversity of Toronto professor Doris L. Bergen has written that because of the \"chaos and terror\" encountered during military service, the chaplain becomes \"a symbol that somehow, even in the midst of death and fear, there is meaning,\" and a symbol of the ability to maintain \"courage, hope, and steadfastness in the face of alienation and destruction.\" According to a letter from the three military Chiefs of Chaplains that was included in the 2003 edition of the American Bible Society's \"Armed Forces Bible,\" chaplains are \"a visible reminder of the Holy.\" Similarly, an August 2011 Washington Post \"Guest Voice\" op-ed noted that:\n\nFor both military personnel and civilians, the work of chaplains became a symbol of cooperation that crossed many lines, including racial lines at a time when such cooperation was considered noteworthy (and even newsworthy) in the civilian community—as evidenced by a 1943 newsreel of Army Chaplain School training (then at Harvard University) which featured captions such as \"White and Negro chaplains come out of the school building and march,\" and \"White and Negro Chaplains perform a drill at Harvard University Chaplain School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\"\n\nScholars have noted that interfaith cooperation among chaplains in the military led to improved interfaith relations in America—to the point that, at least according to some, it actually \"transformed religion in America in the postwar period\"\nCivilian communities felt the impact where former chaplains left the military to take positions at civilian houses of worship, but even where that did not happen, citizens were affected by the stories of military personnel and their chaplains, which became symbols of both cooperation across faith lines and faith in the face of adversity. Additionally, the military chaplain became a symbol in some religious communities (such as the Jewish community) for the kind of spiritual leader its members desired for themselves:\n\nWhen President Reagan quoted the words that the service of chaplains during and after the 1983 Beirut bombing symbolized that \"we Americans still believed that we could be proud of our particular religions and yet work side by side when the time came to help others, to comfort, and to ease pain,\" that speech was one of many that saw the presence of military chaplains as both a symbol of faith and a symbol of interfaith cooperation and respect. In the words of that report:\n\n\n\n"}

It features mutual criticism of religion as well as interfaith dialogue. The participants also travel across the Netherlands to visit houses of worship, an abortion clinic and a halal slaughterhouse amongst other places, and cook together despite their widely varying ethical views on food.\n\nThe EO hopes the programme will show what 'religious stress' does to the candidates, and what effect this has on their beliefs. Just before the first episode was broadcast, the EO published a survey about religious stress amongst Dutch citizens, which showed amongst other things that 93% of the population is in favour of freedom of speech, and 82% supports freedom of religion, but almost half think that religion should not be professed in public. Previously, the EO made similar programmes about refugees (\"Rot op naar je eigen land\", \"Piss Off To Your Own Country\", 2015) and environmental issues (\"Rot op met je milieu\", \"Get Lost With Your Environment\", 2016).\n\nStichting KijkOnderzoek, a ratings tracking service, reported that about 531,000 people watched the first episode.\n\nAccording to \"NRC Handelsblad\", the EO used the programme to deliberately fan the flames of religious stress, and by their selection of participants created an unfair representation of the various worldviews: \"The casting wants us to primarily look for reasonableness amongst the four religious participants (...). Even the two non-believers clash occasionally, because one is vegan and the other finds that to be politically correct bullshit. In short: in the first episode, the religious stress isn't quite fairly distributed yet between the followers of God and those who reject the existence of the fairytale character of god.\"\n\nAfter three episodes, \"de Volkskrant\", too, concluded that \"the EO does everything within their power to let all hell break loose. There is no live and let live.\" Just like in the previous \"Rot op\" series, the programme would primarily be \"about confrontation, heated discussions and perhaps a vain hope of reconciliation.\" It noted that the most fierce nonbeliever, Floris, \"is portrayed the least sympathetic by the montage so far.\" On the preview of the fourth episode, in which Safeer shows his unease when meeting a gay Muslim, the newspaper's reviewer (referencing ) commented: \"Someone saw the announcement, and saw it was not good. \"Stress!\"\"\nA critic from ThePostOnline disagreed with the \"Volkskrant\"'s criticism of the montage: \"By definition, media select that which is appetising.\" On the contrary, 'sensational television' is interesting, especially to discover who 'understands the art of living and tolerance best'. In his opinion, the atheist and vegan Floris, \"whose raised voice against his religious fellow man may go into Dutch television history as legendary\", drawing the comparison to the late politician Pim Fortuyn, finishes last in this regard, followed by the imam Safeer, whilst sympathy for the atheist Bryan is growing throughout the series, and the Jewish Sheila has had the audience's sympathy from the beginning. Furthermore, the EO allegedly lacked a sense of humour, and the idea of 'let it be' would only rarely feature in the show.\n\n"}
{"id": "4393502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4393502", "title": "Sacred architecture", "text": "Sacred architecture\n\nSacred architecture (also known as religious architecture) is a religious architectural practice concerned with the design and construction of places of worship or sacred or intentional space, such as churches, mosques, stupas, synagogues, and temples. Many cultures devoted considerable resources to their sacred architecture and places of worship. Religious and sacred spaces are amongst the most impressive and permanent monolithic buildings created by humanity. Conversely, sacred architecture as a locale for meta-intimacy may also be non-monolithic, ephemeral and intensely private, personal and non-public.\n\nSacred, religious and holy structures often evolved over centuries and were the largest buildings in the world, prior to the modern skyscraper. While the various styles employed in sacred architecture sometimes reflected trends in other structures, these styles also remained unique from the contemporary architecture used in other structures. With the rise of Abrahamic monotheisms (particularly Christianity and Islam), religious buildings increasingly became centres of worship, prayer and meditation.\n\nThe Western scholarly discipline of the history of architecture itself closely follows the history of religious architecture from ancient times until the Baroque period, at least. Sacred geometry, iconography, and the use of sophisticated semiotics such as signs, symbols and religious motifs are endemic to sacred architecture.\n\nSacred or religious architecture is sometimes called sacred space.\n\nArchitect Norman L. Koonce has suggested that the goal of sacred architecture is to make \"transparent the boundary between matter and mind, flesh and the spirit.\" In discussing sacred architecture, Protestant minister Robert Schuller suggested that \"to be psychologically healthy, human beings need to experience their natural setting—the setting we were designed for, which is the garden.\" Meanwhile, Richard Kieckhefer suggests that entering into a religious building is a metaphor for entering into spiritual relationship. Kieckhefer suggests that sacred space can be analyzed by three factors affecting spiritual process: longitudinal space emphasizes the procession and return of sacramental acts, auditorium space is suggestive of proclamation and response, and new forms of communal space designed for gathering and return depend to a great degree on minimized scale to enhance intimacy and participation in worship.\n\nSacred architecture spans a number of ancient architectural styles including Neolithic architecture, ancient Egyptian architecture and Sumerian architecture. Ancient religious buildings, particularly temples, were often viewed as the dwelling place, the \"temenos\", of the gods and were used as the site of various kinds of sacrifice. Ancient tombs and burial structures are also examples of architectural structures reflecting religious beliefs of their various societies. The Temple of Karnak at Thebes, Egypt was constructed across a period of 1300 years and its numerous temples comprise what may be the largest religious structure ever built. Ancient Egyptian religious architecture has fascinated archaeologists and captured the public imagination for millennia.\n\nAround 600 BCE the wooden columns of the Temple of Hera at Olympia were replaced by stone columns. With the spread of this process to other sanctuary structures a few stone buildings have survived through the ages. Greek architecture preceded Hellenistic and Roman periods (Roman architecture heavily copied Greek). Since temples are the only buildings which survive in numbers, most of our concept of classical architecture is based on religious structures. The Parthenon which served as a treasury building as well as a place for veneration of deity, is widely regarded as the greatest example of classical architecture.\n\nIndian architecture is related to the history and religions of the time periods as well as to the geography and geology of the Indian subcontinent. India was crisscrossed by trading routes of merchants from as far away as Siraf and China as well as weathering invasions by foreigners, resulting in multiple influences of foreign elements on native styles. The diversity of Indian culture is represented in its architecture. Indian architecture comprises a blend of ancient and varied native traditions, with building types, forms and technologies from West, Central Asia, and Europe.\n\nBuddhist architecture developed in South Asia beginning in the third century BCE. Two types of structures are associated with early Buddhism: viharas and stupas.\nOriginally, Viharas were temporary shelters used by wandering monks during the rainy season, but these structures later developed to accommodate the growing and increasingly formalized Buddhist monasticism. An existing example is at Nalanda (Bihar).\n\nThe initial function of the stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of the Buddha. The earliest existing example of a stupa is in Sanchi (Madhya Pradesh). In accordance with changes in religious practice, stupas were gradually incorporated into chaitya-grihas (stupa halls). These reached their highpoint in the first century BCE, exemplified by the cave complexes of Ajanta and Ellora (Maharashtra).\n\nThe pagoda is an evolution of the Indian stupa that is marked by a tiered tower with multiple eaves common in China, Japan, Korea, Nepal and other parts of Asia.\nBuddhist temples were developed rather later and outside South Asia, where Buddhism gradually declined from the early centuries CE onwards, though an early example is that of the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya in Bihar. The architectural structure of the stupa spread across Asia, taking on many diverse forms as details specific to different regions were incorporated into the overall design. It was spread to China and the Asian region by Araniko, a Nepali architect in the early 13th century for Kublai Khan.\n\n \nHindu temple architecture is based on \"Sthapatya Veda\" and many other ancient religious texts like the \"Brihat Samhita\", \"Vastu Shastra\" and \"Shilpa Shastras\" in accordance to the design principles and guidelines believed to have been laid by the divine architect Vishvakarma. It evolved over a period of more than 2000 years. The Hindu architecture conforms to strict religious models that incorporate elements of astronomy and sacred geometry. In Hindu belief, the temple represents the macrocosm of the universe as well as the microcosm of inner space. While the underlying form of Hindu temple architecture follows strict traditions, considerable variation occurs with the often intense decorative embellishments and ornamentation.\n\nA basic Hindu temple consists of an inner sanctum, the \"garbhagriha\" or womb-chamber, a congregation hall, and possibly an antechamber and porch. The sanctum is crowned by a tower-like \"shikhara\". The Hindu temple represents Mount Meru, the axis of the universe. There are strict rules which describe the themes and sculptures on the outer walls of the temple buildings.\n\nThe two primary styles that have developed are the Nagara style of Northern India and the Dravida style of Southern India. A prominent difference between the two styles are the elaborate gateways employed in the South. They are also easily distinguishable by the shape and decoration of their shikharas. The Nagara style is beehive-shaped while the Dravida style is pyramid-shaped.\n\nByzantine architecture evolved from Roman architecture. Eventually, a style emerged incorporating Near East influences and the Greek cross plan for church design. In addition, brick replaced stone, classical order was less strictly observed, mosaics replaced carved decoration, and complex domes were erected. One of the great breakthroughs in the history of Western architecture occurred when Justinian's architects invented a complex system providing for a smooth transition from a square plan of the church to a circular dome (or domes) by means of squinches or pendentives. The prime example of early Byzantine religious architecture is the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.\n\nByzantine architecture had a great influence on early Islamic architecture with its characteristic round arches, vaults and domes. Many forms of mosques have evolved in different regions of the Islamic world. Notable mosque types include the early Abbasid mosques, T-type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of Anatolia.\nThe earliest styles in Islamic architecture produced \"Arab-plan\" or \"hypostyle\" mosques during the Umayyad Dynasty. These mosques follow a square or rectangular plan with enclosed courtyard and covered prayer hall. Most early hypostyle mosques had flat prayer hall roofs, which required numerous columns and supports. The Mezquita in Córdoba, Spain was constructed as a hypostyle mosque supported by over 850 columns. Arab-plan mosques continued under the Abbasid dynasty.\n\nThe Ottomans introduced \"central dome mosques\" in the 15th century that have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having one large dome at the center, there are often smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, in areas where prayer is not performed. The Dome of the Rock mosque in Jerusalem is perhaps the best known example of a central dome mosque.\n\n\"Iwan mosques\" are most notable for their domed chambers and \"iwans\", which are vaulted spaces open out on one end. In \"iwan\" mosques, one or more iwans face a central courtyard that serves as the prayer hall. The style represents a borrowing from pre-Islamic Iranian architecture and has been used almost exclusively for mosques in Iran. Many \"iwan\" mosques are converted Zoroastrian fire temples where the courtyard was used to house the sacred fire. Today, iwan mosques are no longer built. The Shah Mosque in Isfahan, Iran is a classic example of an \"iwan\" mosque.\nA common feature in mosques is the minaret, the tall, slender tower that usually is situated at one of the corners of the mosque structure. The top of the minaret is always the highest point in mosques that have one, and often the highest point in the immediate area. The first mosques had no minarets, and even nowadays the most conservative Islamic movements, like Wahhabis, avoid building minarets, seeing them as ostentatious and unnecessary. The first minaret was constructed in 665 in Basra during the reign of the Umayyad caliph Muawiyah I. Muawiyah encouraged the construction of minarets, as they were supposed to bring mosques on par with Christian churches with their bell towers. Consequently, mosque architects borrowed the shape of the bell tower for their minarets, which were used for essentially the same purpose — calling the faithful to prayer.\n\nDomes have been a hallmark of Islamic architecture since the 7th century. As time progressed, the sizes of mosque domes grew, from occupying only a small part of the roof near the mihrab to encompassing all of the roof above the prayer hall. Although domes normally took on the shape of a hemisphere, the Mughals in India popularized onion-shaped domes in South Asia and Persia.\n\nThe prayer hall, also known as the musalla, has no furniture; chairs and pews are absent from the prayer hall. Prayer halls contain no images of people, animals, and spiritual figures although they may be decorated with Arabic calligraphy and verses from the Qur'an on the walls.\n\nUsually opposite the entrance to the prayer hall is the \"qibla wall\", which is the visually emphasized area inside the prayer hall. The \"qibla\" wall is normally set perpendicular to a line leading to Mecca. Congregants pray in rows parallel to the \"qibla\" wall and thus arrange themselves so they face Mecca. In the \"qibla\" wall, usually at its center, is the mihrab, a niche or depression indicating the \"qibla\" wall. Usually the \"mihrab\" is not occupied by furniture either. Sometimes, especially during Friday prayers, a raised minbar or pulpit is located to the side of the \"mihrab\" for a khatib or some other speaker to offer a sermon (khutbah). The mihrab serves as the location where the imam leads the five daily prayers on a regular basis.\n\nMosques often have ablution fountains or other facilities for washing in their entryways or courtyards. However, worshippers at much smaller mosques often have to use restrooms to perform their ablutions. In traditional mosques, this function is often elaborated into a freestanding building in the center of a courtyard. Modern mosques may have a variety of amenities available to their congregants and the community, such as health clinics, libraries and gymnasiums.\n\nThe religious architecture of Christian churches in the Middle Ages featured the Latin cross plan, which takes the Roman Basilica as its primary model with subsequent developments. It consists of a nave, transepts, and the altar stands at the east end (see \"Cathedral diagram\"). Also, cathedrals influenced or commissioned by Justinian employed the Byzantine style of domes and a Greek cross (resembling a plus sign), centering attention on the altar at the \"center\" of the church. The Church of the Intercession on the Nerl is an excellent example of Russian orthodox architecture in the Middle Ages. The Urnes stave church (Urnes stavkyrkje) in Norway is a superb example of a medieval stave church.\n\nGothic architecture was particularly associated with cathedrals and other churches, which flourished in Europe during the high and late medieval period. Beginning in 12th century France, it was known as \"the French Style\" during the period. The style originated at the abbey church of Saint-Denis in Saint-Denis, near Paris. Other notable gothic religious structures include Notre Dame de Paris, the Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens, and the Chartres Cathedral.\n\nThe Renaissance brought a return of classical influence and a new emphasis on rational clarity. Renaissance architecture represents a conscious revival of Roman Architecture with its symmetry, mathematical proportions, and geometric order. Filippo Brunelleschi's plan for the Santa Maria del Fiore as the dome of the Florence Cathedral in 1418 was one of the first important religious architectural designs of the Italian renaissance.\n\nEvolving from the renaissance style, the baroque style was most notably experienced in religious art and architecture. Most architectural historians regard Michelangelo's design of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome as a precursor to the Baroque style. Baroque style can be recognized by broader interior spaces (replacing long narrow naves), more playful attention to light and shadow, extensive ornamentation, large frescoes, focus on interior art, and frequently, a dramatic central exterior projection. The most important early example of the baroque period was the Santa Susanna by Carlo Maderno. Saint Paul's Cathedral in London by Christopher Wren is regarded as the prime example of the rather late influence of the Baroque style in England.\n\nTemples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints offer a unique look at design as it has changed from the simple church like structure of the Kirtland Temple built in the 1830s, to the castellated Gothic styles of the early Utah temples, to the dozens of modern temples built today. \nEarly temples, and some modern temples, have a priesthood assembly room with two sets of pulpits at each end of the room, with chairs or benches that can be altered to face either way. Most, but not all temples have the recognizable statue of the Angel Moroni atop a spire. The Nauvoo Temple and the Salt Lake Temple are adorned with symbolic stonework, representing various aspects of the faith.\n\nModern architecture spans several styles with similar characteristics resulting in simplification of form and the elimination of ornament. The most influential modernist architects in the early to mid 20th century include Dominikus Böhm, Rudolf Schwarz, and Auguste Perret. While secular structures clearly had the greater influence on the development of modern architecture, several excellent examples of modern architecture can be found in religious buildings of the 20th century. For example, Unity Temple in Chicago is a Unitarian Universalist congregation designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The United States Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel, started in 1954 and completed in 1962, was designed by Walter Netsch and is an excellent example of modern religious architecture. It has been described as a \"phalanx of fighters\" turned on their tails and pointing heavenward. In 1967, Architect Pietro Belluschi designed the strikingly modern Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption (San Francisco), the first Catholic cathedral in the United States intended to conform to Vatican II.\n\nPost-modern architecture may be described by unapologetically diverse aesthetics where styles collide, form exists for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound. The Temple at Independence, Missouri was conceived by Japanese architect Gyo Obata after the concept of the chambered nautilus. The Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels (Los Angeles) was designed in 1998 by Jose Rafael Moneo in a post-modern style. The structure evokes the area's Hispanic heritage through the use of adobe coloring while combining stark modern form with some traditional elements. The Basilica of Our Lady of Licheń on the other hand is a much more traditional edifice. Designed by Barbara Bielecka and built between 1994 and 2004, its form includes references to a number of Polish structures. The columns possess a slenderness and delicacy inspired by those of the Renaissance court of Wawel Castle in Kraków, while the huge 420-foot spire that will be erected next to the basilica bears more than an accidental resemblance to the Baroque spire that adorns the Jasna Gora monastery of Czestochowa, home of the Black Madonna.\n\nShaker communities were semiotically architectured upon the crux of the compass rose.\n\n\n</div>\n\n"}
{"id": "14499166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14499166", "title": "Scythian religion", "text": "Scythian religion\n\nScythian religion refers to the mythology, ritual practices and beliefs of the Scythians, an ancient Iranian people who dominated Central Asia and the Pontic-Caspian steppe in Eastern Europe throughout Classical Antiquity. What little is known of the religion is drawn from the work of the 5th century Greek historian and ethnographer Herodotus. Scythian religion is assumed to have been related to the earlier Proto-Indo-Iranian religion, and to have influenced later Slavic, Hungarian and Turkic mythologies, as well as some contemporary Eastern Iranian and Ossetian traditions. \n\nThe primary archaeological context of horse sacrifice are burials, notably chariot burials, but graves with horse remains reach from the Eneolithic well into historical times. Herodotus describes the execution of horses at the burial of a Scythian king, and Iron Age kurgan graves known to contain horses number in the hundreds.\n\nThe Scythians had some reverence for the stag, which is one of the most common motifs in their artwork, especially at funeral sites (see, for example, the Pazyryk burials). \n\nAccording to Herodotus, the Scythians worshipped a pantheon of seven gods and goddesses (heptad), which he equates with Greek divinities of Classical Antiquity following the \"interpretatio graeca\". He mentions eight deities in particular, the eighth being worshipped by the Royal Scythians, and gives the Scythian names for seven of them as follows:\n\nThe mode of Scythian animal sacrifice was, in the opinion of Herodotus, relatively simple. Sacrificial animals included various kinds of livestock, though the most prestigious offering was considered to be the horse. The pig, on the other hand, was never offered in sacrifice, and apparently the Scythians were loath to keep swine within their lands. Herodotus describes the Scythian manner of sacrifice as follows:\n\nAlthough Tabiti was apparently the most important deity in the Scythian pantheon, the worship accorded to the deity Herodotus refers to as \"Ares\" was unique. He notes that \"it is not their custom [...] to make images, altars or temples to any except Ares, but to him it is their custom to make them\". He describes the construction of the altar and the subsequent sacrifice as follows:\n\nAccording to Tadeusz Sulimirski, this form of worship continued among the descendants of the Scythians, the Alans, through to the 4th century CE.; this tradition may be reflected in Jordanes' assertion that Attila was able to assert his authority over the Scythians through his possession of the \"Sword of Mars\".\n\nThe \"Enarei\" were a privileged caste of hereditary priests which played an important political role in Scythian society as they were believed to have received the gift of prophesy directly from the goddess Argimpasa. The method employed by the \"Enarei\" differed from that practised by traditional Scythian diviners: whereas the latter used a bundle of willow rods, the \"Enarei\" used strips cut from the bark of the linden tree (genus \"tilia\") to tell the future. The \"Enarei\" were also noted for dressing themselves in the clothes of women, a custom which Herodotus understands as being reflected in the title \"ena-rei\", glossing this as \"ἀνδρό-γυνοι\" or \"man-women\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3796695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3796695", "title": "Sea of Faith", "text": "Sea of Faith\n\nThe Sea of Faith Network (SoF) is an organisation with the stated aim to explore and promote religious faith as a human creation.\n\nThe SoF movement started in 1984 as a response to Don Cupitt's book and television series, both titled \"Sea of Faith\". Cupitt was educated in both science and theology at the University of Cambridge in the 1950s, and is a philosopher, theologian, Anglican priest, and former Dean of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. In the book and TV series, he surveyed western thinking about religion and charted a transition from traditional realist religion to the view that religion is simply a human creation.\n\nThe name Sea of Faith is taken from Matthew Arnold's nostalgic mid 19th century poem \"Dover Beach\", in which the poet expresses regret that belief in a supernatural world is slowly slipping away; the \"sea of faith\" is withdrawing like the ebbing tide.\n\nFollowing the television series, a small group of radical Christian clergy and laity began meeting to explore how they might promote this new understanding of religious faith. Starting with a mailing list of 143 sympathisers, they organised the first UK conference in 1988. A second conference was held in the following year shortly after which the SoF Network was officially launched. Annual national conferences have been a key event of the network ever since.\n\nThe Sea Of Faith Network holds national and regional conferences and promotional events each year. There is an active network of local groups who meet regularly for discussion and exploration.\n\nThe group's magazine \"Sofia\" is published bi-monthly in the United Kingdom. It has a circulation beyond the SoF membership. The group also maintains a web site and an on-line discussion group.\n\nCurrently there are national networks in the UK, New Zealand and Australia with scattered membership in the USA, Northern Ireland, South Africa, France and The Netherlands. The world-wide membership, as of 2004, stood at about 2,000. Each national network is run by a steering committee elected from its members.\n\nSoF has no official creed or statement of belief to which members are required to assent, seeing itself as a loose network rather than a formal religious movement or organisation. Its stated aim is to \"explore and promote religious faith as a human creation\". In this it spans a broad spectrum of faith positions from uncompromising non-realism at one end to critical realism at the other. Some members describe themselves as on the liberal or radical wing of conventional belief (see liberal Christianity) while others choose to call themselves religious or Christian humanists (see humanism). Some even refer to themselves as agnostic, atheist, or simply nontheist (see Christian atheism).\n\nSoF possesses no religious writings or ceremonies of its own; many members remain active in their own religion (mainly but not exclusively Christian) while others have no religious affiliation at all.\n\nA number of commentators have identified SoF as closely associated with the non-realist approach to religion. This refers to the belief that God has no \"real\", objective, or empirical existence, independent of human language and culture; God is \"real\" in the sense that he is a potent symbol, metaphor or projection, but he has no objective existence outside and beyond the practice of religion. Non-realism therefore entails a rejection of all supernaturalism, including concepts such as miracles, the afterlife, and the agency of spirits.\n\nCupitt wrote, \"God is the sum of our values, representing to us their ideal unity, their claims upon us and their creative power\". Cupitt calls this \"a voluntarist interpretation of faith: a fully demythologized version of Christianity\". It entails the claim that even after we have given up the idea that religious beliefs can be grounded in anything beyond the human realm, religion can still be believed and practised in new ways.\n\nSince he began writing in 1971, Cupitt has produced 36 books. During this time his views have continued to evolve and change. In his early books such as \"Taking Leave of God\" and \"The Sea of Faith\" Cupitt talks of God alone as non-real, but by the end of the 1980s he moved into postmodernism, describing his position as empty radical humanism: that is, there is nothing but our language, our world, and the meanings, truths and interpretations that we have generated. Everything is non-real, including God.\n\nWhile Cupitt was the founding influence of SoF and is much respected for his work for the network, it would not be true to say that he is regarded as a guru or leader of SoF. Members are free to dissent from his views and Cupitt himself has argued strongly that SoF should never be a fan club. Both Cupitt and the network emphasise the importance of autonomous critical thought and reject authoritarianism in all forms.\n\n\n"}

Their goal was to establish a commune of chosen people. As a symbol of their new life they took new names and destroyed their identity documents. Total submission to Kacmajor was required. Members married each other, refused to send children to public school (as Kacmajor stated, \"in chemistry class they teach that you can't turn water into wine, in physics class they teach that you can't walk on water\") and refused to take any medical treatment (Kacmajor was convinced that he can heal even AIDS). Niebo gathered approximately 50 members.\n\nBecause of their total social alienation the group soon started to have troubles with the law. Reports of kidnapping and children being kept prisoner started circulating. The Catholic Church and several church-related movements started a campaign against the community which resulted in bad fame and financial problems. As of 2008 the community does not exist and there are several court cases against Kacmajor.\n\n"}

(The Latin word \"strix\" can mean \"screech-owl\" or \"witch\".)\n\nDuring the early modern period strixologists refuted the reality of witches and contributed to the decline of witch-hunts.\n\nAs a systematic study, strixology emerged during the period 1431—1439 at the Council of Basel - an ecclesiastical council where theologians and demonologists met and debated what was seen as the Devil's work, magical observations and confessions of witches. Those issues were not a primary purpose of the Council. Nonetheless, the subject of one of the discussions was a peasant named Stedelen who was believed to have committed \"maleficia\" and who said under torture that he was a part of a secret society of Devil-worshippers. This story was disturbing enough to be reported to the council by Peter of Simmental and described in great detail.\n\nThis case and similar revelations were later used by the Dominican professor Johannes Nider, a participant at the Council's meetings, as examples in his \"Formicarius\" (1436-1438) a book that laid the foundations of strixology. Scholars cited this significant work for centuries. Around the time \"Formicarius\" was published, there was a relatively small number of witch-hunt victims - estimated to have been in the hundreds. This changed at the end of the 15th century, partially due to the publication of the infamous \"Malleus Maleficarum\" which cemented belief in the reality of witches and in the higher susceptibility of women to take part in witchcraft. The book proclaimed that “evils which are performed by witches exceed all other sin which God has ever permitted to be done.…”.\n\n"}

Some orders are monastic (Quanzhen orders), while the majority are not (Zhengyi orders).\n\nSome of the monastic orders are hermitic, and their members practice seclusion and ascetic lifestyles in the mountains, with the aim of becoming \"xian\", or immortal beings. Non-monastic priests live among the populace and manage and serve their own temples or popular temples.\n\nThe activities of the Taoists tend to be informed by materials which may be found in the \"Daozang\", or Daoist Canon; however, Taoists generally choose, or inherit, specific texts which have been passed down for generations from teacher to student, rather than consulting published versions of these works.\n\nTaoist orders are conventionally categorised into two main branches: Quanzhen and Zhengyi.\n\nQuanzhen Taoism, which is present almost exclusively in the north of China, includes all Taoist orders which have a monastic institution. Their lifestyle is comparable to that of the Buddhist monks in that they are celibate, vegetarian, and live in monasteries. The White Cloud Temple in Beijing is the main monastery of the Longmen school of Quanzhen, and is also the main headquarters of mainland China's official Taoist Church.\n\nThe other main priesthood is Zhengyi Taoism, in which the priests can marry, eat meat, live in their own homes, and found and manage their own temples or serve in folk religious temples. They are mostly priests part-time and can hold other jobs. Their lineages are transmitted through training and ordination by another priest, although historically they received a formal confirmation in their role by the Celestial Master, the highest priest. Fragmentation of the lineage of the Celestial Masters has made Zhengyi priests more independent. In mainland China the Taoist Church has in theory taken over the power to regulate them (although only a minority of them are registered with the Church). Zhengyi orders are present all over China, although with different names according to the local lineages. For example, in northern China there are the \"yinyang\" masters of the Lingbao sub-tradition.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "328815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=328815", "title": "Theistic evolution", "text": "Theistic evolution\n\nTheistic evolution, theistic evolutionism, evolutionary creationism or God-guided evolution are views that regard religious teachings about God as compatible with modern scientific understanding about biological evolution. Theistic evolution is not in itself a scientific theory, but a range of views about how the science of general evolution relates to religious beliefs in contrast to special creation views.\n\nSupporters of theistic evolution generally harmonize evolutionary thought with belief in God, rejecting the conflict thesis regarding the relationship between religion and science they hold that religious teachings about creation and scientific theories of evolution need not contradict each other.\n\nFrancis Collins describes theistic evolution as the position that \"evolution is real, but that it was set in motion by God\", and characterizes it as accepting \"that evolution occurred as biologists describe it, but under the direction of God\". The executive director of the National Center for Science Education in the United States of America, Eugenie Scott, has used the term to refer to the part of the overall spectrum of beliefs about creation and evolution holding the theological view that God creates through evolution. It covers a wide range of beliefs about the extent of any intervention by God, with some approaching deism in rejecting the concept of continued intervention.\n\nJust as different types of evolutionary explanations have evolved, so there are different types of theistic evolution. Creationists Henry M. Morris and John D. Morris, point out that there are different terms which have been used to describe different positions: \"\"Orthogenesis\" (goal-directed evolution), \"nomogenesis\" (evolution according to fixed law), \"emergent evolution\", \"creative evolution\", and others\"\".\n\nOthers argue that one should read the creation story in the book of Genesis only metaphorically.\n\nOthers see \"evolutionary creation\" (EC, also referred to by some observers as \"evolutionary creationism\") as the belief that God, as Creator, uses evolution to bring about his plan. The Jesuit paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955) was an influential proponent of God-directed evolution or \"orthogenesis\", in which man will eventually evolve to the \"omega point\" of union with the Creator. Eugenie Scott states in \"Evolution Vs. Creationism\" that it is a type of evolution rather than creationism, despite its name, and that it is \"hardly distinguishable from Theistic Evolution\". According to evolutionary creationist Denis Lamoureux, although referring to the same view, the word arrangement in the term \"theistic evolution\" places \"the process of evolution as the primary term, and makes the Creator secondary as merely a qualifying adjective.\" Scott also uses the term \"theistic evolutionism\" interchangeably with \"theistic evolution\". Divine intervention is seen at critical intervals in history in a way consistent with scientific explanations of speciation, with similarities to the ideas of progressive creationism that God created \"kinds\" of animals sequentially.\n\nRegarding the embracing of Darwinian evolution, historian Ronald Numbers describes the position of the late 19th-century geologist George Frederick Wright as \"Christian Darwinism\".\n\nHistorians of science (and authors of pre-evolutionary ideas) have pointed out that scientists had considered the concept of biological change well before Darwin.\n\nIn the 17th century, the English nonconformist/Anglican priest and botanist John Ray, in his book \"The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of Creation (1692)\", had wondered \"why such different species should not only mingle together, but also generate an animal, and yet that that hybridous production should not again generate, and so a new race be carried on\".\n\n18th-century scientist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) published \"Systema Naturae\" (1735- ), a book in which he considered that new varieties of plants could arise through hybridization, but only under certain limits fixed by God. Linnaeus had initially embraced the Aristotelian idea of immutability of species (the idea that species never change), but later in his life he started to challenge it. Yet, as a Christian, he still defended \"special creation\", the belief that God created \"every living creature\" at the beginning, as read in Genesis, with the peculiarity a set of original species of which all the present species have descended.\n\nLinnaeus wrote:\nLinnaeus attributed the active process of biological change to God himself, as he stated:\n\nJens Christian Clausen (1967), refers to Linnaeus' theory as a \"forgotten evolutionary theory [that] antedates Darwin's by nearly 100 years\", and reports that he was a pioneer in doing experiments about hybridization.\n\nLater observations by Protestant botanists Carl Friedrich von Gärtner (1772-1850) and Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter (1733-1806) denied the immutability of species, which (according to Christian apologists) the Bible never teaches. Kölreuter used the term \"transmutation of species\" to refer to species which have experienced biological changes through hybridization, although they both were inclined to believe that hybrids would revert to the parental forms by a general law of reversion, and therefore, would not be responsible for the introduction of new species. Later, in a number of experiments carried out between 1856 and 1863, the Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel (1822-1884), aligning himself with the \"new doctrine of special creation\" proposed by Linnaeus, concluded that new species of plants could indeed arise, although limitedly and retaining their own stability.\n\nGeorges Cuvier's analysis of fossils and discovery of extinction disrupted static views of nature in the early 19th century, confirming geology as showing a historical sequence of life. British natural theology, which sought examples of adaptation to show design by a benevolent Creator, adopted catastrophism to show earlier organisms being replaced in a series of creations by new organisms better adapted to a changed environment. Charles Lyell (1797-1875) also saw adaptation to changing environments as a sign of a benevolent Creator, but his uniformitarianism envisaged continuing extinctions and replacements. As seen in correspondence between Lyell and John Herschel, scientists were looking for creation by laws rather than by miraculous interventions. In continental Europe, the idealism of philosophers including Lorenz Oken (1779-1851) developed a \"Naturphilosophie\" in which patterns of development from archetypes were a purposeful divine plan aimed at forming humanity. These scientists rejected transmutation of species as materialist radicalism threatening the established hierarchies of society. The idealist Louis Agassiz (1807-1873), a persistent opponent of transmutation, saw mankind as the goal of a sequence of creations, but his concepts were the first to be adapted into a scheme of theistic evolutionism. In \"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\" published in 1844, its anonymous author (Robert Chambers) set out goal-centred progressive development as the Creator's divine plan, programmed to unfold without direct intervention or miracles. The book became a best-seller and popularised the idea of transmutation in a designed \"law of progression\". The scientific establishment strongly attacked \"Vestiges\" at the time, but later more sophisticated theistic evolutionists followed the same approach of looking for patterns of development as evidence of design.\n\nThe comparative anatomist Richard Owen (1804-1892), a prominent figure in the Victorian era scientific establishment, opposed transmutation throughout his life. When formulating homology he adapted idealist philosophy to reconcile natural theology with development, unifying nature as divergence from an underlying form in a process demonstrating design. His conclusion to his \"On the Nature of Limbs\" of 1849 suggested that divine laws could have controlled the development of life, but he did not expand this idea after objections from his conservative patrons. Others supported the idea of development by law, including the botanist Hewett Watson (1804-1881) and the Reverend Baden Powell (1796-1860), who wrote in 1855 that such laws better illustrated the powers of the Creator. In 1858 Owen in his speech as President of the British Association said that in \"continuous operation of Creative power\" through geological time, new species of animals appeared in a \"successive and continuous fashion\" through birth from their antecedents by a Creative law rather than through slow transmutation.\n\nWhen Charles Darwin published \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859, many liberal Christians accepted evolution provided it was reconciled with divine design. The clergymen Charles Kingsley and Frederick Temple, both conservative Christians in the Church of England, promoted a theology of creation as an indirect process controlled by divine laws. Some strict Calvinists welcomed the idea of natural selection, as it did not entail inevitable progress and humanity could be seen as a fallen race needing salvation. Aubrey Moore also accepted the theory of natural selection, incorporating it into his Christian beliefs as merely the way God worked. Darwin's friend Asa Gray defended natural selection as compatible with design.\n\nDarwin himself, in his second edition of the \"Origin\" (January 1860), had written in the conclusion:\nWithin a decade most scientists had started espousing evolution, but from the outset some expressed opposition to the concept of natural selection and searched for a more purposeful mechanism. In 1860 Richard Owen attacked Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" in an anonymous review while praising \"Professor Owen\" for \"the establishment of the axiom of \"the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things\"\". Sir John Herschel apparently dismissed Darwin's book as \"the law of higgledy-pigglety\", and in 1861 he wrote of evolution that \"An intelligence, guided by a purpose, must be continually in action to bias the direction of the steps of change–to regulate their amount–to limit their divergence–and to continue them in a definite course\". He added \"On the other hand, we do not mean to deny that such intelligence may act according to law (that is to say, on a preconceived and definite plan)\". Christian scientist Sir David Brewster wrote an article called \"\" in which he rejected many Darwinian ideas, such as those concerning vestigial organs or questioning God's perfection in his work. Brewster concluded that Darwin's book contained both \"much valuable knowledge and much wild speculation\", although accepting that \"every part of the human frame had been fashioned by the Divine hand and exhibited the most marvellous and beneficent adaptions for the use of men\".\n\nIn the 1860s theistic evolutionism became a popular compromise in science, and gained widespread support from the general public. Between 1866 and 1868 Owen published a theory of derivation proposing that species had an innate tendency to change in ways that resulted in variety and beauty showing creative purpose. Both Owen and Mivart insisted that natural selection could not explain patterns and variation, which they saw as resulting from divine purpose. In 1867 the Duke of Argyll published \"The Reign of Law\", which explained beauty in plumage without any adaptive benefit as design generated by the Creator's laws of nature for the delight of humans. Argyll attempted to reconcile evolution with design by suggesting that the laws of variation prepared rudimentary organs for a future need.\n\nCardinal John Henry Newman, wrote in 1868: \"Mr Darwin's theory need not then to be atheistical, be it true or not; it may simply be suggesting a larger idea of Divine Prescience and Skill ... and I do not [see] that 'the accidental evolution of organic beings' is inconsistent with divine design — It is accidental to us, not to God.\"\n\nIn 1871 Darwin published his own research on human ancestry in \"The Descent of Man\", concluding that humans were \"descended from a hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail and pointed ears\", which would be classified amongst the Quadrumana along with monkeys, and in turn descended \"through a long line of diversified forms\" going back to something like the larvae of sea squirts. Critics promptly complained that this \"degrading\" image \"tears the crown from our heads\", but there is little evidence that it led to loss of faith. Among the few who did record the impact of Darwin's writings, the naturalist Joseph LeConte struggled with \"distress and doubt\" following the death of his daughter in 1861, before enthusiastically saying in the late 1870s there was \"not a single philosophical question connected with our highest and dearest religious and spiritual interests that is fundamentally affected, or even put in any new light, by the theory of evolution\", and in the late 1880s embracing the view that \"evolution is entirely consistent with a rational theism.\" Similarly, George Frederick Wright responded to Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" and Charles Lyell's 1963 \"Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man\" by turning to Asa Gray's belief, that God had set the rules at the start and only intervened on rare occasions, as a way to harmonise evolution with theology. Wright's faith was not seriously shaken by evolution, but he later suffered a crisis when confronted with historical criticism of the Bible.\n\nAccording to Eugenie Scott: \"In one form or another, Theistic Evolutionism is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline Protestant seminaries, and it is the official position of the Catholic church.\" Studies show that acceptance of evolution is lower in the United States than in Europe or Japan; among 34 countries sampled, only Turkey had a lower rate of acceptance than the United States.\n\nTheistic evolutionism has been described as arguing for compatibility between science and religion, and as such it is viewed with disdain both by some atheists and many creationists.\n\nHominization, in both science and religion, involves the process or the purpose of becoming human. The process and means by which hominization occurs is a key problem in theistic evolutionary thought, at least for the Abrahamic religions, which hold as a core belief that animals do not have immortal souls but that humans do. Many versions of theistic evolution insist on a special creation consisting of at least the addition of a soul just for the human species.\n\nScientific accounts of the origin of the universe, the origin of life, and subsequent evolution of pre-human life forms may not cause any difficulty but the need to reconcile religious and scientific views of hominization and to account for the addition of a soul to humans remains a problem. Theistic evolution typically postulates a point at which a population of hominids who had (or may have) evolved by a process of natural evolution acquired souls and thus (with their descendants) became fully human in theological terms. This group might be restricted to Adam and Eve, or indeed to Mitochondrial Eve, although versions of the theory allow for larger populations. The point at which such an event occurred should essentially be the same as in paleoanthropology and archeology, but theological discussion of the matter tends to concentrate on the theoretical. The term \"special transformism\" is sometimes used to refer to theories that there was a divine intervention of some sort, achieving hominization.\n\nSeveral 19th-century theologians and evolutionists attempted specific solutions, including the Catholics John Augustine Zahm and St. George Jackson Mivart, but tended to come under attack from both the theological and biological camps. and 20th-century thinking tended to avoid proposing precise mechanisms.\n\nThe American botanist Asa Gray used the name \"theistic evolution\" in a now-obsolete sense for his point of view, presented in his 1876 book \"Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism\". He argued that the deity supplies beneficial mutations to guide evolution. St George Jackson Mivart argued instead in his 1871 \"On the Genesis of Species\" that the deity, equipped with foreknowledge, sets the direction of evolution (orthogenesis) by specifying the laws that govern it, and leaves species to evolve according to the conditions they experience as time goes by. The Duke of Argyll set out similar views in his 1867 book \"The Reign of Law\". The historian Edward J. Larson stated that the theory failed as an explanation in the minds of biologists from the late 19th century onwards as it broke the rules of methodological naturalism which they had grown to expect.\n\nThe major criticism of theistic evolution by non-theistic evolutionists focuses on its essential belief in a supernatural creator. These critics argue that by the application of Occam's razor, sufficient explanation of the phenomena of evolution is provided by \"natural\" processes (in particular, natural selection), and the intervention or direction of a \"super\"natural entity is not required. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins considers theistic evolution a superfluous attempt to \"smuggle God in by the back door\". \n\nA number of notable proponents of theistic evolution, including Kenneth R. Miller, John Haught, George Coyne, Simon Conway Morris, Denis Alexander, Ard Louis, Darrel Falk, Alister McGrath, Francisco J. Ayala, and Francis Collins are critics of intelligent design.\n\nYoung Earth creationists including Ken Ham criticise theistic evolution on theological grounds, finding it hard to reconcile the nature of a loving God with the process of evolution, in particular, the existence of death and suffering before the Fall of Man. They consider that it undermines central biblical teachings by regarding the creation account as a myth, a parable, or an allegory, instead of treating it as historical. They also fear that a capitulation to what they call \"atheistic\" naturalism will confine God to the gaps in scientific explanations, undermining biblical doctrines, such as God's incarnation through Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Almost no religions object to vaccination, and some parents either fake religious adherence or invent fake religions to provide exemption.\n\nThe influential Massachusetts preacher Cotton Mather was the first known person to attempt smallpox inoculation on a large scale, inoculating himself and over 200 members of his congregation with the help of a local doctor. While his view became standard, he also caused the first reaction against the practice.\n\nRowland Hill (1744–1833) was a popular English preacher acquainted with Edward Jenner, the pioneer of smallpox vaccination, and he encouraged the vaccination of the congregations he visited or preached to. He published a tract on the subject in 1806, at a time when many medical men refused to sanction it. Later he became a member of the Royal Jennererian Society, which was established when vaccination was accepted in Britain, India, the US, and elsewhere. John C. Lettsom, an eminent Quaker physician of the day wrote to Rowland Hill commenting:\n\nSeveral Boston clergymen and devout physicians formed a society that opposed vaccination in 1798. Others complained that the practice was dangerous, going so far as to demand that doctors who carried out these procedures be tried for attempted murder.\n\nIn 1816 Iceland made the clergy responsible for smallpox vaccination and gave them the responsibility of keeping vaccination records for their parishes; Sweden also had similar practices.\n\nWhen vaccination was introduced into UK public policy, and adoption followed overseas, there was opposition from trade unionists and others, including sectarian ministers and those interested in self-help and alternative medicines like homeopathy.\n\nAnti-vaccinationists were most common in Protestant countries. Those who were religious often came from minority religious movements outside of mainstream Protestantism, including Quakers in England and Baptists in Sweden.\n\nCatholic and Anglican missionaries vaccinated Northwest Coast Native Americans during an 1862 smallpox epidemic.\n\nIn the UK, a number of Vaccination Acts were introduced to control vaccination and inoculation, starting in 1840, when smallpox inoculation was banned. The 1853 Act introduced compulsory free infant vaccination enforced by local authorities. By 1871, infant vaccination was compulsory and parents refusing to have their child vaccinated were fined and imprisoned if the fines were not paid. Resistance to compulsion grew, and in 1889, after riots in Leicester, a Royal Commission was appointed and issued six reports between 1892 and 1896. It recommended the abolition of cumulative penalties. This was done in an 1898 Act, which also introduced a conscience clause that exempted parents who did not believe vaccination was efficacious or safe. This extended the concept of the \"conscientious objector\" in English law. A further Act in 1907 made it easier to obtain exemption.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses banned their members from receiving vaccinations from 1931 to 1952. They have since reversed their position. The decision of whether to vaccinate themselves or their family is left to the individual Witness. Some more recent Jehovah's Witness publications have mentioned the success of vaccination programs.\n\nChristian Science selectively rejects various forms of medical care including vaccination. The Congregation of Universal Wisdom, a religion based on belief in chiropractic spinal adjustments and Universal Intelligence, forbids vaccinations. The \"New York Times\" covered the Congregation of Universal Wisdom and noted that many families have used these religious memberships to avoid vaccination requirements. In a court case citing the Congregation of Universal Wisdom, \"Turner v. Liverpool Cent. School\", the United States District Court in New York affirmed the permissibility of claiming religious exemption from vaccination on the basis of such membership.\n\nSome conservative Christian groups in the United States oppose mandatory vaccination for diseases typically spread via sexual contact, arguing that the possibility of disease deters risky sexual contact. For example, the Family Research Council opposes mandatory vaccination against HPV, a virus that causes various cancers, writing, \"Our primary concern is with the message that would be delivered to nine- to 12-year-olds with the administration of the vaccines. Care must be taken not to communicate that such an intervention makes all sex 'safe'.\" Studies have shown that HPV vaccination does not result in increased sexual activity.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has made vaccination an official initiative in its humanitarian relief program. The Church has also called on its members to see that their own children are properly vaccinated.\n\nIslam and Judaism, religions with dietary prohibitions that regard particular animals as unclean, make exceptions for medical treatments derived from those animals.\n\nIn Aceh Province, an autonomous province of Indonesia with its own Islamic Sharia Law, 80 percent of people refuse all vaccinations due to concerns about pig, or its derivatives, being used to make some vaccines (eating pig is considered haram).\n\nThe use of fetal tissue in the development of vaccines has also provoked some controversy among religions opposed to abortion. The cell culture media of some viral vaccines, and the virus of the rubella vaccine, are derived from tissues taken from therapeutic abortions performed in the 1960s, leading to moral questions. For example, the principle of double effect, originated by Thomas Aquinas, holds that actions with both good and bad consequences are morally acceptable in specific circumstances, and the question is how this principle applies to vaccination. The Vatican Curia has expressed concern about the rubella vaccine's embryonic cell origin, saying Catholics have \"...a grave responsibility to use alternative vaccines and to make a conscientious objection with regard to those which have moral problems.\" The Vatican concluded that until an alternative becomes available it is acceptable for Catholics to use the existing vaccine, writing, \"This is an unjust alternative choice, which must be eliminated as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe majority of Orthodox Rabbis view vaccination as a religious obligation. A magazine called P.E.A.C.H. that presented an anti-immunization message to Orthodox Jews was distributed in Brooklyn, New York in early 2014. This is not a widespread phenomenon though. 96% of students at Yeshivas (who are essentially all Orthodox Jewish) in New York City were immunized according to information obtained in 2014, although this is a lower than average rate.\n\nIn 2003 imams in northern Nigeria advised their followers not to have their children vaccinated with oral polio vaccine, perceived to be a plot by Westerners to decrease Muslim fertility. The boycott caused the number of polio cases to rise not only in Nigeria but also in neighboring countries. The followers were also wary of other vaccinations, and Nigeria reported over 20,000 measles cases and nearly 600 deaths from measles from January through March 2005. In 2006 Nigeria accounted for over half of all new polio cases worldwide. Outbreaks continued thereafter; for example, at least 200 children died in a late-2007 measles outbreak in Borno State. In 2013, nine health workers administering polio vaccine were targeted and killed by gunmen on motorcycles in Kano, but this was an isolated incident. Local traditional and religious leaders and polio survivors worked to support the vaccination campaign, and Nigeria has not had a polio case since July 24, 2014; in 2017, if no new cases appear, Nigeria will be declared polio-free.\n\nIn the 2000s, in Pakistan and Afghanistan, some Taliban issued \"fatwas\" opposing vaccination as an American plot to sterilize Muslims, and kidnapped, beat, and assassinated vaccination officials; the head of Pakistan's vaccination campaign in Bajaur Agency was assassinated in 2007, on his way back from a meeting with a religious leader. In 2011, a CIA spy ran a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign to search for Osama bin Laden; such actions were strongly condemned by US and international health NGOs, the doctor involved was jailed and the CIA promised not to use vaccination as a cover again. A genuine polio vaccinator had previously vaccinated Osama bin Laden's children and grandchildren in his compound in Abbottabad. Both major sides of the Afghani civil war now support polio vaccination, and polio rates are declining rapidly in Afghanistan, with only five cases in Jan–July 2015. In Pakistan there were 28 cases in the same period.\n\nIn 2015, leaders of the Nation of Islam spoke out against a California Bill that removed philosophical exemptions to school vaccination requirements. Saying that data suggests \"that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism.\" They also said that that government mandated vaccines were another Tuskegee Syphilis Study.\n\nIn the U.S., all states except Mississippi, California and West Virginia allow parents to opt out of their children's otherwise-mandatory vaccinations for religious reasons. The number of religious exemptions rose greatly in the late 1990s and early 2000s; for example, in Massachusetts, the rate of those seeking exemptions rose from 0.24% in 1996 to 0.60% in 2006. Some parents falsely claim religious beliefs to get exemptions. The American Medical Association opposes such exemptions, saying that they endanger health not only for the unvaccinated individual but also for neighbors and the community at large.\n\nOn January 1, 2016 Australia introduced legislation that removed eligibility for childcare and welfare benefits if parents refuse to vaccinate their children, removing religious exemptions at the same time as the only religion to apply for an exemption (Church of Christ Science) deemed their exemption to no longer be relevant.\n"}
{"id": "2972976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2972976", "title": "Works of mercy", "text": "Works of mercy\n\nWorks of mercy (sometimes known as acts of mercy) are practices which Christians perform.\n\nThe practice is popular in the Catholic Church as an act of both penance and charity. In addition, the Methodist church teaches that the works of mercy are a means of grace which lead to holiness and aid in sanctification.\n\nThe works of mercy have been traditionally divided into two categories, each with seven elements: \n\nPope John Paul II issued a papal encyclical \"Dives in misericordia\" on 30 November 1980 declaring that \"Jesus Christ taught that man not only receives and experiences the mercy of God, but that he is also called 'to practice mercy' towards others.\" Another notable devotion associated with the works of mercy is the Divine Mercy, which derives from apparitions of Jesus Christ to Saint Faustina Kowalska.\n\nBased on Jesus' doctrine of the sheep and the goats, the corporal and spiritual works of mercy are a means of grace as good deeds and their omission is a reason for damnation. Because the Messianic Age will be a time of mercy, and because the church believes this age began at Jesus' coming and believes Jesus obeyed every mitzvah and fulfilled the Scriptures, Catholics perform the works of mercy.\n\nIn particular cases, a given individual will not be obligated or even competent to perform four of the spiritual works of mercy, namely: instructing the ignorant, counseling the doubtful, admonishing sinners, and comforting the afflicted. These works may require a definitely superior level of authority or knowledge or an extraordinary amount of tact. The other works of mercy, however, are considered to be an obligation of all faithful to practise unconditionally. In an address on the 2016 World Day of Prayer for Creation, Pope Francis suggested \"care for creation\" as a new work of mercy, describing it as a \"complement\" to the existing works. Francis characterized this new work as having both corporal and spiritual components. Corporally, it involves \"daily gestures which break with the logic of violence, exploitation and selfishness\". Spiritually, it involves contemplating each part of creation to find what God is teaching us through them. This pronouncement extensively quoted the encyclical \"Laudato si'\", and Cardinal Peter Turkson, who helped write the encyclical, clarified that the addition of this work of mercy was part of Francis' intention for \"Laudato si\"'.\n\nCorporal works of mercy are those that tend to the bodily needs of other creatures. They come from Isaiah 58 and the mitzvah of hospitality. The seventh work of mercy comes from the Book of Tobit and from the mitzvah of burial, although it was not added to the list until the Middle Ages.\n\nThe works include:\n\nJust as the corporal works of mercy are directed towards relieving corporeal suffering, the aim of the spiritual works of mercy is to relieve spiritual suffering. The first four come from Ezekiel 33, the fifth comes from the mitzvah of forgiving others before receiving forgiveness from God, the sixth comes from Deuteronomy 15, and the seventh comes from Maccabees 2.\n\nThe works include:\n\nThe Corporal works of mercy are an important subject of Christian iconography. In some representations of the Middle Ages, the seven works were allegorically juxtaposed with the seven deadly sins (avarice, anger, envy, laziness, unchastity, intemperance, pride). The pictorial representation of the works of mercy began in the 12th century.\n\nThe Master of Alkmaar painted the polyptych of the \"Seven works of mercy\" (ca. 1504) for the Church of Saint Lawrence in Alkmaar, Netherlands. His series of wooden panel paintings show the works of mercy, with Jesus in the background viewing each, in this order: feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, bury the dead, shelter the traveler, comfort the sick, and ransom the captive.\n\nThe painting of the \"Seven Works of Mercy\" by Frans II Francken (1605) represents the acts not as a picture cycle, but in one single composition.\n\nA major work of the iconography of mercy is the altarpiece of Caravaggio (1606/07) in Naples, which was commissioned by the Confraternità del Pio Monte della Misericordia for their church. This charity brotherhood was founded in 1601 in Naples. The artist painted the \"Seven Works of Mercy\" in one single composition. Regarding the sharp contrasts of the painting’s chiaroscuro, the art historian Ralf van Bühren explains the bright light as a metaphor for mercy, which \"helps the audience to explore mercy in their own lives\".\n\nIn Methodist teaching, doing merciful acts is a prudential means of grace. Along with works of piety, they are necessary for the believer to move on to Christian perfection. In this sense, the Methodist concern for people at the margins is closely related to its worship. As such, these beliefs have helped create the emphasis of the social gospel in the Methodist Church.\n\n\n"}

While scholars like Ngô Đức Thịnh propose that it represents a systematic mother goddess cult, Đạo Mẫu draws together fairly disparate beliefs and practices. These include the worship of goddesses such as Thiên Y A Na, The Lady of the Realm (Bà Chúa Xứ), The Lady of the Storehouse (Bà Chúa Kho) and Princess Liễu Hạnh, legendary figures like Âu Cơ, the Trung Sisters (Hai Bà Trưng), and Lady Trieu (Bà Triệu), as well as the cult of the Four Palaces. Đạo Mẫu is commonly associated with spirit mediumship rituals—known in Vietnam as \"lên đồng\"—much as practiced in other parts of Asia, such as Southern China, Myanmar (Mon people) and some community in India... Although the Communist government had initially proscribed the practice of such rituals, deeming them to be superstitions, they relented in 1987, once again legalizing their practice.\n\nThe cult of Four Palaces (Tứ Phủ) worships a hierarchical pantheon of Taoist gods, Buddhist and historical figures. They included:\n\nTen Princes are mythical or historical figures. \n\n"}
