Eileen Barker noted that there five sources of information on new religious movements (NRMs): the information provided by such groups themselves, that provided by ex-members as well as the friends and relatives of members, organisations that collect information on NRMs, the mainstream media, and academics studying such phenomena.\n\nThe study of new religions is unified by its topic of interest, rather than by its methodology, and is therefore interdisciplinary in nature. A sizeable body of scholarly literature on new religions has been published, most of it produced by social scientists. Among the disciplines that NRS uses are anthropology, history, psychology, religious studies, and sociology. Of these approaches, sociology played a particularly prominent role in the development of the field, resulting in it being initially confined largely to a narrow array of sociological questions. This came to change in later scholarship, which began to apply theories and methods initially developed for examining more mainstream religions to the study of new ones.\n\nThe majority of research has been directed toward those new religions which have attracted a greater deal of public controversy; less controversial NRMs have tended to be the subject of less scholarly research. It has also been noted that scholars of new religions have often avoided researching certain movements which tend instead to be studied by scholars from other backgrounds; the feminist spirituality movement is usually examined by scholars of women's studies, African-American new religions by scholars of Africana studies, and Native American new religions by scholars of Native American studies.\n\nIn Japan, the academic study of new religions appeared in the years following the Second World War. In the 1960s American sociologist John Lofland lived with Unification Church missionary Young Oon Kim and a small group of American church members in California and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships. Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: 'The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes', and in 1966 in book form by Prentice-Hall as \"\". It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of religious conversion, as well as one of the first sociological studies of a new religious movement.\n\nIn Western nations the study of new religions became a distinct field in the 1970s; prior to this, new religions had been examined from varying perspectives, with Pentecostalism for instance being studied by church historians and cargo cults by anthropologists. This Western academic study of new religions emerged in response to growing public concerns regarding the emergence of various NRMs during the 1970s. By the latter part of that decade, increasing numbers of papers on new religions were being presented at the annual conferences of the American Academy of Religion, Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, and the Association for the Sociology of Religion. The manner in which the scholarly study of new religions rose to prominence due to the public perception that these movements were social threats bore similarities with the manner in which Islamic studies grew in Western nations following the September 11 attacks in 2001. The study of new religions would only be fully embraced by the Western religious studies establishment in the 1990s.\n\nIn 1988, the charity INFORM (Information Network Focus on Religious Movements) was established by Barker, who was then a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics. The organisation was supported by the UK Home Office and the British established churches and was designed to conduct research and disseminate accurate information about new religions.\nBarker established INFORM due to her \"conviction that a great deal of unnecessary suffering has resulted from ignorance of the nature and characteristics of the current wave of [NRMs] in the West.\"\nAlso in 1988, the Italian scholar Massimo Introvigne established CESNUR (Centre for Studies on New Religions) in Turin; it brought together academics studying NRMs in both Europe and North America. In the United States, CESNUR gained representation through the Institute for the Study of American Religion in Santa Barbara, California, which was directed by J. Gordon Melton.\n\nScholars of new religion often operate in a politicised environment given that their research can be cited in legal briefs and judicial decisions regarding NRMs. In Barker's view, academic research into NRMs had practical applications in dealing with the problems that people experience with regard to NRMs. It can, for example, provide accurate information about a particular religious movement that can help guide an individual's reactions to the group; \"an awareness of the complexity of a situation might help people to avoid precipitous actions that would later have been regretted.\" However, given that scholars of new religions often reject the stereotypes about \"cults\" promoted by the anti-cultist movements, they have often been criticised by proponents of the latter. Anti-cult groups have sometimes criticised scholarly groups such as these, claiming that they uncritically believe what NRMs tell them, that they are pro-NRM, or that they ignore the issues raised by ex-members. They sometimes have accused academic researchers of being \"cult apologists\".\n\nInclusion in this list assumes having both the requisite training as well as actually conducting at least one research study on cults and/or new religious movements (using accepted methodological standards common in the research community), published in a peer-reviewed journal or academic book.\n"}

{"id": "27913535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27913535", "title": "All Religions are One", "text": "All Religions are One\n\nAll Religions are One is a series of philosophical aphorisms by William Blake, written in 1788. Following on from his initial experiments with relief etching in the non-textual \"The Approach of Doom\" (1787), \"All Religions are One\" and \"There is No Natural Religion\" represent Blake's first successful attempt to combine image and text via relief etching, and are thus the earliest of his illuminated manuscripts. As such, they serve as a significant milestone in Blake's career; as Peter Ackroyd points out, \"his newly invented form now changed the nature of his expression. It had enlarged his range; with relief etching, the words inscribed like those of God upon the tables of law, Blake could acquire a new role.\"\n\nIn 1822, Blake completed a short two-page dramatic piece which would prove to be the last of his illuminated manuscripts, entitled \"The Ghost of Abel A Revelation In the Visions of Jehovah Seen by William Blake\". Inscribed in the colophon of this text is \"W Blakes Original Stereotype was 1788\". It is almost universally agreed amongst Blakean scholars, that the \"Original Stereotype\" to which he here refers was \"All Religions are One\" and/or \"There is No Natural Religion\".\n\nDuring the 1770s, Blake had come to feel that one of the major problems with reproducing artwork in print was the division of labour by which it was achieved; one person would create a design (the artist), another would engrave it (the engraver), another print it (the printer) and another publish it (the publisher). It was unusual for artists to engrave their own designs, due primarily to the social status attached to each job; engraving was not seen as an especially exalted profession, and was instead regarded as nothing more than mechanical reproduction. Artists like James Barry and John Hamilton Mortimer were the exceptions to the norm insofar as they tended to engrave their own material. A further division in the process was that text and images were handled by different artisans; text was printed by means of a movable letterpress, whereas images were engraved, two very different jobs.\n\nDuring Blake's training as a professional copy engraver with James Basire during the 1770s, the most common method of engraving was stippling, which was thought to give a more accurate impression of the original picture than the previously dominant method, line engraving. Etching was also commonly used for layering in such aspects as landscape and background. All traditional methods of engraving and etching were intaglio, which meant that the design's outline was traced with a needle through an acid-resistant 'ground' which had been poured over the copperplate. The plate was then covered with acid, and the engraver went over the incised lines with a burin to allow the acid to bite into the furrows and eat into the copper itself. The acid would then be poured off, leaving the design incised on the plate. The engraver would then engrave the plate's entire surface with a web of crosshatched lines, before pouring the ink onto the plate and transferring it to the printing press.\n\nFrustrated with this method, Blake seems to have begun thinking about a new method of publishing at least as early as 1784, as in that year a rough description of what would become relief etching appears in his unpublished satire, \"An Island in the Moon\". Around the same time, George Cumberland had been experimenting with a method to allow him to reproduce handwriting via an etched plate, and Blake incorporated Cumberland's method into his own relief etching; treating the text as handwritten script rather than mechanical letterpress, and thus allowing him to make it a component of the image.\n\nBlake's great innovation in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, parts of the plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto the plate with an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate’s edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and pour the acid about a quarter of an inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly above the rest of the plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern rubber stamp. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press. This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio. The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he wrote in reverse. Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text on a sheet of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.\n\nBlake could also colour the plates themselves in coloured inks before pressing them or tint them with watercolours after printing. Because of this aspect, a major component of relief etching was that every page of every book was a unique piece of art; no two copies of any page in Blake's entire \"oeuvre\" are identical. Variations in the actual print, different colouring choices, repainted plates, accidents during the acid bath etc., all led to multiple examples of the same plate.\n\nBlake himself referred to relief etching as \"printing in the infernal method, by means of corrosives [...] melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid.\" A contemporary description of the method was provided by Blake's friend, J.T. Smith; \"writing his poetry, and drawing his marginal subjects of embellishments in outline upon the copper-plate with an impervious liquid, and then eating the plain parts or lights away with aquafortis considerably below them so that the outlines were left as Stereotype.\"\n\nRelief etching was the same basic method used for woodcutting, and copper relief etching had been practised in the early eighteenth century by Elisha Kirkall, but Blake was the first to use such a method to create both words and designs mixed together on the same plate. Apart from the unique aesthetic effects possible, a major advantage of relief etching was that Blake could print the material himself. Because the text was in relief, the pressure needed for printing was constant, unlike in intaglio printing, where different pressures were needed to force the paper into the furrows, depending on size. Additionally, intaglio etchings and engravings were printed with great pressure, but in relief etching, because the printed material was a raised surface rather than incised lines, considerably less pressure was required. As such, relief etching tackled the problem of the division of labour of publishing. Blake's new method was autographic; \"it permitted – indeed promoted – a seamless relationship between conception and execution rather than the usual divisions between invention and production embedded in eighteenth-century print technology, and its economic and social distinctions among authors, printers, artists and engravers. Like drawings and manuscripts, Blake's relief etchings were created by the direct and positive action of the author/artist's hand without intervening processes.\" Blake served as artist, engraver, printer \"and\" publisher.\n\nAlthough \"All Religions are One\" was etched in 1788, the only surviving copy (known as Copy A) was not printed until 1795; a large paper copy printed as part of a deluxe edition of Blake's collected illuminated manuscripts. Whether he had printed \"All Religions\" prior to 1795 is unknown. However, the fact that it is not mentioned in his 'To the Public' address of October 1793, where he listed all of his extant manuscripts up to that time except \"All Religions\" and \"No Natural Religion\", would suggest he had not.\n\nCopy A is located in The Huntington Library, except Plate 2 (title page), which exists in two impressions. The copy of the title page which goes with Copy A is located in the Geoffrey Keynes Collection in the Fitzwilliam Museum. The title page from another copy (colour printed in brown ink), the additional plates of which are unrecorded, is in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\n\"All Religions are One\" comprises ten plates, each of which is roughly 5.4 X 4 cm., with each paragraph on a separate plate, except Plate 10, which contains both Principal 7 and a short paragraph which functions as a conclusion to the series. In numerous cases, it seems as if the acid has eaten away too much of the relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and wash, often touching the text and design outlines with pen. Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary colour printing, a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of white line engraving, a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be eaten away by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.\n\nThe black ink framing lines drawn around each design are thought to have been added at a later date, possibly in 1818, just prior to Blake giving the plates to John Linnell. The ink and wash work in the designs themselves may also have been executed at that time, although this cannot be ascertained for certain. It has been suggested that the framing lines may have been added due to the discrepancy between the size of the plates and the size of the paper (each sheet is 37.8 x 27 cm.).\nPlates 1 and 3–10 of the Huntington copy were acquired by John Linnell some time after 1818, with the missing title page replaced by an impression of the title page from \"There is No Natural Religion\". The plates were sold from the Linnell estate on 15 March 1918 to Henry E. Huntington. Plate 2 was acquired by George A. Smith in 1853. It may have subsequently been owned by William Muir, but was ultimately sold at Sotheby's by Sir Hickman Bacon on 21 July 1953, to Geoffrey Keynes, who donated it to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1982.\n\nAfter the original 1795 printing, the text of \"All Religions\" was not published again until 1893, in \"The Works of William Blake, Poetic, Symbolic and Critical\", edited by W.B. Yeats and E.J. Ellis.\n\nUntil 1971, most editors tended to consider \"All Religions are One\" as later than \"There is No Natural Religion\". For example, in his 1905 book \"The poetical works of William Blake; a new and verbatim text from the manuscript engraved and letterpress originals\", John Sampson places \"No Natural Religion\" prior to \"All Religions\" in his 'Appendix to the Prophetic Books'. However, in 1971, Geoffrey Keynes argued that \"All Religions are One\" was the earlier of the two, based on what he saw as its \"greater technical imperfection.\" In his 1978 book, \"The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake\", David Bindman initially disagreed with Keynes, arguing that the imperfections in \"All Religions\" are not because of an earlier date of composition, but because of the increased complexity of the plates, with such complexity demonstrating Blake growing in confidence from the more rudimentary plates for \"No Natural Religion\". Most scholars however support Keynes, and \"All Religions are One\" precedes \"There is No Natural Religion\" in almost all modern anthologies of Blake's work; for example, Alicia Ostriker's \"William Blake: The Complete Poems\" (1977), David V. Erdman's 2nd edition of \"The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake\" (1982), Morris Eaves', Robert N. Essick's and Joseph Viscomi's \"Blake's Illuminated Books, Volume 3: The Early Illuminated Books\" (1993), even Bindman's own \"The Complete Illuminated Books of William Blake\" (2003), and W.H. Stevenson's 3rd edition of \"Blake: The Complete Poems\" (2007).\n\nFurther evidence for Keynes hypothesis is discussed by Eaves, Essick and Viscomi, who, in counterpoint to Bindman, see the style of \"No Natural Religion\" as more confident than that of \"All Religions\". They especially cite the use of upright roman lettering in \"All Religions\" contrasted with the italic, cursive writing on several plates of \"No Natural Religion\"; \"this style was easier to execute since it required fewer independent strokes. And since the resulting dense matrix of lines provided better support for the inking dabber, italic permitted a shallower etch.\" Blake introduced italic script on plate a3 of \"No Natural Religion\", a script which he would use throughout the 1790s. Other evidence for an earlier dating of \"All Religions\" is that many of the individual letters themselves lean to the left, unlike in \"No Natural Religion\". This was a common problem in mirror writing, and its presence in \"All Religions\" but not \"No Natural Religion\" suggests Blake was only learning how to overcome it as he worked.\n\nWhen analysing \"All Religions are One\" it is important to remember that the images are not necessarily literal depictions of the text; \"the philosophical propositions [...] offer little visual imagery or even named objects. These qualities may have determined the relative independence of many of the designs from the accompanying text. The links are thematic and metaphoric, not direct and literal.\"\nThe central concern in \"All Religions are One\" is the notion of the \"Poetic Genius\", which is roughly analogous to the imagination. Blake argues that the Poetic Genius is greater than all else and \"is the true man.\" The Poetic Genius thus replaces traditional concepts of divinity insofar as \"The body or outward form of Man is derived from the Poetic Genius [...] the forms of all things are derived from their Genius. which by the Ancients was call'd an Angel & Spirit & Demon.\" Thus, the Poetic Genius supplants theological belief. This Poetic Genius is universal, common to all Mankind; \"as all men are alike in outward form [...] all men are alike in the Poetic Genius.\" Similarly, all philosophies are derived from the Poetic Genius; \"all sects of Philosophies are from the Poetic Genius adapted to the weaknesses of every individual\", and so too are all religions, which are merely expressions of the Poetic Genius; \"the Religions of all Nations are derived from each Nations different reception of the Poetic Genius which is everywhere call'd the Spirit of Prophecy,\" again emphasising the theological character of the Poetic Genius. Even the Bible originates with the Poetic Genius; \"The Jewish & Christian Testaments are An original derivation from the Poetic Genius.\" Thus, as all Men are alike in their Poetic Genius, and as all religions originate with the Poetic Genius, so too must all religions be alike, thus all religions are one.\n\nDavid Bindman classifies \"All Religions are One\" as \"a rather abstract dialogue with conventional theology,\" and in this sense, it is often interpreted as Blake's earliest engagement with deism and dualism. Similarly, Northrop Frye argues that Blake's theory that all religions are one is a \"visionary tolerance\" at odds with the \"rational tolerance\" of deism \"which holds that all religions are equally an attempt to solve an insoluble mystery.\" Working along the same lines, Florence Sandler argues that in these texts Blake \"set himself to the task of separating true religion from its perversions in his own age and in the Bible itself.\" Also concentrating on the refutation of deism, Alicia Ostriker refers to the series as a \"mockery of rationalism and an insistence on Man's potential infinitude.\" S. Foster Damon suggests that what Blake has done in \"All Religions are One\" is \"dethroned reason from its ancient place as the supreme faculty of man, replacing it with the Imagination.\" Damon also argues that \"Blake had completed his revolutionary theory of the nature of Man and proclaimed the unity of all true religions.\" Harold Bloom reaches much the same conclusion, suggesting that Blake is arguing for the \"primacy of the poetic imagination over all metaphysical and moral systems.\" A similar conclusion is reached by Denise Vultee, who argues that \"the two tractates are part of Blake's lifelong quarrel with the philosophy of Bacon, Newton, and Locke. Rejecting the rational empiricism of eighteenth-century deism or \"natural religion\", which looked to the material world for evidence of God's existence, Blake offers as an alternative the imaginative faculty or \"Poetic Genius\".\"\n\nIn terms of influences on Blake, in 1787 Henry Fuseli was working on a translation of J.C. Lavater's \"Aphorisms on Man\" for the publisher Joseph Johnson, when he hired Blake to engrave the frontispiece. Blake became so enamoured of Lavater's work that on the inside cover of his own copy of the book, he inscribed both his name and Lavater's, and drew a heart encompassing them. Blake also extensively annotated his own copy of \"Aphorisms\", and a number of critics have noted parallels between the Lavater annotations and Blake's own aphorisms in both \"All Religions\" and \"No Natural Religion\". S. Foster Damon specifically points to Lavater's first two aphorisms as having a strong influence on Blake;\n\n\nTo these points Blake has annotated \"This is true Christian philosophy far above all abstraction.\"\n\nAnother work which may also have influenced him is Emanuel Swedenborg's \"Heaven and Hell\" (1758). In his annotations to Swedenborg, Blake twice connects the word \"Lord\" with \"Poetic Genius\". During Swedenborg's discussion of the connection between the spiritual world and the natural world, Blake writes \"He who Loves feels love descend into him & if he has wisdom may perceive it is from the Poetic Genius which is the Lord.\" Shortly thereafter, to Swedenborg's \"the negation of God constitutes Hell\", Blake annotates \"the negation of the Poetic Genius.\"\n\nWhile the Lavater and Swedenborg influences are somewhat speculative, the importance of Bacon, Newton and Locke is not, as it is known that Blake despised empiricism from an early age. In 1808, as he annotated \"The Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds\", Blake wrote\n\nHarold Bloom also cites the work of Anthony Collins, Matthew Tindal and John Toland as having an influence on Blake's thoughts. In a more general sense, \"Blake sees the school of Bacon and Locke as the foundation of natural religion, the deistic attempt to prove the existence of God on the basis of sensate experience and its rational investigation.\" To that end, Blake \"manipulates the syncretic mythology of Jacob Bryant, Paul Henri Mallet, and perhaps other founders of what has become the comparative study of religion, to argue for the existence of a universal and supra-rational 'Poetic Genius' that expresses itself through the shared (though ever various) forms of all religions.\"\n\nIn relation to his later work, Northrop Frye sees \"All Religions are One\" and \"There is No Natural Religion\" as forming a fundamental statement of intent for Blake, a kind of pre-emptive outline of his future work, \"a summarised statement of the doctrines of the engraved canon.\" Similarly, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi state that they \"contain some of Blake's most fundamental principles and reveal the foundation for later development in his thought and art.\" W.H. Stevenson calls them \"a very early statement of fundamental opinions [Blake] held all his life.\" As an example of how Blake returned to the specific themes of \"All Religions\", in \"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\" (1790), he writes \"the Poetic Genius was the first principle and all the others merely derivative\" (12:22–24).\n\n\n"}

For example, in Christianity the liturgical year is an annual cycle, which for some Christian denominations is composed of the \"temporal cycle\" that tracks the events in the life of Christ, and the \"sanctoral cycle\" which tracks the various saint's days. Some Christian churches only observe the \"temporal cycle\".\n\nIn climatology, an annual cycle is the part of a measured quantity's fluctuation that is attributed to Earth's changing position in orbit over the course of the year. Such quantities might be influenced directly (e.g. incoming solar radiation at a point at the surface) or indirectly (e.g. stratospheric westerlies and easterlies over the winter and summer hemispheres, respectively) by orbital position.\n\nMathematically, the climatological annual cycle is commonly estimated from observational data or model output by taking the average of all Januaries, all Februaries, and so forth.

{"id": "2524491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2524491", "title": "Argument from a proper basis", "text": "Argument from a proper basis\n\nThe argument from a proper basis is an ontological argument for the existence of God related to fideism. Alvin Plantinga argued that belief in God is a properly basic belief, and so no basis for belief in God is necessary.\n\nThe best-known defender of this argument is Alvin Plantinga. According to the argument from a proper basis, belief in God can be rational and justified even without arguments or evidence for the existence of God. More specifically, Plantinga argues that belief in God is properly basic, and, owing to a religious externalist epistemology, he claims belief in God could be justified independently of evidence. His externalist epistemology, called \"Proper functionalism\", is a form of epistemological reliabilism.\n\nPlantinga discusses his view of Reformed epistemology and proper functionalism in a three-volume series. In the first book of the trilogy, \"Warrant: The Current Debate\", Plantinga introduces, analyzes, and criticizes 20th-century developments in analytic epistemology, particularly the works of Roderick Chisholm, Laurence BonJour, William Alston, and Alvin Goldman. Plantinga argues that the theories of what he calls \"warrant\"—what many others have called justification (Plantinga draws out a difference: justification is a matter of fulfilling one's epistemic duties, whereas warrant is what transforms true belief into knowledge)—put forth by these epistemologists have failed to capture in full what is required for knowledge.\n\nIn the second book of his three book philosophical series, \"Warrant and Proper Function\", he introduces the notion of warrant as an alternative to justification and discusses topics like self-knowledge, memories, perception, and probability. Plantinga's \"proper function\" account argues that as a necessary condition of having warrant, one's \"belief-forming and belief-maintaining apparatus of powers\" are functioning properly—\"working the way it ought to work\". Plantinga explains his argument for proper function with reference to a \"design plan\", as well as an environment in which one's cognitive equipment is optimal for use. Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: \"it is perhaps possible that evolution (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans\", but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological naturalism- i.e. epistemology that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties – is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics – in this case the belief in a creator God or in some designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.\n\nAccording to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if:\n\n(1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning properly…; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) … the design plan governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or function, the production of true beliefs…; and (4) the design plan is a good one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan in that sort of environment is true.\n\nPlantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as \"naturalistic\", including the \"functional generalization\" view of John Pollock, the evolutionary/etiological account provided by Ruth Millikan, and a dispositional view held by John Bigelow and Robert Pargetter. Plantinga also discusses his evolutionary argument against naturalism in the later chapters of \"Warrant and Proper Function\".\n\nIn 2000 Plantinga's third volume, \"Warranted Christian Belief\", was published. In this volume, Plantinga's warrant theory is the basis for his theological end: providing a philosophical basis for Christian belief, an argument for why Christian theistic belief can enjoy warrant. In the book, he develops two models for such beliefs, the \"A/C\" (Aquinas/Calvin) model, and the \"Extended A/C\" model. The former attempts to show that a belief in God can be justified, warranted and rational, while the Extended model tries to show that core Christian theological beliefs, including the Trinity, the Incarnation, the resurrection of Christ, the atonement, salvation, etc. can be warranted. Under this model, Christians are warranted in their beliefs because of the work of the Holy Spirit in bringing those beliefs about in the believer.\n\nThe best known objection to the argument from a proper basis is known as 'The Great Pumpkin Objection'. Alvin Plantinga brought it up in his 1983 book \"Warrant: The Current Debate\", and described it as follows:\nIt is tempting to raise the following sort of question. If belief in God can be properly basic, why cannot just any belief be properly basic? Could we not say the same for any bizarre aberration we can think of? What about voodoo or astrology? What about the belief that the Great Pumpkin returns every Halloween? Could I properly take that as basic? Suppose I believe that if I flap my arms with sufficient vigor, I can take off and fly about the room; could I defend myself against the charge of irrationality by claiming this belief is basic? If we say that belief in God is properly basic, will we not be committed to holding that just anything, or nearly anything, can properly be taken as basic, thus throwing wide the gates to irrationalism and superstition? (p. 74)\n\nPlantinga's answer to this line of thinking is that the objection simply assumes that the criteria for \"proper basicality\" propounded by classical foundationalism (self-evidence, incorrigibility, and sense-perception) are the only possible criteria for properly basic beliefs. It is as if the Great Pumpkin objector feels that if properly basic beliefs cannot be arrived at by way of one of these criteria, then it follows that just 'any' belief could then be properly basic, precisely because there are no other criteria. But Plantinga says it simply doesn't follow from the rejection of classical foundationalist criteria that all possibility for criteria has been exhausted and this is exactly what the Great Pumpkin objection assumes.\n\nPlantinga takes his counter-argument further, asking how the great pumpkin objector \"knows\" that such criteria are the only criteria. The objector certainly seems to hold it as 'basic' that the classical foundationalist criteria are all that is available. Yet, such a claim is neither self-evident, incorrigible, nor evident to the senses. This rebuts the Great Pumpkin objection by demonstrating the classical foundationalist position to be internally incoherent, propounding an epistemic position which it itself does not follow.\n\n"}
{"id": "925810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=925810", "title": "Axial Age", "text": "Axial Age\n\nAxial Age (also Axis Age, from ) is a term coined by German philosopher Karl Jaspers in the sense of a \"pivotal age\" characterizing the period of ancient history from about the 8th to the 3rd century BCE.\n\nThen, according to Jaspers' concept, new ways of thinking appeared in Persia, India, China and the Greco-Roman world in religion and philosophy, in a striking parallel development, without any obvious direct cultural contact between all of the participating Eurasian cultures. Jaspers identified key thinkers from this age who had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. \n\nJaspers' approach to the culture of the middle of the first millennium BC has been adopted by other scholars and academics, and has become a point of discussion in the history of religion.\n\nJaspers introduced the concept of an Axial Age in his book \"Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte\" (\"The Origin and Goal of History\"), published in 1949. The simultaneous appearance of thinkers and philosophers in different areas of the world had been remarked by numerous authors since the 18th century, notably by the French Indologist Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron. Jaspers explicitly cited some of these authors, including Victor von Strauß (1859) and Peter Ernst von Lasaulx (1870). \nJasper's contribution was to claim that the Axial Age should be viewed as an objective empirical fact of history, independently of religious considerations. He argued that during the Axial Age, \"the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently in China, India, Persia, Judea, and Greece. And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today\".\n\nHe identified a number of key thinkers as having had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. Jaspers held up this age as unique, and one to which the rest of the history of human thought might be compared.\n\nJaspers presented his first outline of the Axial age by a series of examples:\n\nJaspers described the Axial Age as \"an interregnum between two ages of great empire, a pause for liberty, a deep breath bringing the most lucid consciousness\". It has also been suggested that the Axial Age was a historically liminal period, when old certainties had lost their validity and new ones were still not ready. \n\nJaspers had a particular interest in the similarities in circumstance and thought of its figures. Similarities included an engagement in the quest for human meaning and the rise of a new elite class of religious leaders and thinkers in China, India and the Occident. \n\nThese spiritual foundations were laid by individual thinkers within a framework of a changing social environment. Jaspers argues that the characteristics appeared under similar political circumstances: China, India, the Middle East and the Occident each comprised multiple small states engaged in internal and external struggles.\nThe three regions all gave birth to, and then institutionalized, a tradition of travelling scholars, who roamed from city to city to exchange ideas. After the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, Taoism and Confucianism emerged in China. In other regions, the scholars were largely from extant religious traditions; in India, from Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism; in Persia, from Zoroastrianism; in The Levant, from Judaism; and in Greece, from Sophism and other classical philosophies.\n\nMany of the cultures of the axial age were considered second-generation societies because they were built on the societies that preceded them.\n\nParshvanatha (23rd Tirthankara in the 9th century BCE) and Mahavira (24th Tirthankara in the 6th century BCE), known as the fordmakers of Jainism lived during this age. They propagated the religion of sramanas (previous Tirthankaras) and influenced Indian philosophy by propounding the principles of ahimsa (non-violence), karma, samsara and asceticism.\n\nBuddhism, also of the sramana tradition of India, was another of the world's most influential philosophies, founded by Siddhartha Gautama, or the Buddha, who lived during this period; its spread was aided by Ashoka, who lived late in the period.\n\nIn China, the Hundred Schools of Thought were in contention and Confucianism and Taoism arose during this era, and in this area it remains a profound influence on social and religious life.\n\nZoroastrianism, another of Jaspers' examples, is one of the first monotheistic religions and some believe it greatly influenced modern Abrahamic religions with such conceptions as the devil and Heaven/Hell. The exact date of Zoroaster's life is debated by scholars, with some, such as Mary Boyce, arguing that Zoroastrianism itself is significantly older. Others, such as William W Malandra and RC Zaehner, suggest that he may indeed have been an early contemporary of Cyrus living around 600 BC. However, Boyce and other leading scholars who once supported much earlier dates for Zarathustra/Zoroaster have recently changed their position on the time when he likely lived, so that there is an emerging consensus regarding him as a contemporary or near-contemporary of Cyrus the Great.\n\nJaspers' axial shifts included the rise of Platonism, which would later become a major influence on the Western world through both Christianity and secular thought throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance.\n\nIn addition to Jaspers, the philosopher Eric Voegelin referred to this age as \"The Great Leap of Being\", constituting a new spiritual awakening and a shift of perception from societal to individual values. Thinkers and teachers like the Buddha, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, and Anaxagoras contributed to such awakenings which Plato would later call \"anamnesis\", or a remembering of things forgotten.\n\nDavid Christian notes that the first \"universal religions\" appeared in the age of the first universal empires and of the first all-encompassing trading networks.\n\nAnthropologist David Graeber has pointed out that \"the core period of Jasper's Axial age [...] corresponds almost exactly to the period in which coinage was invented. What's more, the three parts of the world where coins were first invented were also the very parts of the world where those sages lived; in fact, they became the epicenters of Axial Age religious and philosophical creativity.\" Drawing on the work of classicist Richard Seaford and literary theorist Marc Shell on the relation between coinage and early Greek thought, Graeber argues that an understanding of the rise of markets is necessary to grasp the context in which the religious and philosophical insights of the Axial age arose. The ultimate effect of the introduction of coinage was, he argues, an \"ideal division of spheres of human activity that endures to this day: on the one hand the market, on the other, religion.\"\n\nGerman sociologist Max Weber played an important role in Jaspers' thinking. Shmuel Eisenstadt argues in the introduction to \"The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations\" that Weber's work in his \"\", \"\" and \"Ancient Judaism\" provided a background for the importance of the period, and notes parallels with Eric Voegelin's \"Order and History\". Wider acknowledgement of Jaspers' work came after it was presented at a conference and published in \"Dædalus\" in 1975, and Jaspers' suggestion that the period was uniquely transformative generated important discussion amongst other scholars, such as Johann Arnason. In literature, Gore Vidal in his novel \"Creation\" covers much of this Axial Age through the fictional perspective of a Persian adventurer.\n\nShmuel Eisenstadt analyses economic circumstances relating to the coming of the Axial Age in Greece.\n\nReligious historian Karen Armstrong explored the period in her \"The Great Transformation\", and the theory has been the focus of academic conferences. Usage of the term has expanded beyond Jaspers' original formulation. Armstrong argues that the Enlightenment was a \"Second Axial Age\", including thinkers such as Isaac Newton, Sigmund Freud, and Albert Einstein. It has also been suggested that the modern era is a new axial age, wherein relationships between religion, secularity, and traditional thought are changing.\n\nThe validity of the concept has been called into question. In 2006 Diarmaid MacCulloch called the Jaspers thesis \"a baggy monster, which tries to bundle up all sorts of diversities over four very different civilisations, only two of which had much contact with each other during the six centuries that (after adjustments) he eventually singled out, between 800 and 200 BCE\". A comprehensive critique appears in Iain Provan's 2013 book \"Convenient Myths: The Axial Age, Dark Green Religion, and the World That Never Was\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "497380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=497380", "title": "Chosen people", "text": "Chosen people\n\nThroughout history, various groups of people have considered themselves to be chosen people by a deity for a purpose, such as to act as the deity's agent on earth. In monotheistic faiths references to God are used in constructs such as \"God's Chosen People\". The phenomenon of a \"chosen people\" is particularly common in the\nIsraelite tradition, where it originally referred to the Israelites—in fact Jews refer to this as a burden to spread the message of one God. Some claims of chosenness are based on parallel claims of Israelite ancestry, as is the case for the Christian Identity and Black Hebrew sects—both which claim themselves (and not Jews) to be the \"true Israel\". Others claim a \"spiritual\" chosenness, including most Christian denominations, who traditionally believe the church has replaced Israel as the People of God.\n\nAnthropologists commonly regard claims of chosenness as a form of ethnocentrism.\n\nIn Judaism, \"chosenness\" is the belief that the Jews, via descent from the ancient Israelites, are the chosen people, i.e. chosen to be in a covenant with God. The idea of the Israelites being chosen by God is found most directly in the Book of Deuteronomy as the verb \"bahar\" (), and is alluded to elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible using other terms such as \"holy people\". Much is written about these topics in rabbinic literature. The three largest Jewish denominations—Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism—maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose. Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah.\n\nIn Mormonism, all Latter Day Saints are viewed as covenant, or chosen, people because they have accepted the name of Jesus Christ through the ordinance of baptism. In contrast to supersessionism, Latter Day Saints do not dispute the \"chosen\" status of the Jewish people.\nMost practicing Mormons receive a patriarchal blessing that reveals their lineage in the House of Israel. This lineage may be blood related or through \"adoption;\" therefore, a child may not necessarily share the lineage of her parents (but will still be a member of the tribes of Israel). It is a widely held belief that most members of the faith are in the tribe of Ephraim or the tribe of Manasseh.\n\nThe Christian Identity movement sees the Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, Nordic and kindred peoples of the world as both the descendants of the ancient Israelites and the physical descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Christian Identity, though not organized as a religion, comprises certain individuals, churches and some prison gangs with a white supremacist theology\nthat promotes a racial interpretation of Christianity. Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who regarded Europeans as the \"chosen people\" and Jews as the cursed offspring of Cain. White supremacist sects and gangs later adopted many of these teachings.\n\nBased on Jewish biblical tradition and Ethiopian legend via Kebra Nagast, Rastas believe that Israel's King Solomon, together with Ethiopian Queen of Sheba, conceived a child which began the Solomonic line of kings in Ethiopia, rendering the Ethiopian people as the true children of Israel, and thereby chosen. Reinforcement of this belief occurred when Beta Israel, Ethiopia's ancient Israelite First Temple community, were rescued from Sudanese famine and brought to Israel during Operation Moses in 1985.\n\nSun Myung Moon taught that Korea is the chosen nation, selected to serve a divine mission and was \"chosen by God to be the birthplace of the leading figure of the age\" and was the birthplace of \"Heavenly Tradition\", ushering in God's kingdom.\n\nThe NOI teaches that black people constitute a nation and that through the institution of the Atlantic slave trade they were systematically denied knowledge of their history, language, culture, and religion and, in effect, lost control of their lives. Founder Elijah Muhammad called for the establishment of a separate nation for black Americans and the adoption of a religion based on the worship of Allah and on the belief that blacks were his chosen people.\n\n"}

The work is written in Persian, probably having been composed in about 1655 CE.\n\nThe \"Dabistan-e Madahib\" is best known for its chapter on the Dīn-i Ilāhī, the syncretic religion propounded by the Mughal emperor Jalāl ud-Dīn Muḥammad Akbar (\"Akbar the Great\") after 1581 and is possibly the most reliable account of the \"Ibādat Khāna\" discussions that led up to this.\n\nThis work was first printed by Nazar Ashraf in a very accurate edition in movable type at Calcutta in 1809 (an offset reprint of this edition was published by Ali Asghar Mustafawi from Teheran in 1982). A lithographed edition was published by Ibrahim bin Nur Muhammad from Bombay in AH 1292 (1875). In 1877, Munshi Nawal Kishore published another Lithographed edition from Lucknow. The distinguished Persian scholar Francis Gladwin translated the chapter on the Persians into English and published it from Calcutta in 1789. A German version by E. Dalburg from Wurzburg was published in 1809. The chapter on the Raushanyas was translated into English by J. Leyden for the \"Asiatic Researches\", xi, Calcutta. The entire work was translated into English by David Shea and Anthony Troyer under the title, \"The Dabistan or School of Manners\" (1843) in three volumes from London. \n\nThe critical English-language edition by David Shea and Anthony Troyer in 1843 is slightly flawed since the translators were not well-versed in much of the subject matter. The editors, who were not certain of the identity of the author, suggest a certain Muhsin Fani and propose 1670 as his date of death. They furthermore stated that he was \"of the philosophic sect of Sufis\", but the 1993 edition of the \"Encyclopaedia Iranica\" suggests that the author was most likely a Zoroastrian. The present Persian edition of the text by Rezazadeh Malik attributes it to the son and successor of Azar Kayvan, Kay Khosrow Esfandiyar. The author may have belonged to a Persian tradition (Sipásíán) that can be considered to be heterodox relative to orthodox Zoroastrianism.\n\nThe author describes that he spent time in Patna, Kashmir, Lahore, Surat and Srikakulam (Andhra Pradesh). He is perceived to have been a person of great scholarship and curiosity, and extremely open-minded for the context of his time. He mentions numerous interviews with scholars of numerous faiths, which suggests that he was well connected, and so qualified to report on the Dīn-i Ilāhī.\n\nAccording to \"The Jew in the Lotus\" by Rodger Kamenetz, a \"Dabistan\" was commissioned by a Mughal mystic prince, Dara Shikoh. The section on Judaism consists of translations by a Persian Jewish Sufi Muslim convert, Sarmad Kashani, and his Hindu disciple from Sindh. Walter Fischel notes: An English version of the \"Dabistan\" by David Shea (1843) is available at the Digital Library of India IISc.\n\nAlthough the author spent most of life in South Asia, he regarded himself as a Persian. However his perspective of the Hindus, and of other religions was unusually liberal. He writes:\n\nHe personally met many scholars of different faiths. For example, about the Jains he writes:\n\nHe observes that while Hindus dress following their own custom, the non-Muslims of Iran and Turan pass themselves off as Muslims, while practicing their faith in secret:\n\nHe describes the disputations in Akbar's Ibadat Khana in detail, as if he had been there:\n\nHe describes and defends the liberal views of Akbar:\n\nThe text is divided into twelve ta‘lims (chapters):\n\nChapter II includes one of the earliest historical account of the Sikhs.\n\n"}

As the title suggests, the ballad takes as its primary focus the coronation of William III of England and his consort Mary II of England, which took place in February 1689 (even though the ballad claims it took place in 1688. This is most likely a typographical error on the part of the composer or the printer). William III and Mary II's coregency marked the end of the Glorious Revolution and the reign of James II of England. The coregency also brought about a shift in the religious paradigm of 17th-century England, which was Roman Catholic when James II sat upon the throne. Indeed, the ballad comments on the \"vile pop'ry\" that ruled the throne prior to the rule of William III, which saw the restoration of Protestant liberty. Extant copies of the ballad are available at Magdelene College in the Pepys Library. Alternatively, online facsimiles of the ballad are available online for public consumption.\n\nSet to the tune of \"Hark the Thundering Cannons Roar,\" the ballad opens with an encomium directed toward King William III: \"Now the Royal deed is done, / King William’s seated on the Throne, / and we his Subjects justly own, / He was our preservation.\" The ballad goes on to explicate what it means for England's religious state now that William III is \"seated on the throne\": \"The Glories of our Court are clear, / Now Rome’s dark Clouds all disappear / And shall no more o’re-cast us here, / nor send their priests to fool us. ... [O]ur brave Prince William came, / Who smote the Babylonian Dame, / And brough her Tod-pole Tools to shame, / redeem’d us all from Slav’ry\" As the ballad makes clear, the ascension of William and Mary meant that Catholicism, the \"Babylonian Dame\" mentioned in these lines, was once again no longer the official religion of England. The ballad concludes as most encomium ballads do, which is to say with general praise of the subject: \"May they all delights obtain, / Prove happy in a prosp’rous Reign, / And e’ery thing they wish for gain, / and prove to them a blessing.\"\n\nThe ballad is broken up into eight octets with varying rhyme schemes. For instance, the first stanza has an \"AA BB CCC B\" rhyme scheme while the second stanza has an \"AAA B CCC B\" rhyme scheme.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17796289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17796289", "title": "Equanimity", "text": "Equanimity\n\nEquanimity (Latin: \"æquanimitas\", having an even mind; \"aequus\" even; \"animus\" mind/soul) is a state of psychological stability and composure which is undisturbed by experience of or exposure to emotions, pain, or other phenomena that may cause others to lose the balance of their mind. The virtue and value of equanimity is extolled and advocated by a number of major religions and ancient philosophies.\nFrom Fr. \"équanimité\", from L. \"aequanimitatem\" (nom. \"aequanimitas\") \"evenness of mind, calmness,\" from \"aequus\" \"even, level\" (see equal) + \"animus\" \"mind, spirit\" (see animus). Meaning \"evenness of temper\" in English is from 1610s.\n\nIn Hinduism the term for equanimity is समत्व \"samatvam\" (also rendered \"samatva\" or \"samata\"). \n\nIn Chapter Two, Verse 48 of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" one reads: \"yoga-sthaḥ kuru karmāṇi saṅgaṁ tyaktvā dhanañ-jaya siddhy-asiddhyoḥ samo bhūtvā samatvaṁ yoga ucyate\". Srila Prabhupada translates this as: Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.\nIn his book \"Samatvam - The Yoga of Equanimity\", Swami Sivananda states: \n\n\"An aspirant who treads the path to \"samatvam\" must make every effort to acquire the following essential qualities: \"Viveka\", discrimination; \"vairagya\", dispassion; \"shadsampat\", the six virtues (\"shama\", mental calmness and control; \"dama\", restraint of the senses; \"uparati\", sense withdrawal or \"pratyahara\"; \"titiksha\", endurance; \"shraddha\", faith and \"samadhana\", mental balance); and an intense desire for liberation, \"mumukshutva\". In order to possess the virtue of \"Samatvam\", he will also need to dedicate himself to steadying the mind every moment of his yoga career...\"\n\nAnother Sanskrit term for equanimity is \"upekṣhā\". This is the term used by Patanjali in his \"Yoga Sutras\" (1.33), Here \"upekṣhā\" is considered to be one of the four sublime attitudes, along with loving-kindness (\"maitri\"), compassion (\"karuṇā\"), and joy (\"mudita\"). It is related to the idea of Vairagya or \"dispassion\". The Upeksha Yoga school foregrounds equanimity as the most important tenet of a yoga practice.\n\nIn many Yoga traditions, the virtue of equanimity can be one of the results attained through regular meditation, combined with regular practice of pranayama, asanas and mental disciplines, which clear the mind and bring one inexorably toward a state of health and balance.\n\nEquanimity is a central concept in Stoic ethics and psychology. The Greek stoics use the word \"apatheia\" or \"ataraxia\" whereas the Roman stoics used the Latin word \"aequanimitas\". The Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius's \"Meditations\" detail a philosophy of service and duty, describing how to find and preserve equanimity in the midst of conflict by following nature as a source of guidance and inspiration. His adoptive father Antoninus Pius's last word was uttered when the tribune of the night-watch came to ask him for the night's password — Pius decided upon \"aequanimitas\" (equanimity). \n\nIn Pyrrhonism the term used for equanimity is \"ataraxia\", which means to be unperturbed. Ataraxia the goal of Pyrrhonist practice. \n\nIn Buddhism, equanimity (\"upekkhā\", \"upekṣhā\") is one of the four sublime attitudes and is considered:\n\nEquanimity can also be cultivated through meditation\n\nMany Jewish thinkers highlight the importance of equanimity (Menuhat ha-Nefesh or Yishuv ha-Da'at) as a necessary foundation for moral and spiritual development. The virtue of equanimity receives particular attention in the writings of rabbis such as Rabbi Yisroel Bal Shem Tov and Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv.\n\nSamuel Johnson defined equanimity as \"evenness of mind, neither elated nor depressed.\" In Christian philosophy, equanimity is considered essential for carrying out the theological virtues of gentleness, contentment, temperance, and charity.\n\nThe word “Islam” is derived from the Arabic word \"aslama\", which denotes the peace that comes from total surrender and acceptance. A Muslim may experientially behold that everything happening is meant to be, and stems from the ultimate wisdom of God; hence, being a Muslim can therefore be understood to mean that one is in a state of equanimity.\n\nThe voluminous Writings of the Baha'i Faith are filled with thousands of references to divine attributes, of which equanimity is one. Similar in intent and more frequently used than \"equanimity\" in the Baha'i Writings are \"detachment\" and \"selflessness\" which dispose human beings to free themselves from inordinate reactions to the changes and chances of the world. Humanity is called upon to show complete and sublime detachment from aught else but God, from all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, from the material world and from the promptings of their own interests and passions. Related concepts include faith, the concept of growing through suffering and being tested, fortitude under trials, dignity, patience, prudence, moderation, freedom from material things, radiant acquiescence, wisdom and evanescence. Baha'u'llah, the Central Personage of the Baha'i Faith, wrote: \"Until a being setteth his foot in the plane of sacrifice, he is bereft of every favour and grace; and this plane of sacrifice is the realm of dying to the self, that the radiance of the living God may then shine forth. The martyr’s field is the place of detachment from self, that the anthems of eternity may be upraised. Do all ye can to become wholly weary of self, and bind yourselves to that Countenance of Splendours; and once ye have reached such heights of servitude, ye will find, gathered within your shadow, all created things. This is boundless grace; this is the highest sovereignty; this is the life that dieth not. All else save this is at the last but manifest perdition and great loss.\"\n\nThe highly revered Son of Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha, was an exile and prisoner along with His Father, for more than forty years facing a torrent of various hardships. It is written about him: \"So imperturbable was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s equanimity that, while rumors were being bruited about that He might be cast into the sea, or exiled to Fizán in Tripolitania, or hanged on the gallows, He, to the amazement of His friends and the amusement of His enemies, was to be seen planting trees and vines in the garden of His house, whose fruits when the storm had blown over, He would bid His faithful gardener, Ismá’íl Áqá, pluck and present to those same friends and enemies on the occasion of their visits to Him.\" When in London He was asked about His time in prison and said: \"Freedom is not a matter of place. It is a condition. I was thankful for the prison, and the lack of liberty was very pleasing to me, for those days were passed in the path of service, under the utmost difficulties and trials, bearing fruits and results...Unless one accepts dire vicissitudes, he will not attain...When one is released from the prison of self, that is indeed release, for that is the greater prison...The afflictions which come to humanity sometimes tend to centre the consciousness upon the limitations, and this is a veritable prison. Release comes by making of the will a Door through which the confirmations of the Spirit come.\" Asked about this He said: The confirmations of the Spirit are all those powers and gifts which some are born with (and which men sometimes call genius), but for which others have to strive with infinite pains. They come to that man or woman who accepts his life with radiant acquiescence. Radiant acquiescence—that was the quality with which we all suddenly seemed inspired as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá bade us good-bye.\"\n\nThe following quote by 'Abdu'l-Baha offers a perspective aimed at cultivating equanimity. He wrote: \"Grieve thou not over the troubles and hardships of this nether world, nor be thou glad in times of ease and comfort, for both shall pass away. This present life is even as a swelling wave, or a mirage, or drifting shadows. Could ever a distorted image on the desert serve as refreshing waters? No, by the Lord of Lords! Never can reality and the mere semblance of reality be one, and wide is the difference between fancy and fact, between truth and the phantom thereof. Know thou that the Kingdom is the real world, and this nether place is only its shadow stretching out. A shadow hath no life of its own; its existence is only a fantasy, and nothing more; it is but images reflected in water, and seeming as pictures to the eye. Rely upon God. Trust in Him. Praise Him, and call Him continually to mind. He verily turneth trouble into ease, and sorrow into solace, and toil into utter peace. He verily hath dominion over all things. If thou wouldst hearken to my words, release thyself from the fetters of whatsoever cometh to pass. Nay rather, under all conditions thank thou thy loving Lord, and yield up thine affairs unto His Will that worketh as He pleaseth. This verily is better for thee than all else, in either world.\" \n"}
{"id": "344406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=344406", "title": "Ethnic religion", "text": "Ethnic religion\n\nIn religious studies, an ethnic religion (or indigenous religion) is a religion associated with a particular ethnic group. Ethnic religions are often distinguished from universal religions which claim to not be limited in ethnic or national scope, such as Christianity or Islam or Buddhism or Jainism. Ethnic religions are not only independent religions. Some localised denominations of global religions are practised solely by certain ethnic groups. For example, the Assyrians have a unique denominational structure of Christianity known as the Assyrian Church of the East.\n\nA number of alternative terms have been used instead of \"ethnic\" or \"indigenous\" religions.\n\nThe term \"primal religion\" was coined by Andrew Walls in the University of Aberdeen in the 1970s to provide a focus on non-Western forms of religion as found in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Terms such as \"primal religion,\" \"primitive religion,\" and \"tribal religion\" have been contested by Walls' student, Jim Cox, who argues that such terms suggest an undeveloped religion which can be seen as a preparation for conversion to Christianity. Cox prefers to use the term \"indigenous religion.\"\n\nAnother term that is often used is \"folk religion.\" While \"ethnic religion\" and \"folk religion\" have overlapping uses, the latter term implies \"the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level.\" The term \"folk religion\" can therefore be used to speak of Chinese and African indigenous religions, but can also refer to popular expressions of more multi-national and institutionalized religions such as Folk Christianity or Folk Islam.\n\nEthnic religions are distinctive in their relationship with a particular ethnic group and often in the shaping of one's solidarity with an ethnic identity. Some ethnic religions include Hinduism of the Indians, Judaism of the Jews, Chinese folk religion of the Han Chinese, Shinto of the Japanese, and A ƭat Roog of the Serer of Senegal, The Gambia, and Mauritania. Diasporic groups often maintain ethnic religions as a means of maintaining a distinct ethnic identity, such as Hinduism among diasporic Indians in the Caribbean, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, France, Netherlands, southern and eastern Africa, Mauritius, Fiji, and the Malay Peninsula, or the role of African traditional religion and Afro-American religions among the African diaspora in the Americas.\n\nSome ancient ethnic religions, such as those historically found in pre-modern Europe, have found new vitality in neopaganism. Moreover, non-ethnic religions such as Christianity have been known to assume ethnic traits to an extent that they serve a role as an important ethnic identity marker, a notable example of this is the Serbian \"Saint-Savianism\" of the Serbian Orthodox Church.\n\n"}
{"id": "46006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46006", "title": "Freedom of religion", "text": "Freedom of religion\n\nFreedom of religion is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance. It also includes the freedom to change one's religion or beliefs.\n\nFreedom of religion is considered by many people and most of the nations to be a fundamental human right. In a country with a state religion, freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths.\nFreedom of belief is different. It allows the right to believe what a person, group or religion wishes, but it does not necessarily allow the right to practice the religion or belief openly and outwardly in a public manner.\n\nHistorically, \"freedom of religion\" has been used to refer to the tolerance of different theological systems of belief, while \"freedom of worship\" has been defined as freedom of individual action. Nevertheless, freedom \"from\" religion is a far more pressing moralistic, legal, and peaceful solution. Each of these have existed to varying degrees. While many countries have accepted some form of religious freedom, this has also often been limited in practice through punitive taxation, repressive social legislation, and political disenfranchisement. Compare examples of individual freedom in Italy or the Muslim tradition of dhimmis, literally \"protected individuals\" professing an officially tolerated non-Muslim religion.\nIn Antiquity, a syncretic point of view often allowed communities of traders to operate under their own customs. When street mobs of separate quarters clashed in a Hellenistic or Roman city, the issue was generally perceived to be an infringement of community rights.\n\nCyrus the Great established the Achaemenid Empire ca. 550 BC, and initiated a general policy of permitting religious freedom throughout the empire, documenting this on the Cyrus Cylinder.\n\nSome of the historical exceptions have been in regions where one of the revealed religions has been in a position of power: Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity and Islam. Others have been where the established order has felt threatened, as shown in the trial of Socrates in 399 BC or where the ruler has been deified, as in Rome, and refusal to offer token sacrifice was similar to refusing to take an oath of allegiance. This was the core for resentment and the persecution of early Christian communities.\n\nFreedom of religious worship was established in the Buddhist Maurya Empire of ancient India by Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BC, which was encapsulated in the Edicts of Ashoka.\n\nGreek-Jewish clashes at Cyrene in 73 AD and 117 AD and in Alexandria in 115 AD provide examples of cosmopolitan cities as scenes of tumult.\n\nThe Romans tolerated most religions, including Judaism and encouraged local subjects to continue worshipping their own gods. They did not however, tolerate Christianity until it was legalised by the Roman emperor Galerius in 311. The Edict of Milan guaranteed freedom of religion in the Roman Empire until the Edict of Thessalonica in 380, which outlawed all religions except Christianity.\n\nFollowing a period of fighting lasting around a hundred years before 620 AD which mainly involved Arab and Jewish inhabitants of Medina (then known as \"Yathrib\"), religious freedom for Muslims, Jews and pagans was declared by Muhammad in the Constitution of Medina. The Islamic Caliphate later guaranteed religious freedom under the conditions that non-Muslim communities accept \"dhimmi\" status and their adult males pay the punitive \"jizya\" tax instead of the \"zakat\" paid by Muslim citizens. Though Dhimmis were not given the same political rights as Muslims, they nevertheless did enjoy equality under the laws of property, contract, and obligation.\n\nReligious pluralism existed in classical Islamic ethics and Sharia, as the religious laws and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early Caliphate, Al-Andalus, Indian subcontinent, and the Ottoman Millet system. In medieval Islamic societies, the \"qadi\" (Islamic judges) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily choose to be judged according to Islamic law, thus the \"dhimmi\" communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who would have their own \"Halakha\" courts.\n\nDhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems in cases that did not involve other religious groups, or capital offences or threats to public order. Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that were usually forbidden by Islamic law, such as the consumption of alcohol and pork, as well as religious practices which Muslims found repugnant, such as the Zoroastrian practice of incestuous \"self-marriage\" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter. According to the famous Islamic legal scholar Ibn Qayyim (1292–1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion.\n\nDespite Dhimmis enjoying special statuses under the Caliphates, they were not considered equals, and sporadic persecutions of non-Muslim groups did occur in the history of the Caliphates.\n\nAncient Jews fleeing from persecution in their homeland 2,500 years ago settled in India and never faced anti-Semitism. Freedom of religion edicts have been found written during Ashoka the Great's reign in the 3rd century BC. Freedom to practise, preach and propagate any religion is a constitutional right in Modern India. Most major religious festivals of the main communities are included in the list of national holidays.\n\nAlthough India is an 80% Hindu country, India is a secular state without any state religions.\n\nMany scholars and intellectuals believe that India's predominant religion, Hinduism, has long been a most tolerant religion. Rajni Kothari, founder of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies has written, \"[India] is a country built on the foundations of a civilisation that is fundamentally non-religious.\"\n\nThe Dalai Lama, the Tibetan leader in exile, said that religious tolerance of 'Aryabhoomi,' a reference to India found in the Mahabharata, has been in existence in this country from thousands of years. \"Not only Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism which are the native religions but also Christianity and Islam have flourished here. Religious tolerance is inherent in Indian tradition,\" the Dalai Lama said.\n\nFreedom of religion in the Indian subcontinent is exemplified by the reign of King Piyadasi (304–232 BC) (Ashoka). One of King Ashoka's main concerns was to reform governmental institutes and exercise moral principles in his attempt to create a just and humane society. Later he promoted the principles of Buddhism, and the creation of a just, understanding and fair society was held as an important principle for many ancient rulers of this time in the East.\n\nThe importance of freedom of worship in India was encapsulated in an inscription of Ashoka:\n\nOn the main Asian continent, the Mongols were tolerant of religions. People could worship as they wished freely and openly.\n\nAfter the arrival of Europeans, Christians in their zeal to convert local as per belief in conversion as service of God, have also been seen to fall into frivolous methods since their arrival, though by and large there are hardly any reports of law and order disturbance from mobs with Christian beliefs, except perhaps in the north eastern region of India.\n\nFreedom of religion in contemporary India is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 25 of the nation's constitution. Accordingly, every citizen of India has a right to profess, practice and propagate their religions peacefully. Vishwa Hindu Parishad counters this argument by saying that evangelical Christians are forcefully (or through money) converting rural, illiterate populations and they are only trying to stop this.\n\nIn September 2010, the Indian state of Kerala's State Election Commissioner announced that \"Religious heads cannot issue calls to vote for members of a particular community or to defeat the nonbelievers\". The Catholic Church comprising Latin, Syro-Malabar and Syro-Malankara rites used to give clear directions to the faithful on exercising their franchise during elections through pastoral letters issued by bishops or council of bishops. The pastoral letter issued by Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) on the eve of the poll urged the faithful to shun atheists.\n\nEven today, most Indians celebrate all religious festivals with equal enthusiasm and respect. Hindu festivals like Deepavali and Holi, Muslim festivals like Eid al-Fitr, Eid-Ul-Adha, Muharram, Christian festivals like Christmas and other festivals like Buddha Purnima, Mahavir Jayanti, Gur Purab etc. are celebrated and enjoyed by all Indians.\n\nMost Roman Catholic kingdoms kept a tight rein on religious expression throughout the Middle Ages. Jews were alternately tolerated and persecuted, the most notable examples of the latter being the expulsion of all Jews from Spain in 1492. Some of those who remained and converted were tried as heretics in the Inquisition for allegedly practicing Judaism in secret. Despite the persecution of Jews, they were the most tolerated non-Catholic faith in Europe.\n\nHowever, the latter was in part a reaction to the growing movement that became the Reformation. As early as 1380, John Wycliffe in England denied transubstantiation and began his translation of the Bible into English. He was condemned in a Papal Bull in 1410, and all his books were burned.\n\nIn 1414, Jan Hus, a Bohemian preacher of reformation, was given a safe conduct by the Holy Roman Emperor to attend the Council of Constance. Not entirely trusting in his safety, he made his will before he left. His forebodings proved accurate, and he was burned at the stake on 6 July 1415. The Council also decreed that Wycliffe's remains be disinterred and cast out. This decree was not carried out until 1429.\n\nAfter the fall of the city of Granada, Spain, in 1492, the Muslim population was promised religious freedom by the Treaty of Granada, but that promise was short-lived. In 1501, Granada's Muslims were given an ultimatum to either convert to Christianity or to emigrate. The majority converted, but only superficially, continuing to dress and speak as they had before and to secretly practice Islam. The Moriscos (converts to Christianity) were ultimately expelled from Spain between 1609 (Castile) and 1614 (rest of Spain), by Philip III.\n\nMartin Luther published his famous 95 Theses in Wittenberg on 31 October 1517. His major aim was theological, summed up in the three basic dogmas of Protestantism:\n\n\nIn consequence, Luther hoped to stop the sale of indulgences and to reform the Church from within. In 1521, he was given the chance to recant at the Diet of Worms before Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. After he refused to recant, he was declared heretic. Partly for his own protection, he was sequestered on the Wartburg in the possessions of Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, where he translated the New Testament into German. He was excommunicated by Papal Bull in 1521.\n\nHowever, the movement continued to gain ground in his absence and spread to Switzerland. Huldrych Zwingli preached reform in Zürich from 1520 to 1523. He opposed the sale of indulgences, celibacy, pilgrimages, pictures, statues, relics, altars, and organs. This culminated in outright war between the Swiss cantons that accepted Protestantism and the Catholics. The Catholics were victorious, and Zwingli was killed in battle in 1531. The Catholic cantons were magnanimous in victory.\n\nThe defiance of Papal authority proved contagious, and in 1533, when Henry VIII of England was excommunicated for his divorce and remarriage to Anne Boleyn, he promptly established a state church with bishops appointed by the crown. This was not without internal opposition, and Thomas More, who had been his Lord Chancellor, was executed in 1535 for opposition to Henry.\n\nIn 1535, the Swiss canton of Geneva became Protestant. In 1536, the Bernese imposed the reformation on the canton of Vaud by conquest. They sacked the cathedral in Lausanne and destroyed all its art and statuary. John Calvin, who had been active in Geneva was expelled in 1538 in a power struggle, but he was invited back in 1540.\nThe same kind of seesaw back and forth between Protestantism and Catholicism was evident in England when Mary I of England returned that country briefly to the Catholic fold in 1553 and persecuted Protestants. However, her half-sister, Elizabeth I of England was to restore the Church of England in 1558, this time permanently, and began to persecute Catholics again. The King James Bible commissioned by King James I of England and published in 1611 proved a landmark for Protestant worship, with official Catholic forms of worship being banned.\n\nIn France, although peace was made between Protestants and Catholics at the Treaty of Saint Germain in 1570, persecution continued, most notably in the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day on 24 August 1572, in which thousands of Protestants throughout France were killed. A few years before, at the \"Michelade\" of Nîmes in 1567, Protestants had massacred the local Catholic clergy.\n\nThe Norman Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II was characterized by its multi-ethnic nature and religious tolerance. Normans, Jews, Muslim Arabs, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards, and native Sicilians lived in harmony. Rather than exterminate the Muslims of Sicily, Roger II's grandson Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1215–1250) allowed them to settle on the mainland and build mosques. Not least, he enlisted them in his Christian army and even into his personal bodyguards.\n\nBohemia (present-day Czech Republic) enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1520, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period of time. The so-called Basel Compacts of 1436 declared the freedom of religion and peace between Catholics and Utraquists. In 1609 Emperor Rudolf II granted Bohemia greater religious liberty with his Letter of Majesty. The privileged position of the Catholic Church in the Czech kingdom was firmly established after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620. Gradually freedom of religion in Bohemian lands came to an end and Protestants fled or were expelled from the country. A devout Catholic, Emperor Ferdinand II forcibly converted Austrian and Bohemian Protestants.\n\nIn the meantime, in Germany Philip Melanchthon drafted the Augsburg Confession as a common confession for the Lutherans and the free territories. It was presented to Charles V in 1530.\n\nIn the Holy Roman Empire, Charles V agreed to tolerate Lutheranism in 1555 at the Peace of Augsburg. Each state was to take the religion of its prince, but within those states, there was not necessarily religious tolerance. Citizens of other faiths could relocate to a more hospitable environment.\n\nIn France, from the 1550s, many attempts to reconcile Catholics and Protestants and to establish tolerance failed because the State was too weak to enforce them. It took the victory of prince Henry IV of France, who had converted into Protestantism, and his accession to the throne, to impose religious tolerance formalized in the Edict of Nantes in 1598. It would remain in force for over 80 years until its revocation in 1685 by Louis XIV of France. Intolerance remained the norm until Louis XVI, who signed the Edict of Versailles (1787), then the constitutional text of 24 December 1789, granting civilian rights to Protestants. The French Revolution then abolished state religion and confiscated all Church property, turning intolerance against Catholics.\n\nIn 1558, the Transylvanian Diet's Edict of Torda declared free practice of both Catholicism and Lutheranism. Calvinism, however, was prohibited. Calvinism was included among the accepted religions in 1564. Ten years after the first law, in 1568, the same Diet, under the chairmanship of King of Hungary, and Prince of Transylvania John Sigismund Zápolya (John II.), following the teaching of Ferenc Dávid, the founder of the Unitarian Church of Transylvania, extended the freedom to all religions, declaring that \"It is not allowed to anybody to intimidate anybody with captivity or expelling for his religion\". However, it was more than a religious tolerance; it declared the equality of the religions, prohibiting all kinds of acts from authorities or from simple people, which could harm other groups or people because of their religious beliefs. The emergence in social hierarchy wasn't dependent on the religion of the person thus Transylvania had also Catholic and Protestant monarchs, who all respected the Edict of Torda. The lack of state religion was unique for centuries in Europe. Therefore, the Edict of Torda is considered as the first legal guarantee of religious freedom in Christian Europe.\n\nFour religions (Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, Unitarianism) were named as accepted religions (religo recepta), having their representatives in the Transylvanian Diet, while the other religions, like the Orthodoxs, Sabbatarians and Anabaptists were tolerated churches (religio tolerata), which meant that they had no power in the law making and no veto rights in the Diet, but they were not persecuted in any way. Thanks to the Edict of Torda, from the last decades of the 16th Century Transylvania was the only place in Europe, where so many religions could live together in harmony and without persecution.\n\nThis religious freedom ended however for some of the religions of Transylvania in 1638. After this year the Sabbatarians begun to be persecuted, and forced to convert to one of the accepted religions of Transylvania.\n\nAlso the Unitarians (despite of being one of the \"accepted religions\") started to be put under an ever-growing pressure, which culminated after the Habsburg conquest of Transylvania (1691), Also after the Habsburg occupation, the new Austrian masters forced in the middle of the 18th century the Hutterite Anabaptists (who found a safe heaven in 1621 in Transylvania, after the persecution to which they were subjected in the Austrian provinces and Moravia) to convert to Catholicism or to migrate in another country, which finally the Anabaptists did, leaving Transylvania and Hungary for Wallachia, than from there to Russia, and finally in the United States.\n\nIn the Union of Utrecht (20 January 1579), personal freedom of religion was declared in the struggle between the Northern Netherlands and Spain. The Union of Utrecht was an important step in the establishment of the Dutch Republic (from 1581 to 1795). Under Calvinist leadership, the Netherlands became the most tolerant country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, such as the Huguenots, the Dissenters, and the Jews who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal. The establishment of a Jewish community in the Netherlands and New Amsterdam (present-day New York) during the Dutch Republic is an example of religious freedom. When New Amsterdam surrendered to the English in 1664, freedom of religion was guaranteed in the Articles of Capitulation. It benefitted also the Jews who had landed on Manhattan Island in 1654, fleeing Portuguese persecution in Brazil. During the 18th century, other Jewish communities were established at Newport, Rhode Island, Philadelphia, Charleston, Savannah, and Richmond.\n\nIntolerance of dissident forms of Protestantism also continued, as evidenced by the exodus of the Pilgrims, who sought refuge, first in the Netherlands, and ultimately in America, founding Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts in 1620. William Penn, the founder of Philadelphia, was involved in a case which had a profound effect upon future American laws and those of England. In a classic case of jury nullification, the jury refused to convict William Penn of preaching a Quaker sermon, which was illegal. Even though the jury was imprisoned for their acquittal, they stood by their decision and helped establish the freedom of religion.\n\nThe General Charter of Jewish Liberties known as the Statute of Kalisz was issued by the Duke of Greater Poland Boleslaus the Pious on 8 September 1264 in Kalisz. The statute served as the basis for the legal position of Jews in Poland and led to the creation of the Yiddish-speaking autonomous Jewish nation until 1795. The statute granted exclusive jurisdiction of Jewish courts over Jewish matters and established a separate tribunal for matters involving Christians and Jews. Additionally, it guaranteed personal liberties and safety for Jews including freedom of religion, travel, and trade. The statute was ratified by subsequent Polish Kings: Casimir III of Poland in 1334, Casimir IV of Poland in 1453 and Sigismund I of Poland in 1539. Poland freed Jews from direct royal authority, opening up enormous administrative and economic opportunities to them.\n\nThe right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the future Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth throughout the 15th and early 16th century, however, complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in 1573 during the Warsaw Confederation. Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.\n\nMost of the early colonies were generally not tolerant of dissident forms of worship, with Maryland being one of the exceptions. For example, Roger Williams found it necessary to found a new colony in Rhode Island to escape persecution in the theocratically dominated colony of Massachusetts. The Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony were the most active of the New England persecutors of Quakers, and the persecuting spirit was shared by Plymouth Colony and the colonies along the Connecticut river. In 1660, one of the most notable victims of the religious intolerance was English Quaker Mary Dyer, who was hanged in Boston, Massachusetts for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony. As one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs, the hanging of Dyer on the Boston gallows marked the beginning of the end of the Puritan theocracy and New England independence from English rule, and in 1661 King Charles II explicitly forbade Massachusetts from executing anyone for professing Quakerism. Anti-Catholic sentiment appeared in New England with the first Pilgrim and Puritan settlers. In 1647, Massachusetts passed a law prohibiting any Jesuit Roman Catholic priests from entering territory under Puritan jurisdiction. Any suspected person who could not clear himself was to be banished from the colony; a second offense carried a death penalty. The Pilgrims of New England held radical Protestant disapproval of Christmas. Christmas observance was outlawed in Boston in 1659. The ban by the Puritans was revoked in 1681 by an English appointed governor, however it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became common in the Boston region.\n\nFreedom of religion was first applied as a principle of government in the founding of the colony of Maryland, founded by the Catholic Lord Baltimore, in 1634. Fifteen years later (1649), the Maryland Toleration Act, drafted by Lord Baltimore, provided: \"No person or persons...shall from henceforth be any waies troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof.\" The Act allowed freedom of worship for all Trinitarian Christians in Maryland, but sentenced to death anyone who denied the divinity of Jesus. The Maryland Toleration Act was repealed during the Cromwellian Era with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was passed. In 1657, the Catholic Lord Baltimore regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1658 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than thirty years, until 1692 when, after Maryland's Protestant Revolution of 1689, freedom of religion was again rescinded. In addition, in 1704, an Act was passed \"to prevent the growth of Popery in this Province\", preventing Catholics from holding political office. Full religious toleration would not be restored in Maryland until the American Revolution, when Maryland's Charles Carroll of Carrollton signed the American Declaration of Independence.\n\nRhode Island (1636), Connecticut (1636), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania (1682) founded by Protestants Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker, and William Penn, respectively combined the democratic form of government which had been developed by the Puritans and the Separatist Congregationalists in Massachusetts with religious freedom. These colonies became sanctuaries for persecuted religious minorities. Catholics and later on Jews also had full citizenship and free exercise of their religions. Williams, Hooker, Penn, and their friends were firmly convinced that freedom of conscience was the will of God. Williams gave the most profound argument: As faith is the free work of the Holy Spirit, it cannot be forced on a person. Therefore, strict separation of church and state has to be kept. Pennsylvania was the only colony that retained unlimited religious freedom until the foundation of the United States in 1776. It was the inseparable connection between democracy, religious freedom, and the other forms of freedom which became the political and legal basis of the new nation. In particular, Baptists and Presbyterians demanded the disestablishment of state churches Anglican and Congregationalist and the protection of religious freedom.\n\nReiterating Maryland's and the other colonies' earlier colonial legislation, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, written in 1779 by Thomas Jefferson, proclaimed:\n\n[N]o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\n\nThose sentiments also found expression in the First Amendment of the national constitution, part of the United States' Bill of Rights: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\"\n\nThe United States formally considers religious freedom in its foreign relations. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 established the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom which investigates the records of over 200 other nations with respect to religious freedom, and makes recommendations to submit nations with egregious records to ongoing scrutiny and possible economic sanctions. Many human rights organizations have urged the United States to be still more vigorous in imposing sanctions on countries that do not permit or tolerate religious freedom.\n\nFreedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. Canadian law goes further, requiring that private citizens and companies provide reasonable accommodation to those, for example, with strong religious beliefs. The Canadian Human Rights Act allows an exception to reasonable accommodation with respect to religious dress, such as a Sikh turban, when there is a \"bona fide\" occupational requirement, such as a workplace requiring a hard hat.\n\nOn 25 November 1981, the United Nations General Assembly passed the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. This declaration recognizes freedom of religion as a fundamental human right in accordance with several other instruments of international law.\n\nHowever, the most substantial binding legal instruments that guarantee the right to freedom of religion that was passed by the international community is the Convention on the Rights of the Child which states in its Article 14: \"States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.\"\n\nIn 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \"protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief.\" The committee further stated that \"the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views.\" Signatories to the convention are barred from \"the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers\" to recant their beliefs or convert. Despite this, minority religions still are persecuted in many parts of the world.\n\nThe French philosopher Voltaire noted in his book on English society, \"Letters on the English\", that freedom of religion in a diverse society was deeply important to maintaining peace in that country. That it was also important in understanding why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace.Adam Smith, in his book \"The Wealth of Nations\" (using an argument first put forward by his friend and contemporary David Hume), states that in the long run it is in the best interests of society as a whole and the civil magistrate (government) in particular to allow people to freely choose their own religion, as it helps prevent civil unrest and reduces intolerance. So long as there are enough different religions and/or religious sects operating freely in a society then they are all compelled to moderate their more controversial and violent teachings, so as to be more appealing to more people and so have an easier time attracting new converts. It is this free competition amongst religious sects for converts that ensures stability and tranquillity in the long run.\n\nSmith also points out that laws that prevent religious freedom and seek to preserve the power and belief in a particular religion will, in the long run, only serve to weaken and corrupt that religion, as its leaders and preachers become complacent, disconnected and unpractised in their ability to seek and win over new converts:\n\nHinduism is one of the more broad-minded religions when it comes to religious freedom. It respects the right of everyone to reach God in their own way. Hindus believe in different ways to preach attainment of God and religion as a philosophy and hence respect all religions as equal. One of the famous Hindu sayings about religion is: \"Truth is one; sages call it by different names.\"\n\nJudaism includes multiple streams, such as Orthodox, Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism, Jewish Renewal and Humanistic Judaism. However, Judaism also exists in many forms as a civilization, possessing characteristics known as peoplehood, rather than strictly as a religion. In the Torah, Jews are forbidden to practice idolatry and are commanded to root out pagan and idolatrous practices within their midst, including killing idolaters who sacrifice children to their gods, or engage in immoral activities. However, these laws are not adhered to anymore as Jews have usually lived among a multi-religious community.\n\nAfter the conquest of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judea by the Roman Empire, a Jewish state did not exist until 1948 with the establishment of the State of Israel. For over 1500 years Jewish people lived under pagan, Christian, Muslim, etc. rule. As such Jewish people in some of these states faced persecution. From the pogroms in Europe during the Middle Ages to the establishment of segregated Jewish ghettos during World War II. In the Middle East, Jews were categorised as dhimmi, non- Muslims permitted to live within a Muslim state. Even though given rights within a Muslim state, a dhimmi is still not equal to a Muslim within Muslim society, the same way non-Jewish Israeli citizens are not equal with Jewish citizens in modern-day Israel.\n\nPossibly because of this history of long term persecution, Jews in modernity have been among the most active proponents of religious freedom in the US and abroad and have founded and supported anti-hate institutions, including the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union. Jews are very active in supporting Muslim and other religious groups in the US against discrimination and hate crimes and most Jewish congregations throughout the US and many individual Jews participate in interfaith community projects and programs.\n\nThe State of Israel was established for the Jewish diaspora after World War II. While the Israel Declaration of Independence stresses religious freedom as a fundamental principle, in practice the current government, dominated by the ultra-Orthodox segment of the population has instituted legal barriers for those who do not practice Orthodox Judaism as Jews. However, as a nation state, Israel is very open towards other religions and religious practices, including public Muslim call to prayer chants and Christian prayer bells ringing in Jerusalem. Israel has been evaluated in research by the Pew organization as having \"high\" government restrictions on religion. The government recognizes only Orthodox Judaism in certain matters of personal status, and marriages can only be performed by religious authorities. The government provides the greatest funding to Orthodox Judaism, even though adherents represent a minority of citizens. Jewish women, including Anat Hoffman, have been arrested at the Western Wall for praying and singing while wearing religious garments the Orthodox feel should be reserved for men. Women of the Wall have organized to promote religious freedom at the Wall. In November 2014, a group of 60 non-Orthodox rabbinical students were told they would not be allowed to pray in the Knesset synagogue because it is reserved for Orthodox. Rabbi Joel Levy, director of the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem, said that he had submitted the request on behalf of the students and saw their shock when the request was denied. He noted: \"paradoxically, this decision served as an appropriate end to our conversation about religion and state in Israel.\" MK Dov Lipman expressed the concern that many Knesset workers are unfamiliar with non-Orthodox and American practices and would view \"an egalitarian service in the synagogue as an affront.\" The non-Orthodox forms of Jewish practice function independently in Israel, except for these issues of praying at the Western Wall.\n\n According to the Catholic Church in the Vatican II document on religious freedom, \"Dignitatis Humanae\", \"the human person has a right to religious freedom\", which is described as \"immunity from coercion in civil society\". This principle of religious freedom \"leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion.\" In addition, this right \"is to be recognized in the constitutional law whereby society is governed and thus it is to become a civil right.\"\n\nPrior to this, Pope Pius IX had written a document called the \"Syllabus of Errors. \"The Syllabus was made up of phrases and paraphrases from earlier papal documents, along with index references to them, and presented as a list of \"condemned propositions\". It does not explain why each particular proposition is wrong, but it cites earlier documents to which the reader can refer for the Pope's reasons for saying each proposition is false. Among the statements included in the Syllabus are: \"[It is an error to say that] Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true\" (15); \"[It is an error to say that] In the present day it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship\"; \"[It is an error to say that] Hence it has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic countries, that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar worship\".\n\nSome Orthodox Christians, especially those living in democratic countries, support religious freedom for all, as evidenced by the position of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Many Protestant Christian churches, including some Baptists, Churches of Christ, Seventh-day Adventist Church and main line churches have a commitment to religious freedoms. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also affirms religious freedom.\n\nHowever others, such as African scholar Makau Mutua, have argued that Christian insistence on the propagation of their faith to native cultures as an element of religious freedom has resulted in a corresponding denial of religious freedom to native traditions and led to their destruction. As he states in the book produced by the Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief, \"Imperial religions have necessarily violated individual conscience and the communal expressions of Africans and their communities by subverting African religions.\"\n\nIn their book \"Breaking India\", Rajiv Malhotra and Aravindan Neelakandan discussed the \"US Church\" funding activities in India, such as the popularly advertised campaigns to \"save\" poor children by feeding, clothing, and educating them, with the book arguing that the funds collected were being used not so much for the purposes indicated to sponsors, but for indoctrination and conversion activities. They suggest that India is the prime target of a huge enterprise a \"network\" of organizations, individuals, and churches that, they argue, seem intensely devoted to the task of creating a separatist identity, history, and even religion for the vulnerable sections of India. They suggest that this nexus of players includes not only church groups, government bodies, and related organizations, but also private think tanks and academics.\n\nJoel Spring has written about the Christianization of the Roman Empire:\n\nChristianity added new impetus to the expansion of empire. Increasing the arrogance of the imperial project, Christians insisted that the Gospels and the Church were the only valid sources of religious beliefs. Imperialists could claim that they were both civilizing the world and spreading the true religion. By the 5th century, Christianity was thought of as co-extensive with the \"Imperium romanum\". This meant that to be human, as opposed to being a natural slave, was to be \"civilized\" and Christian. Historian Anthony Pagden argues, \"just as the \"civitas\"; had now become coterminous with Christianity, so to be human to be, that is, one who was 'civil', and who was able to interpret correctly the law of nature one had now also to be Christian.\" After the fifteenth century, most Western colonialists rationalized the spread of empire with the belief that they were saving a barbaric and pagan world by spreading Christian civilization.\n\nConversion to Islam is simple, but Muslims are forbidden to convert from Islam to another religion. Certain Muslim-majority countries are known for their restrictions on religious freedom, highly favoring Muslim citizens over non-Muslim citizens. Other countries having the same restrictive laws tend to be more liberal when imposing them. Even other Muslim-majority countries are secular and thus do not regulate religious belief. \n\nIslamic theologians quote the Qur'an ( and , i.e., Sura Al-Kafirun) to show scriptural support for religious freedom.\n\n, referring to the war against Pagans during the Battle of Badr in Medina, indicates that Muslims are only allowed to fight against those who intend to harm them (right of self-defense) and that if their enemies surrender, they must also stop because God does not like those who transgress limits.\n\nIn Bukhari:V9 N316, Jabir ibn 'Abdullah narrated that a Bedouin accepted Islam and then when he got a fever he demanded that Muhammad to cancel his pledge (allow him to renounce Islam). Muhammad refused to do so. The Bedouin man repeated his demand once, but Muhammad once again refused. Then, he (the Bedouin) left Medina. Muhammad said, \"Madinah is like a pair of bellows (furnace): it expels its impurities and brightens and clear its good.\" In this narration, there was no evidence demonstrating that Muhammad ordered the execution of the Bedouin for wanting to renounce Islam.\n\nIn addition, , which is believed to be God's final revelation to Muhammad, states that Muslims are to fear God and not those who reject Islam, and states that one is accountable only for one's own actions. Therefore, it postulates that in Islam, in the matters of practising a religion, it does not relate to a worldly punishment, but rather these actions are accountable to God in the afterlife. Thus, this supports the argument against the execution of apostates in Islam.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, some Muslims support the practice of executing apostates who leave Islam, as in Bukhari:V4 B52 N260; \"The Prophet said, 'If a Muslim discards his religion and separates from the main body of Muslims, kill him.\n\nIn Iran, the constitution recognizes four religions whose status is formally protected: Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\nThe constitution, however, also set the groundwork for the institutionalized persecution of Bahá'ís,\nwho have been subjected to arrests, beatings, executions, confiscation and destruction of property, and the denial of civil rights and liberties, and the denial of access to higher education. There is no freedom of conscience in Iran, as converting from Islam to any other religion is forbidden.\n\nIn Egypt, a 16 December 2006 judgment of the Supreme Administrative Council created a clear demarcation between recognized religions Islam, Christianity and Judaism and all other religious beliefs; no other religious affiliation is officially admissible. The ruling leaves members of other religious communities, including Bahá'ís, without the ability to obtain the necessary government documents to have rights in their country, essentially denying them of all rights of citizenship. They cannot obtain ID cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, and passports; they also cannot be employed, educated, treated in public hospitals or vote, among other things. See Egyptian identification card controversy.\n\nAmong the most contentious areas of religious freedom is the right of an individual to change or abandon his or her own religion (apostasy), and the right to evangelize individuals seeking to convince others to make such a change.\n\nOther debates have centered around restricting certain kinds of missionary activity by religions. Many Islamic states, and others such as China, severely restrict missionary activities of other religions. Greece, among European countries, has generally looked unfavorably on missionary activities of denominations others than the majority church and proselytizing is constitutionally prohibited.\n\nA different kind of critique of the freedom to propagate religion has come from non-Abrahamic traditions such as the African and Indian. African scholar Makau Mutua criticizes religious evangelism on the ground of cultural annihilation by what he calls \"proselytizing universalist faiths\" (Chapter 28: Proselytism and Cultural Integrity, p. 652):\n\nSome Indian scholars have similarly argued that the right to propagate religion is not culturally or religiously neutral.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, there have been debates regarding a bill on religious freedom that seeks to protect indigenous religious traditions from certain kinds of missionary activities. Debates have also occurred in various states of India regarding similar laws, particularly those that restrict conversions using force, fraud or allurement.\n\nIn 2008, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a Christian human rights non-governmental organisation which specializes in religious freedom, launched an in-depth report on the human rights abuses faced by individuals who leave Islam for another religion. The report is the product of a year long research project in six different countries. It calls on Muslim nations, the international community, the UN and the international media to resolutely address the serious violations of human rights suffered by apostates.\n\nIn Islam, apostasy is called \"ridda\" (\"turning back\") and is considered to be a profound insult to God. A person born of Muslim parents that rejects Islam is called a \"\"murtad fitri\" (natural apostate), and a person that converted to Islam and later rejects the religion is called a \"murtad milli\"\" (apostate from the community).\n\nIn Islamic law (Sharia), the consensus view is that a male apostate must be put to death unless he suffers from a mental disorder or converted under duress, for example, due to an imminent danger of being killed. A female apostate must be either executed, according to Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh), or imprisoned until she reverts to Islam as advocated by the Sunni Hanafi school and by Shi'a scholars.\n\nIdeally, the one performing the execution of an apostate must be an imam. At the same time, all schools of Islamic jurisprudence agree that any Muslim can kill an apostate without punishment.\n\nHowever, while almost all scholars agree about the punishment, many disagree on the allowable time to retract the apostasy. Many scholars push this as far as allowing the apostate till he/she dies. Thus, practically making the death penalty just a theoretical statement/exercise. S. A. Rahman, a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, argues that there is no indication of the death penalty for apostasy in the Qur'an.\n\nReligious practice may also conflict with secular law, creating debates on religious freedom. For instance, even though polygamy is permitted in Islam, it is prohibited in secular law in many countries. This raises the question of whether prohibiting the practice infringes on the beliefs of certain Muslims. The US and India, both constitutionally secular nations, have taken two different views of this. In India, polygamy is permitted, but only for Muslims, under Muslim Personal Law. In the US, polygamy is prohibited for all. This was a major source of conflict between the early LDS Church and the United States until the Church amended its position on practicing polygamy.\n\nSimilar issues have also arisen in the context of the religious use of psychedelic substances by Native American tribes in the United States as well as other Native practices.\n\nIn 1955, Chief Justice of California Roger J. Traynor neatly summarized the American position on how freedom of religion cannot imply freedom from law: \"Although freedom of conscience and the freedom to believe are absolute, the freedom to act is not.\" But with respect to the religious use of animals within secular law and those acts, the US Supreme Court decision in the case of the \"Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah\" in 1993 upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual animal sacrifice, with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision: \"religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection\" (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Burger in \"Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division\" ).\n\nIn 2015, Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, refused to abide by the Supreme Court decision in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" legalizing Same-sex marriage in the United States. When she refused to issue marriage licenses, she became embroiled in the \"Miller v. Davis\" lawsuit. Her actions caused attorney and author Roberta Kaplan to state that \"Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate.\"\n\nIn 1962, the case of Engele v. Vitale went to court over the violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment resulting from a mandatory nondenominational prayer in New York public schools. The Supreme Court ruled in opposition to the state. \n\nIn 1963, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Abington School District v. Schempp. Edward Schempp sued the school district in Abington over the Pennsylvania law which required students to hear and sometimes read portions of the bible for their daily education. The court ruled in favor of Schempp and the Pennsylvania law was overturned.\n\nIn 1968, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Epperson v. Arkansas. Susan Epperson, a high school teacher in Arkansas sued over a violation of religious freedom. The state had a law banning the teaching of evolution and the school Epperson worked for had provided curriculum which contained evolutionary theory. Epperson had to choose between violating the law or losing her job. The Supreme Court ruled to overturn the Arkansas law because it was unconstitutional.\n\nThe law in Germany provides the term of \"religious majority\" (\"Religiöse Mündigkeit\") with a minimum age for minors to follow their own religious beliefs even if their parents don't share those or don't approve. Children 14 and older have the unrestricted right to enter or exit any religious community. Children 12 and older cannot be compelled to change to a different belief. Children 10 and older have to be heard before their parents change their religious upbringing to a different belief. There are similar laws in Austria and in Switzerland.\n\n27 October is International Religious Freedom Day, in commemoration of the execution of the Boston martyrs, a group of Quakers executed by the Puritans on Boston Common for their religious beliefs under the legislature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony between 1659–1661. The US proclaimed 16 January Religious Freedom Day.\n\nIn its 2011 annual report, the \"United States Commission on International Religious Freedom\" designated fourteen nations as \"countries of particular concern\". The commission chairman commented that these are nations whose conduct marks them as the world's worst religious freedom violators and human rights abusers. The fourteen nations designated were Burma, China, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Other nations on the commission's watchlist include Afghanistan, Belarus, Cuba, India, Indonesia, Laos, Russia, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Venezuela.\n\nThere are concerns about the restrictions on public religious dress in some European countries (including the Hijab, Kippah, and Christian cross). Article 18 of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights limits restrictions on freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs to those necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. Freedom of religion as a legal concept is related to, but not identical with, religious toleration, separation of church and state, or secular state (\"laïcité\").\n\nThe Pew Research Center has performed studies on international religious freedom between 2009 and 2015, compiling global data from 16 governmental and non-governmental organizations–including the United Nations, the United States State Department, and Human Rights Watch–and representing over 99.5 percent of the world's population. In 2009, nearly 70 percent of the world's population lived in countries classified as having heavy restrictions on freedom of religion. This concerns restrictions on religion originating from government prohibitions on free speech and religious expression as well as social hostilities undertaken by private individuals, organisations and social groups. Social hostilities were classified by the level of communal violence and religion-related terrorism.\n\nWhile most countries provided for the protection of religious freedom in their constitutions or laws, only a quarter of those countries were found to fully respect these legal rights in practice. In 75 countries governments limit the efforts of religious groups to proselytise and in 178 countries religious groups must register with the government. In 2013, Pew classified 30% of countries as having restrictions that tend to target religious minorities, and 61% of countries have social hostilities that tend to target religious minorities.\n\nThe countries in North and South America reportedly had some of the lowest levels of \"government\" and \"social\" restrictions on religion, while The Middle East and North Africa were the regions with the highest. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iran were the countries that top the list of countries with the \"overall\" highest levels of restriction on religion. Topping the Pew government restrictions index were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Uzbekistan, China, Egypt, Burma, Maldives, Eritrea, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\nOf the world's 25 most populous countries, Iran, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan had the most restrictions, while Brazil, Japan, Italy, South Africa, the UK, and the US had some of the lowest levels, as measured by Pew.\n\nVietnam and China were classified as having high \"government\" restrictions on religion but were in the moderate or low range when it came to \"social\" hostilities. Nigeria, Bangladesh and India were high in \"social\" hostilities but moderate in terms of \"government\" actions.\n\nRestrictions on religion across the world increased between mid-2009 and mid-2010, according to a 2012 study by the Pew Research Center. Restrictions in each of the five major regions of the world increased—including in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, the two regions where overall restrictions previously had been declining. In 2010, Egypt, Nigeria, the Palestinian territories, Russia, and Yemen were added to the \"very high\" category of social hostilities. The five highest social hostility scores were for Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Iraq, and Bangladesh. In 2015, Pew published that social hostilities declined in 2013, but the harassment of Jews increased.\n\n\n"}

Under a broader definition, Jewish identity does not depend on whether a person is regarded as a Jew by others, or by an external set of religious, or legal, or sociological norms. Jewish identity does not need to imply religious orthodoxy. Accordingly, Jewish identity can be cultural in nature. Jewish identity can involve ties to the Jewish community. Orthodox Judaism bases Jewishness on matrilineal descent. According to Jewish law (halacha), all those born of a Jewish mother are considered Jewish, regardless of personal beliefs or level of observance of Jewish law.\n\nJews who are atheists may have a Jewish identity. While the absolute majority of people with this identity are of Jewish ethnicity, people of a mixed Jewish and non-Jewish background or gentiles of Jewish ancestry may still have a sense of Jewish self-identity.\n\nJewish identity can be described as consisting of three interconnected parts:\n\n\nJewish identity can be cultural, religious, and/or through ancestry. There are religious, cultural, and ancestral components to Jewish identity due to its fundamental non-proselytizing nature, as opposed to Christian or Muslim identity which are both \"universal\" religions in that they ascribe to the notion that their faith is meant to be spread throughout all of humanity, regardless of nationality, (and still are, though to a far lesser extent than throughout its history in the case of Christianity). However, Jewish identity is firmly intertwined with Jewish ancestry dating back to the historical Kingdom of Israel, which was largely depopulated by the Roman Empire c. first century CE, leading to what is known as today as the Jewish Diaspora.\n\nJewish identity began to gain the attention of Jewish sociologists in the United States with the publication of Marshall Sklare's \"Lakeville studies\". Among other topics explored in the studies was Sklare's notion of a \"good Jew\". The \"good Jew\" was essentially an idealized form of Jewish identity as expressed by the Lakeville respondents. Today, sociological measurements of Jewish identity have become the concern of the Jewish Federations who have sponsored numerous community studies across the U.S.; policy decisions (in areas such as funding, programming, etc.) have been shaped in part due to studies on Jewish identity.\n\nAccording to the social-psychologist Simon Herman, antisemitism plays a part in shaping Jewish identity. This view is echoed by religious leaders such as Rabbi Jonathan Sacks who writes that modern Jewish communities and the modern Jewish identity are deeply influenced by antisemitism.\n\n\n"}

Unfit to perform theological functions, much less to defend the interests of the Church, these warlords viewed Church property as an extension of their own landholdings.\n\nWhat resulted was the plunder of movable wealth (of which the monasteries had become the keepers during the period of Viking invasion) and the parcelling out of land and office as the temporal powers saw fit. This sorry state of the Church prompted enthusiasm for 'freeing' it from the direct control of these milites; Gregory VII helped frame this goal through the specifics of his reform program.\n\nIn addition to calling for spiritually pure figures at the helm of the Church, Gregory VII addressed the practical problems of pluralism (holding more than one church office) and poorly educated clerics.\n\n\n"}

Most religions have organized behaviours, including clerical hierarchies, a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership, congregations of laity, regular meetings or services for the purposes of veneration of a deity or for prayer, holy places (either natural or architectural) or religious texts. Certain religions also have a sacred language often used in liturgical services. The practice of a religion may also include sermons, commemoration of the activities of a god or gods, sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trance, rituals, rites, ceremonies, worship, initiations, funerals, marriages, meditation, invocation, mediumship, music, art, dance, public service or other aspects of human culture. Religious beliefs have also been used to explain parapsychological phenomena such as out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences and reincarnation, along with many other paranormal and supernatural experiences.\n\nSome academics studying the subject have divided religions into three broad categories: world religions, a term which refers to transcultural, international faiths; indigenous religions, which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and new religious movements, which refers to recently developed faiths. One modern academic theory of religion, social constructionism, says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all spiritual practice and worship follows a model similar to the Abrahamic religions as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings, and thus religion, as a concept, has been applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures that are not based upon such systems, or in which these systems are a substantially simpler construct.\n\nReligions that originated in East Asia; namely Taoism, Confucianism and Shintoism, and religions and traditions related to, and descended from them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReligions that originated in the Indian subcontinent; namely Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism, and religions and traditions related to, and descended from them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReligions that originated in the Middle East; namely Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and religions and traditions related to, and descended from them.\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain Christian groups are difficult to classify as \"Eastern\" or \"Western.\" Many Gnostic groups were closely related to early Christianity, for example, Valentinism.

Inca beliefs in Mama Cocha and other water deities indicate that the people back then understood the basics of the hydrological cycle. They knew the seawater was replenishing the rain, which then fell over the ground.\n"}

An Indian priest, Tom Ozhonaniel, was kidnapped. \n\nThe identities of the attackers are unknown. Media outlets published a statement attributed to Ansar al-Sharia, one of the active jihadist organizations in the country, denies any relation to the incident.\n\n\"The Times of India\" posited the attackers belonged to the Yemen-based affiliate of the Islamic State (ISIS) group.\n\nChristian presence in Yemen goes back to the fourth century AD to hold a number of Himyarites believers due to the efforts of Theophilos the Indian. Currently, there are no official statistics on their numbers, but estimated at between 3,000 and 25,000 people, and most of them are refugees or temporary residents.\n\nFreedom of worship, conversion from Islam and establishing facilities dedicated for worship are not recognized in the Constitution or as laws or legal rights. At the same time, Wahabbi activities linked to Al-Islah were being facilitated, financed and encouraged from multiple fronts including the Ministry of Endowments and Guidance, which says that its tasks \"to contribute to the development of Islamic awareness and circulation of the publication Education and Islamic morals and consolidation in the life of public and private citizens.\"\n\nThe Missionaries of Charity, founded by Mother Teresa, have worked in Aden since 1992, and the order has three other centers in Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah. Three Catholic nuns were killed in Hodeidah in 1998, two from India and the third from the Philippines, at the hands of a member of Al-Islah Abdullah al-Nashiri, arguing that they were calling for conversion to Christianity. In 2002, three Americans were killed in Baptists Hospital at the hands of another Al-Islah member named Abed Abdul Razak Kamel. Survivors say that the hospital was \"a political football\" often raised by Islamists (Al-Islah), who talked about it in mosques and hospital workers describing Hospital workers as \"spies\". But they emphasized that these opinions are a minority among Yemenis.\n\nIn December 2015, a Catholic church in Aden was destroyed. Since the escalation of the Yemeni crisis in March 2015, six priests from John Bosco remained, and twenty workers of charitable missions in the country, described by Pope Francis by the courage to fortitude amid war and conflict. He called the Apostolic Vicar of Southern Arabia to pray for all the oppressed and tortured, expelled from their homes, and killed unjustly. The Missionaries of Charity were not actively engaged in evangelization according to the testimonies of beneficiaries of its services.\n\nThe attack on the house took place at 12:00pm local time, when two armed men had persuaded the guards to let them through the main gate having claimed they were going to visit their elderly mother. Once they entered, they began to shoot randomly, according to Indian officials at the Foreign Ministry.\n\nInside the building, nuns were preparing breakfast. Four of the five nuns sensed danger and tried to hide in a convent, where they were shot dead in an open area. All the rooms were stormed and the meeting tent was destroyed, as were statues and crucifixes in the small church. In one picture, two nuns are shown lying on the ground in a dirt yard, after having been shot execution-style. The attackers were dressed in a \"semi-blue\" uniform. According to the Catholic News Agency, the last prayer said by the nuns before they were killed says:\nSunita Kumar, a spokesman for the charity's mission, described the killers as \"demented\", adding \"there is no other explanation as to why armed people would enter the premises of the home and shoot down innocent, harmless nurses who had dedicated their lives to serving others.\" Bishop Michael Lewis of the Anglican Church said the compound contained seventy or eighty elderly people, many destitute. The Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin commented that Pope Francis prayed that this pointless slaughter will awaken consciences, lead to a change of heart and inspire all parties to lay down their arms and take up the path of dialogue.\n\nPope Francis described the crime as \"satanic\", stating that the nuns were \"martyrs of today\", adding that they were killed by both the attackers, and a \"globalization of indifference.\". His statement was published, including the following quote:\nThe Missionaries of Charity announced it would continue its work in Yemen despite the violence and danger.\n\nAn Indian priest, Tom Ozhonaniel, was also kidnapped. Since, he has appeared in several videos chastising the lack of effort to release him and pleading for his life.\n\n"}
{"id": "51920687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51920687", "title": "Multiple religious belonging", "text": "Multiple religious belonging\n\nMultiple religious belonging refers to the idea that individuals can belong to more than one religious tradition. While this is often seen as a common reality in regions such as Asia with its many religions, religious scholars have begun to discuss multiple religion belonging with respect to religious traditions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\n\nIn some religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, those who hold to an exclusivist understanding of religion see multiple religious belonging as problematic. This is in contrast with countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, whose cultures have a long history of being influenced by different religions. Moreover, in the postmodern period people tend to question their identity, because of the unlimited choices of religions, which leads to the difficulty in defining their identity.\n\nVan Bragt showed that 79% of Japanese self-identify as Shintoists and 75% self-identify as Buddhists. The reason for the extremely high percentage of both religions is that many Japanese consider themselves as both a Shintoist and a Buddhist and do not consider it a problem to belong to more than one religion. (Whether this statistic is correct is arguable.) This phenomenon, according to Van Bragt, is a \"division of labour\". Van Bragt argued that the cause of this phenomenon is that, different from the Western concept of religion, Shintoism and Buddhism in Japan are defined by their rituals and practices, not by their moral and social authority. Thus, the Japanese can belong to several religions that do not conflict with each other in terms of social and ethical issues.\n\nScholars such as Catherine Cornille, Peter C. Phan, Francis Xavier Clooney, Jan Van Bragt, Aloysius Pieris and Devaka Premawardhana have questioned the possibility of defining oneself into multiple religions. For these scholars, \"religious belonging\" is not an individual's subjective sense of a particular religion but rather, in Cornille's words, \"the recognition of one's religious identity by the tradition itself and the disposition to submit to the conditions for membership as delineated by that tradition.\" For Cornille, the ultimate purpose of a scholarly discussion on multiple religious belonging is to transform one's religion through the understanding of other religions.\n\nBased on Van Bragt's study, scholars have tried to investigate the possibility for adherents of a religion such as Christianity to belong to multiple religions. The approach to Christian multiple religious belonging, according to Devaka Premawardhana, can be divided into two trends: Peter Phan's approach based on a Christological ground, in which he emphasises on Christ's \"asymmetrically superior status\", and Francis Clooney's approach rooted in a methodological ground, which tries to cross boundaries into another religion just as religions must have discrete entities. These two approaches are summarised below.\n\nPhan's approach emphasised the assymmetricality in which Jesus is the Logos made flesh and the climax of God dealing with humankind. In an attempt to resonate with one's cultural identity and tradition, Phan explained that multiple religious belonging is necessary in order for practitioners of multiple belonging to treat other religions as a qualifier of their identity. This approach, according to Phan, does not deny one's Christian identity, which functions as substantive in relation to non-Christian religion. Phan noted that multiple religious belonging is not a new issue in the twenty-first century but rather the common form of life of the first-century Christians recorded in the book of Acts. In Phan's view, the disappearance of this trend was \"a tragic loss to both Judaism and Christianity\", because it led to a subsequent history of bitter hatred, especially from the side of Christianity.\n\nAs a comparative theologian, Clooney writes about the diversity in the world nowadays, especially with respect to the flourishing of different religions. For Clooney, reflecting on one's religion in this pluralistic world is necessary, so that we can \"see the others in light of our own, and our own in light of the other.\" Focusing on the study of scriptural and theological texts, Clooney compares them between Christian traditions and non-Christian religions, to \"cross boundaries\" to other traditions, so that one would re-think his or her theology, which would thus shape his or her identity. After more than 40 years of studying Hinduism, Clooney concluded that he finds the distinctive disciplines of theology and Hinduism are \"mutually enriching\". By applying this approach, according to Clooney, one can start within his or her \"home\" tradition, enter a different tradition and return to his or her tradition, which is enriched and reformulated after crossing boundaries.\n\nWhile scholars studying multiple religious belonging attempt to appreciate other religions' traditions besides their own, the conservative segment of Christianity tends to question the inclusivistic view of multiple religious belonging because it implies that salvation can be found from somewhere else other than Jesus Christ. In a 2010 article, Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen, a systematic theologian, questioned the approach of \"othering\" those that have traditions different from Christians' because God is the one who offers salvation; Christians only witness it. It is out of humility that Christians can say that salvation belongs to God, and God only, in Kärkkäinen's view. On the other hand, scholars studying multiple religious belonging such as John B. Cobb see this as an opportunity rather than a threat: \"I do not see multiple religious belonging as the primary way into the future. The primary way is the transformation of the particular religious traditions, at least in the Christian case, through their new encounter with other traditions.\" For Cobb, engaging in interfaith dialogue helps smooth the tension between Christianity and Judaism and avoid misunderstanding toward Islam.\n\nIn a 2017 article, sociologist Steve Bruce pointed out that most of the published writings in which multiple religious belonging is studied are purely conceptual and offer \"only anecdotes to illustrate theoretical or classificatory discussions\". Bruce argued that the few attempts to gather empirical data on the phenomenon have conflated a variety of different attitudes that should not be given the label of \"multiple religious belonging\", attitudes such as: universalistic re-interpretation of multiple religions, multiple religious association through family ties, multiple religious interest or sympathies, ancillary religious respect for a specific aspect of a religion, and secular equal respect for all religions. Bruce argued that the term \"multiple religious belonging\" should be strictly confined to being \"an observant 'member' of more than one religion (religion here meaning such high level abstractions as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism etc)\", and since most religions have strict requirements for and expectations of observant members, sociologists should expect multiple religious belonging, defined in this way, to be \"remarkably rare\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1666883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1666883", "title": "Phenomenology of religion", "text": "Phenomenology of religion\n\nThe phenomenology of religion concerns the experiential aspect of religion, describing religious phenomena in terms consistent with the orientation of worshippers. It views religion as made up of different components, and studies these components across religious traditions in order to gain some understanding of them.\n\nThe first explicit use of the phrase \"phenomenology of religion\" occurs in the \"Lehrbuch der Religionsgeschichte\" (Handbook of the History of Religions), written by Pierre Daniël Chantepie de la Saussaye in 1887, wherein he articulates the task of the science of religion and gives an \"Outline of the phenomenology of religion\". Employing the terminology of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Chantepie divides his science of religion into two areas of investigation, essence and manifestations, which are approached through investigations in philosophy and history, respectively. However, Chantepie’s phenomenology \"belongs neither to the history nor the philosophy of religion as Hegel envisioned them\". For Chantepie, it is the task of phenomenology to prepare historical data for philosophical analysis through \"a collection, a grouping, an arrangement, and a classifying of the principal groups of religious conceptions\". This sense of phenomenology as a grouping of manifestations is similar to the conception of phenomenology articulated by Robison and the British; however, insofar as Chantepie conceives of phenomenology as a preparation for the philosophical elucidation of essences, his phenomenology is not completely opposed to that of Hegel.\n\nChantepie’s \"Lehrbuch\" was highly influential, and many researchers began similar efforts after its publication and its subsequent translation into English and French. One such researcher was William Brede Kristensen. In 1901, Kristensen was appointed the first professorship relating to the phenomenology of religion at the University of Leiden. Some of the material from Kristensen’s lectures on the phenomenology of religion was edited posthumously, and the English translation was published in 1960 as \"The Meaning of Religion\". James notes that Kristensen’s phenomenology \"adopts many of the features of Chantepie’s grouping of religious phenomena,\" and penetrates further into the intricacies of Chantepie’s phenomenological approach.\nFor Chantepie, phenomenology is affected by the philosophy and history of religion, but for Kristensen, it is also the medium whereby the philosophy and history of religion interact with and affect one another. In this sense, Kristensen’s account of the relationship between historical manifestations and philosophy is more similar to that of Hegel than it is to Chantepie. In defining the religious essence of which he explores historical manifestations, Kristensen appropriates Rudolf Otto’s conception of \"das Heilige\" (\"the holy\" or \"the sacred\"). Otto describes \"das Heilige\" with the expression \"mysterium tremendum et fascinans\"—a numinous power revealed in a moment of \"awe\" that admits of both the horrible shuddering of \"religious dread\" (\"tremendum\") and fascinating wonder (\"fascinans\") with the overpowering majesty (\"majestas\") of the ineffable, \"wholly other\" mystery (\"mysterium\").\n\nLike Chantepie, Kristensen argues that phenomenology seeks the “meaning” of religious phenomena. Kristensen clarifies this supposition by defining the meaning that his phenomenology is seeking as “the meaning that the religious phenomena have for the believers themselves”. Furthermore, Kristensen argues that phenomenology is not complete in grouping or classifying the phenomena according to their meaning, but in the act of understanding. “Phenomenology has as its objects to come as far as possible into contact with and to understand the extremely varied and divergent religious data”.\n\nBeing a phenomenologist, Kristensen was less interested in philosophical presuppositions than in his concrete depth-research in the incidental religious phenomena. These subjects concerned mythological material (such as Creation, the Flood etc.) as well as human action (such as baptism, Olympic Games etc.), and objects of nature and handicrafts.\nIn all of this he only made use of the authentic sources: writings and images by the believers themselves. This procedure compelled him to reduce the field of his research - he had to profoundly master all relating languages and writings in order to be able to understand his sources in a way as they would have wanted to be understood themselves.\nConsequently, he reduced his field of research to the phenomena in religions living around the origin of Christianity: during the millennia before and the centuries after Christ, in Iran (Avesta), Babylonia and Assyria, Israel, Egypt, Greece and Rome.\nThe required knowledge of speeches, also, is one of the causes that only few (Van der Leeuw, Bleeker) of his pupils did carry on in his line, although many scholars showed interests in the results of his research.\nApart from his synopsis \"The Meaning of Religion\", and a just simple \"Introduction in History of Religion\", his publications are mostly restricted to the results of his incidental partial researches, published in the shape of a Communication of the Royal Academy of the Netherlands.\n\nThe phenomenological approach to religion developed in Gerardus van der Leeuw’s \"Phänomenologie der Religion\" (1933) follows Kristensen in many respects, while also appropriating the phenomenology of Martin Heidegger and the hermeneutics of Wilhelm Dilthey.\n\nFor van der Leeuw, understanding is the subjective aspect of phenomena, which is inherently intertwined with the objectivity of that which is manifest. Van der Leeuw articulates the relation of understanding to understood phenomena according to the schema outlined in Dilthey’s definition of the human sciences (\"Geisteswissenschaften\") as sciences that are “based on the relations between experience, expression and understanding” (“\"Verhältnis von Erlebnis, Ausdruck, und Verstehen\"”). Van der Leeuw correlates subjective experience, expression, and understanding with three objective levels of appearing—relative concealment (\"Verborgenheit\"), relative transparency (\"Durchsichtigkeit\"), and gradually becoming manifest or revealed (\"Offenbarwerden\"), wherein the understanding of what is becoming revealed is the primordial level of appearing from which the experienced concealment and expressed transparency of appearing are derived.\n\nBecause van der Leeuw, like Kristensen, appropriates Otto’s concept of \"das Heilige\" in defining the essential category of religion, the transcendence becoming revealed in all human understanding can be further described as sacred — an overpowering “wholly other,” which becomes revealed in astonishing moments of dreadful awe (\"Scheu\") and wonderful fascination. Van der Leeuw argues that this concept of religious dread is also present in Kierkegaard’s work on \"Angst\" and in Heidegger’s statement that “what arouses dread is ‘being in the world’ itself”. Moreover, van der Leeuw recognizes that, although dreadful, Being-in-the-world is fundamentally characterized as care (\"Sorge\"), the existential structure whereby \"Dasein\" is concerned with meaningful relationships in the world alongside other beings.\n\nBecause all experiences disclose concealed (wholly other) transcendence to the understanding, all experiences of Being-in-the-world are ultimately religious experiences of the sacred, whether explicitly recognized as such or not. Human being as such is \"homo religiosus\", the opposite of \"homo negligens\".\n\nIt is the task of the phenomenology of religion to interpret the various ways in which the sacred appears to human beings in the world, the ways in which humans understand and care for that which is revealed to them, for that which is ultimately wholly other mystery.\nAmong other great phenomenologists who worked and influenced phenomenology of religion are Henry Corbin, Ninian Smart, Mircea Eliade.\n\n\n\n"}

Such groups as the Church of Scientology, the Raëlian Church and Heaven's Gate, seen as dangerous, exploitative, secretive, or closed, have been classified as pseudoreligious cults.\n\nOthers may begin as splinters or hold-overs from traditional religions based in Apocryphal or Pseudepigraphical writings not accepted within the originating religion.\n\nExamples of marginal movements with founding figures, liturgies and recently invented traditions that have been studied as legitimate social practices include various New Age movements, and millennaristic movements such as the Ghost Dance and South Pacific cargo cults.\n\nIn 1963 Paul Tillich distinguished pseudo-religions (intentionally similar to acknowledged religions) from quasi-religions (entities with unintended similarities to religions).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40880627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40880627", "title": "Religio", "text": "Religio\n\nThe Latin term \"religiō\", origin of the modern lexeme \"religion\" (via Old French/Middle Latin) is of ultimately obscure etymology. It is recorded beginning in the 1st century BC, i.e. in Classical Latin at the beginning of the Roman Empire, notably by Cicero, in the sense of \"scrupulous or strict observance of the traditional \"cultus\"\".\n\nThe classical explanation of the word, traced to Cicero himself, derives it from \"re-\" (again) + \"lego\" in the sense of \"choose\", \"go over again\" or \"consider carefully\".\nModern scholars such as Tom Harpur and Joseph Campbell favor the derivation from ' \"bind, connect\", probably from a prefixed ', i.e. \"re-\" (again) + \"ligare\" or \"to reconnect,\" which was made prominent by St. Augustine, following the interpretation of Lactantius. \n\nThe problem with these etymologies, regardless of whether one favours \"lego\" or \"ligo\", is that the now-familiar prefix re- \"again\" is not attested prior to its occurrence in \"religio\" and is itself in need of an etymological explanation.\n\nWithin the system of what we would now call \"Roman religion (in the modern sense of the word), the term \"religio\" originally meant an obligation to the gods, something expected by them from human beings or a matter of particular care or concern as related to the gods, \n\"reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, piety\".\n\nIn this sense, \"religio\" might be translated better as \"religious scruple\" than with the English word \"religion\". One definition of \"religio\" offered by Cicero is \"cultus deorum\", \"the proper performance of rites in veneration of the gods.\"\n\n\"Religio\" among the Romans was not based on \"faith\", but on knowledge, including and especially correct practice. \"Religio\" (plural \"religiones\") was the pious practice of Rome's traditional cults, and was a cornerstone of the \"mos maiorum\", the traditional social norms that regulated public, private, and military life. To the Romans, their success was self-evidently due to their practice of proper, respectful \"religio\", which gave the gods what was owed them and which was rewarded with social harmony, peace and prosperity.\n\nReligious law maintained the proprieties of divine honours, sacrifice, and ritual. Impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were \"vitia\" (faults, hence \"vice,\" the English derivative); excessive devotion, fearful grovelling to deities, and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were \"superstitio\"; neglecting the \"religiones\" owed to the traditional gods was atheism, a charge leveled during the Empire at Jews, Christians, and Epicureans. Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger (\"ira deorum\") and, therefore, harm the State. See Religion in ancient Rome.\n\n\"Religiosus\" was something pertaining to the gods or marked out by them as theirs, as distinct from \"sacer\", which was something or someone given to them by humans. Hence, a graveyard was not primarily defined as \"sacer\" but a \"locus religiosus\", because those who lay within its boundaries were considered belonging to the di Manes. Places struck by lightning were taboo because they had been marked as \"religiosus\" by Jupiter himself.\n"}

Different types of religious names may be in use among clergy of a religion, as well in some cases among the laity.\n\nIn baptism, Catholics are given a Christian name, which should not be \"foreign to Christian sentiment\" and is often the name of a saint. In East Asia, in Africa and elsewhere, the baptismal name is distinct from the traditional-style given name.\n\nIn some countries, it is common to adopt a confirmation name, in addition to the baptismal name.\n\nIn some religious institutes, a new member takes a religious name. In Italian, a religious figure is often referred to by their religious name and by their secular name or their \"\" name. A newly elected Pope also takes on a new name, called his regnal name or papal name.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church converts often take a new name at the time of their reception into the church, either by baptism or chrismation. A person's religious name is always the name of a saint, who then becomes that person's patron saint. When deciding on a name for their child, Orthodox parents will often name the child after a saint whose feast day falls on either the day of the child's birth or the day of its baptism. Traditionally, Orthodox Christians celebrate their \"name day\" (i.e., the feast day of their patron saint), rather than their birthday.\n\nOrthodox monks and nuns are often given a new monastic name at the time of their tonsure (i.e., when they take their monastic vows). A monastic name is usually the name of a prophet or a monastic saint. Sometimes, the monastic name will begin with the same initial as the individual's baptismal name.\n\nConverts to Judaism take a Hebrew name upon conversion. Born Jews generally have a patronymic Hebrew name which is used for religious purposes; this is frequently different from their legal name, especially when the latter is of gentile or non-Hebrew origin.\n\nMany Buddhist sects also practice this, with newly ordained sangha often given new names by their master. Lay Buddhists are also given Dharma names during their refuge ceremony.\n\nMembers of ISKCON and some other Gaudiya Vaishnava organisations are given a \"spiritual name\" by their guru upon initiation. This name ends in \"Das\" or \"Dasa\" for men and \"Dasi\" for women (meaning \"servant\"), and generally begins with the same letter as the devotee's given name.\n\nIn Wicca, a craft name is often used.\n\nIt is usual for a Discordian Episkopos to adopt a faux-mystical and bizarre name for the duration of the Episkoposity; such names are not immutable and are frequently adapted over time. The same is true for the clergy of the related Church of the SubGenius.\n\n"}

{"id": "7199040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7199040", "title": "The Ghost Club", "text": "The Ghost Club\n\nThe Ghost Club is a paranormal investigation and research organization, founded in London in 1862. It is widely believed to be the oldest such organization in the world. Since 1862 it has primarily investigated ghosts and hauntings.\n\nThe club has its roots in Cambridge in 1855, where fellows at Trinity College began to discuss ghosts and psychic phenomena. Launched officially in London in 1862, it counted Charles Dickens and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle among its members. One of the club's earliest investigations was of the Davenport brothers and their \"spirit cabinet\" hoax, the club challenging the Davenports' claim of contacting the dead.\n\nThe group continued to undertake practical investigations of spiritualist phenomena, a topic then in vogue, meeting to discuss ghostly subjects. The Ghost Club dissolved in the 1870s following the death of Dickens.\n\nThe club was revived on All Saints Day 1882 by the medium Stainton Moses and Alaric Alfred Watts. initially claiming to be the original founders, without acknowledging its origins. In 1882, the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), with whom there was an initial overlap, was founded at a similar time.\n\nWhile the SPR was a body devoted to scientific study, the Ghost Club remained a selective and secretive organization of convinced believers for whom psychic phenomena were an established fact. Stainton Moses resigned from the vice presidency of the SPR in 1886 and thereafter devoted himself to the Ghost Club. Membership was small (82 members over 54 years) and women were not allowed but during this period it attracted some of the most original and controversial minds in psychical research. These included Sir William Crookes Sir Oliver Lodge, Nandor Fodor and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nThe archives of the Club reveal that the names of members, both living and dead, were solemnly recited each November 2. Each individual, living or dead, was recognized a member of the Club. On more than one occasion deceased members were believed to have made their presence felt.\n\nAlso involved were the poet W. B. Yeats (joined 1911) and Frederick Bligh Bond (joined 1925), who became infamous with his investigations into spiritualism at Glastonbury. Bligh Bond later left the country and became active in the American Society for Psychical Research. He was ordained into the Old Catholic Church and rejoined the Ghost Club on his return to Britain in 1935.\n\nThe Principal of Jesus College, Cambridge, Arthur Grey fictionalized the Ghost Club in 1919 as \"The Everlasting Club\" in a ghost story that many still believe to be true.\n\nThe 20th century's move from séance room investigation to laboratory-based research meant the Ghost Club fell out of touch with contemporary psychic research. Harry Price, famous for his investigation into Borley Rectory, joined as a member in 1927 as did psychologist Nandor Fodor who represented the changing approach to psychical research taking place. With attendance falling, the club closed in 1936 after 485 meetings. The Ghost Club records were deposited in the British Museum under the proviso that they would remain closed until 1962 out of respect for confidentiality.\n\nWithin 18 months, Price relaunched the Ghost Club as a society dining event where psychic researchers and mediums delivered after-dinner talks. Price decided to admit women to the club, also specifying that it was not a spiritualist church or association but a group of skeptics that gathered to discuss paranormal topics. Members in this period included , Sir Julian Huxley, Algernon Blackwood, Sir Osbert Sitwell and Lord Amwell.\n\nFollowing Price's death in 1948, the club was again relaunched by members of the committee, Philip Paul and Peter Underwood. From 1962 Underwood served as President; many accounts of club activities are found in his books.\n\nTom Perrott joined the club in 1967 and served as Chairman from 1971 to 1993.\n\nIn 1993, the club underwent a period of internal disruption, during which Underwood left to become Life President of another society he had revived called \"The Ghost Club Society\".\n\nThe Ghost Club later expanded its remit to include the study of UFOs, dowsing, cryptozoology and similar topics.\n\nIn 1998, Perrott resigned as chairman (although he remained active in club affairs), and barrister Alan Murdie was elected as his successor. Murdie has written a number of ghost books including \"Haunted Brighton\" and regularly writes for \"Fortean Times\". In 2005 he was succeeded by Kathy Gearing, the club's first female chairperson. Gearing announced her resignation in the club's Summer 2009 newsletter.\n\nThe club continues to meet monthly at the Victory Services Club near Marble Arch, in London. Several investigations are performed in England every year. In recent times, investigations have been organised in Scotland by the club's Scottish Area Investigation Coordinator.\n\n\n\nThe club has been mentioned in numerous books, the most notable being \"No Common Task\" (1983), \"This Haunted Isle\" (1984), \"The Ghosthunters Almanac\" (1993) and \"Nights in Haunted Houses\" (1994), all by Peter Underwood, \"Some Unseen Power\" (1985) by Philip Paul, \"The Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits\" (1992) by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, \"Will Storr Versus the Supernatural\" (2006) by Will Storr, \"The Guide to Mysterious Glasgow\" (2009) by Geoff Holder, \"Ghost Hunting: a Survivor's Guide\" (2010) by John Fraser and \"A Brief Guide to Ghost Hunting\" (2013) by Dr Leo Ruickbie.\n"}
{"id": "31480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31480", "title": "Theosophy (Boehmian)", "text": "Theosophy (Boehmian)\n\nTheosophy, also known as Christian theosophy and Boehmian theosophy, refers to a range of positions within Christianity which focus on the attainment of direct, unmediated knowledge of the nature of divinity and the origin and purpose of the universe.\nThey have been characterized as mystical and occultist philosophies. Theosophy is considered part of Western esotericism, which believes that hidden knowledge or wisdom from the ancient past offers a path to enlightenment and salvation.\n\nThe foundation of Christian theosophy is usually attributed to the German philosopher Jakob Böhme.\n\nIn 1875, the term \"theosophy\" was adopted and revived by the Theosophical Society, an esoteric organisation which spawned a spiritual movement also called Theosophy. In the twentieth century, theosophy became the object of study for various scholars of Western esotericism.\n\nTheosophy comes from the Greek ' (), which combines ' (θεός), \"God\" and \"\" (), \"wisdom\". Its etymological meaning is thus \"wisdom of God.\" \n\nThe term \"theosophia\" appeared (in both Greek and Latin) in the works of early church fathers, as a synonym for theology: the \"theosophoi\" are \"those knowing divine things\". The term however acquired various other meanings throughout its history. The adjective \"theosophos\" (θεόσοφος) \"wise in divine things\" was applied by Iamblichus to the gymnosophists (Γυμνοσοφισταί), i.e. the Indian yogis or sadhus.\n\nScholars of esotericism such as Godwin and Faivre differentiated the tradition of religious illumination from the religious system established in the late nineteenth century by Helena Blavatsky by referring to the latter with a capital letter as Theosophy, and the former with a lower-case letter as theosophy. Followers of Blavatsky's movement are known as Theosophists, while adherents of the older tradition are termed theosophers. Causing some confusion was the fact that a few Theosophists — such as C. C. Massey — were also theosophers.\n\nAntoine Faivre suggested that it be called \"Boehmian theosophy\".\n\nThe term theosophy was used as a synonym for theology as early as the 3rd century CE. The 13th century work \"Summa philosophiae\" attributed to Robert Grosseteste made a distinction between theosophers and theologians. In Summa, theosophers were described as authors only inspired by the holy books, while theologians like Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Origen were described as persons whose task was to explain theosophy. Therefore, the terms were the opposite of the present-day meaning.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, use of the term diverged to refer to gnostic knowledge that offers the individual enlightenment and salvation through a knowledge of the bonds that are believed to unite her or him to the world of divine or intermediary spirits. Christian theosophy arose in Germany in the 16th century. Inspired to a considerable extent by the works of Paracelsus (1493–1541). The term had not yet reached a settled meaning, however, as the mid-16th century \"Theosophia\" by Johannes Arboreus provided a lengthy exposition that included no mention of esotericism.\n\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Christian theosophy and Pietism arose in response to the orthodoxy of the Lutheran Reformation.\n\nThe work of the 17th-century German Christian mystic Jakob Boehme (1575–1624) strongly contributed to spread the use of the word \"theosophy\", even though Boehme rarely used the word in his writings. It is on account of the title of some of his works, but these titles appear to have been chosen more by the editors than by Boehme himself. Moreover, Boehme gave the word \"theosophy\" a limited meaning, making it clear that he was not conflating nature with God. Boehme's work has been described as being \"foundational\" for Christian theosophy. There were relatively few theosophers in the 17th century, but many of them were prolific. Outside of Germany, there were also theosophers from Holland, England, and France. This group is represented by Jan Baptist van Helmont (1618–1699), Robert Fludd (1574–1637), John Pordage (1608–1681), Jane Leade (1623–1704), Henry More (1614–1687), Pierre Poiret (1646–1719), and Antoinette Bourignon (1616–1680). Theosophers of this period often inquired into nature using a method of interpretation founded upon a specific myth or revelation, applying active imagination in order to draw forth symbolic meanings and further their pursuit of knowledge toward a complete understanding of these mysteries. In Athanasius Kircher's \"Oedipus Aegyptiacus\" (1652), Kircher assigned the word theosophy to the metaphysics adhered to in ancient Egypt, and to Neo-Platonism, and thus he gave once again the word one of its most generally accepted meanings, that of divine metaphysics.\n\nIn the 18th century, the word theosophy came into more widespread use among some philosophers. However, the term \"theosophy\" was still \"practically absent\" throughout the entire eighteenth century in dictionaries and encyclopedias, where it only appeared more and more frequently beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century. Theosophers themselves used the word theosophy sparingly, at least up until the middle of the nineteenth century. Johann Jakob Brucker (1696–1770) included a long chapter on theosophy in his monumental work (1741). He included theosophers alongside other currents in esotericism in what was then a standard reference in the history of philosophy. By the 18th century, the word \"theosophy\" was often used in conjunction with The term \"theosophy\" is more properly reserved for the reverse process of contemplating the divine in order to discover the content of the concrete universe.\n\nIn England, Robert Hindmarsh, a printer with a Methodist background, formed a \"Theosophical Society\" in 1783, for translating, printing and distributing the writings of Swedenborg. This society was renamed in 1785 as \"The British Society for the Propagation of the Doctrines of the New Church\", consisting of Swedenborgian based beliefs. In France, Denis Diderot gave the word \"\" more attention than other encyclopedias of this period by including an article on it in his \"Encyclopédie\", published during the French Enlightenment. The article dealt mostly with Paracelsus and essentially plagiarized Brucker's \"Historia\".\n\nGroups such as the Martinist Order founded by Papus in 1891, followed the theosophical current closely linked to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition and Western esotericism. Theosophers outside of the initiate societies included people such as Vladimir Solovyov (1853–1900), whose views have been described as follows: \"although empiricism and rationalism rest on false principles, their respective objective contents, external experience, qua the foundation of natural science, and logical thought, qua the foundation of pure philosophy, are to be synthesized or encompassed along with mystical knowledge in 'integral knowledge,' what Solovyov terms 'theosophy.'\"\n\nFaivre stated that \"Theosophy is a gnosis that has a bearing not only on the salvific relations the individual maintains with the divine world, but also on the nature of God Himself, or of divine persons, and on the natural universe, the origin of that universe, the hidden structures that constitute it in its actual state, its relationship to mankind, and its final ends.\"\n\nTheosophy actually designates a specific flow of thought or tradition within the modern study of esotericism. Thus, it follows the path starting from the more modern period of the 15th century onward. Faivre describes the \"theosophic current\" or theosophy as a single esoteric current among seven other esoteric currents in early modern Western thought (i.e., alchemy, astrology, Neo-Alexandrian Hermeticism, Christian Kabbalah, Paracelsism (i.e., the studying of the \"prognostications\" of Paracelsus), philosophia occulta and Rosicrucianism). \n\nFaivre noted that there are \"obvious similarities\" between earlier theosophy and modern Theosophy as both play an important part in Western esotericism and both claim to deal with wisdom from a gnostic perspective. But he says there are also differences, since they do not actually rely on the same reference works; and their style is different. The referential corpus of earlier theosophy \"belongs essentially to the Judeo-Christian type\", while that of modern Theosophy \"reveals a more universal aspect\". Although there are many differences between Christian theosophy and the Theosophical movement begun by Helena Blavatsky, the differences \"are not important enough to cause an insurmountable barrier\".\n\nTheosophers engage in analysis of the universe, humanity, divinity, and the reciprocal effects of each on the other. The starting point for theosophers may be knowledge of external things in the world or inner experiences and the aim of the theosopher is to discover deeper meanings in the natural or divine realm. Antoine Faivre notes, \"the theosophist dedicates his energy to inventing (in the word's original sense of 'discovering') the articulation of all things visible and invisible, by examining both divinity and nature in the smallest detail.\" The knowledge that is acquired through meditation is believed to change the being of the meditator.\n\nFaivre identified three characteristics of theosophy. The three characteristics of theosophy are listed below.\n\n\"Theosophy\":\n\nThe scholar of esotericism Wouter Hanegraaff described Christian theosophy as \"one of the major currents in the history of Western esotericism\". \n\nChristian theosophy is an under-researched area; a general history of it has never been written. The French scholar Antoine Faivre had a specific interest in the theosophers and illuminists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He wrote his doctoral thesis on Karl von Eckartshausen and Christian theosophy.\nScholars of esotericism have argued that Faivre's definition of Western esotericism relies on his own specialist focus on Christian theosophy, Renaissance Hermeticism, and Romantic \"Naturphilosophie\" and therefore creates an \"ideal\" type of esotericism that does not suit all esoteric currents.\n\n"}
{"id": "3159905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3159905", "title": "Transcendence (religion)", "text": "Transcendence (religion)\n\nIn religion, transcendence refers to the aspect of a deity's nature and power that is wholly independent of the material universe, beyond all known physical laws. This is contrasted immanence, where a god is said to be fully present in the physical world and thus accessible to creatures in various ways. In religious experience transcendence is a state of being that has overcome the limitations of physical existence and by some definitions has also become independent of it. This is typically manifested in prayer, séance, meditation, psychedelics and paranormal \"visions\".\n\nIt is affirmed in various religious traditions' concept of the divine, which contrasts with the notion of a god (or, the Absolute) that exists exclusively in the physical order (immanentism), or indistinguishable from it (pantheism). Transcendence can be attributed to the divine not only in its being, but also in its knowledge. Thus, a god may transcend both the universe and knowledge (is beyond the grasp of the human mind).\n\nAlthough transcendence is defined as the opposite of immanence, the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Some theologians and metaphysicians of various religious traditions affirm that a god is both within and beyond the universe (panentheism); in it, but not of it; simultaneously pervading it and surpassing it.\n\nBahá'ís believe in a single, imperishable god, the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe. In the Bahá'í tradition, god is described as \"a personal god, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty.\" Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of his creation, with a mind, will and purpose. Bahá'ís believe that God expresses this will at all times and in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as Manifestations of God or sometimes \"divine educators\". In expressing God's intent, these manifestations are seen to establish religion in the world. Bahá'í teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, nor to create a complete and accurate image.\n\nIn Buddhism \"transcendence\", by definition, belongs to the mortal beings of the formless realms of existence. However, although such beings are at 'the peak' of Samsara, Buddhism considers the development of transcendence to be both temporary and a spiritual cul-de-sac, which therefore does not eventuate a permanent cessation of Samsara. This assertion was a primary differentiator from the other Sramana teachers during Gautama Buddha's own training and development.\n\nAlternatively, in the various forms of Buddhism—Theravada, Mahayana (especially Pure Land and Zen) and Vajrayana—the notion of transcendence sometimes includes a soteriological application. Except for Pure Land and Vajrayana, the role played by transcendent beings is minimal and at most a temporary expedient. However some Buddhists believe that Nirvana is an eternal, transcendental state beyond name and form, so for these Buddhists, Nirvana is the main concept of transcendence. The more usual interpretation of Nirvana in Buddhism is that it is a cessation—a permanent absence of something (namely suffering), and therefore it is not in any way a state which could be considered transcendent.\n\nPrimordial enlightenment and the dharma are sometimes portrayed as transcendent, since they can surpass all samsaric obstructions.\n\nThe Catholic Church, as do other Christian Churches, holds that God transcends all creation. According to Aquinas, \"...concerning God, we cannot grasp what he is, but only what he is not, and how other beings stand in relation to him.\" Anthropomorphic depictions of God are largely metaphorical and reflect the challenge of \"human modes of expression\" in attempting to describe the infinite. St. Augustine observed \"...[I]t is only by the use of such human expressions that Scripture can make its many kinds of readers whom it wants to help to feel, as it were, at home.\" The \"sense of transcendence\" and therefore, an awareness of the \"sacred\", is an important component of the liturgy. God is recognized as both transcendent and immanent.\n\nTranscendence is described and viewed from a number of diverse perspectives in Hinduism. Some traditions, such as Advaita Vedanta, view transcendence in the form of God as the Nirguna Brahman (God without attributes), transcendence being absolute. Other traditions, such as Bhakti yoga, view transcendence as God with attributes (Saguna Brahman), the Absolute being a personal deity (Ishvara), such as Vishnu or Shiva.\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita transcendence is described as a level of spiritual attainment, or state of being which is open to all spiritual aspirants (the goal of yoga practice), the state at which one is no longer under the control of animalistic, base desires and is aware of a higher spiritual reality.\nThe exact nature of this transcendence is given as being \"above the modes of material nature\", which are known as \"gunas\" (ropes) which bind the living entity to the world of \"samsara\" (repeated rebirth) in Hindu philosophy.\n\n\"Tawhid\" is the act of believing and affirming that God (Arabic: Allah) is one and unique (\"wāḥid\"). The Qur'an asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible being who is independent of the entire creation. According to the Qur'an:\n\"Say: He is God, the One and Only; God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.\" (Sura , \"Yusuf Ali\") <br>Thy Lord is self-sufficient, full of Mercy: if it were God's will, God could destroy you, and in your place appoint whom God will as your successors, even as God raised you up from the posterity of other people.\" (Sura , \"Yusuf Ali\")\nAccording to Vincent J. Cornell, the Qur'an also provides a monist image of God by describing the reality as a unified whole, with God being a single concept that would describe or ascribe all existing things:\"God is the First and the Last, the Outward and the Inward; God is the Knower of everything (Sura )\" All Muslims have however vigorously criticized interpretations that would lead to a monist view of God for what they see as blurring the distinction between the creator and the creature, and its incompatibility with the radical monotheism of Islam.\n\nIn order to explain the complexity of unity of God and of the divine nature, the Qur'an uses 99 terms referred to as \"Most Beautiful Names of Allah\" (Sura 77:180)[12]. Aside from the supreme name \"Allah\" and the neologism al-Rahman (referring to the divine beneficence that constantly (re)creates, maintains and destroys the universe), other names may be shared by both God and human beings. According to the Islamic teachings, the latter is meant to serve as a reminder of God's immanence rather than being a sign of one's divinity or alternatively imposing a limitation on God's transcendent nature.\n\nTawhid or Oneness of God constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession. To attribute divinity to a created entity is the only unpardonable sin mentioned in the Qur'an. Muslims believe that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawhid.\n\nJewish theologians, especially since the Middle Ages, have described the transcendence of God in terms of divine simplicity, explaining the traditional characteristics of God as omniscient and omnipotent. Interventions of divine transcendence occur in the form of events outside the realm of natural occurrence such as miracles and the revelation of the Ten Commandments to Moses at Mt. Sinai.\n\nIn Jewish Kabbalistic cosmology, God is described as the \"Ein Sof\" (literally, without end) as reference to God's divine simplicity and essential unknowability. The emanation of creation from the Ein Sof is explained through a process of filtering. In the Kabbalistic creation myth referred to as the \"breaking of the vessels,\" filtering was necessary because otherwise this intense, simple essence would have overwhelmed and made impossible the emergence of any distinct creations. Each filter, described as a vessel, captured the emanation of this creative force until it was overwhelmed and broken by the intensity of God's simple essence. Once broken, the vessel's shards, full of absorbed \"divine sparks,\" fell into a vessel below. This process ultimately continued until the \"light\" of Godliness was sufficiently reduced to allow the world we inhabit to be sustained without breaking. The creation of this world, however, comes with the consequence that Godly transcendence is hidden, or \"exiled\" (from the immanent world). Only through the revelation of sparks hidden within the shards embedded in our material world can this transcendence be recognized again. In Hasidic thought, divine sparks are revealed through the performance of commandments or \"mitzvot,\" (literally, the obligations and prohibitions described in the Torah). A Kabbalistic explanation for the existence of malevolence in the world is that such terrible things are possible with the divine sparks being hidden. Thus there is some urgency to performing mitzvot in order to liberate the hidden sparks and perform a \"tikkun olam\" (literally, healing of the world). Until then, the world is presided over by the immanent aspect of God, often referred to as the Shekhinah or divine spirit, and in feminine terms.\n\nWaheguru (, \"\") is a term most often used in Sikhism to refer to God, the Supreme Being or the creator of all. It means \"Wonderful Teacher\" in the Punjabi language, but in this case is used to refer to the Sikh God. \"Wahi\" means \"wonderful\" (a Middle Persian borrowing) and \"Guru\" () is a term denoting \"teacher\". Waheguru is also described by some as an experience of ecstasy which is beyond all descriptions.\n\nCumulatively, the name implies wonder at the Divine Light eliminating spiritual darkness. It might also imply, \"Hail the Lord whose name eliminates spiritual darkness.\" Earlier, Shaheed Bhai Mani Singh, \"Sikhan di Bhagat Mala\", gave a similar explication, also on the authority of Guru Nanak. Considering the two constituents of \"Vahiguru\" (\"vahi\" + \"guru\") implying the state of wondrous ecstasy and offering of homage to the Lord, the first one was brought distinctly and prominently into the devotional system by Guru Nanak, who has made use of this interjection, as in Majh ki Var (stanza 24), and Suhi ki Var, sloka to pauri 10.\n\nSikh doctrine identifies one panentheistic god (Ek Onkar) who is omnipresent and has infinite qualities, whose name is true (Satnam), can do anything (Karta purkh), has no fear (Nirb hau), is not the enemy of anyone (Nirvair), is beyond time (Akaal), has no image (Murat), is beyond birth and death circulation (Ajunee), is self-existent (Sai Bhang) and possesses the grace of word guru (eternal light) we can meet him (Gurprasaad). Sikhs do not identify a gender for Ek Onkar, nor do they believe it takes a human form. In the Sikh tradition, all human beings are considered equal regardless of their religion, sex, or race. All are sons and daughters of Waheguru, the Almighty.\n\nIn 1961, Christian theologian Gabriel Vahanian's published \"The Death of God\". Vahanian argued that modern secular culture had lost all sense of the sacred, lacking any sacramental meaning, no transcendental purpose or sense of providence. He concluded that for the modern secular mind \"God is dead\", but he did not mean that God did not exist. In Vahanian's vision a transformed post-Christian and post-modern culture was needed to create a renewed experience of deity.\n\nPaul Van Buren and William Hamilton both agreed that the concept of transcendence had lost any meaningful place in modern secular thought. According to the norms of contemporary modern secular thought, God is dead. In responding to this denial of transcendence Van Buren and Hamilton offered secular people the option of Jesus as the model human who acted in love. The encounter with the Christ of faith would be open in a church-community.\n\nThomas J. J. Altizer offered a radical theology of the death of God that drew upon William Blake, Hegelian thought and Nietzschean ideas. He conceived of theology as a form of poetry in which the immanence (presence) of God could be encountered in faith communities. However, he no longer accepted the possibility of affirming his belief in a transcendent God. Altizer concluded that God had incarnated in Christ and imparted his immanent spirit which remained in the world even though Jesus was dead. It is important that such ideas are understood as socio-cultural developments and not as ontological realities. As Vahanian expressed it in his book, the issue of the denial of God lies in the mind of secular man, not in reality.\n\nCritiquing the death of God theology, Joseph Papin, the founder of the Villanova Theology Institute, noted: \"Rumbles of the new theology of the 'Requiem for God,\" (theologians of the death of God) proved to be a totally inadequate foundation for spanning a theological river with a bridge. The school of the theology of the \"Requiem of God,\" not even implementing a \"Requiem for Satan,\" will constitute only a footnote to the history of theology. . . . 'The Grave of God,' was the death rattle for the continuancy of the aforementioned school without any noticeable echo.\" Professor Piet Schoonenberg (Nijmegen, Netherlands) directly critiqued Altizer concluding: \"Rightly understood the transcendence of God does not exclude His immanence, but includes it.\" Schoonenberg went on to say: \"We must take God's transcendence seriously by not imposing any limits whatsoever, not even the limits that our images or concepts of transcendence evoke. This however occurs when God's transcendence is expressed as elevated over the world to the exclusion of his presence in this world; when his independence is expressed by excluding his real relation and reaction to the world; or when we insist upon his unchangeable eternity to the exclusion of his real partnership in human history.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "3972534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3972534", "title": "Vaccination and religion", "text": "Vaccination and religion\n\nVaccination and religion have interrelations of varying kinds. Almost no religions object to vaccination, and some parents either fake religious adherence or invent fake religions to provide exemption.\n\nThe influential Massachusetts preacher Cotton Mather was the first known person to attempt smallpox inoculation on a large scale, inoculating himself and over 200 members of his congregation with the help of a local doctor. While his view became standard, he also caused the first reaction against the practice.\n\nRowland Hill (1744–1833) was a popular English preacher acquainted with Edward Jenner, the pioneer of smallpox vaccination, and he encouraged the vaccination of the congregations he visited or preached to. He published a tract on the subject in 1806, at a time when many medical men refused to sanction it. Later he became a member of the Royal Jennererian Society, which was established when vaccination was accepted in Britain, India, the US, and elsewhere. John C. Lettsom, an eminent Quaker physician of the day wrote to Rowland Hill commenting:\n\nSeveral Boston clergymen and devout physicians formed a society that opposed vaccination in 1798. Others complained that the practice was dangerous, going so far as to demand that doctors who carried out these procedures be tried for attempted murder.\n\nIn 1816 Iceland made the clergy responsible for smallpox vaccination and gave them the responsibility of keeping vaccination records for their parishes; Sweden also had similar practices.\n\nWhen vaccination was introduced into UK public policy, and adoption followed overseas, there was opposition from trade unionists and others, including sectarian ministers and those interested in self-help and alternative medicines like homeopathy.\n\nAnti-vaccinationists were most common in Protestant countries. Those who were religious often came from minority religious movements outside of mainstream Protestantism, including Quakers in England and Baptists in Sweden.\n\nCatholic and Anglican missionaries vaccinated Northwest Coast Native Americans during an 1862 smallpox epidemic.\n\nIn the UK, a number of Vaccination Acts were introduced to control vaccination and inoculation, starting in 1840, when smallpox inoculation was banned. The 1853 Act introduced compulsory free infant vaccination enforced by local authorities. By 1871, infant vaccination was compulsory and parents refusing to have their child vaccinated were fined and imprisoned if the fines were not paid. Resistance to compulsion grew, and in 1889, after riots in Leicester, a Royal Commission was appointed and issued six reports between 1892 and 1896. It recommended the abolition of cumulative penalties. This was done in an 1898 Act, which also introduced a conscience clause that exempted parents who did not believe vaccination was efficacious or safe. This extended the concept of the \"conscientious objector\" in English law. A further Act in 1907 made it easier to obtain exemption.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses banned their members from receiving vaccinations from 1931 to 1952. They have since reversed their position. The decision of whether to vaccinate themselves or their family is left to the individual Witness. Some more recent Jehovah's Witness publications have mentioned the success of vaccination programs.\n\nChristian Science selectively rejects various forms of medical care including vaccination. The Congregation of Universal Wisdom, a religion based on belief in chiropractic spinal adjustments and Universal Intelligence, forbids vaccinations. The \"New York Times\" covered the Congregation of Universal Wisdom and noted that many families have used these religious memberships to avoid vaccination requirements. In a court case citing the Congregation of Universal Wisdom, \"Turner v. Liverpool Cent. School\", the United States District Court in New York affirmed the permissibility of claiming religious exemption from vaccination on the basis of such membership.\n\nSome conservative Christian groups in the United States oppose mandatory vaccination for diseases typically spread via sexual contact, arguing that the possibility of disease deters risky sexual contact. For example, the Family Research Council opposes mandatory vaccination against HPV, a virus that causes various cancers, writing, \"Our primary concern is with the message that would be delivered to nine- to 12-year-olds with the administration of the vaccines. Care must be taken not to communicate that such an intervention makes all sex 'safe'.\" Studies have shown that HPV vaccination does not result in increased sexual activity.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has made vaccination an official initiative in its humanitarian relief program. The Church has also called on its members to see that their own children are properly vaccinated.\n\nIslam and Judaism, religions with dietary prohibitions that regard particular animals as unclean, make exceptions for medical treatments derived from those animals.\n\nIn Aceh Province, an autonomous province of Indonesia with its own Islamic Sharia Law, 80 percent of people refuse all vaccinations due to concerns about pig, or its derivatives, being used to make some vaccines (eating pig is considered haram).\n\nThe use of fetal tissue in the development of vaccines has also provoked some controversy among religions opposed to abortion. The cell culture media of some viral vaccines, and the virus of the rubella vaccine, are derived from tissues taken from therapeutic abortions performed in the 1960s, leading to moral questions. For example, the principle of double effect, originated by Thomas Aquinas, holds that actions with both good and bad consequences are morally acceptable in specific circumstances, and the question is how this principle applies to vaccination. The Vatican Curia has expressed concern about the rubella vaccine's embryonic cell origin, saying Catholics have \"...a grave responsibility to use alternative vaccines and to make a conscientious objection with regard to those which have moral problems.\" The Vatican concluded that until an alternative becomes available it is acceptable for Catholics to use the existing vaccine, writing, \"This is an unjust alternative choice, which must be eliminated as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe majority of Orthodox Rabbis view vaccination as a religious obligation. A magazine called P.E.A.C.H. that presented an anti-immunization message to Orthodox Jews was distributed in Brooklyn, New York in early 2014. This is not a widespread phenomenon though. 96% of students at Yeshivas (who are essentially all Orthodox Jewish) in New York City were immunized according to information obtained in 2014, although this is a lower than average rate.\n\nIn 2003 imams in northern Nigeria advised their followers not to have their children vaccinated with oral polio vaccine, perceived to be a plot by Westerners to decrease Muslim fertility. The boycott caused the number of polio cases to rise not only in Nigeria but also in neighboring countries. The followers were also wary of other vaccinations, and Nigeria reported over 20,000 measles cases and nearly 600 deaths from measles from January through March 2005. In 2006 Nigeria accounted for over half of all new polio cases worldwide. Outbreaks continued thereafter; for example, at least 200 children died in a late-2007 measles outbreak in Borno State. In 2013, nine health workers administering polio vaccine were targeted and killed by gunmen on motorcycles in Kano, but this was an isolated incident. Local traditional and religious leaders and polio survivors worked to support the vaccination campaign, and Nigeria has not had a polio case since July 24, 2014; in 2017, if no new cases appear, Nigeria will be declared polio-free.\n\nIn the 2000s, in Pakistan and Afghanistan, some Taliban issued \"fatwas\" opposing vaccination as an American plot to sterilize Muslims, and kidnapped, beat, and assassinated vaccination officials; the head of Pakistan's vaccination campaign in Bajaur Agency was assassinated in 2007, on his way back from a meeting with a religious leader. In 2011, a CIA spy ran a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign to search for Osama bin Laden; such actions were strongly condemned by US and international health NGOs, the doctor involved was jailed and the CIA promised not to use vaccination as a cover again. A genuine polio vaccinator had previously vaccinated Osama bin Laden's children and grandchildren in his compound in Abbottabad. Both major sides of the Afghani civil war now support polio vaccination, and polio rates are declining rapidly in Afghanistan, with only five cases in Jan–July 2015. In Pakistan there were 28 cases in the same period.\n\nIn 2015, leaders of the Nation of Islam spoke out against a California Bill that removed philosophical exemptions to school vaccination requirements. Saying that data suggests \"that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism.\" They also said that that government mandated vaccines were another Tuskegee Syphilis Study.\n\nIn the U.S., all states except Mississippi, California and West Virginia allow parents to opt out of their children's otherwise-mandatory vaccinations for religious reasons. The number of religious exemptions rose greatly in the late 1990s and early 2000s; for example, in Massachusetts, the rate of those seeking exemptions rose from 0.24% in 1996 to 0.60% in 2006. Some parents falsely claim religious beliefs to get exemptions. The American Medical Association opposes such exemptions, saying that they endanger health not only for the unvaccinated individual but also for neighbors and the community at large.\n\nOn January 1, 2016 Australia introduced legislation that removed eligibility for childcare and welfare benefits if parents refuse to vaccinate their children, removing religious exemptions at the same time as the only religion to apply for an exemption (Church of Christ Science) deemed their exemption to no longer be relevant.\n"}
{"id": "24464731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24464731", "title": "Wu (shaman)", "text": "Wu (shaman)\n\nWu () are spirit mediums who have practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, rainmaking, and healing in Chinese traditions dating back over 3,000 years.\n\nThe Chinese word \"wu\" \"spirit medium; shaman; shamaness; sorcerer; doctor; proper names\" was first recorded during the Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600–1046 BCE), when a \"wu\" could be of either sex. During the late Zhou Dynasty (1045-256 BCE) \"wu\" was used to specify \"female shaman; sorceress\" as opposed to \"xi\" 覡 \"male shaman; sorcerer\" (which first appears in the 4th century BCE \"Guoyu\"). Other sex-differentiated shaman names include \"nanwu\" 男巫 for \"male shaman; sorcerer; wizard\"; and \"nüwu\" 女巫, \"wunü\" 巫女, \"wupo\" 巫婆, and \"wuyu\" 巫嫗 for \"female shaman; sorceress; witch\".\n\n\"Wu\" is used in compounds like \"wugu\" 巫蠱 \"sorcery; cast harmful spells\", \"wushen\" 巫神 or \"shenwu\" 神巫 (with \"shen\" \"spirit; god\") \"wizard; sorcerer\", and \"wuxian\" 巫仙 (with \"xian\" \"immortal; alchemist\") \"immortal shaman\".\n\nThe word \"tongji\" 童乩 (lit. \"youth diviner\") \"shaman; spirit-medium\" is a near-synonym of \"wu\". Chinese uses phonetic transliteration to distinguish native \"wu\" from \"Siberian shaman\": \"saman\" 薩滿 or \"saman\" 薩蠻. \"Shaman\" is occasionally written with Chinese Buddhist transcriptions of Shramana \"wandering monk; ascetic\": \"shamen\" 沙門, \"sangmen\" 桑門, or \"sangmen\" 喪門.\n\nJoseph Needham (1954:134) suggests \"shaman\" was transliterated \"xianmen\" 羨門 in the name of Zou Yan's disciple Xianmen Gao 羨門高 (or Zigao 子高). He quotes the \"Shiji\" that Emperor Qin Shi Huang (r. 221–210 BCE), \"wandered about on the shore of the eastern sea, and offered sacrifices to the famous mountains and the great rivers and the eight Spirits; and searched for \"xian\" \"immortals\", [\"xianmen\"], and the like.\" Needham (1954:134) compares two later Chinese terms for \"shaman\": \"shanman\" 珊蛮, which described the Jurchen leader Wanyan Xiyin, and \"sizhu\" 司祝, which was used for imperial Manchu shamans during the Qing Dynasty.\n\n\"Shaman\" is the common English translation of Chinese \"wu\", but some scholars (de Groot 1910, Mair 1990:35) maintain that the Siberian \"shaman\" and Chinese \"wu\" were historically and culturally different shamanic traditions. Arthur Waley (1955:9) defines \"wu\" as \"spirit-intermediary\" and says, \"Indeed the functions of the Chinese \"wu\" were so like those of Siberian and Tunguz shamans that it is convenient (as has indeed been done by Far Eastern and European writers) to use shaman as a translation of \"wu\". In contrast, Schiffeler (1976:20) describes the \"untranslatableness\" of \"wu\", and prefers using the romanization \"\"wu\" instead of its contemporary English counterparts, \"witches,\" \"warlocks,\" or \"shamans\",\" which have misleading connotations. Taking \"wu\" to mean \"female shaman\", Edward H. Schafer translates it as (1951:153) \"shamaness\" and (1980:11) \"shamanka\". The transliteration-translation \"\"wu\" shaman\" or \"\"wu\"-shaman\" (Unschuld 1985:344) implies \"Chinese\" specifically and \"shamanism\" generally. \"Wu\", concludes Falkenhausen (1995:280), \"may be rendered as \"shaman\" or, perhaps, less controversially as \"spirit medium\".\" Paper (1995:85) criticizes \"the majority of scholars\" who use one word \"shaman\" to translate many Chinese terms (\"wu\" 巫, \"xi\" 覡, \"yi\" 毉, \"xian\" 仙, and \"zhu\" 祝), and writes, \"The general tendency to refer to all ecstatic religious functionaries as shamans blurs functional differences.\"\nThe Modern Standard Chinese pronunciation of 巫 is \"wu\", which phonologically descends from (ca. 6th century CE) Middle Chinese and (ca. 6th century BCE) Old Chinese. Compare these Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions of \"wu\" 巫: \"mu\" < *\"mwo\" (Bernhard Karlgren), \"mjuo\" < *\"\" (Zhou Fagao), *\"mjag\" (Li Fanggui), \"mju\" < *\"ma\" (Axel Schuessler), and *\"mag\" (Victor H. Mair) . Linguists disagree whether \"wu\" had an Old Chinese velar final \"-g\" or \"-ɣ\". This 巫 is pronounced \"mouh\" in Cantonese, \"vu\" in Vietnamese, \"mu\" in Korean, and \"fu\" or \"miko\" in Japanese.\n\nThe contemporary Chinese character for \"wu\" combines the graphic radicals \"gong\" \"work\" and \"ren\" \"person\" doubled (cf. \"cong\" ). This 巫 character developed from Seal script characters that depicted dancing shamans, which descend from Bronzeware script and Oracle bone script characters that resembled a cross potent.\n\nThe first Chinese dictionary of characters, the (121 CE) \"Shuowen Jiezi\" defines \"wu\" as \"zhu\" \"sacrifice; prayer master; invoker; priest\" (祝也 女能以舞降神者也 象从工 两人舞形, tr. Hopkins 1920:432) and analyzes the Seal graph, \"An Invoker. A woman who can serve the Invisible, and by posturing bring down the spirits. Depicts a person with two sleeves posturing.\" This Seal graph for \"wu\" is interpreted as showing \"the 工 work of two dancing figures set to each other – a shamanistic dance\" (Karlgren 1923:363) or \"two human figures facing some central object (possibly a pole, or in a tent-like enclosure?)\" (Schafer 1951:153).\n\nThis dictionary also includes a variant Great Seal script (called a \"guwen\" \"ancient script\") that elaborates \"wu\" 巫. Hopkins (1920:433) analyzes this \"guwen\" graph as \"gong\" 廾 \"two hands held upward\" at the bottom (like \"shi\" 筮's Seal graph) and two \"mouths\" with the \"sleeves\" on the sides; or (1920:424) \"jade\" because the \"Shuowen\" defines \"ling\" 靈 \"spiritual; divine\" as synonymous with \"wu\" and depicting (巫以玉事神, tr. Hopkins 1920:424), \"an inspired shaman serving the Spirits with jade.\"\n\nSchafer (1951:154) compares the Shang Dynasty oracle graphs for \"wu\" and \"nong\" \"play with; cause\" (written with 玉 \"jade\" over 廾 \"two hands\") that shows \"hands (of a shaman?) elevating a piece of jade (the rain-compelling mineral) inside an enclosure, possibly a tent. The Seal and modern form 巫 may well derive from this original, the hands becoming two figures, a convergence towards the dancer-type graph.\"\n\nTu Baikui 塗白奎 (quoted by Boileau 2002:354) believes the \"wu\" oracle character \"was composed of two pieces of jade and originally designated a tool of divination.\" Citing Li Xiaoding 李孝定 that \"gong\" 工 originally pictured a \"carpenter's square\", Allan (1991:77) argues that oracle inscriptions used \"wu\" 巫 interchangeably with \"fang\" \"square; side; place\" for sacrifices to the \"sifang\" 四方 \"four directions\".\n\nThis 巫 component is semantically significant in several characters:\n\nThe comprehensive \"Hanyu Da Zidian\" dictionary (1989 1:412) lists five meanings of \"wu\" 巫, translatable as:\nThe former two \"shaman\" and \"doctor\" \"wu\" meanings are discussed below in detail. The latter three \"proper name\" meanings of apply to mountains, places, and people. \"Wushan\" \"Wu Mountain\" is located near Chongqing in Sichuan Province. In Chinese, it is known through the four-character idiom \"Wushanyunyu\" 巫山雲雨 (with \"clouds and rain\") \"lovers' rendezvous; coitus\" (for example, see \"Rain Clouds over Wushan\"). In English, Wu Mountain is known as the archeological site where Wushan Man \"taxon of \"Homo erectus\"\" was discovered. Two nearby place names are \"Wuxi\" 巫溪 (Wu Stream) and \"Wu Gorge\" (Wuxia 巫峽), which is in the Yangtze River's Three Gorges region. The Chinese surname \"Wu\" goes back to the Shang Dynasty (for example, legendary Wu Xian 巫咸), but is comparatively uncommon today (but does appear, for example, in the name of recording artist Wu Qixian 巫啟賢 \"Eric Moo\"). Wuma 巫馬 (lit. \"shaman horse\") is both a Chinese compound surname (for example, the Confucian disciple Wuma Shi/Qi 巫馬施/期) and a name for \"horse shaman; equine veterinarian\" (for example, the \"Zhouli\" official).\n\nHistorical linguists hypothetically connect the etymology of Chinese \"wu\" \"spirit medium; shaman\" not only with Sino-Tibetan languages, but also with Mongolic, Austronesian, Mon–Khmer, Turkic, and Indo-Iranian language groups.\n\nBerthold Laufer (1917:370) proposed a relation between Mongolian \"bügä\" \"shaman\", Turkish \"bögü\" \"shaman\", \"Chinese \"bu\", \"wu\" (shaman), \"buk\", \"puk\" (to divine), and Tibetan \"aba\" (pronounced \"ba\", sorcerer)\".\n\nCoblin (1986:107) puts forward a Sino-Tibetan root **\"\" \"magician; sorcerer\" for Chinese \"wu\" < \"mju\" < *\"mjag\" 巫 \"magician; shaman\" and Written Tibetan\" 'ba'-po\" \"sorcerer\" and\" 'ba'-mo\" \"sorcereress\" (of the Bön religion).\n\nSchuessler (2007:516) notes Chinese \"xian\" < \"sjän\" < *\"sen\" 仙 \"transcendent; immortal; alchemist\" was probably borrowed as Written Tibetan \"gšen\" \"shaman\" and Thai < Proto-Tai *' \"doctor; sorcerer\". In addition, the Mon–Khmer and Proto-Western-Austronesian *' \"shaman\" may also be connected with \"wu\". Schuessler lists four proposed etymologies.\n\nFirst, \"wu\" could be the same word as \"wu\" 誣 \"to deceive\" (Karlgren 1923:363). Schuessler notes a Written Tibetan semantic parallel between \"magical power\" and \"deceive\": \"sprul-ba\" \"to juggle, make phantoms; miraculous power\" cognate with \"magical deception\".\nSecond, \"wu\" could be cognate with \"wu\" \"to dance\". Based on analysis of ancient characters, Hopkins (1920, 1945) proposed that \"wu\" 巫 \"shaman\", \"wu\" \"not have; without\", and \"wu\" 舞 \"dance\", \"can all be traced back to one primitive figure of a man displaying by the gestures of his arms and legs the thaumaturgic powers of his inspired personality\" (1945:5). Many Western Han Dynasty tombs contained jade plaques or pottery images showing \"long-sleeved dancers\" performing at funerals, who Erickson (1994:52-54) identifies as shamans, citing the \"Shuowen jiezi\" that early \"wu\" characters depicted a dancer's sleeves.\n\nThird, \"wu\" could also be cognate with \"mu\" 母 \"mother\" since \"wu\", as opposed to \"xi\" 覡, were typically female. Edward Schafer associates \"wu\" shamanism with fertility rituals.\nLinguistic facts reveal the intimate relationships between the word \"wu\" (*\"myu\") \"shamanka\" and such words as \"mother\", \"dance\", \"fertility\", \"egg\", and \"receptacle\". The ancient shamanka, then, was closely related to the fecund mother, to the fertile soil, to the receptive earth. The textual evidence supports these philological associations. In Shang and Chou times, shamankas were regularly employed in the interests of human and natural fertility, above all in bringing rain to parched farmlands – a responsibility they shared with ancient kings. They were musicians and dancers and oracles. (1973:10) \nJensen (1995:421) cites the Japanese sinologist Shirakawa Shizuka 白川静's hypothesis that the mother of Confucius was a \"wu\".\nFourth, \"wu\" could be a loanword from Iranian *\"maguš\" \"magi; magician\" (cf. Old Persian \"maguš\", Avestan \"mogu\"), meaning an \"able one; specialist in ritual\". Mair (1990) provides archaeological and linguistic evidence that Chinese \"wu\" < *\"mag\" 巫 \"shaman; witch, wizard; magician\" was a loanword from Old Persian *\"maguš\" \"magician; magi\".\n\nMair connects the nearly identical Chinese Bronze script for \"wu\" 巫 (above) and Western heraldic cross potent ☩, an ancient symbol of a \"magi\" or \"magician\", for which both words were ultimately borrowed from the same Iranian word.\n\nThe oldest written records of \"wu\" are Shang Dynasty oracle inscriptions and Zhou Dynasty classical texts. Boileau notes the disparity of these sources.\nConcerning the historical origin of the \"wu\", we may ask: were they a remnant of an earlier stage of the development of archaic Chinese civilization? The present state of the documentation does not allow such a conclusion for two reasons: first, the most abundant data about the \"wu\" are to be found in Eastern Zhou texts; and, second, these texts have little in common with the data originating directly from the Shang civilization; possible ancestors of the Eastern Zhou \"wu\" are the cripples and the females burned in sacrifice to bring about rain. They are mentioned in the oracular inscriptions but there is no mention of the Shang character \"wu\". Moreover, because of the scarcity of information, many of the activities of the Zhou \"wu\" cannot be traced back to the Shang period. Consequently, trying to correlate Zhou data with Neolithic cultures appears very difficult. (2002:376) \n\nShima's (1971:418) concordance of oracle inscriptions lists 58 occurrences of the character \"wu\": 32 in repeated compounds (most commonly 巫帝 \"\"wu\" spirit/sacrifice\" and 氐巫 \"bring the \"wu\") and 26 in miscellaneous contexts. Boileau (2002:354-5) differentiates four meanings of these oracular \"wu\":\nThe inscriptions about this living \"wu\", which is later identified as \"shaman\", reveal six characteristics:\nBased on this ancient but limited Shang-era oracular record, it is unclear how or whether the \"Wu\" spirit, sacrifice, person, and place were related.\n\nChinese \"wu\" 巫 \"shaman\" occurs over 300 times in the Chinese classics, which generally date from the late Zhou and early Han periods (6th-1st centuries BCE). The following examples are categorized by the common specializations of \"wu\"-shamans:\nmen and women possessed by spirits or gods, and consequently acting as seers and soothsayers, exorcists and physicians; invokers or conjurers bringing down gods at sacrifices, and performing other sacerdotal functions, occasionally indulging also in imprecation, and in sorcery with the help of spirits. (De Groot 1910 6:1212) \n\nA single text can describe many roles for \"wu\"-shamans. For instance, the \"Guoyu\" idealizes their origins in a Golden Age. It contains a story about King Zhao of Chu (r. 515-489 BCE) reading in the \"Shujing\" that the sage ruler Shun \"commissioned Chong and Li to cut the communication between heaven and earth\". He asks his minister to explain and is told.\nAnciently, men and spirits did not intermingle. At that time there were certain persons who were so perspicacious, single-minded, and reverential that their understanding enabled them to make meaningful collation of what lies above and below, and their insight to illumine what is distant and profound. Therefore the spirits would descend upon them. The possessors of such powers were, if men, called \"xi\" (shamans), and, if women, \"wu\" (shamanesses). It is they who supervised the positions of the spirits at the ceremonies, sacrificed to them, and otherwise handled religious matters. As a consequence, the spheres of the divine and the profane were kept distinct. The spirits sent down blessings on the people, and accepted from them their offerings. There were no natural calamities.\n\nThe belief that demonic possession caused disease and sickness is well documented in many cultures, including ancient China. The early practitioners of Chinese medicine historically changed from \"wu\" 巫 \"spirit-mediums; shamans\" who used divination, exorcism, and prayer to \"yi\" 毉 or 醫 \"doctors; physicians\" who used herbal medicine, moxibustion, and acupuncture.\n\nAs mentioned above, \"wu\" 巫 \"shaman\" was depicted in the ancient 毉 variant character for \"yi\" 醫 \"healer; doctor\". This archaic \"yi\" 毉, writes Carr (1992:117), \"ideographically depicted a shaman-doctor in the act of exorcistical healing with (矢 'arrows' in) a 医 'quiver', a 殳 'hand holding a lance', and a \"wu\" 巫 'shaman'.\" Unschuld believes this 毉 character depicts the type of \"wu\" practitioner described in the \"Liji\".\nSeveral times a year, and also during certain special occasions, such as the funeral of a prince, hordes of exorcists would race shrieking through the city streets, enter the courtyards and homes, thrusting their spears into the air, in an attempt to expel the evil creatures. Prisoners were dismembered outside all gates to the city, to serve both as a deterrent to the demons and as an indication of their fate should they be captured. (1985:37) \nReplacing the exorcistical 巫 \"shaman\" in 毉 with medicinal 酒 \"wine\" in \"yi\" 醫 \"healer; doctor\" signified, writes Schiffeler (1976:27), \"the practice of medicine was not any longer confined to the incantations of the \"wu\", but that it had been taken over (from an official standpoint) by the \"priest-physicians,\" who administered elixirs or wines as treatments for their patients.\"\n\n\"Wu\" and \"yi\" are compounded in the word \"wuyi\" 巫醫 \"shaman-doctor; shamans and doctors\", translated \"exorcising physician\" (De Groot 1910), \"sorcerer-physician\" (Schiffeler 1976), or \"physician-shaman\" (Mainfort 2004). Confucius quotes a \"Southern Saying\" that a good \"wuyi\" must have \"heng\" \"constancy; ancient tradition; continuation; perseverance; regularity; proper name (e.g., \"Yijing\" Hexagram 32)\". The (ca. 5th century BCE) \"Lunyu\" \"Confucian Analects\" and the (ca. 1st century BCE) \"Liji\" \"Record of Rites\" give different versions of the Southern Saying.\n\nFirst, the \"Lunyu\" quotes Confucius to mention the saying and refer to the Heng Hexagram:\nThe Master said, The men of the south have a saying, Without stability a man will not even make a good shaman or witch-doctor. Well said! Of the maxim; if you do not stabilize an act of \"te\" 德, you will get evil by it (instead of good), the Master said, They (i.e. soothsayers) do not simply read the omens. (13/22, tr. Waley 1938:77) \nConfucius refers to a \"Yijing\" line interpretation of the Heng \"Duration\" Hexagram (tr. Wilhelm 1967:127-9): \"Nine in the third place means: He who does not give duration to his character meets with disgrace.\" In Waley's earlier article about the \"Yijing\", he translated \"If you do not stabilize your \"virtue,\" Disgrace will overtake you\", and quoted the \"Lunyu\".\n\"The people of the south have a saying, 'It takes \"heng\" to make even a soothsayer or medicine-man.' It's quite true. 'If you do not stabilize your virtue, disgrace will overtake you'.\" Confucius adds 不占而已矣, which has completely baffled his interpreters. Surely the meaning is 'It is not enough merely to get an omen,' one must also \"heng\" 'stabilize it'. And if such a rule applies even to inferior arts like those of the diviner and medicine-man, Confucius asks, how much the more does it apply to the seeker after [\"de\"] in the moral sense? Surely he too must 'make constant' his initial striving! (1933:136-137)\n\nSecond, the \"Liji\" quotes Confucius to elaborate upon the Southern Saying.\nThe Master said, 'The people of the south have a saying that \"A man without constancy cannot be a diviner either with the tortoise-shell or the stalks.\" This was probably a saying handed down from antiquity. If such a man cannot know the tortoise-shell and stalks, how much less can he know other men? It is said in the \"Book of Poetry\" (II, v, ode 1, 3) \"Our tortoise-shells are wearied out, And will not tell us anything about the plans.\" The Charge to [Yue] says ([\"Shujing\"], IV, VIII, sect. 2, 5, 11), \"Dignities should not be conferred on men of evil practices. (If they be), how can the people set themselves to correct their ways? If this be sought merely by sacrifices, it will be disrespectful (to the spirits). When affairs come to be troublesome, there ensues disorder; when the spirits are served so, difficulties ensue.\" 'It is said in the [\"Yijing\"], \"When one does not continuously maintain his virtue, some will impute it to him as a disgrace; (in the position indicated in the Hexagram.) 'When one does maintain his virtue continuously (in the other position indicated), this will be fortunate in a wife, but in a husband evil'.\" (55, tr. Legge 1885 2:363-364) \nThis \"Liji\" version makes five changes from the \"Lunyu\" (Carr 1992:121-122). (1) It writes \"bushi\" 卜筮 \"diviner\" instead of \"wuyi\" 巫醫 \"shaman-doctor\", compounding \"bu\" \"divine by bone or shell, scapulimancy or plastromancy\" and \"shi\" (also with \"shaman\") \"divine by milfoil stalks, cleromancy or sortilege\". (2) Instead of quoting Confucius to remark \"well said!\"; he describes the southern proverb as \"probably a saying handed down from antiquity\" and rhetorically questions the efficacy of divination. (3) The \"Liji\" correctly quotes the \"Shijing\" (195, tr. Karlgren 1950:142) criticizing royal diviners: \"Our tortoises are (satiated =) weary, they do not tell us the (proper) plans.\" (4) It quotes the \"Charge to Yue\" 說命 (traditionally attributed to Shang king Wu Ding) differently from the fabricated \"Guwen\" \"Old Texts\" \"Shujing\" \"Classic of History\" chapter with this name.\nDignities may not be conferred on man of evil practices, but only on men of worth. Anxious thought about what will be good should precede your movements. Your movements also should have respect to the time for them. … Officiousness in sacrifices is called irreverence; ceremonies when burdensome lead to disorder. To serve the spirits in this way is difficult. (17, tr. Legge 1865:256-8)\n(5) It cites an additional \"Yijing\" Hexagram 32 line (tr. Wilhelm 1967:129) that gender determines the auspiciousness of \"heng\". \"Six in the fifth place means: Giving duration to one's character through perseverance. This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man.\"\n\nThe mytho-geography \"Shanhaijing\" \"Classic of Mountains and Seas\" associates \"wu\"-shamans with medicinal herbs.\nEast of the Openbright there are Shaman Robust, Shaman Pushaway, Shaman Sunny, Shaman Shoe, Shaman Every, and Shaman Aide. They are all on each side of the corpse of Notch Flaw and they hold the neverdie drug to ward off decay. (tr. Birrell 2000:141) \nThere is Mount Divinepower. This is where Shaman Whole, Shaman Reach, Shaman Share, Shaman Robust, Shaman Motherinlaw, Shaman Real, Shaman Rite, Shaman Pushaway, ShamanTakeleave, and Shaman Birdnet ascend to the sky and come down from Mount Divinepower. This is where the hundred drugs are to be found. (tr. Birrell 2000:174) \n\"Shaman Whole\" translates Wu Xian 巫咸 below.\n\nBoileau contrasts Siberian and Chinese shamanic medicines.\nConcerning healing, a comparison of the \"wu\" and the Siberian shaman shows a big difference: in Siberia, the shaman is also in charge of cures and healing, but he does this by identifying the spirit responsible for the disease and negotiates the proper way to appease him (or her), for example by offering a sacrifice or food on a regular basis. In archaic China, this role is performed through sacrifice: exorcism by the \"wu\" does not seem to result in a sacrifice but is aimed purely and simply at expelling the evil spirit. (2002:361) \n\n\"Wu\" anciently served as intermediaries with nature spirits believed to control rainfall and flooding. During a drought, \"wu\"-shamans would perform the \"yu\" \"sacrificial rain dance ceremony\". If that failed, both \"wu\" and \"wang\" \"cripple; lame person; emaciated person\" engaged in \"ritual exposure\" (Schafer 1951) rainmaking techniques based upon homeopathic or sympathetic magic. As Unschuld (1985:33-34) explains, \"Shamans had to carry out an exhausting dance within a ring of fire until, sweating profusely, the falling drops of perspirations produced the desired rain.\" These \"wu\" and \"wang\" procedures were called \"pu\" / \"expose to open air/sun\", \"fen\" \"burn; set on fire\", and \"pulu\" \"reveal; lay bare; expose to open air/sun\".\n\nFor the year 639 BCE, the \"Chunqiu\" records, \"In summer, there was a great drought\" in Lu, and the \"Zuozhuan\" notes a discussion about \"fen wu wang\" 焚巫尪:\nThe duke (Xi) wanted to burn a \"wu\" and a cripple at the stake. Zang Wenzhong 臧文仲 said: this is no preparation for the drought. Repair the city walls, limit your food, be economic in your consumption, be parsimonious and advise (people) to share (the food), this is what must be done. What use would be \"wu\" and cripple? If Heaven wanted to have them killed, why were they born at all? If they (the cripple and the \"wu\") could produce drought, burning them would augment very much (the disaster). (tr. Boileau 2002:363, cf. Legge 1872:180) \nThe duke followed this advice, and subsequently \"scarcity was not very great\".\n\nThe \"Liji\" uses the words \"puwang\" 暴尪 and \"puwu\" 暴巫 to describe a similar rainmaking ritual during the reign (407-375 BCE) of Duke Mu 穆公 of Lu.\nThere was a drought during the year. Duke Mu called on Xianzi and asked him about the reason for this. He said: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time. I want to expose to the sun a cripple and what about that?' (Xianzi) said: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time but to expose to the sun the crippled son of somebody, that would be cruel. No, this cannot be allowed.' (the duke said): 'Well, then I want to expose to the sun a \"wu\" and what about that?' (Xianzi) answered: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time but to put one's hope on an ignorant woman and offer her to pray (for rain), no, this is too far (from reason).' (tr. Boileau 2002:364, cf. Legge 1885 1:201) \nCommentators interpret the \"wu\" as a female shaman and the \"wang\" as a male cripple.\n\nDe Groot connects the \"Zuozhuan\" and \"Liji\" stories about ritually burning \"wu\".\nThese two narratives evidently are different readings of one, and may both be inventions; nevertheless they have their value as sketches of ancient idea and custom. Those 'infirm or unsound' \"wang\" were non-descript individuals, evidently placed somewhat on a line with the \"wu\"; perhaps they were queer hags or beldams, deformed beings, idiotic or crazy, or nervously affected to a very high degree, whose strange demeanour was ascribed to possession. (1910 6:1194) \n\nOneiromancy or dream interpretation was one type of divination performed by \"wu\" 巫. The \"Zuozhuan\" records two stories about \"wu\" interpreting the guilty dreams of murderers.\n\nFirst, in 581 BCE the lord of Jin, who had slain two officers from the Zhao (趙) family, had a nightmare about their ancestral spirit, and called upon an unnamed \"wu\" \"shaman\" from Sangtian 桑田 and a \"yi\" \"doctor\" named Huan 緩 from Qin.\nThe marquis of [Jin] saw in a dream a great demon with disheveled hair reaching to the ground, which beat its breast, and leaped up, saying: \"You have slain my descendants unrighteously, and I have presented my request to the High God in consequence.\" It then broke the great gate (of the palace), advanced to the gate of the State chamber, and entered. The duke was afraid and went into a side-chamber, the door of which it also broke. The duke then awoke, and called the witch of [Sangtian], who told him everything which he had dreamt. \"What will be the issue?\" asked the duke. \"You will not taste the new wheat,\" she replied. <br>\nAfter this, the duke became very ill, and asked the services of a physician from [Qin], the earl of which sent the physician [Huan] to do what he could for him. Before he came, the duke dreamt that his disease turned into two boys, who said, \"That is a skilful physician; it is to be feared he will hurt us; how shall we get out of his way?\" Then one of them said: \"If we take our place above the heart and below the throat, what can he do to us?\" When the physician arrived, he said, \"Nothing can be done for this disease. Its seat is above the heart and below the throat. If I assail it (with medicine), it will be of no use; if I attempt to puncture it, it cannot be reached. Nothing can be done for it.\" The duke said, \"He is a skilful physician\", gave him large gifts, and send him back to [Qin].<br>\nIn the sixth month, on the day [bingwu], the marquis wished to taste the new wheat, and made the superintendent of his fields present some. While the baker was getting it ready, [the marquis] called the witch of [Sangtian], showed her the wheat and put her to death. As the marquis was about to taste the wheat, he felt it necessary to go to the privy, into which he fell, and so died. One of the servants that waited on him had dreamt in the morning that he carried the marquis on his back up to heaven. The same at mid-day carried him on his back out from the privy, and was afterwards buried alive with him. (tr. Legge 1872:374, note \"witch\" translates \"wu\") \nCommentators have attempted to explain why the \"wu\" merely interpreted the duke's dream but did not perform a healing ritual or exorcism, and why the duke waited until the prediction had failed before ordering the execution. Boileau (2002:368) suggests the \"wu\" was executed in presumed responsibility for the Zhao ancestral spirit's attack.\n\nSecond, in 552 BCE a \"wu\" named Gao 皋 both appears in and divines about a dream of Zhongxing Xianzi. After conspiring in the murder of Duke Li of Jin, Zhongxing dreams that the duke's spirit gets revenge.\nIn autumn, the marquis of [Jin] invaded our northern border. [Zhongxing Xianzi] prepared to invade [Qi]. (Just then), he dreamt that he was maintaining a suit with duke [Li], in which the case was going against him, when the duke struck him with a [\"ge\"] on his head, which fell down before him. He took his head up, put it on his shoulders, and ran off, when he saw the wizard [Gao] of [Gengyang]. A day or two after, it happened that he did see this [Gao] on the road, and told him his dream, and the wizard, who had had the same dream, said to him: \"Your death is to happen about this time; but if you have business in the east, you will there be successful [first]\". Xianzi accepted this interpretation. (tr. Legge 1872:478, note \"wizard\" translates \"wu\") \nBoileau questions:\nwhy wasn't the \"wu\" asked by Zhongxin to expel the spirit of the duke? Perhaps because the spirit went through him to curse the officer. Could it be that the \"wu\" was involved (his involvement is extremely strong in this affair) in a kind of deal, or is it simply that the \"wu\" was aware of two different matters concerning the officer, only one connected to the dream? (2002:369) \n\nAccording to these two stories, \"wu\" were feared and considered dangerous. This attitude is also evident in a \"Zhuangzi\" story about the \"shenwu\" 神巫 \"spirit/god shaman\" Jixian 季咸 from Zheng.\nIn [Zheng], there was a shaman of the gods named [Jixian]. He could tell whether men would live or die, survive or perish, be fortunate or unfortunate, live a long time or die young, and he would predict the year, month, week, and day as though he were a god himself. When the people of [Zheng] saw him, they all ran out of his way. (tr. Watson 1968:95) \n\"As soothsayers.\" writes de Groot (1910 6:1195), \"the \"wu\" in ancient China no doubt held a place of great importance.\"\n\nSinological controversies have arisen over the political importance of \"wu\" 巫 in ancient China. Some scholars (e.g., Eliade 1964 and Chang 1983) believe Chinese \"wu\" used \"techniques of ecstasy\" like shamans elsewhere; others (e.g., Keightley 1983) believe \"wu\" were \"ritual bureaucrats\" or \"moral metaphysicians\" who did not engage in shamanistic practices.\n\nChen Mengjia wrote a seminal article (1936) that proposed Shang kings were \"wu\"-shamans.\nIn the oracle bone inscriptions are often encountered inscriptions stating that the king divined or that the king inquired in connections with wind- or rain-storms, rituals, conquests, or hunts. There are also statements that \"the king made the prognostication that …,\" pertaining to weather, the border regions, or misfortunes and diseases; the only prognosticator ever recorded in the oracle bone inscriptions was the king ... There are, in addition, inscriptions describing the king dancing to pray for rain and the king prognosticating about a dream. All of these were activities of both king and shaman, which means in effect that the king was a shaman. (1936:535, tr. Chang 1983:46-47) \nChen's shaman-king hypothesis was supported by Kwang-chih Chang who cited the \"Guoyu\" story about Shao Hao severing heaven-earth communication (above).\nThis myth is the most important textual reference to shamanism in ancient China, and it provides the crucial clue to understanding the central role of shamanism in ancient Chinese politics. Heaven is where all the wisdom of human affairs lies. … Access to that wisdom was, of course, requisite for political authority. In the past, \"everybody\" had had that access through the shamans. Since heaven had been severed from earth, only those who controlled that access had the wisdom – hence the authority – to rule. Shamans, therefore, were a crucial part of every state court; in fact, scholars of ancient China agree that the king himself was actually head shaman. (1983:45) \nSome modern scholars disagree. For instance, Boileau (2002:350) calls Chen's hypothesis \"somewhat antiquated being based more on an a priori approach than on history\" and says,\nIn the case of the relationship between \"wu\" and \"wang\" [king], Chen Mengjia did not pay sufficient attention to what the king was able to do as a king, that is to say, to the parts of the king's activities in which the \"wu\" was not involved, for example, political leadership as such, or warfare. The process of recognition must also be taken into account: it is probable that the \"wu\" was chosen or acknowledged as such according to different criteria to those adopted for the king. Chen's concept of the king as the head \"wu\" was influenced by Frazer's theories about the origin of political power: for Frazer the king was originally a powerful sorcerer. (2002:351) \n\nThe \"Shujing\" \"Classic of History\" lists Wu Xian 巫咸 and Wu Xian 巫賢 as capable administrators of the Shang royal household. The Duke of Zhou tells Prince Shao 召 that:\nI have heard that of ancient time, when King Tang had received the favoring decree, he had with him Yi Yin, making his virtue like that of great Heaven. Tai Jia, again, had Bao Heng. Tai Wu had Yi Zhi and Chen Hu, through whom his virtue was made to affect God; he had also [巫咸] Wu Xian, who regulated the royal house; Zu Yi had [巫賢] Wu Xian. Wu Ding had Gan Pan. These ministers carried out their principles and effected their arrangements, preserving and regulating the empire of [Shang], so that, while its ceremonies lasted, those sovereigns, though deceased, were assessors to Heaven, while it extended over many years. (tr. Legge 1865:206, n.b., names standardized to pinyin) \nAccording to Boileau,\nIn some texts, Wu Xian senior is described as being in charge of the divination using [\"shi\" 筮] achilea. He was apparently made a high god in the kingdom of Qin 秦 during the Warring States period. The Tang subcommentary interprets the character \"wu\" of Wu Xian father and son as being a cognomen, the name of the clan from which the two Xian came. It is possible that in fact the text referred to two Shang ministers, father and son, coming from the same eponymous territory \"wu\". Perhaps, later, the name (\"wu\" 巫) of these two ministers has been confused with the character \"wu\" (巫) as employed in other received texts. (2002:358) \n\n\"Wu\"-shamans participated in court scandals and dynastic rivalries under Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87 BCE), particularly regarding the crime of \"wugu\" 巫蠱 (with \"gu\" \"venom-based poison\") \"sorcery; casting harmful spells\". In 130 BCE, Empress Chen Jiao was convicted of using shamans from Yue to conduct \"wugu\" magic. She \"was dismissed from her position and a total of 300 persons who were involved in the case were executed\" (tr. Loewe 1970:169), their heads were cut off and exposed on stakes. In 91 BCE, an attempted coup against crown prince Liu Ju involved accusations of practicing \"wugu\", and subsequently \"no less than nine long months of bloody terrorism, ending in a tremendous slaughter, cost some tens of thousands their lives!\" (tr. Groot 1910 5:836).\n\nEver since Emperor Wu of Han established Confucianism as the state religion, the ruling classes have shown increasing prejudice against shamanism (de Groot 1910:1233-42, Waley 1955:11-12). Some modern writers view the traditional Confucianist disdain for female shamans as sexism. Schafer wrote:\nIn the opinion of the writer, the Chou ruling class was particularly hostile to women in government, and regarded the ancient fertility rites as impure. This anti-female tendency was even more marked in the state of Lu, where Confucius approved of the official rain-ceremony in which men alone participated. There was, within ancient China, a heterogeneity of culture areas, with female shamans favored in some, males in others. The \"licentiousness\" of the ceremonies of such a state as Cheng (doubtless preserving the ancient Shang traditions and customs) was a byword among Confucian moralists. Confucius' state seems on the other hand to have taken the \"respectable\" attitude that the sexes should not mingle in the dance, and that men were the legitimate performers of the fertility rites. The general practice of the later Chou period, or at least the semi-idealized picture given of the rites of that time in such books as the \"Chou li\", apparently prescribed a division of magical functions between men and women. The former generally play the role of exorcists, the latter of petitioners. This is probably related to the metaphysical belief that women, embodying the principle \"yin\", were akin to the spirits, whereas men, exemplifying the element \"yang\", were naturally hostile to them. (1951:158) \nAccepting the tradition that Chinese shamans were women (i.e., \"wu\" 巫 \"shamaness\" as opposed to \"xi\" 覡 \"shaman\"), Kagan believes:\nOne of the main themes in Chinese history is the unsuccessful attempt by the male Confucian orthodoxy to strip women of their public and sacred powers and to limit them to a role of service ... Confucianists reasserted daily their claim to power and authority through the promotion of the phallic ancestor cult which denied women religious representation and excluded them from the governmental examination system which was the path to office, prestige, and status. (1980:3-4) \nIn addition, Unschuld (1980:125-128) refers to a \"Confucian medicine\" based upon systematic correspondences and the idea that illnesses are caused by excesses (rather than demons).\n\nThe \"Zhouli\" provides detailed information about the roles of \"wu\"-shamans. It lists (Falkenhausen 1995:282), \"Spirit Mediums as officials on the payroll of the Zhou Ministry of Rites (\"Liguan\" 禮官, or Ministry of Spring, \"Chun guan\" 春官).\" This text differentiates three offices: the Siwu 司巫 \"Manager/Director of Shamans\", Nanwu 男巫 \"Male Shamans\", and \"Nüwu\" 女巫 \"Female Shamans\".\n\nThe managerial Siwu, who was of \"Shi\" 士 \"Gentleman; Yeoman\" feudal rank, yet was not a \"wu\", supervised \"the many \"wu\"\".\nThe Managers of the Spirit Mediums are in charge of the policies and orders issued to the many Spirit Mediums. When the country suffers a great drought, they lead the Spirit Mediums in dancing the rain-making ritual (\"yu\" 雩). When the country suffers a great calamity, they lead the Spirit Mediums in enacting the long-standing practices of Spirit Mediums (\"wuheng\" 巫恆). At official sacrifices, they [handle] the ancestral tablets in their receptacles, the cloth on which the spirits walk, and the box containing the reeds [for presenting the sacrificial foodstuffs]. In all official sacrificial services, they guard the place where the offerings are buried. In all funerary services, they are in charge of the rituals by which the Spirit Mediums make [the spirits] descend (\"jiang\" 降). (tr. von Falkenhausen 1995:285, cf. de Groot 1910 6:1189-1190) \n\nThe Nanwu and Nüwu have different shamanic specializations, especially regarding inauspicious events like sickness, death, and natural disaster.\nThe Male Spirit Mediums are in charge of the \"si\" 祀 and \"yan\" 衍 Sacrifices to the Deities of the Mountains and Rivers. They receive the honorific titles [of the deities], which they proclaim into the [four] directions, holding reeds. In the winter, in the great temple hall, they offer [or: shoot arrows] without a fixed direction and without counting the number. In the spring, they make proclamations and issue bans so as to remove sickness and disease. When the king offers condolence, they together with the invocators precede him. <br>\nThe Female Mediums are in charge of anointing and ablutions at the exorcisms that are held at regular times throughout the year. When there is a drought or scorching heat, they dance in the rain-making ritual (\"yu\"). When the queen offers condolence, they together with the invocators precede her. In all great calamities of the state, they pray, singing and wailing. (26, tr. von Falkenhausen 1995:290, cf. de Groot 1910 6:1189) \n\nVon Falkenhausen concludes:\nIf we are to generalize from the above enumeration, we find that the Spirit Mediums' principal functions are tied up with averting evil and pollution. They are especially active under circumstances of inauspiciousness and distress. In case of droughts and calamities, they directly address the supernatural powers of Heaven and Earth. Moreover, they are experts in dealing with frightful, dangerous ghosts (the ghosts of the defunct at the time of the funeral, the evil spirits at the exorcism, and the spirits of disease) and harmful substances (unburied dead bodies during visits of condolence and all manner of impure things at the lustration festival). (1995:293)\n\nThe poetry anthology \"Chu Ci\", especially its older pieces, is largely characterized by its shamanic content and style, as explicated to some extent by sinologist David Hawkes.(1985[2011]:\"passim\") Among other points of interest are the intersection of Shamanic traditions and mythology/folk religion in the earlier textual material, such as \"Tianwen\" (possibly based on even more ancient shamanic temple murals), the whole question of the interpretation of the 11 verses of the \"Jiu Ge\" (\"Nine Songs\") as the libretto of a shamanic dramatic performance, the motif of shamanic spirit flight from \"Li Sao\" through subsequent pieces, the evidence of possible regional variations in wu shamanism between Chu, Wei, Qi, and other states (or shamanic colleges associated with those regions), and the suggestion that some of the newer textual material was modified to please Han Wudi, by Liu An, the Prince of Huainan, or his circle. The \"Chu Ci\" contents have traditionally been chronologically divided into an older, pre-Han dynasty group, and those written during the Han Dynasty. Of the traditionally-considered to be the older works (omitting the mostly prose narratives, \"Bu Ju\" and \"Yu Fu\") David Hawkes considers the following sections to be \"functional, explicitly shamanistic\": \"Jiu Ge\", \"Tian Wen\", and the two shamanic summons for the soul, \"The Great Summons\" and \"Summons of the Soul\".(1985[2011]:38) Regarding the other, older pieces he considers that \"shamanism, if there is any\" to be an incidental poetic device, particularly in the form of descriptions of the shamanic spirit journey.\n\nThe mainstream of Chinese literacy and literature is associated with the shell and bone oracular inscriptions from recovered archeological artifacts from the Shang dynasty and with the literary works of the Western Zhou dynasty, which include the classic Confucian works. Both are associated with the northern Chinese areas. South of the traditional Shang and Zhou areas was the land (and water) of Chu. Politically and to some extent culturally distinct from the Zhou dynasty and its later 6 devolved hegemonic states, Chu was the original source and inspiration for the poems anthologized during the Han dynasty under the title \"Chu Ci\", literally meaning something like \"the literary material of Chu\".(Hawkes:16-17 and 28-29) Despite the tendency of Confucian-oriented government officials to suppress wu shamanic beliefs and practice, in the general area of Chinese culture, the force of colonial conservatism and the poetic voice of Qu Yuan and other poets combined to contribute an established literary tradition heavily influenced by wu shamanism to posterity.(Hawkes:19-20) Shamanic practices as described anthropologically are generally paralleled by descriptions of wu practices as found in the \"Chu Ci\", and in Chinese mythology more generally.(Hawkes:42-47)\n\nThe signature poem of the \"Chu Ci\" is the poem \"Li Sao\". By China's \"first poet\", Qu Yuan, a major literary device of the poem is the shamanic spirit journey. \"Yuan You\", literally \"The Far-off Journey\" features shamanic spirit flight as a literary device, as does \"Jiu Bian\", as part of its climactic ending. In the \"Li Sao\", two individual shaman are specified, Ling Fen (靈氛) and Wu Xian (巫咸).(Hawkes:45, note 9) This Wu Xian may or may not be the same as the (one or more) historical person(s) named Wu Xian. Hawkes suggests an equation of the word \"ling\" in the Chu dialect with the word \"wu\".(46 and 84)\n\nThe \"Heavenly Questions\" (literally \"Questioning Heaven\") is one of the ancient repositories of Chinese myth and a major cultural legacy. Propounded as a series of questions, the poem provides incite and provokes questions about the role of wu shaman practitioners in society and history.\n\nThe \"Jiu Ge\" may be read as the lyrical preservation of a shamanic dramatic performance. Apparently typical of at least one variety of shamanism of the Chu area of the Yangzi River basin, the text exhibits a marked degree of eroticism in connection with shamanic invocations.\n\nSummoning the soul (\"hun\") of the possibly dead was a feature of ancient culture. The 2 \"Chu Ci\" pieces of this type may be authentic transcriptions of such a process.\n\nVarious individual wu shaman are alluded to in the \"Chu Ci\". In some cases the binomial nomenclature is unclear, referring perhaps to one or two persons; for example, in the case of Peng Xian, who appears likely to represent Wu Peng and Wu Xian,(Hawkes:70 and 84-86) which is a common type of morphological construction in Classical Chinese poetry. David Hawkes refers to some wu shaman as \"Shaman Ancestors\". Additionally, the distinction between humans and transcendent divinities tends not to be explicit in the received \"Chu Ci\" text. In some cases, the individual wu shaman are known from other sources, such as the \"Shanhaijing\" (\"Classic of Mountains and Seas\"). The name of some individual shaman includes \"Wu\" (巫) in the normal position of the family surname, for example, in the case of Wu Yang (巫陽, \"Shaman Bright\"). Wu Yang is the major speaker in \"Zhao Hun\"/\"Summons for the Soul\". He also appears in \"Shanhaijing\" together with Wu Peng (巫彭): 6 wu shaman are depicted together reviving a corpse, with Wu Peng holding the Herb of Immortality.(Hawkes:45 and 230-231)\n\nThe ancient Chinese traditions of \"wu\"-shamans continue in the contemporary cultures of China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Popular practices include clairvoyance, fortune telling, exorcism, invocation, and prayer.\n\nScholars have studied many aspects of modern \"wu\". De Groot (1910 6:1243-1268) provided descriptions and pictures of hereditary shamans in Fujian, called \"saigong\" (pinyin \"shigong\") 師公. Paper (1999) analyzed \"tongji\" mediumistic activities in the Taiwanese village of Bao'an 保安. Noll (2004) documented Chuonnasuan (1927–2000), the last shaman of the Oroqen in northeast China.\n\nJordan Paper summarizes the present-day shaman's religious significance.\nMediums, frequently associated with local temples … are ubiquitous aspects of popular Chinese religion. They are (or at least were into the mid-twentieth century) common from far north in Manchuria to the extreme south of Hainan and Guangtung, and from the eastern island of Taiwan to Tibet in China's far west.
