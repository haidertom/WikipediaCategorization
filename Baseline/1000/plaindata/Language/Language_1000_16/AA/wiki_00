They are different from both constructed languages and formal languages in that they have not been consciously devised by an individual or group but are the result of (distributed) conventionalisation processes, much like natural languages. Opposed to the idea of a central \"designer\", the field of artificial language evolution in which artificial languages are studied can be regarded as a sub-part of the more general cultural evolution studies.\n\nThe idea of creation of artificial language arose in 17th and 18th century as a result of gradually decreasing international role of Latin. The initial schemes ere mainly aimed at the development of a rational language free from inconsistence of living language and based on classification of concepts. The material of living languages also appears later.\n\nThe lack of empirical evidence in the field of evolutionary linguistics has led many researchers to adopt computer simulations as a means to investigate the ways in which artificial agents can self-organize languages with natural-like properties. This research is based on the hypothesis that natural language is a complex adaptive system that emerges through interactions between individuals and continues to evolve in order to remain adapted to the needs and capabilities of its users. By explicitly building all assumptions into computer simulations, this strand of research strives to experimentally investigate the dynamics underlying language change as well as questions regarding the origin of language under controlled conditions.\n\nDue to its success the paradigm has also been extended to investigate the emergence of new languages in psychological experiments with humans, leading up to the new paradigm of experimental semiotics.\n\nBecause the focus of the investigations lies on the conventionalisation dynamics and higher-level properties of the resulting languages rather than specific details of the conventions, artificially evolved languages are typically not documented or re-used outside the single experiment trial or simulation run in which they emerge. In fact, the limited size and short-lived nature of artificial languages are probably the only things that sets them apart from \"natural\" languages, since \"all\" languages are artificial insofar as they are conventional (see also Constructed language#Planned, constructed, artificial).\n\nArtificial languages have been used in research in developmental psycholinguistics. Because researchers have a great deal of control over artificial languages, they have used these languages in statistical language acquisition studies, in which it can be helpful to control the linguistic patterns heard by infants.\n\n"}
{"id": "34416580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34416580", "title": "Backchannel (linguistics)", "text": "Backchannel (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, backchannels are listener responses at a point in time of a conversation where another person is the primary speaker. Backchannels can be both verbal and non-verbal in nature, and are frequently phatic expressions, primarily serving a social or meta-conversational purpose, rather than involving substantial two-way communication.\n\nThe term was coined by Victor Yngve in 1970, in the following passage: \"In fact, both the person who has the turn and his partner are simultaneously engaged in both speaking and listening. This is because of the existence of what I call the back channel, over which the person who has the turn receives short messages such as 'yes' and 'uh-huh' without relinquishing the turn.\"\n\nThe term \"backchannel\" was designed to imply that there are two channels of communication operating simultaneously during a conversation. The predominant channel is that of the speaker who directs primary speech flow. The secondary channel of communication (or backchannel) is that of the listener which functions to provide \"continuers\" or \"assessments\", defining a listener's comprehension and/or interest. Recent research, which can be seen below, has also suggested new terms for these two functions. They have proposed the term \"generic\" in place of \"continuers\" and \"specific\" in place of \"assessments\".\n\nBackchannel communication is present in all cultures and languages, though frequency and use may vary. Confusion or distraction can occur during an intercultural encounter if participants from both parties are not accustomed to the same backchannel norms.\n\nDue to research development in recent years, backchannel responses have been expanded to include sentence completions, requests for clarification, brief statements, and non-verbal responses and now fall into three categories: non-lexical, phrasal, and substantive. \n\nA non-lexical backchannel is a vocalized sound that has little or no referential meaning but still verbalizes the listener's attention, and that frequently co-occurs with gestures. In English, sounds like \"uh-huh\" and \"hmm\" serve this role. Non-lexical backchannels generally come from a limited set of sounds not otherwise widely used in contentful conversational speech; as a result, they can be used to express support, surprise, or a need for clarification at the same time as someone else's conversational turn without causing confusion or interference.\n\nEnglish allows for the reduplication, or repetition, of syllables within a non-lexical backchannel, such as in responses like \"uh-huh\", \"mm-hm\", or \"um-hm\", as well as for single-syllable backchanneling. In a study examining the use of two-syllable backchannels that focused on \"mm\" and \"mm-hm\", Gardner found that the two tokens are generally not identical in function, with \"mm\" being used more productively as a continuer, a weak acknowledgment token, and a weak assessment marker. In contrast, \"mm-hm\" is generally used as a backchannel to signal that the speaker is yielding their conversational turn and allowing the other speaker to maintain control of the conversational floor.\n\nPhrasal backchannels most commonly assess or acknowledge a speaker's communication with simple words or phrases (for example, \"Really?\" or \"Wow!\" in English). Substantive backchannels consist of more substantial turn-taking by the listener and usually manifest as asking for clarification or repetitions.\n\nOne of the conversational functions of phrasal backchannels is to assess or appraise a previous utterance. Goodwin argues that this is the case for the phrasal backchannel \"oh wow\", where use of the backchannel requires a specific conversational context where something unexpected or surprising was said. Similarly, more substantive backchannels such as \"oh come on, are you serious?\" require a context where the speaker is responding to something exasperating or frustrating. In both of these cases, Goodwin argues that the backchannels focus only on addressing some aspect of the immediately proceeding utterance rather than the larger conversation itself. As a result, they have a broad conversational distribution, appearing both in the middle of extended talk as well as at the end of longer conversational turns.\n\nMore recent research has pushed back on the notion of backchannels, in which the listener's role is merely to receive information provided by the speaker. Bavelas, Coates, and Johnson put forth evidence that listeners' responses help shape the content of the speaker. They grouped acknowledgment tokens into two categories: generic and specific. Generic responses could be considered back channels and would include \"mm hm\" and \"yeah\", while specific responses would involve a reaction to the given context. Examples might include \"Oh!\" or a facial display of concern.\n\nThey transcribed students telling a fellow participant about a close call experience that they had had. With one group of participants, they had the listener perform another task to distract them from the story being told. The researchers asked independent reviewers to code the verbal and visual responses of the narration events as generic or specific. They also asked other independent reviewers to gauge the quality of the narration in each case.\n\nThey concluded that the responses from the distracted listeners included significantly fewer specific responses than from the undistracted listeners. In addition, they found that the quality of the narration was dramatically lower when the listener was distracted. Their basic contention was that listeners are co-narrators and help the storyteller in his or her narration. In other words, a storyteller tells a better story with an audience that is engaged than one that is not.\n\nTolins and Foxtree have also published research demonstrating how backchannel communication influences speakers. Their research was specifically looking at how speakers respond to generic responses compared to specific responses.\n"}

Its precise meaning has varied by location and over time.\n\nThe word \"Bannwald\" is a combination of \"Bann\" (English \"ban\") and \"Wald\" (English \"forest\" or \"wood\"). \"Bann\" has many historical meanings in German, one of which refers to an area controlled by and set aside for the use of a landowner in medieval times (comparable to the forests subject to the royal ban in Anglo-Saxon England). A \"Bannwald\" was a forest where a nobleman had the prerogative to make use of it and the creatures in it. A royal ban forest existed at Dreieich (from the heathen worship of three oaks) for a very long period, and its charter was one of the most primitive. The (obsolete) French literal equivalent (also: \"banbois\") is still the toponym of local forests in areas which once were part of the former Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIn modern times, the term \"Bannwald\" is, in a certain sense, an archaic word which has been revived as a specific term for forests under various types of protection.\n\nThe term is generally used with a rather broad meaning:\n\nDepending on the respective forest act, there may be an overlapping or difference in meaning between the terms \"banned forest\" and \"protection forest\".\n\nSilvicultural use is still permitted and in the case of protection forests it is even welcome (except in Baden-Württemberg). However, it is prohibited in the core zones of nature reserves. \"Forestal exclusion zones\" (temporarily restricted forest areas) subject to hunting prohibitions or restrictions, or temporary \"hunting grounds\" or \"game preserves\" (areas closed during a hunting season or breeding and upbringing season) are not classified as banned forests.\n\nThe term \"Bann\" dates back to the Middle Ages. At that time a \"Bannwald\" referred to a forest area where the respective territorial lord had the exclusive right to use the forest (\"forest privilege\"). Originally this applied only to hunting (\"hunting privilege\") and fishing, however, later it was extended to the complete use of the forest. In the mountain valleys of Switzerland banned forests had the function to protect against avalanches and also to provide sufficient timber for fencing torrents. Corresponding decrees from the 14th century deal with protection against avalanches, rockfalls and flooding. The concept of \"Bannwald\" plays an important part in Ludwig Ganghofer's novel \"Die Martinsklause\" in which a tyrannical administrator in Berchtesgaden claims excessive privileges.\n\n→ \"see also: \"\n\nIn Baden-Württemberg, there are \"Bannwälder Totalreservate\", fully protected reserves where any use is strictly prohibited by law. In other federal states of Germany such \"total reserves\" are known under different names. Due to their structural diversity in living trees and dry wood banned forests are refugia for many endangered species of animals, plants, and mushrooms.\n\nIn Bavaria \"forest and its existence and size is extremely essential in particular in densely populated and sparsely wooded areas and consequently its size and structure must be preserved as it is of extraordinary importance for the climate, water resources or for air purification\" and may be classified as banned forest.\"\n\nIn Hesse a \"Bannwald\" is a forest which because of its location, size and extraordinary importance for hydrological balance, climate and air purification has to be preserved and may be cut only in exceptional cases.\n\nIn Austria, a \"Bannwald\" is a stricter form of a protection forest.\n\nThe Swiss Forestry Act of 1874 uses the term, Schutzwald (protection forest), rather than \"Bannwald\".\n\n\n\n"}

These rate abnormalities further are manifest in one or more of the following symptoms: (a) an excessive number of disfluencies, the majority of which are not typical of people with stuttering; (b) the frequent placement of pauses and use of prosodic patterns that do not conform to syntactic and semantic constraints; and (c) inappropriate (usually excessive) degrees of coarticulation among sounds, especially in multisyllabic words\".\n\nStuttering is often misapplied as a common term referring to any dysfluency. It is also often incorrectly applied to normal dysfluency rather than dysfluency from a disorder. Cluttered speech is exhibited by normal speakers, and is often referred to as stuttering. This is especially true when the speaker is nervous, where nervous speech more closely resembles cluttering than stuttering.\n\nCluttering is sometimes confused with stuttering. Both communication disorders break the normal flow of speech, but they are distinct. A stutterer has a coherent pattern of thoughts, but may have a difficult time vocally expressing those thoughts; in contrast, a clutterer has no problem putting thoughts into words, but those thoughts become disorganized during speaking. Cluttering affects not only speech, but also thought patterns, writing, typing, and conversation.\n\nStutterers are usually dysfluent on initial sounds, when beginning to speak, and become more fluent towards the ends of utterances. In contrast, clutterers are most clear at the start of utterances, but their speaking rate increases and intelligibility decreases towards the end of utterances.\n\nStuttering is characterized by struggle behavior, such as overtense speech production muscles. Cluttering, in contrast, is effortless. Cluttering is also characterized by slurred speech, especially dropped or distorted /r/ and /l/ sounds; and monotone speech that starts loud and trails off into a murmur.\n\nA clutterer described the feeling associated with a clutter as:\nCluttering can often be confused with language delay, language disorder, learning disabilities, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Clutterers often have reading and writing disabilities, especially sprawling, disorderly handwriting, which poorly integrate ideas and space.\n\nBecause clutterers have poor awareness of their disorder, they may be indifferent or even hostile to speech-language pathologists. Delayed auditory feedback (DAF) is usually used to produce a more deliberate, exaggerated oral-motor response pattern. Other treatment components include improving narrative structure with story-telling picture books, turn-taking practice, pausing practice, and language therapy.\n\nBattaros was a legendary Libyan king who spoke quickly and in a disorderly fashion. Others who spoke as he did were said to suffer from \"battarismus\". This is the earliest record of the speech disorder of cluttering.\n\nIn the 1960s, cluttering was called \"tachyphemia\", a word derived from the Greek for \"fast speech\". This word is no longer used to describe cluttering because fast speech is not a required element of cluttering.\n\nDeso Weiss described cluttering as the outward manifestation of a \"central language imbalance\".\n\nThe First World Conference on Cluttering was held in May 2007 in Razlog, Bulgaria. It had over 60 participants from North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nWeiss claimed that Battaros, Demosthenes, Pericles, Justinian, Otto von Bismarck, and Winston Churchill were clutterers. He says about these people, \"Each of these contributors to world history viewed his world holistically, and was not deflected by exaggerated attention to small details. Perhaps then, they excelled because of, rather than in spite of, their \n[cluttering].\"\n\n\n\n"}

In contrast to selective mutism, it was thought someone who was electively mute may not speak in any situation, as is usually shown in books and movies. Elective mutism was often attributed to defiance or the effect of trauma. Those who are able to speak freely in some situations but not in others are now better described by selective mutism.\n\nIn 1877, a German physician named the disorder \"aphasia voluntaria\" to describe children who were able to speak normally but often \"refused\" to.\n\nIn 1980, a study by Torey Hayden identified four \"subtypes\" of Elective Mutism:\n\nThe \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM), first published in 1952, first included Elective Mutism in its third edition, published in 1980. Elective mutism was described as \"a continuous refusal to speak in almost all social situations\" despite normal ability to speak. While \"excessive shyness\" and other anxiety-related traits were listed as associated features, predisposing factors included \"maternal overprotection\", mental retardation, and trauma. Elective mutism in the third edition revised (DSM III-R) is described similarly as in the third edition except for specifying that the disorder is \"not\" related to social anxiety disorder.\n\nIn 1994, the fourth edition of the DSM reflected the name change to selective mutism and redefined the disorder.\n\nThough elective mutism is no longer recognized by most psychiatrists, it is a popular character element or plot point in stories and movies. Many characters choose to stop speaking, for various reasons. Even more commonly, there are also characters who stop speaking after a traumatic incident. In both these cases, often, and almost always in the second, the character is silent in all situations. This is therefore not selective mutism, and anxiety is very rarely involved. Selective mutism itself is almost nonexistent in pop culture.\n\nThe following are a few references to stories including a character who does not speak despite being physically able to.\n\n"}

It is the largest Byzantine lexicon and draws on many earlier grammatical, lexical and rhetorical works. Its main sources were two previous \"etymologica\", the so-called \"Etymologicum Genuinum\" and the \"Etymologicum Gudianum\". Other sources include Stephanus of Byzantium, the \"Epitome\" of Diogenianus, the so-called \"Lexicon\" Αἱμωδεῖν (\"Haimōdeῖn\"), Eulogius’ Ἀπορίαι καὶ λύσεις (\"Ἀporίai kaὶ lύseis\"), George Choeroboscus’ \"Epimerismi ad Psalmos\", the \"Etymologicon\" of Orion of Thebes, and collections of \"scholia\".

{"id": "58617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58617", "title": "Fact", "text": "Fact\n\nA fact is something that is consistent with objective reality or that can be proven with evidence. The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability — that is whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to experience. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by experiments or other means.\n\nThe word \"fact\" derives from the Latin \"factum\", and was first used in English with the same meaning: \"a thing done or performed\" a meaning now obsolete. The common usage of \"something that has really occurred or is the case\" dates from the middle of the sixteenth century.\n\nFact is sometimes used synonymously with \"truth\", as distinct from opinions, falsehoods, or matters of taste. This use is found in such phrases as, \"It is a fact that the cup is blue\" or \"Matter of fact\", and \"... not history, nor fact, but imagination.\" Filmmaker Werner Herzog distinguishes between the two, claiming that \"Fact creates norms, and truth illumination.\"\n\nFact also indicates a \"matter under discussion\" deemed to be true or correct, such as to emphasize a point or prove a disputed issue; (e.g., \"... the \"fact\" of the matter is ...\").\n\nAlternatively, \"fact\" may also indicate an \"allegation or stipulation\" of something that may or may not be a \"true fact\", (e.g., \"the author's facts are not trustworthy\"). This alternate usage, although contested by some, has a long history in standard English.\n\nFact may also indicate findings derived through a \"process of evaluation\", including review of testimony, direct observation, or otherwise; as distinguishable from matters of inference or speculation. This use is reflected in the terms \"fact-find\" and \"fact-finder\" (e.g., \"set up a fact-finding commission\").\n\nFacts may be checked by reason, experiment, personal experience, or may be argued from authority. Roger Bacon wrote \"If in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error, it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics.\"\n\nIn philosophy, the concept \"fact\" is considered in epistemology and ontology. Questions of objectivity and truth are closely associated with questions of fact. A \"fact\" can be defined as something that is the case—that is, a state of affairs.\n\nFacts may be understood as information that makes a true sentence true. Facts may also be understood as those things to which a true sentence refers. The statement \"Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system\" is \"about\" the fact Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.\n\nPascal Engel's version of the correspondence theory of truth explains that what makes a sentence true is that it \"corresponds\" to a fact.\nThis theory presupposes the existence of an objective world.\n\nThe Slingshot argument claims to show that all true statements stand for the same thing - the truth value \"true\". If this argument holds, and facts are taken to be what true statements stand for, then we reach the counter-intuitive conclusion that there is only one fact - \"the truth\".\n\nAny non-trivial true statement about reality is necessarily an abstraction composed of a complex of objects and properties or relations. For example, the fact described by the true statement \"Paris is the capital city of France\" implies that there is such a place as Paris, there is such a place as France, there are such things as capital cities, as well as that France has a government, that the government of France has the power to define its capital city, and that the French government has chosen Paris to be the capital, that there is such a thing as a \"place\" or a \"government\", and so on. The verifiable accuracy of all of these assertions, if facts themselves, may coincide to create the fact that Paris is the capital of France.\n\nDifficulties arise, however, in attempting to identify the constituent parts of negative, modal, disjunctive, or moral facts.\n\nMoral philosophers since David Hume have debated whether values are objective, and thus factual. In \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" Hume pointed out there is no obvious way for a series of statements about what \"ought\" to be the case to be derived from a series of statements of what \"is\" the case. Those who insist there is a logical gulf between facts and values, such that it is fallacious to attempt to derive values from facts, include G. E. Moore, who called attempting to do so the naturalistic fallacy.\n\nFactuality—what has occurred—can also be contrasted with counterfactuality:\nwhat \"might have\" occurred, but did not. A counterfactual conditional or subjunctive conditional is a conditional (or \"if-then\") statement indicating what \"would be\" the case if events had been other than they were. For example, \"If Alexander had lived, his empire would have been greater than Rome.\" This contrasts with an indicative conditional, which indicates what \"is\" (in fact) the case if its antecedent \"is\" (in fact) true—for example, \"If you drink this, it will make you well.\"\n\nSuch sentences are important to modal logic, especially since the development of possible world semantics.\n\nIn science, a \"fact\" is a repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experimentation or other means), also called empirical evidence. Facts are central to building scientific theories. Various forms of observation and measurement lead to fundamental questions about the scientific method, and the scope and validity of scientific reasoning.\n\nIn the most basic sense, a scientific \"fact\" is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a \"hypothesis\" or \"theory\", which is intended to explain or interpret facts.\n\nVarious scholars have offered significant refinements to this basic formulation. Scientists are careful to distinguish between: 1) \"states of affairs\" in the external world and 2) \"assertions\" of fact that may be considered relevant in scientific analysis. The term is used in both senses in the philosophy of science.\n\nScholars and clinical researchers in both the social and natural sciences have written about numerous questions and theories that arise in the attempt to clarify the fundamental nature of scientific fact. Pertinent issues raised by this inquiry include:\n\nConsistent with the idea of confirmation holism, some scholars assert \"fact\" to be necessarily \"theory-laden\" to some degree. Thomas Kuhn points out that knowing what facts to measure, and how to measure them, requires the use of other theories. For example, the age of fossils is based on radiometric dating, which is justified by reasoning that radioactive decay follows a Poisson process rather than a Bernoulli process. Similarly, Percy Williams Bridgman is credited with the methodological position known as operationalism, which asserts that all observations are not only influenced, but necessarily defined by the means and assumptions used to measure them.\n\nApart from the fundamental inquiry into the nature of scientific fact, there remain the practical and social considerations of how fact is investigated, established, and substantiated through the proper application of the scientific method. Scientific facts are generally believed independent of the observer: no matter who performs a scientific experiment, all observers agree on the outcome.\nIn addition to these considerations, there are the social and institutional measures, such as peer review and accreditation, that are intended to promote \"factual accuracy\" (among other interests) in scientific study.\n\nA common rhetorical cliché states, \"History is written by the winners.\" This phrase suggests but does not examine the use of facts in the writing of history.\n\nE. H. Carr in his 1961 volume \"What is History?\" argues that the inherent biases from the gathering of facts makes the objective truth of any historical perspective idealistic and impossible. Facts are, \"like fish in the Ocean,\" of which we may only happen to catch a few, only an indication of what is below the surface. Even a dragnet cannot tell us for certain what it would be like to live below the Ocean's surface. Even if we do not discard any facts (or fish) presented, we will always miss the majority; the site of our fishing, the methods undertaken, the weather and even luck play a vital role in what we will catch. Additionally, the composition of history is inevitably made up by the compilation of many different biases of fact finding - all compounded over time. He concludes that for a historian to attempt a more objective method, one must accept that history can only aspire to a conversation of the present with the past - and that one's methods of fact gathering should be openly examined. Historical truth and facts therefore change over time, and reflect only the present consensus (if that).\n\nIn most common law jurisdictions, the general concept and analysis of fact reflects fundamental principles of jurisprudence, and is supported by several well-established standards. Matters of fact have various formal definitions under common law jurisdictions.\n\nThese include:\n\n\n\nA party to a civil suit generally must clearly state all relevant allegations of fact that form the basis of a claim. The requisite level of precision and particularity of these allegations varies, depending on the rules of civil procedure and jurisdiction. Parties who face uncertainties regarding facts and circumstances attendant to their side in a dispute may sometimes invoke alternative pleading. In this situation, a party may plead separate sets of facts that (when considered together) may be contradictory or mutually exclusive. This (seemingly) logically-inconsistent presentation of facts may be necessary as a safeguard against contingencies (such as \"res judicata\") that would otherwise preclude presenting a claim or defense that depends on a particular interpretation of the underlying facts.\n\n"}
{"id": "47665171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47665171", "title": "Feminist language reform", "text": "Feminist language reform\n\nFeminist language reform or feminist language planning refers to the effort, often of political and grassroots movements, to change how language is used to gender people, activities and ideas on an individual and societal level. This initiative has been adopted in countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Australia, and has been tentatively linked to higher gender equality.\n\nLinguistic activism and feminist authorship stemming from second wave feminism in the 1960s and 70s began to draw attention to gender bias in language, including \"the uncovering of the gendered nature of many linguistic rules and norms\". Scholarship such as Dennis Baron's \"Grammar and Gender\" and Anne Bodine's \"Androcentrism in Prescriptive Grammar\" uncovered historical male regulation to promote male-centric language such as the use of \"he\" as a generic pronoun.\n\nExposition and analysis of sexism in language through a grassroots feminist linguistics movement continued throughout the 80's and 90's, including study across languages and speech communities such as Germany and France. Study and documentation of gendered language has since spread to cover over 30 languages.\n\nFeminist language planning has more recently been instituted centrally in countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Australia, with mixed results.\n\nSweden have made strides towards shifting their language to fit a less misogynistic society. In the Swedish language, there has never been a word for the female genitalia or even a translation of the word “vagina”, even though the word \"snopp\" translates to “penis” and has been used as such since the 1960s. Through history, there have been many slang terms used for the woman’s genitalia, including words such as \"fitta\" translated to “cunt”, \"där nere\" translated to “down-there”, and even \"mus\" translated to “mouse”. In the 1990s, Swedish media started to bring the absence of such a word to light. It wasn’t until the early 2000s did the feminists and activists start using the word \"snippa\" to be identified with the female genitalia. \"Snippa\"’s origins can be traced back to many different Swedish dialects. It’s popular definition “refers to something small and/or narrow, for example a small pike or a narrow boat”. In regards to genitalia, “it might have been used to refer to female genitalia of cows and pigs in the early twentieth century”. Since the popularization of using the word \"Snippa,\" the Swedish Academy added the word to the 2006 Swedish Language Dictionary.\n\nSome language reformers directly work with identifying and changing sexist undertones and patriarchal vocabulary through a method called “linguistic disruption”. An example: In the United States, the word “herstory” became popularized “to refer to history which is not only about men”. Sweden has also showed efforts in language planning regarding changing misogynistic undertones in their vocabulary. The Swedish Association for Sexuality Education has promoted the word \"slidkrans\" to replace the word for “hymen”, \"mödomshinna.\" “The new word, \"slidkrans\", is made up of the two parts \"slid\", translating to “vaginal” and \"krans\", translating to “garland”. It lacks the connotations of the ideology of virginity and honour attached to mödomshinna.”\n\nAdditionally, Sweden has also shown efforts in accepting more of a non-gender binary identity by creating the gender-neutral pronoun \"hen,\" which has been used by feminists and the LGBT community. Feminist language reform regarding gender is not of recent efforts. Early feminist language reformists have been fighting the male-dominant approach to language and raising awareness to the public about the gendered structure of the society’s language.\n\nAustralia has been identified as a nation that officially promotes the feminist influence to its public bureaucracy by implementing feminist language reform across many institutions. Since this planned social shift, Australia has seen changes in political and government leadership that aim to interfere with this reform, such as a shift towards a conservative-leaning government. There are shifts that come from such movements that support them as well, such as the gender-neutral pronoun “they” being more widely accepted.\n\nThe ongoing feminist movement acknowledges language as a “powerful instrument of patriarchy”. The goals set for linguistic reform aim to achieve linguistic equality of the sexes. A study of Australian newspapers from 1992 and 1996 found that the word “chairman” was used to describe all people holding the position, including women. This is an example of a linguistic issue that feminist’s seek to reform. Occupational nomenclature reflects gender bias when “professional nomenclature used in employment-related contexts displays bias in favour of men leading to women’s invisibility in this area.” The invisibility of women is a linguistic feminist issue because when encountering sentences predominantly using male pronouns, listeners are more likely to think of men before women and therefore women get overlooked. Positions are gendered to be male and the “continuing, frequent use reflects the fact that far more men than women continue to occupy this position.” This study further investigated and found instances of female professionals being specified as women while men would just be titled with the profession itself, for example “female judge,” “woman engineer,” and “woman politician.”\n\nSwitzerland has attempted to implement feminist language reform both formally and informally. However, changes in Switzerland have proven to be complicated due to the fact that Switzerland is a multilingual country (with the major languages being German, French, and Italian). The Bulletin Suisse de Linguistique Appliquée (Swiss Bulletin of Applied Linguistics) addressed this issue in 2000 when it created a special issue dedicated to the feminization of language in Switzerland. The bulletin attempted to critique language in Switzerland by creating a composite image of all the languages in Switzerland and how they interact with gender.\n\nThe most commonly spoken language in Switzerland is German. German is a gendered language. This has concerned some language activists due to the fact that many important societal position such as judge and professor possess the gender of male and are often referred to as he/him. Activists worry that the gendering of those words discourage women from entering those fields. This facet of the German language is particularly important in Switzerland because it was historically used as a justification to restrict women’s right to vote and pass the bar.\n\nVarious attempts to implement feminist language reform have been undertaken in German speaking Switzerland. The government and other organizations have attempted to implement language feminization in the realms of policy making, teaching, advertising, etc. Language feminization refers to when in writing or talking traditional male words are feminized by either using the feminine variant of the word or adding a feminine suffix. However, these attempts have had only limited success. For example, private Swiss radio and television broadcasts still generally use the generic-masculine form of words.\n\nThe second most commonly spoken language in Switzerland is French which is also a gendered language. The French language raises similar concerns to that of the German language. This is because many nouns (especially those of professions) are gendered. To address these concerns, the Swiss government has created a guide on the non-sexist use of the French language. However, these attempts at change have been met with little success. This is due to the fact that Switzerland has limited influence over the French language. Meanwhile, France and specifically the government backed Académie Française (French Academy) (the French council for matters relating to the French language) has resisted feminist language reform.\n\nThe main focus of Feminist Language Reform is to acknowledge the often unconscious ways that language both silences and emphasizes gender in negative ways. In some languages it is clear with gendered nouns how some words are gendered to associate those words with maleness of femaleness. Feminist Philosophers argue that English, a non gendered language, still has the need for Language Reform.\n\nPrevious language reform attempts to avoid sexist words or phrases were addressed in a symptomatic manner. Often in the workplace, employees were given pamphlets with lists of words to avoid or preferred words to use. Many modern day feminists argue that this is ineffective because it does not address the root of the problem or make the large scale changes to the language that they feel are necessary.\n\nA major part of the theory focuses on when words or phrases make one gender, typically women, subjugated or invisible compared to the other. The most popular examples are the pronoun “he” or the word “man”. Feminist Language Philosophers argue that these words participate in making women invisible by having them being used to refer to men and also women. The fact that the pronouns or words for the male gender can be also used to refer to the female gender shows how maleness is dominant and femaleness is subjugated.\n\nFeminist Language Theory also focuses on when words or phrases emphasize a break in gender norms. Clear examples of this are words like Lady Doctor or Manageress. These are positions of power that are typically held by men. Therefore, when a woman holds them, they need a new title to emphasize their break of social norm. It also goes both ways, with terms like male nurse referring to a man in a typically feminine role. Feminist Language Reform seeks to remove words like this because they help to sustain unhealthy gender norms.\n\nSome modern feminists, like Sergio Bolaños Cuellar, argue that feminist language reforms needs to reverse the generic masculine forms and create a generic feminine form with words like he or man being replaced with she or woman.\n\nCases of feminist language planning have taken a largely sociolinguistic approach in which the goal is to enact social change through the reform of language and language use. This approach to language planning is divided into four stages:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3844882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3844882", "title": "Fuck (film)", "text": "Fuck (film)\n\nFuck is a 2005 American documentary film by director Steve Anderson about the word \"fuck\". The film argues that the word is an integral part of societal discussions about freedom of speech and censorship. It examines the term from perspectives which include art, linguistics, society and comedy, and begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film \"Perversion for Profit\". Scholars and celebrities analyze perceptions of the word from differing perspectives. Journalist Sam Donaldson talks about the versatility of the word, and comedian Billy Connolly states it can be understood despite one's language or location. Musician Alanis Morissette comments that the word contains power because of its taboo nature. The film features the last recorded interview of author Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide. Scholars, including linguist Reinhold Aman, journalism analyst David Shaw and \"Oxford English Dictionary\" editor Jesse Sheidlower, explain the history and evolution of the word. Language professor Geoffrey Nunberg observes that the word's treatment by society reflects changes in our culture during the 20th century.\n\nAnderson was exposed to public conceptions surrounding the word \"fuck\" by comedian George Carlin's monologue \"Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television\". He named the film \"Fuck\" despite anticipating problems with marketing. Animator Bill Plympton provided sequences illustrating key concepts in the film. The documentary was first shown at the AFI Film Festival on November 7, 2005, at ArcLight Hollywood in Hollywood.\n\n\"Fuck\"'s reviews were generally mixed. Film critic A. O. Scott called the documentary a battle between advocates of morality and supporters of freedom of expression. \"The Washington Post\" and the New York \"Daily News\" criticized its length and other reviewers disliked its repetitiveness – the word \"fuck\" is used 857 times in the film. In his 2009 book \"\", law professor Christopher M. Fairman called the movie \"the most important film using 'fuck'\". The American Film Institute said, \"Ultimately, \"Fuck\" is a movie about free speech ... Freedom of expression must extend to words that offend. Love it or hate it, fuck is here to stay.\"\n\n\"Fuck\" begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film \"Perversion for Profit\", followed by a clip from \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" which states that the word can be used as a \"sentence enhancer\". The documentary includes commentary from film and television writers Kevin Smith and Steven Bochco; comedians Janeane Garofalo, Bill Maher, Drew Carey and Billy Connolly; musicians Chuck D, Alanis Morissette and Ice T; political commentators Alan Keyes and Pat Boone; and journalists Michael Medved and Judith Martin. The word \"fuck\" is used 857 times during the film.\nScholarly analysis is provided by \"Maledicta\" publisher Reinhold Aman, journalism analyst David Shaw and \"Oxford English Dictionary\" editor Jesse Sheidlower. Language professor Geoffrey Nunberg says, \"You could think of that [word] as standing in for most of the changes that happened in the 20th century, at least many of the important ones\".\n\nThe film next features author Hunter S. Thompson in his final documented interview. \"Fuck\" later includes archival footage of comedians Lenny Bruce and George Carlin, and analysis of the word's use in popular culture, from \"MASH\" (1970) to \"Scarface\" (1983) and \"Clerks\" (1994). Carlin's 1972 monologue \"Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television\" is excerpted in the film. Journalist Sam Donaldson comments on the versatility of \"fuck\": \"It's one of those all-purpose words.\" Bill Maher comments, \"It's the ultimate bad word\", observing that thanks to Lenny Bruce, comedy clubs have become \"the freest free-speech zone\" in the United States.\n\nConnolly states that \"fuck\" \"sounds exactly like what it is\", noting that the emotional impact of saying \"fuck off\" cannot be translated. He says that if you are in Lhasa airport and someone is fiddling with your luggage, yelling \"fuck off\" will effectively communicate that they should stop and leave. Morissette says, \"The f-word is special. Everybody uses the word 'breakfast', but not everyone feels comfortable using the word 'fuck' so there's an extra power behind it.\" Boone argues for less use of the word, saying that he uses his surname instead. Radio talk show host Dennis Prager says that it is acceptable for youths to hear the word on television and film, but not from their family members. In the film, opponents of the word \"fuck\" use an argument commonly known as \"Think of the children\".\n\n\"Fuck\" observes that the original use of the word is unknown to scholars, noting that its earliest written appearance was in the 1475 poem \"Flen flyys\". It was not, as is often claimed, originally an acronym for \"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\" or \"Fornication Under Consent of the King\". The word has been used by authors including Robert Burns, D. H. Lawrence (in his 1928 \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\") and James Joyce. The film explains that \"fuck\" established its current usage during the First and Second World Wars, and was used by General George S. Patton in a speech to his forces who were about to enter France.\n\n\"Fuck\" states that the first use of the word in a large-studio film was in \"M*A*S*H\" (1970), and it entered the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in 1972. That year, the word was also recorded during the Apollo 16 United States mission to land on the Moon. The film includes a segment from the 1987 film \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\" with actor Steve Martin, in which \"fuck\" is repeated for comedic effect. \"Fuck\" states that the most financially successful live action comedy film to date had the suggestive title of \"Meet the Fockers\" (2004). The director analyzes the uses and connotations of \"fuck\" and the feelings it evokes on several levels. Bruce is quoted as saying, \"If you can't say 'fuck', you can't say 'fuck the government'\". Steve Anderson argues that \"fuck\" is an integral part of societal discussions about freedom of speech and censorship.\n\n\"Fuck\" includes songs with similarly themed titles, including \"Shut Up and Fuck\" by American hard rock band Betty Blowtorch, \"Fucking Fucking Fuck\" by Splatpattern and \"I Love to Say Fuck\" by American horror punk supergroup Murderdolls. Journalist Sam Peczek of \"Culture Wars\" compared the film's music to that in softcore pornography, and observed that the soundtrack was broad in scope and helped accentuate the film's content.\n\nAnderson made his directorial debut in 2003 with the film \"The Big Empty\", starring actors Daryl Hannah and Jon Favreau, and became fascinated by the usage of the word \"fuck\". In an interview with the \"Democrat and Chronicle\", Anderson suggested he cursed a lot more than he used to after the film's production. He decided to research the film's topic due to the word's versatility and his interest in language as a writer. Early exposure by Anderson to public perception of the word \"fuck\" came from \"Class Clown\" by comedian George Carlin, which included his monologue \"Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television\".\n\nThe director explained in an interview that he was fascinated with the word \"fuck\" because of its different uses. He originally proposed the idea of a film about the word in jest, later realizing that the topic could fuel a documentary. \"The Observer\" quoted him as saying that he was entertained by the word \"fuck\", and intrigued with the idea of examining how the word had been incorporated into popular culture. He wanted to analyze why some people were offended by its use and others enjoyed it, noting that the word sharpened debate about taboo language in society.\n\nAnderson explained to the \"Los Angeles Times\" the confusing, forbidden nature of the word \"fuck\" in the face of the increased pervasiveness of euphemisms for it. He commented on its taboo nature and demonstrated how it can be indirectly referred to, so youth understand the reference without using the word itself. In an interview with the \"South China Morning Post\", Anderson said that film directors should fight against censorship, because it can block their true message.\n\nThe director told CanWest News Service that he hoped the documentary would provoke a wider discussion about freedom of speech, sexual slang and its media use. Anderson questioned whether the word should be used on \"NYPD Blue\", and how parents should discuss its use with their children. He emphasized that artists and filmmakers should be free to express their views without censorship, deferring to public opinion on the appropriateness of his documentary's title.\n\nAnderson stated in an interview with IndieWire that freedom of speech was not guaranteed, but a concept requiring discussion and monitoring so it is not lost. He classified the word \"fuck\" as being at the core of discussion about freedom of speech. He acknowledged that there are terms considered by society more vulgar than \"fuck\", but said that this particular word creates controversy and dialogue. Anderson said that its title alone distinguished his documentary from others, in terms of promotional difficulty. During production, \"Fuck\" was known as \"The Untitled F-Word Film\".\n\nIn an interview about the film on his website, Anderson discussed problems he encountered in naming his film \"Fuck\" instead of a censored version of the word. Anderson always wanted to call it \"Fuck\", because it succinctly described the film's contents. There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as \"The New York Times\" and \"Los Angeles Times\" (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in alternative newspapers such as \"LA Weekly\". Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre marquees.\n\nAnderson explained that although the title of his documentary was \"Fuck\", he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as \"Fuck\", including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title. Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep \"Fuck\" as its title.\n\nThe film features animation by American graphic designer and cartoonist Bill Plympton. To illustrate key concepts, \"Fuck\" uses sound bites, music, video clips and archival film footage; Anderson combined excerpts from five television series and twenty-two films in the documentary. The interviews were cut so that different subjects appear to be talking to each other; the interviewees in question generally had opposite views on the subject. The film was unrated by the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\nRainstorm Entertainment was confirmed in November 2003 to produce and finance the documentary, with production scheduled to begin in January 2004. The film was completed in 2005 by Anderson's company, Mudflap Films, and produced by Rainstorm Entertainment co-founders Steven Kaplan and Gregg Daniel, and Bruce Leiserowitz, Jory Weitz and Richard Ardi. Financial assistance was provided by Bad Apple Films of Spokane, Washington.\nThirty-five media commentators were interviewed for the film. Jory Weitz helped obtain interviews; he had cast Anderson's previous film, \"The Big Empty\", and had industry credibility as executive producer of \"Napoleon Dynamite\". Anderson said he intended to select interviewees with a variety of perspectives, conservative as well as liberal. He described how, as confirmations of interview subjects came in, he was surprised when Pat Boone was among the first to confirm his participation. Anderson had previously worked as a cameraman on a piece with Boone about eight years before starting work on \"Fuck\". After confirming Boone, Bill Maher and Janeane Garofalo on \"Fuck\", it became easier for Anderson to confirm other interviewees. The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide, and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.\n\nDistribution rights to \"Fuck\" were obtained by THINKFilm in 2006. Movie chains did not use the film's title in their promotion, instead using references such as \"The Four-Letter Word Film\". Mark Urman, chief of the theatrical division of THINKFilm, told \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" that it was especially difficult (as an independent film distributor) to promote a film with a title media outlets did not wish to print. Urman told \"Variety\" that the intent of the production staff during promotion was a creative, original marketing campaign. THINKFilm marketed the documentary as a comprehensive, humorous look at the dichotomy between the taboo nature and cultural universality of the word \"fuck\".\n\n\"Fuck\" was shown for the first time on November 7, 2005, at the American Film Institute Film Festival at the ArcLight Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California. On March 10, 2006, interest increased after the opening night of the 20th South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas. At the 30th Cleveland International Film Festival, it sold out two screenings (which were standing-room only events).\n\n\"Fuck\" was featured on March 31 and April 2, 2006, at the Florida Film Festival. It was screened in April 2006 during the Philadelphia Film Festival at Prince Music Theater in Philadelphia. It had its Washington, D.C. premiere in June 2006, and was shown on June 15 at the Nantucket Film Festival.\n\n\"Fuck\" opened in Los Angeles on August 23, 2006 and in New York on November 10. It made its Canadian debut at the 2006 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, and began regular showings at the Bloor Cinema on December 1. The documentary began screening at the Century Centre Cinema in Chicago on November 17, 2006. \"Fuck\" had two screenings in April 2007 during the Hong Kong International Film Festival in Tsim Sha Tsui. According to a 2011 interview with Anderson in the \"Santa Barbara Independent\", the documentary was shown in about 100 film festivals worldwide and was screened in about 65 cities during its theatrical release.\n\n\"Fuck\" received mixed reviews. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 56% approval rating with an average rating of 5.8/10 based on 72 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"A documentary that sets out to explore a lingual taboo but can't escape its own naughty posturing.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted-mean rating from 0–100 based on reviews by film critics, the film has a rating score of 58 based on 23 reviews (a mixed, or average, film). The American Film Institute wrote, \"Ultimately, \"Fuck\" is a movie about free speech ... Freedom of expression must extend to words that offend. Love it or hate it, fuck is here to stay\".\n\nJack Garner of the \"Democrat and Chronicle\" gave the film a rating of 8 out of 10, concluding that he was pleasantly surprised at the documentary's entertainment value. He described it as educational, despite \"Fuck\"s repetitive use of the word. In \"The Boston Globe\" Wesley Morris commented that the director's flippant style was beneficial, enabling him to make serious educational points to the audience. Sally Foster of \"Film Threat\" said that the crux of the film was the debate about freedom of speech, and that the film was funny and thought-provoking. A. O. Scott wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"Mr. Anderson's movie is staged as a talking-head culture-war skirmish between embattled upholders of propriety (or repression, if you prefer) and proponents of free expression (or filth), but its real lesson is that the two sides depend upon each other. Or rather, that the continued vitality of the word—its unique ability to convey emphasis, relieve stress, shock grown-ups and function as adverb, noun, verb, intensifier and what linguists call 'infix'—rests on its ability to mark an edge between the permissible and the profane\". In the \"Chicago Reader\", Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that the documentary was an amusing film and an educational commentary on the word. According to Glenn Garvin of \"The Miami Herald\", the film was an expansive merging of perspectives from politics, history and culture.\n\nIn a review for \"The Austin Chronicle\" Marjorie Baumgarten gave the film a rating of 4.5 out of five stars, concluding that it helped unravel myths surrounding the word and describing it as captivating and educational. Steve Schneider reviewed the film for the \"Orlando Weekly\", comparing it to an academic thesis despite its repeated use of off-color humor. Noel Murray of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the film a grade of B-minus, stating that \"Fuck\" succeeded where Kirby Dick's \"This Film Is Not Yet Rated\" did not, by providing viewpoints from multiple perspectives. Karl French wrote in a review for the \"Financial Times\" that the documentary was unique and reasonably entertaining. Moira MacDonald asked, in a review for \"The Seattle Times\", if viewers could embrace the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and still be leery of the word's omnipresence in society. Mick LaSalle wrote in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" that the commentators seemed monotonous and formulaic in debating freedom of speech, and criticized the film's repetition of the word \"fuck\".\n\nPeter Keough reviewed the film for the \"Boston Phoenix\"; giving it a rating of two out of four stars, he also said that the repeated use of \"fuck\" grew tiresome. In a critical review for \"The Observer\" Philip French wrote that the film had low comedic value, calling it arrogant, puerile and tedious. Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" gave the film two out of five stars, criticizing its lack of originality. In a review for \"Empire\" magazine, David Parkinson also gave the film a rating of two out of five stars and was frustrated that arguments by the director seemed guarded; he said that the film's scope was not comedic, amusing or provoking enough. In \"Time Out London\" David Jenkins gave the film one star out of six, writing that it lacked depth on the issues of linguistics, media, and censorship. A critical review by Noah Sanders of \"The Stranger\" concluded that the film was watchable and amusing, but poorly edited and organized. The \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\" criticized the film's length, which was echoed by \"The Washington Post\", the \"Deseret News\", \"The Herald\" and the \"New York Daily News\". In a review for the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" Bill White gave the film a grade C, calling it a dull compilation of childish observations and a failed attempt to spark a discussion about freedom of speech. Mike Pinsky of \"DVD Verdict\" concluded that the film's main arguments were achieved by the beginning of the documentary, and criticized its lack of subsequent structure and light tone overall.\n\nTHINKFilm reached an agreement to screen the documentary on the American premium cable channel Showtime in 2007, and it aired on the Documentary Channel on May 28, 2011. The DVD for \"Fuck\" was released by THINKFilm on February 13, 2007, and a United Kingdom DVD edition was released in 2009. For the DVDs, THINKFilm remastered the video for \"Fuck\"; it was optimized for home viewing with 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer to a 16:9 anamorphic full-frame presentation and Dolby Digital Stereo 2.0 audio.\n\nTrailers for \"Shortbus\", \"Farce of the Penguins\" and \"The Aristocrats\" appear on the DVD before the documentary. Special features include a commentary track by Steve Anderson, interviews with Anderson and Bill Plympton, the film's theatrical trailer, a gallery for the introductory trailers, deleted scenes and interviews with Hunter S. Thompson and Tera Patrick. The disc includes an optional on-screen counter, giving viewers a running total of utterances (and appearances) of the word \"fuck\" during play.\n\n\"Fuck\" has been a resource for several university courses. Christopher M. Fairman discussed the documentary in his article, \"Fuck\", published in February 2007 in the \"Cardozo Law Review\". Fairman cited Anderson's decision to call his film \"Fuck\" and the marketing problems this entailed, saying that he and Anderson both found the title of their works helped spur debate on word taboos in society.\n\nIn an interview with the \"Santa Barbara Independent\", Anderson said that a schoolteacher in Philadelphia had been fired for showing the documentary to his students. The teacher had researched the documentary, and wanted to teach his students the history of the word because of its frequent use in his class. Anderson said it was not the use of the word \"fuck\" in the film that cost the teacher his job, but a 38-second scene from a \"Fuck for Forest\" concert in Europe where a couple engaged in sexual intercourse onstage as environmental advocacy. The teacher showed the DVD to his 11th-grade journalism class at William Penn High School without previewing it or sending permission slips home to parents. He told the \"Philadelphia Daily News\" that before showing the documentary, he was unaware that it contained the clip showing sexual intercourse. He was dismissed from his position by the school principal, and his termination was upheld by the regional superintendent. The teacher did not appeal the decision, instead retiring. An analysis of the incident by the \"Philadelphia Daily News\" concluded that the school district's decision to fire the teacher was appropriate, but also agreed with the teacher's position that showing a 90-minute DVD should not have obliterated his 19 years as an educator.\n\n\"Fuck\" was featured in a 2012 analysis in the academic journal \"Communication Teacher\", \"Do You Talk to Your Teacher with That Mouth? \"F*ck: A Documentary\" and Profanity as a Teaching Tool in the Communication Classroom\", by Miriam Sobre-Denton of Southern Illinois University Carbondale and Jana Simonis. Sobre-Denton and Simonis discussed the documentary's use for communication studies students studying university-level intercultural relations. Their research incorporated interviews with Steve Anderson, students and data from graduate-level classes in language and culture. Sobre-Denton and Simonis' conclusions correlated taboo words with social forms of power, rebelliousness, professionalism and gender roles.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27403833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27403833", "title": "Heritage language learning", "text": "Heritage language learning\n\nHeritage language learning or heritage language acquisition is the act of learning a heritage language from an ethnolinguistic group that traditionally speaks the language, or from those whose family historically spoke the language. According to a commonly accepted definition by Valdés, heritage languages are generally minority languages in society and are typically learned at home during childhood. When a heritage language learner grows up in an environment with a dominant language that is different from their heritage language, the learner appears to be more competent in the dominant language and often feels more comfortable speaking in that language. \"Heritage language\" may also be referred to as \"community language,\" \"home language,\" and \"ancestral language\".\n\nThere are different kinds of heritage language learners, such as learners with varying levels of proficiency in the heritage language, and also those who learn a \"foreign\" language in school with which they have some connection. Polinsky & Kagan label heritage language learners on a continuum that ranges from fluent speakers to individuals who speak very little of their heritage language. Valdés points out that a connection with a heritage language does not have to be made only through direct previous exposure to the language or a certain amount of proficiency in the language. In her conception of heritage language learners, monolingual English-speaking students of Armenian ancestry in the United States could consider themselves to have a heritage language of Armenian. A different definition of heritage language learners or speakers limits the term to individuals who were exposed to the language in early childhood, but who later lost proficiency in the language in favor of adopting the majority language of the community.\n\nHeritage language acquisition theories are highly contested. The most common theory is the Incomplete Acquisition Theory, but other scholars have considered delayed acquisition, variations in input, and cross-linguistic influence as factors that contribute to heritage language speakers' competence (see section on Acquisition Theories). For children who may have acquired a different dialect of the heritage language, they would require a unique type of instruction that may differ from styles of instruction that would be most beneficial for students who experience incomplete acquisition at an early age.\n\nHeritage languages can be learned in various contexts, including public school instruction and language courses organized by a community which speaks the particular language during after-school hours or on the weekend. When someone is engaged in informal heritage language learning, they are acquiring a language from a particular ethnolinguistic group that traditionally speaks the language, or from someone whose family historically spoke the language. Formal heritage language instruction occurs inside of a classroom, where learners are taught a language that is being used inside of the home or among members of their own ethnic group. Language programs that include Saturday schools and courses that happen outside of school hours are programs where children are encouraged to further develop and improve their heritage language proficiency.\n\nAccording to Valdés, the term \"heritage language\" can be used very broadly and can refer to minority languages which are spoken by what many know as \"linguistic minorities.\" Typically, these heritage languages are endangered or have a high possibility of disappearing soon without intervention, and because of this, there are several communities in the United States that have chosen to work towards maintaining these languages.\n\nThe difference between native language (or First language) and heritage language is an important distinction to make. The term \"native language\" tends to be associated with acquisition at a very early age and carries with it the notion that a person will achieve a high amount of fluency and proficiency in this language. Typically, the native language is the dominant language for a speaker and this speaker is expected to have natural understanding of not only linguistic knowledge, but also pragmatic and cultural knowledge, as well as skills such as writing creatively, making jokes, and translating. On the other hand, the term \"heritage language\" is more associated with the language in which proficiency was sacrificed in order to gain proficiency in the dominant language in a particular community. This is not always the case, however, as some speakers of heritage languages have just as much proficiency in that language as in their other language(s).\n\nHeritage language learners differ from other types of language learners. Kagan & Dillon provide us with distinctions among speakers of Russian as a native language, and learners of Russian as a heritage language or a foreign language in the table below. The goal of the research was to distinguish between types of language learners of Russian and to use that information to create a new perspective for instruction. The table explains that students whose native language was Russian had acquired it as a child and used it throughout life with exposure to a full language community of speakers. For the students who learned Russian as a foreign language (L2), there was first an L1 or native language before they began learning Russian, the foreign language, which was typically learned solely outside of the community. Lastly, the heritage speakers of Russian had acquired Russian as an L1, but when they immigrated to the United States, English became their primary language. This left most heritage language students with varying levels of proficiency in their heritage language due to the limited community that spoke Russian.\n\nAcquisition theories have been proposed in an attempt to explain why heritage speakers’ competence in the heritage language diverges from that of their monolingual peers. Silvina Montrul’s research has been foundational to this work. Her Incomplete Acquisition Theory states that heritage speakers do not completely acquire the heritage language before switching to the L2. As attrition can also render a grammar “incomplete,” attrition is included in this theory. Multiple researchers have refuted Silvina Montrul's proposal by suggesting that the Incomplete Acquisition Theory does not take into consideration delayed acquisition, input variation, and cross-linguistic influence, all of which factor into language competence.\n\nAs research on heritage language learners' acquisition is relatively recent, dating back to the early 2000s, there remains much to be discovered about the process. It should also be noted that the following acquisition theories pertain to language learners who have learned, at least partially, the heritage language before switching to the dominant language. For more information on heritage language learners who lack personal experience with the heritage language but have ancestry who spoke the language, see language revitalization.\n\nThe Incomplete Acquisition Theory recognizes that complete acquisition of L1 takes place throughout childhood, stretching into the school-age period. Therefore, heritage language learners, who typically switch to the dominant culture’s language when they enter school and, consequently, experience a decline in input in the heritage language, do not completely acquire their first language. As heritage language learners are rarely schooled in their L1, they are often orally proficient but illiterate or have underdeveloped written comprehension and production in the heritage language. In treating heritage language learning as interrupted L1 acquisition, in which the learner has access to Universal Grammar, it is expected that heritage language learners have knowledge of concepts found in early stages of L1 development, such as binding constraints, wh-movement, and aspects of lexical semantics, and struggle with grammatical concepts that require sustained exposure and practice in school-aged children, such as specialized vocabulary and uses of the subjunctive in Spanish.\n\nAn incomplete grammar may be the result of attrition and fossilization of concepts in the L1 due to insufficient input once the child has switched to the dominant language. Attrition is the loss of, or failure to make full use of, “grammatical knowledge previously acquired\". Fossilization occurs when a speaker lets go of non-core grammatical concepts but retains the basic core structure of the language. Attrition and fossilization are considered to be part of the Incomplete Acquisition Theory because they render a language incomplete. However, Pires and Rothman (2009) argue that attrition should be distinguished from the Incomplete Acquisition Theory in future studies because, in instances of attrition, the speakers do, indeed, completely acquire the target grammar as children.\n\nDelayed acquisition may contribute to the difference in language competence between heritage speakers and monolingual speakers of the same language. Late or delayed acquisition of a language can have \"consequences for linguistic, neurological, and cognitive mechanisms\" that work to make language acquisition \"fast, effortless, and... successful\". Flores and Barbosa (2014) studied the clitic placement of heritage speakers of Portuguese living in Germany and concluded that the heritage speakers went through the same stages of acquisition as their monolingual counterparts. However, the process of acquisition was delayed and took longer for the heritage speakers because they had reduced input of the heritage language. Thus, this theory must be considered in conjunction with theories on input variation.\n\nTheories of acquisition involving variations of input postulate that heritage language learners' production of the heritage language diverges from that of their monolingual peers who speak the same language because the two groups are exposed to different dialects and quantities of input.\n\nTheories surrounding dialect variation suggest that errors or deviations from the standard dialect made by a heritage language learner may reflect the acquisition of a non-standard variety or informal register of the heritage language, which include variations on certain properties or the lack of certain properties found in the standard dialect. Heritage language learners are often only exposed to one dialect or colloquial variety of the heritage language, unlike their monolingual peers who interact with a standard monolingual dialect found in formal instruction. Furthermore, certain grammatical properties are only present in the standard dialect or are used infrequently in the colloquial dialect. Pires and Rothaman use the expression, \"missing-input competence divergence,\" to refer to instances when a grammatical property is missing from the colloquial variety.\n\nThe dramatic difference between standard and colloquial dialects is particularly evident in cases of verbal morphology, the clitic system, the subjunctive, and inflected infinitives in Brazilian Portuguese. Pires and Rothman (2009) found that Brazilian Portuguese heritage learners do not acquire inflected infinitives because their input does not \"robustly instantiate these forms\". Similarly, Dominguez (2009) found that deviations in the use and distribution of indicative and subjunctive forms that were in the output of heritage Spanish speakers were also found in the children's input (parental speech).\n\nIn certain cases, heritage language learners receive their input from first-generation migrants who have shown effects of attrition in certain domains. Consequently, the language learner would be missing grammatical properties in their input as a result of the interlocutor's attrition and would replicate these errors in their output.\n\nPires and Rothman (2009) claim that due to their \"inborn faculty of language,\" children automatically acquire the grammar found in their input. Therefore, in conclusion, it is not a deficient ability to acquire the language, but rather, the absence of, or limited access to, certain properties in the child's input that leads to errors in language production. Without access to a standard dialect of the target language often found in formal academic contexts, heritage language learners continue to make these production errors.\n\nHeritage language learners may also have a smaller quantity of input than their monolingual peers because the heritage language is only found in a restricted number of contexts and with fewer interlocutors. Citing statistics found in studies on hearing children with deaf parents, Flores and Barbosa (2014) posit that bilingual heritage language learners need a minimum of 5 to 10 hours of interaction per week with the language to develop native-like proficiency. Hours of input may be particularly restricted once the heritage speaker switches to the dominant language.\n\nCross-linguistic influence may contribute to heritage speakers' competence divergence. Heritage language learners show a tendency to overuse grammatical properties that are found in both the heritage language and the dominant language. Furthermore, heritage language learners may prefer grammatical structures from the dominant language and transfer them into the heritage language. To learn more about language transfer in bilingual individuals, see Crosslinguistic influence.\n\nThere are many theories across disciplines that seek to explain the relationship between language and identity, but the existence of such a relationship is the common thread. For heritage language learners, when their native or heritage language is not treated as valuable in the classroom, this negatively affects their view of themselves and their mental health. Many minority language speakers’ children lose the ability to speak the minority language once they enter the classroom, because of several detrimental factors discussed below. Heritage language learning may help these children regain or avoid losing the ability to communicate with their parents.\n\nWithout the ability to communicate with parents or other family members, it becomes difficult to create an identity intertwined with one's heritage culture. In fact, once the heritage language is lost, children may lose the cognitive ability to understand certain concepts or beliefs in their heritage culture. Those who lose the heritage language and choose not to actively maintain its use often assimilate into the dominant culture rather quickly. When heritage language learning does take place, the “standard” language is instructed, and learners whose heritage language is of a different dialect are judged for their variance from the standard. This results in a loss of self-esteem that makes strong self-identity difficult.\n\nOne group of heritage language learners includes international adoptees. Some parents that adopt internationally see heritage language learning as a necessary part of the adoptees connection with their own cultural identity, and choose to learn the heritage language along with their child. Though the language is not a heritage language for these parents, it is the language their child might have been brought up in and is a necessary part of “culture keeping,” or the act of purposefully ensuring the adopted child holds onto their birth culture.\n\nAnother sub-category of heritage language learners are mixed-heritage learners. Studies show that these individuals may have a confused sense of identity because they do not feel that they are fully accepted by either culture. Heritage language learning can be a way to help mixed-heritage individuals connect to the culture of their minority language parent, but these children face several obstacles in pursuing this language, as described in “Detrimental Factors to Heritage Language Learning.”\n\nFor all heritage language learners, Kondo-Brown suggests that proficiency is positively correlated to both a strong perception of heritage and ethnic identity and a strong community in one's ethnic group. Much research backs this claim. In a study of Japanese heritage language learners, Kondo-Brown found that individuals with one parent speaking the language performed much better in both grammatical knowledge, and various self-assessment tools than those without a parent speaking Japanese. Individuals in this same study with either one Japanese speaking grandparent, or only being of Japanese descent performed on the same level, below those with one Japanese speaking parent. Kondo-Brown attributes this difference to variance in sense of ethnic identity.\n\nHeritage language learning is generally an effort to recover one's cultural identity, and is therefore linked to the language loss experienced by immigrant and indigenous populations. Immigration and colonialism around the world have created communities of people who speak languages other than the dominant language at home. Their minority status means that they must navigate the effects of linguistic difference, and the expression of culture, ethnicity, and values through language. Heritage learners often cite a desire to connect with their cultural heritage as a major motivation for studying their heritage language. They may also be motivated by the global prominence and potential career advantages of some heritage languages. As both major immigrant destinations and exporters of the world's dominant language, the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Australia are home to large populations of heritage language speakers. Indigenous populations in Australia and the Americas also teach their own languages as heritage languages, attempting to revitalize them after the effects of colonial occupation.\n\nThe distribution of immigrant languages around the world largely reflects immigration patterns; for example, Spanish and Chinese are more likely to be taught as heritage languages abroad. The language profile of a single immigrant community can also vary due to the presence of different dialects. This variation in dialects and even writing systems can be another obstacle in meeting community needs. Ebb and flow in a country's immigrant populations can also lead to significant variation in the abilities of heritage learners in a single classroom. A study conducted by the National Heritage Language Resource Center (UCLA) shows that in the United States, heritage speakers' interest in their home language tends to wane as they enter school, but may rise again in the later teenage years, prompting the decision to study it in college.\n\nThe study and teaching of indigenous heritage languages stands at odds with colonial governments' earlier attempts at forced cultural assimilation. The process of language loss accelerated by colonial policies and practices means that many indigenous languages are faced with the threat of extinction, and the effort to teach them as heritage languages intersects with broader language revitalization projects. While learners of immigrant languages are likely to have at least partial knowledge of their language from an early age, indigenous language learners may never have spoken their languages before they began learning them in a formal setting. Education in these languages is further complicated by social stigma, and the feelings of shame or inadequacy that some indigenous people may associate with their language due to colonial intervention. Adult speakers coming from a legacy such as that of Canada's residential schools (a project for assimilating indigenous peoples), whose negative psychological effects have been reported by Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, may be unable or unwilling to pass their language on to their children.\n\nHeritage language learners have widely varying circumstances and educational needs that set them apart from foreign language learners. They may have little to no understanding of the language, or be able to speak but not read or write it. Formal education in heritage languages has existed since the nineteenth century, in immigrant communities and private and religious schools. Heritage languages did not attract the attention of public education and universities until the concept of heritage language itself began to emerge as a separate field from foreign language learning. Heritage languages are also referred to as community, ethnic, ancestral, minority, or non-official languages, but the term \"heritage language\" appears to have originated with Canadian programs of this type.\n\nWhen designing heritage language curricula and teaching methods, linguists and educators attempt to address the ways in which heritage learners are unique. In contrast to the teaching of foreign languages, heritage language teaching methods place more emphasis on literacy and experiential, content-based approaches. Because cultural identity is a definitive part of heritage language learning, languages are often taught alongside cultural practices. Teaching heritage languages is not limited to the classroom; it may be a part of other local community contexts, such as a volunteer work and internships, field trips, oral history projects, or Scout troops.\n\nOne question facing heritage language programs is the relationship of heritage language learners to foreign language learners of that same language. The two types of students have different educational, cultural, and psychological backgrounds, which can lead to uneven learning outcomes if they are taught together. Heritage language learners can be taught in entirely separate programs from foreign language learners, or in courses where different types of learners are integrated to varying degrees. They may also be taught alongside their foreign language counterparts with no distinction between them, as is usually the case in college language courses.\n\nAmerican immigrants often end their pursuit of heritage language learning after two or three generations in the United States, and it is now becoming more common to shift into English within two generations. The decision to end heritage language learning can stem from a variety of factors, but often includes societal pressure to use the dominant language. Some L2 speakers view the dominant language as superior or associate it with higher class society, and prefer it to their heritage language, or believe it will lead them to greater opportunity than their native tongue. Some parents discourage use of the heritage language in the home because of a fear that their children will have a harder time learning the dominant language if they are also learning another language. This belief is not supported by research. Research by Yan and Elena (as cited in Yilmaz 2016) showed better performance in bilinguals as compared to monolinguals in metalinguistic ability, pragmatics, and attention control. This and other research actually points to Cognitive advantages of bilingualism including greater cognitive ability and mental flexibility.\n\nPractical limitations to heritage language learning are also possible, and can include limited access to resources for heritage language learning, and limited materials in the heritage language. A combination of a social and practical limitation, classrooms may also discourage the use of minority languages by students during instruction.\n\nIn the sub-population of mixed-heritage learners, there may other stigmas that contribute to the loss of heritage language learning. If it is not widely accepted to marry outside of their culture, and individuals decide to do so anyhow, they may lose contact with their ethnic community upon marriage. This leaves them without access to a community of speakers in their heritage language. Their children now have little access to one parent’s native language, and little opportunity to pursue heritage language learning.\n\nAlthough heritage language learning can be important in many cases, the stakes are particularly high when the language is near extinction. In some cases, the active pursuit of heritage language learning is necessary to keep a minority languages alive, yet there may be limited learning materials and resources to do so. The language of the Cherokee people in North Carolina and in the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma fits into this category. In these situations, it is also likely that there is limited access to social communities of native speakers to communicate with. Without this natural input as well as pedagogical input, speakers may not achieve the fluency needed to keep the language alive, and the minority language may be lost.\n\n"}

The double form of the idiom is still found in parts of the American Southwest as \"Howdy, howdy\". Without regard to etymological beginnings, the word is used as a greeting such as \"Hello\" and not, normally, as an enquiry. As a result, it's not followed by a question mark. Punctuating \"Howdy\" commonly follows these rules:\n(i) If \"Howdy\" is used as a complete sentence, it's followed by an exclamation mark.\n(ii) If \"Howdy\" is the first word in a sentence, it's followed by a comma.\n\nIn the rural Southwestern United States, \"Howdy\" is a colloquial contraction of the formal greeting of \"How do you do?\", and as such is considered a formal and acceptable greeting for residents of that region of the world. \"Howdy\" is also the official greeting of Texas A&M University, though the two are not always automatically associated.\n\nThe word became recently popular in other areas of the world as it is the default greeting from the dashboard of WordPress, a very popular content management system. The probable reason for using \"Howdy\" (instead of \"Welcome\" or \"Hello\") in the dashboard is because Matt Mullenweg, one of the main developers of WordPress, was born and raised in Texas.\n\nThe phrase \"boy howdy\" is a development of the greeting which adds the exclamation \"boy\" to form an interjection which indicates an emphatic affirmation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "496944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=496944", "title": "Hypergraphia", "text": "Hypergraphia\n\nHypergraphia is a behavioral condition characterized by the intense desire to write or draw. Forms of hypergraphia can vary in writing style and content. It is a symptom associated with temporal lobe changes in epilepsy, which is the cause of the Geschwind syndrome, a mental disorder. Structures that may have an effect on hypergraphia when damaged due to temporal lobe epilepsy are the hippocampus and Wernicke's area. Aside from temporal lobe epilepsy, chemical causes may be responsible for inducing hypergraphia.\n\nIn some cases hypergraphia can manifest with compulsive drawing. Drawings by patients with hypergraphia exhibit repetition and a high level of detail, sometimes mixing both compulsive writing and drawing together.\n\nWaxman and Geschwind were the first to describe hypergraphia, in the 1970s. The patients they observed displayed extensively compulsive detailed writing, sometimes with literary creativity. The patients kept diaries, which some used to meticulously document minute details of their everyday activities, write poetry, or create lists. Case 1 of their study wrote lists of her relatives, her likes and dislikes, and the furniture in her apartment. Beside lists, the patient wrote poetry, often with a moral or philosophical undertone. She described an incident in which she wrote the lyrics of a song she learned when she was 17 several hundred times and another incident in which she felt the urge to write a word over and over again. Another patient wrote aphorisms and certain sentences in repetition.\n\nA patient from a separate study experienced \"continuously rhyming in his head\" for five years after a seizure and said that he \"felt the need to write them down.\" The patient did not talk in rhyme, nor did he read poetry. Language capacity and mental status were normal for this patient, except for recorded right temporal spikes on electroencephalograms. This patient had right hemisphere epilepsy. Functional MRI scans of other studies suggest that rhyming behavior is produced in the left hemisphere, but Mendez proposed that hyperactive electrical activity of the right hemisphere may induce a release of writing and rhyming abilities in the left hemisphere.\n\nIn addition to writing in different forms (poetry, books, repetition of one word), hypergraphia patients differ in the complexity of their writings. While some writers (e.g. Alice Flaherty) use their hypergraphia to help them write extensive papers and books, most patients do not write things of substance. Flaherty defines hypergraphia, as a result of temporal lobe epilepsy, as a condition that \"increase[s] idea generation, sometimes at the expense of quality.\" Patients hospitalized with temporal lobe epilepsy and other disorders causing hypergraphia have written memos and lists (like their favorite songs) and recorded their dreams in extreme length and detail. Some patients who also suffer from temporal lobe epilepsy record the times and locations of each seizure compiled as a list.\n\nThere are many accounts of patients writing in nonsensical patterns including writing in a center-seeking spiral starting around the edges of a piece of paper. In one case study, a patient even wrote backwards, so that the writing could only be interpreted with the aid of a mirror. Sometimes the writing can consist of scribbles and frantic, random thoughts that are quickly jotted down on paper very frequently. Grammar can be present, but the meaning of these thoughts is generally hard to grasp and the sentences are loose. In some cases, patients write extremely detailed accounts of events that are occurring or descriptions of where they are.\n\nSome studies have suggested that hypergraphia is related to bipolar disorder, hypomania, and schizophrenia. Although creative ability was observed in the patients of these studies, signs of creativity were observed, not hypergraphia specifically. Therefore, it is difficult to say with absolute certainty that hypergraphia is a symptom of these psychiatric illnesses because creativity in patients with bipolar disorder, hypomania, or schizophrenia may manifest into something aside from writing. However, other studies have shown significant accounts between hypergraphia and temporal lobe epilepsy and chemical causes. \n\nHypergraphia is a symptom of temporal lobe epilepsy, a condition of reoccurring seizures caused by excessive neuronal activity, but it is not a common symptom among patients. Less than 10 percent of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy exhibit characteristics of hypergraphia. Temporal lobe epilepsy patients may exhibit irritability, discomfort, or an increasing feeling of dread if their writing activity is disrupted. To elicit such responses when interrupting their writing suggests that hypergraphia is a compulsive condition, resulting in an obsessive motivation to write. A temporal lobe epilepsy may influence frontotemporal connections in such a way that the drive to write is increased in the frontal lobe, beginning with the prefrontal and premotor cortex planning out what to write, and then leading to the motor cortex (located next to the central fissure) executing the physical movement of writing.\n\nMost temporal lobe epilepsy patients who suffer from hypergraphia can write words, but not all may have the capacity to write complete sentences that have meaning.\n\nCertain drugs have been known to induce hypergraphia including donepezil. In one case study, a patient taking donepezil reported an elevation in mood and energy levels which led to hypergraphia and other excessive forms of speech (such as singing). Six other cases of patients taking donepezil and experiencing mania have been previously reported. These patients also had cases of dementia, cognitive impairment from a cerebral aneurysm, bipolar I disorder, and/or depression. Researchers are unsure why donepezil can induce mania and hypergraphia. It could potentially result from an increase in acetylcholine levels, which would have an effect on the other neurotransmitters in the brain.\n\nAnother potential cause of hypergraphia is from one of the body's neurotransmitters, dopamine (DA). Dopamine has been known to decrease latent inhibition, which causes a decrease in the ability to habituate to different stimuli. Low latent inhibition leads to an excessive level of stimulation and could contribute to the onset of hypergraphia and general creativity. This research implies that there is a direct correlation between the levels of DA between neuronal synapses and the level of creativity exhibited by the patient. DA agonists increase the levels of DA between synapses which results in higher levels of creativity, and the opposite is true for DA antagonists.\n\nSeveral regions of the brain are involved in the act of writing. Primary areas are the superior parietal cortex and the frontal lobe, the region of the brain that plans out movement. An area of the frontal lobe that is especially active is Exner's area, located in the premotor cortex. The physical motion of the hand is controlled by the primary motor cortex, also located in the frontal lobe, and the right cerebellum. Writing creatively and generating ideas, on the other hand, is controlled by the limbic system, specifically involving the activity of the hippocampus, which is important in the retrieval of long-term memories. Words and ideas are cognized and understood by the temporal lobes, and these temporal lobes are connected to the limbic system. \nAlthough hypergraphia cannot be isolated to one specific part of the brain, some areas are known to have more of an effect than others. The hippocampus has been found to play a role in the occurrence of temporal lobe epilepsy and schizophrenia. In one study, rats induced with temporal lobe epilepsy showed an increase in dopamine neural activity in the hippocampus. Because hypergraphia has been linked to temporal lobe epilepsy and schizophrenia, the hippocampus could have an effect on hypergraphia as well. In another study, patients with bilateral hippocampal atrophy (BHA) showed signs of having Geschwind syndrome, including hypergraphia.\n\nWhile epilepsy-induced hypergraphia is usually lateralized to the left cerebral hemisphere in the language areas, hypergraphia associated with lesions and other brain damage usually occurs in the right cerebral hemisphere. Lesions to the right side of the brain usually cause hypergraphia because they can disinhibit language function on the left side of the brain. Hypergraphia has also been known to be caused by right hemisphere strokes and tumors.\n\nLesions to Wernicke's area (in the left temporal lobe) can increase speech output, which can sometimes manifest itself in writing.\n\nHypergraphia was one of the central issues in the 1999 trial of Alvin Ridley for the imprisonment and murder of his wife Virginia Ridley. The mysterious woman, who had died in bed of apparent suffocation, had remained secluded in her home for 27 years in the small town of Ringgold, Georgia, USA. Her ten thousand page journal, which provided abundant evidence that she suffered from epilepsy and had remained housebound of her own will, was instrumental in the acquittal of her husband.\n\n\"I am a compulsive writer\", Isaac Asimov said in 1969. Vincent van Gogh and Fyodor Dostoevsky are reported to have been affected by hypergraphia . It has been suggested that the poet Robert Burns was a sufferer.\n\nLewis Carroll, the author of \"Alice in Wonderland\", is said to have had hypergraphia. In his lifetime he wrote over 98,000 letters varying in format. Some were written backwards, in rebus, and in patterns, as with \"The Mouse's Tale\" in \"Alice\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "555466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=555466", "title": "IMRAD", "text": "IMRAD\n\nIn scientific writing, IMRAD or IMRaD () (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) is a common organizational structure (a document format). IMRaD is the most prominent norm for the structure of a scientific journal article of the original research type.\n\nOriginal research articles are typically structured in this basic order\n\nThe plot and the flow of the story of IMRaD is style writing are explained by a 'wine glass model' or hourglass model.\n\nWriting, compliant with IMRaD format (IMRaD writing) typically first presents \"(a) the subject that positions the study from the wide perspective\", \"(b) outline of the study\", develops through \"(c) study method\", and \"(d) the results\", and concludes with \"(e) outline and conclusion of the fruit of each topics\", and \"(f) the meaning of the study from the wide and general point of view\". Here, (a) and (b) are mentioned in the section of the \"Introduction\", (c) and (d) are mentioned in the section of the \"Method\" and \"Result\" respectively, and (e) and (f) are mentioned in the section of the \"Discussion\" or \"Conclusion\".\n\nIn this sense, to explain how to line up the information in IMRaD writing, the 'wine glass model' (see the pattern diagram shown in Fig.1) will be helpful (see pp 2–3 of the Hilary Glasman-deal ). As mentioned in abovementioned textbook, the scheme of 'wine glass model' have two characteristic. First one is \"top-bottom symmetric shape\" and Second one is \"changing width\" i.e. \"the top is wide and it narrows towards the middle, and then widens again as it goes down toward the bottom\". \nThe First one, \"top-bottom symmetric shape\", represents the symmetry of the story development. Note the shape of the top trapezoid (representing the structure of Introduction) and the shape of the trapezoid at the bottom are reversed. This is expressing that the same subject introduced in Introduction will be taken up again in suitable formation for the section of Discussion/Conclusion in these section in the reversed order. (See the relationship between abovementioned (a), (b) and (e), (f).)\n\nThe Second one, \"the change of the width\" of the schema shown in Fig.1, represents the change of generality of the view point. As along the flow of the story development, when the viewpoints are more general, the width of the diagram is expressed wider, and when they are more specialized and focused, the width is expressed narrower.\n\nThe IMRAD format has been adopted by a steadily increasing number of academic journals since the first half of the 20th century. The IMRAD structure has come to dominate academic writing in the sciences, most notably in empirical biomedicine. The structure of most public health journal articles reflects this trend. Although the IMRAD structure originates in the empirical sciences, it now also regularly appears in academic journals across a wide range of disciplines. Many scientific journals now not only prefer this structure but also use the IMRAD acronym as an instructional device in the instructions to their authors, recommending the use of the four terms as main headings. For example, it is explicitly recommended in the \"Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals\" issued by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (previously called the \"Vancouver guidelines\"): \nThe text of observational and experimental articles is usually (but not necessarily) divided into the following sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. This so-called \"IMRAD\" structure is not an arbitrary publication format but rather a direct reflection of the process of scientific discovery. Long articles may need subheadings within some sections (especially Results and Discussion) to clarify their content. Other types of articles, such as case reports, reviews, and editorials, probably need to be formatted differently.\nThe IMRAD structure is also recommended for empirical studies in the 6th edition of the publication manual of the American Psychological Association (APA style). The APA publication manual is widely used by journals in the social, educational and behavioral sciences.\n\nThe IMRAD structure has proved successful because it facilitates literature review, allowing readers to navigate articles more quickly to locate material relevant to their purpose. But the neat order of IMRAD rarely corresponds to the actual sequence of events or ideas of the research presented; the IMRAD structure effectively supports a reordering that eliminates unnecessary detail, and allows the reader to assess a well-ordered and noise-free presentation of the relevant and significant information. It allows the most relevant information to be presented clearly and logically to the readership, by summarizing the research process in an ideal sequence and without unnecessary detail.\n\nThe idealised sequence of the IMRAD structure has on occasion been criticised for being too rigid and simplistic. In a radio talk in 1964 the Nobel laureate Peter Medawar even criticised this instructive text structure for not giving a realistic representation of the thought processes of the writing scientist: \"… the scientific paper may be a fraud because it misrepresents the processes of thought that accompanied or gave rise to the work that is described in the paper\". Medawar's criticism was discussed at the XIXth General Assembly of the World Medical Association in 1965. While respondents may argue that it is too much to ask from such a simple instructional device to carry the burden of representing the entire process of scientific discovery, Medawar's caveat expressed his belief that many students and faculty throughout academia treat the structure as a simple panacea. Medawar and others have given testimony both to the importance and to the limitations of the device.\n\nIn addition to the scientific article itself a brief abstract is usually required for publication. The abstract should, however, be composed to function as an autonomous text, even if some authors and readers may think of it as an almost integral part of the article. The increasing importance of well-formed autonomous abstracts may well be a consequence of the increasing use of searchable digital abstract archives, where a well-formed abstract will dramatically increase the probability for an article to be found by its optimal readership. Consequently, there is a strong recent trend toward developing formal requirements for abstracts, most often structured on the IMRAD pattern, and often with strict additional specifications of topical content items that should be considered for inclusion in the abstract. Such abstracts are often referred to as \"structured abstracts\". The growing importance of abstracts in the era of computerized literature search and information overload has led some users to modify the IMRAD acronym to AIMRAD, in order to give due emphasis to the abstract.\n\nUsually, the IMRAD article sections use the IMRAD words as headings. A few variations can occur, as follows: \n\n\nIn the late 20th century and early 21st, the scientific communities found that the communicative value of journal articles was still much less than it could be if best practices were developed, promoted, and enforced. Thus reporting guidelines (guidelines for how best to report information) arose. The general theme has been to create templates and checklists with the message to the user being, \"your article is not complete until you have done all of these things.\" In the 1970s, the ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) released the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (Uniform Requirements or URM). Other such standards, mostly developed in the 1990s through 2010s, are listed below. The academic medicine community is working hard on trying to raise compliance with good reporting standards, but there is still much to be done; for example, a 2016 review of instructions for authors in 27 emergency medicine journals found insufficient mention of reporting standards, and a 2018 study found that even when journals' instructions for authors mention reporting standards, there is a difference between a mention or badge and enforcing the requirements that the mention or badge represents.\n\nThe advent of a need for best practices in data sharing has expanded the scope of these efforts beyond merely the pages of the journal article itself. In fact, from the most rigorous versions of the evidence-based perspective, the distance to go is still quite formidable.\n\nMost researchers cannot be familiar with all of the many reporting standards that now exist, but it is enough to know which ones must be followed in one's own work, and to know where to look for details when needed. Several organizations provide help with this task of checking one's own compliance with the latest standards: \n\nSeveral important webpages on this topic are: \n\nRelatedly, SHERPA provides compliance-checking tools, and AllTrials provides a rallying point, for efforts to enforce openness and completeness of clinical trial reporting. These efforts stand against publication bias and against excessive corporate influence on scientific integrity.\n\n"}

In the process of various migrations of the 14th–17th centuries, Curonians (already speaking a Latvian dialect) settled along the Curonian Spit in East Prussia and became known as Kursenieki.\nKursenieki language was influenced by Old Prussian, Low German, High German and the Samogitian dialect successively, and by the end of the 18th century new Curonian dialects had formed, with the dialect of the Curonian Spit being notably distinct, due to its isolation from the mainland. Kursenieki vocabulary published in 1927 shows: 60% of Curonian words were the same as Latvian, 26% were loanwords from “German” (i.e. Low German and High German), and 13% from Lithuanian dialects. The Kursenieki language is mutually intelligible with Latvian, especially with its southwestern dialects, and Latvians can communicate easily with Kursenieki today.\n\nBefore World War II, the Kursenieki language was a sociolect of Curonian fishermen of the Curonian Spit. In other spheres of everyday life Kursenieki used the Low German and High German languages. \nThe events of the first half of the 20th century, including the Soviet and German occupations of the Baltic states and later East Prussia, led to the near extinction of the language, making it severely endangered.

{"id": "10261226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10261226", "title": "Language bioprogram theory", "text": "Language bioprogram theory\n\nThe language bioprogram theory or language bioprogram hypothesis (LBH) is a theory arguing that the structural similarities between different creole languages cannot be solely attributed to their superstrate and substrate languages. As articulated mostly by Derek Bickerton, creolization occurs when the linguistic exposure of children in a community consists solely of a highly unstructured pidgin; these children use their innate language capacity to transform the pidgin, which characteristically has high syntactic variability, into a language with a highly structured grammar. As this capacity is universal, the grammars of these new languages have many similarities.\n\nBy comparing Hawaiian Creole, Haitian Creole and Sranan, Bickerton identified twelve features which he believed to be integral to any creole: \n\nHaving analyzed these features, he believed that he was able to characterize, at least partly, the properties of innate grammar. Bickerton in his LBH, defined very precisely what he considers to be a creole: a language that has arisen out of a prior pidgin that had not existed for more than a generation and among a population where, at most, 20% were speakers of the dominant language and where the remaining 80% were linguistically diverse. Such a definition excludes many languages that might be called creoles. Moreover, lack of historical data makes it often impossible to evaluate such claims. In addition, many of the creole languages that fit this definition do not display all the twelve features, while, according to , the left-out creoles often display more of them. Another problem, raised by , is that if the same bioprogram was the starting point of all creoles, one must explain the differences between them, and language diversity in general, as the bioprogram is universal.\n\nOn the other hand, Bickerton, puts emphasis on children's contribution to the development of a creole and the abrupt character of this process. For example, in , he exhibits ungrammatical utterances made by English-speaking children between the ages of two and four, and argues that they are very similar to perfectly grammatical sentences of English-based creole languages:\n\nNormally, the grammar behind such utterances made by children is eventually altered as parents continue to model a grammar different from this innate one. Presumably, if such children were removed from exposure to English parents, their grammars would continue to be that of creole languages.\n\nHowever, according to , the differences between the speech of children and adults in Tok Pisin are so big that communication is drastically hindered.\n\nThe verb conjugation is typically close to an ideal tense–modality–aspect pattern. In this system, the absence or presence of auxiliary verbs indicate tense (concurrent or anterior), modality (realis or irrealis) and aspect (punctual or progressive), and when present these auxiliaries occur in that order, and typically are based on similar meaning words in the pidgin or superstrate language. Thus anterior tense may be marked by words such as \"bin\" in English-based creoles (from \"been\"), or \"té\" in French-based creoles (from \"été\"), a future or subjunctive tense may be marked by \"go\" (from English \"go\") or \"al\" (from French \"aller\"), and a non-punctual (non-stative) aspect by a word such as \"stei\" (from English \"stay\").\n\nThe above table demonstrates syntactic similarities of creole languages. Stative verbs are those that cannot form the nonpunctual aspect. According to Bickerton, all observed creole languages strictly follow a structure that has the anterior particle precede the irreal particle, and the irreal particle precede the nonpunctual particle, although in certain languages some compounded forms may be replaced by other constructions.\n\nMcWhorter contributed to the LBH with his Creole Prototype Theory, which argues that creoles exhibit some features that may be used to distinguish them from other languages without referring to the socio-historical dimension. According to , creoles are much less likely than other languages:\n\nThese features do not appear in creoles because creoles are relatively young languages, but they may appear later on in their grammars as the languages change. He does not claim that all creoles are ideal examples of the prototype, rather they exhibit varying degrees of conformity with the prototype.\n\nBickerton proposed in 1976 an empirical test of his theory, which involved putting families speaking mutually unintelligible languages on a previously uninhabited island for three years. Federal funding for the test was obtained, but the experiment was cancelled over concerns that informed consent could not be obtained, given the breadth of unknown possible hazards of participation.\n\n\n"}

When done without the property owner's consent, it constitutes vandalism. Some venues have attempted to curb such vandalism by installing in the lavatory large blackboards and providing free chalk; it is hoped that patrons will avail themselves of the blackboard and chalk rather than applying their latrinalia directly to the walls or toilet stalls.\n\nThe late Alan Dundes, a folklorist at University of California, Berkeley, coined the term \"latrinalia\" in 1966 to refer to graffiti found in restrooms. Dundes preferred it over the term \"shithouse poetry\", as not all latrinalia is in verse or poetic form.\n\nThe word is derived from the compounding of \"latrine\" (or toilet) and the suffix \"-alia\", which signifies a worthless collection of something — in this case bathroom writings.\n\n\n\n"}

It was originally published in \"The New Yorker\" magazine on April 8, 1974, and published in book form in 1976 in \"Divine Comedies\".\n\nThe poem opens with a description of a summer Merrill spent as a child in a great house in The Hamptons, with his governess, waiting patiently for a rented wooden jigsaw puzzle to arrive in the mail from an Upper East Side Manhattan puzzle rental shop.\n\n\"Lost in Translation\" is Merrill's most anthologized poem, and has been widely praised by literary critics including Harold Bloom.\n\nMerrill wrote in his lifetime mainly for a select group of friends, fans, and critics, and expected readers of \"Lost in Translation\" to have some knowledge of his biography. Born in New York City, Merrill was the son of the founder of the world's largest brokerage firm. He enjoyed a privileged upbringing in economic and cultural terms, although his intelligence and exceptional financial circumstances often made him feel lonely as a child. Merrill was the only son of Charles E. Merrill and Hellen Ingram. (Merrill had two older half siblings from his father's first marriage.)\n\nGiven that his parents were often preoccupied, his father with business, his mother with social obligations, Merrill developed a number of close relationships with household staff. \"Lost in Translation\" describes a profound childhood bond with the woman who taught him French and German. Merrill's parents would divorce in 1939, when Merrill was thirteen years old, in a scandal that was front-page news on the \"New York Times\".\n\nNot only is \"Lost in Translation\" a poem about a child putting together a jigsaw puzzle, it is an interpretive puzzle, designed to engage a reader's interest in solving mysteries at various narrative levels.\n\nThe poem is dedicated to Merrill's friend, the distinguished poet, critic, and translator Richard Howard. It consists of 215 lines with an additional four line epigraph. The poem is mainly in unrhymed pentameter but includes a section in Rubaiyat quatrain stanzas. \"Lost in Translation\" may be classified as an autobiographical narrative or narrative poem, but is better understood as a series of embedded narratives (stories within a story).\n\nUnusual for Merrill, the poem bears a mysterious four-line epigraph in German, which is printed without translation or attribution:\n\nIn James Merrill's own English version of this epigraph (published in 1985 in \"Late Settings\"), these four lines are translated into English as follows:\n\nIn \"Lost in Translation\", the narrator's puzzle-making companion is his French governess, whom he repeatedly refers to as \"Mademoiselle.\" Part mother, part teacher, part nanny, part servant, she is described by Merrill as \"stout, plain, carrot-haired, devout.\"\n\nAt one point in the poem, Mademoiselle speaks the same phrase in French and in German. In addition to playing with the boy's marionettes and doing jigsaw puzzles with him, Mademoiselle is teaching the young James Merrill languages which would be critical to making him the sophisticated and urbane lyric poet of later life. By giving name, in several languages, to objects and tasks around the home, Mademoiselle helps the young James Merrill come to understand a doubleness about language itself, that objects and activities can have different names and connotations across languages.\n\nFrom the child's point of view, the \"puzzle\" goes well beyond what is taking place on the card table. Merrill is puzzling through the mystery of his existence, puzzling through the mystery of what the world is, what objects are, what people do in life. An unspoken puzzle is solved when the young Merrill determines what his relationship to Mademoiselle is, given the frequent absence of his own mother. Mademoiselle knows \"her place\", he writes, indicating his first consciousness of his own class privilege, as well as (perhaps) the limits placed on Mademoiselle's maternal role.\n\nYet other puzzles are not solved until later in life. At one point the narrator's voice modulates into that of an adult. We find out that Mademoiselle hid her true origins from the boy (and from his family) because of the political tensions leading up to 1939 and to the outbreak of World War II. Mademoiselle claimed to be French and hid her German or Alsatian birth. She presumably gained a French family name through marriage to a soldier who died in the Battle of Verdun in World War I (1914–1918). Mademoiselle could let no one know she was German for fear of losing her job and her employers' trust. This explains the fact that Merrill's own French, learned in imitation of his governess, was always spoken with a slight German accent. The boy finds out the full truth only as an adult, after a chance conversation with Mademoiselle's grown nephew, a United Nations interpreter, who tells him the story of the governess's true origins.\n\nThe poem includes several other secondary narratives, including a section in which the puzzle itself is put together. Inspired by Omar Khayyám's \"Rubaiyat\" quatrains, Merrill describes an imaginary harem-like 19th century Orientalist painting, by an alleged follower of Jean-Léon Gérôme, that begins to appear as the puzzle pieces are put together. When the puzzle is nearly done, the piece that was missing the whole time is found under the table at the boy's feet. The missing piece is, in fact, an image of the boy's feet. When it is put in place, the portrait of the little boy in the puzzle is finally complete.\n\nAt the center of the poem is a mysterious sequence in which the poet, attending a present-day séance, describes a medium who is able to divine that a piece of a wooden jigsaw puzzle has been concealed inside a box.\n\nTo understand \"Lost in Translation\", the reader must work out and solve a puzzle in the narrative text, revealed by a confession Merrill the adult makes at the end of the poem. The little boy has apparently kept a piece of the jigsaw puzzle, in the shape of a palm tree, throughout his life. This fact has jogged the memory in Merrill of a poem called \"Palme\" by the French Symbolist poet Paul Valéry (1871–1945), and that memory in turn has reminded Merrill of a German translation he has once seen of that same poem by poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875–1926).\n\nThe poet knows that he has seen and read the Rilke translation before, because he can picture the words on the page. \"The owlet umlaut peeps and hoots/ Above the open vowel\", Merrill writes, in some of the poem's most quoted lines. Yet despite remembering the experience of reading the Rilke translation, he cannot locate a copy in Athens, Greece (where Merrill and his partner David Jackson were living six months of the year), and begins to doubt whether it exists except in his imagination. The poem \"Lost in Translation\" assumes the form of a letter to Richard Howard seeking an actual copy of that translation.\n\nBut the translation turns out not to have been lost, or a figment of the poet's imagination, for it is used to write the poem \"Lost In Translation.\" The German epigraph at the beginning of the poem offers the key clue here. The four lines come from that \"lost\" German translation by Rilke of Valéry's \"Palme\". (Merrill's own English translation of \"Palme\" is the source of the translated quatrain above. See Merrill's \"Paul Valéry: \"Palme\"\" in \"Late Settings\", 1985.)\n\nThe original in French:\n\nfrom Paul Valéry, Charmes (1922) Palme classical dizain 7th Stanza \n\nThe solution to the puzzle of the poem is hidden in plain sight all along. \"Nothing's lost\", Merrill suggests, when it comes to translating experience or memory, at least according to the way Merrill understands our human experience. The poem's coda salutes the power of the transformative imagination to recover meaning in the world from all we see and remember. Its language and phrasing offer a veiled tribute by Merrill to the poet he most admired from his father's generation, Wallace Stevens (author of \"The Palm at the End of the Mind\"):\n\n"}

Many words in many languages have multiple definitions. Ambiguity is an effect of a rupture of the rule of identity in the context of the exchange of information. Particularly the \"sender\" may be physically absent, and the contexts explicitly divergent, such as will be the case when the receptor is a reader and the \"sender\" was a writer.\n\nPragmatics is the study of how context affects meaning. The two primary forms of context important to pragmatics are linguistic context and situation context.\n\nLinguistic context is how meaning is understood without relying on intent and assumptions. In applied pragmatics, for example, meaning is formed through sensory experiences, even though sensory stimulus cannot be easily articulated in language or signs. Pragmatics, then, reveals that meaning is both something affected by and affecting the world. Meaning is something contextual with respect to language and the world, and is also something active toward other meanings and the world. Linguistic context becomes important when looking at particular linguistic problems such as that of pronouns.\n\nSituation context refers to every non-linguistic factor that affects the meaning of a phrase. An example of situation context can be seen in the phrase \"it's cold in here\", which can either be a simple statement of fact or a request to turn up the heat, depending on, among other things, whether or not it is believed to be in the listener's power to affect the temperature.\n\nThe relationship between words and their referents is called semantic. Semantics is the study of how meaning is conveyed through signs and language. Understanding how facial expressions, body language, and tone affect meaning, and how words, phrases, sentences, and punctuation relate to meaning are examples. Various subgroups of semantics are studied within the fields of linguistics, logic and computing. For example, linguistic semantics includes the history of how words have been used in the past; logical semantics includes how people mean and refer in terms of likely intent and assumptions.\n\nDuring the 19th century, John Stuart Mill defined semantic meaning with the words \"denotation\" and \"connotation\". A denotation is the literal or primary meaning of a word. Connotations are ideas or feelings that a word invokes for a person in addition to its literal or primary meaning.\n\nThe original use of \"meaning\" as understood early in the 20th century occurred through Lady Welby, after her daughter translated the term \"semantics\" from French.\n\nLanguages allow information to be conveyed even when the specific words used are not known by the reader or listener. People connect words with meaning and use words to refer to concepts. A person's intentions affect what is meant. \"Meaning\" (in English) as \"intent\" harkens back to the Anglo-Saxons and is associated today still, with the German verb \"meinen\" as to think or intend.\n\nFerdinand de Saussure, in founding semiology, his original subset of the semiotics, started describing language in terms of \"Signs\", dividing those \"signs\" in turn into \"signifieds\" and \"signifiers\". The signifier is the perceptive side of a sign, thus the sound form in case of oral language. The signified is the signification (semantic) side, the mental construction or image associated with the sound, by either a speaker and hearer. A sign, then, is essentially a relationship between signified and signifier.\n\nSigns are essentially conventional, as any foreign language student is well aware: there is no reason that \"bat\" couldn't mean \"body of water\" or even \"that bust of Napoleon over there\". Since the choice of signifiers is ultimately arbitrary, the meaning cannot somehow be \"in\" the signifier. Saussure instead defers meaning to the sign itself: meaning is ultimately the same thing as the sign, and \"meaning\" means that relationship is between signified and signifier. All meaning is both within us and communal, thus cultural. Signs \"mean\" by reference to our internal lexicon and grammar, and despite there being a matter of convention, so the communal part, signs also, because of the individual's uniqueness, can mean something only to the individual (what \"red\" means to one person may not be what \"red\" means to another, either in absolute value, or by including what's suggested by the context). However, while meanings carried by one given set of signifiers may vary to some extent from individual to individual, only those meanings that stay within a boundary are seen by other speakers of the language to belong to the language: if one were to refer to smells as red, most other speakers would assume the person is talking nonsense (although statements like this are common among people who experience synesthesia, or in poetry).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They begin to make more frequent and sophisticated use of metaphors such as the simile, \"We packed the room like sardines\".

Thus it may describe behaviour or the person who behaves thus. For example, \"all intensive purposes\" is a common eggcorn of the fixed expression \"all intents and purposes\"; if a person who continues to say the eggcorn even after being made aware of the correct form, either the speaker or the phrase may be called a mumpsimus.\n\nThe term originates from an apocryphal story about a poorly educated Catholic priest saying Latin mass who, in reciting the postcommunion prayer (meaning: \"What we have received in the mouth, Lord\"), instead of (meaning: \"we have received\") substitutes the non-word \"mumpsimus\", presumably as a mondegreen. After being made aware of his mistake, he nevertheless persisted with his erroneous version, whether from stubbornness, force of habit, or refusing to believe he was mistaken.\n\nThe story was told by Desiderius Erasmus (1466–1536) in a letter he wrote in August 1516 to Henry Bullock. Erasmus used it as an analogy with those who refused to accept that \"Novum Instrumentum omne\", his edition of the Greek New Testament, corrected errors in the Latin Vulgate. The English diplomat Richard Pace (1482–1536) included a variant in his 1517 work \"De Fructu qui ex Doctrina Percipitur\", where the priest was English and had been saying \"mumpsimus\" for thirty years when corrected. While Pace's book (written in Latin) is credited by the first edition of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" as the origin of \"mumpsimus\", Pace acknowledged his borrowing in a 1517 letter to Erasmus. \"Mumpsimus and sumpsimus\" became proverbial among Protestants in the early English Reformation.\n\nMumpsimus soon entered the language as a cant word widely used by 16th-century writers.\nIn William Tyndale's 1530 book \"Practice of Prelates\", the word was used in the sense of a stubborn opponent to Tyndale's views. He said that the men whom Cardinal Wolsey had asked to find reasons why Catherine of Aragon was not truly the wife of King Henry VIII of England were \"...all lawyers, and other doctors, mumpsimuses of divinity\". \nIn 1531 Sir Thomas Elyot used the word in his \"Boke named the Gouvernor\" where he said of \"Magnanimitie\" that the word, \"...being yet straunge, as late borowed out of the Latyne, shall not content all men, and specially them whome nothing contenteth out of their accustomed mumpsimus\".\n\nHenry VIII in his speech at the State Opening of Parliament on Christmas Eve 1545 said:\n\nPeter Heylin refers to the king's saying in his 1631 \"The History of St. George of Cappadocia\" when he talks of \"...those self-conceited ones which are so stiffe—as King Harry used to say—in their new sumpsimus...\" \nHugh Latimer (1487–1555) used the term in two sermons he preached in 1552, saying: \"When my neighbour is taught, and knoweth the truth, and will not believe it, but will abide in his old \"mumpsimus\"...\" and again: \"Some be so obstinate in their old \"mumpsimus\", that they cannot abide the true doctrine of God.\"\n\nIn an 1883 polemic on errors in translations of the Christian Bible, John Burgon says: \"If men prefer \"their\" 'mumpsimus' to \"our\" 'sumpsimus', let them by all means have it: but pray let them keep their rubbish to themselves—and at least leave our SAVIOUR's words alone.\"\n\nEugene T. Maleska, 1970s editor of \"The New York Times\" crossword puzzle, received \"dozens of letters\" after \"mumpsimus\" appeared as an answer; he had felt that \"it was time to revive the obsolete noun\". A. Leslie Derbyshire applied it in a 1981 management science book to managers who know how to do a better job but choose not to. \"Garner's Modern English Usage\" says the word could describe George W.

In the process of language formation, neologisms are more mature than protologisms.\n\nNeologisms are often created by combining existing words (see compound noun and adjective) or by giving words new and unique suffixes or prefixes. Portmanteaux are combined words that are sometimes used commonly. \"Brunch\" is an example of a portmanteau word (breakfast + lunch). Lewis Carroll's \"snark\" (snake + shark) is also a portmanteau. Neologisms also can be created through abbreviation or acronym, by intentionally rhyming with existing words or simply through playing with sounds.\n\nNeologisms can become popular through memetics, by way of mass media, the Internet, and word of mouth, including academic discourse in many fields renowned for their use of distinctive jargon, and often become accepted parts of the language. Other times, however, they disappear from common use just as readily as they appeared. Whether a neologism continues as part of the language depends on many factors, probably the most important of which is acceptance by the public. It is unusual, however, for a word to enter common use if it does not resemble another word or words in an identifiable way.\n\nWhen a word or phrase is no longer \"new\", it is no longer a neologism. Neologisms may take decades to become \"old\", however. Opinions differ on exactly how old a word must be to cease being considered a neologism.\n\nPopular examples of neologism can be found in science, fiction, branding, literature, linguistic and popular culture. Examples include \"laser\" (1960) from Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation, \"robotics\" (1941), \"agitprop\" (1930).\n\nThe term \"neologism\" is first attested in English in 1772, borrowed from French \"néologisme\" (1734). A proponent of a new word or doctrine may be called a neologist. Neologists might study cultural and ethnic vernacular.\n\nThe term \"neologism\" has a broader meaning that includes not only \"an entirely new lexical item\" but also an existing word whose meaning has been altered. Sometimes, the latter process is called \"semantic shifting\", or \"semantic extension\". Neologisms are distinct from a person's \"idiolect\", one's unique patterns of vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.\n\nNeologisms are usually introduced when an individual or individuals find that a specific notion is lacking a term in a language, or when the existing vocabulary is insufficiently detailed. The law, governmental bodies, and technology have a relatively high frequency of acquiring neologisms. Another trigger that motivates neologists and protologists to coin a neologism is in order to disambiguate a previously existing term that may have been obscure or vague due to having multiple senses.\n\nNeologisms may come from a word used in the narrative of a book. Examples include \"grok\" from \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" by Robert A. Heinlein; \"McJob\" from \"\" by Douglas Coupland; \"cyberspace\" from \"Neuromancer\" by William Gibson and \"quark\" from James Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\".\n\nThe title of a book may become a neologism, for instance, \"Catch-22\" (from the title of Joseph Heller's novel). Alternatively, the author's name may give rise to the neologism, although the term is sometimes based on only one work of that author. This includes such words as \"Orwellian\" (from George Orwell, referring to his novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\") and \"Kafkaesque\" (from Franz Kafka).\n\nNames of famous characters are another source of literary neologisms, e.g. \"quixotic\" (referring to the title character in \"Don Quixote de la Mancha\" by Cervantes), \"scrooge\" (from the main character in Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol\") and \"pollyanna\" (from Eleanor H. Porter's book of the same name).\n\nCulture and technology use are major drivers in neologism development. Examples of recent pop-culture neologisms include Canadian \"Snowmageddon\", Russian \"Monstration\".\n\nIn these instances, words are used in small communities then spread through the use of social media. \"Doggo-Lingo\" specifically has spread primarily through Facebook group and Twitter account use. The suspected origin of this way of referring to dogs stems from a Facebook group created in 2008 and gaining popularity in 2014 in Australia. The Facebook group called DogSpotting posts pictures of dogs that members have seen with amusing captions, often using Doggo-Lingo. In Australian English it is common to use diminutives, often ending in –o, which could be where doggo-lingo was first used. The term has grown so that Merriam-Webster has acknowledged its use but notes the term needs to be found in published, edited work for a longer period of time before it can be deemed a new word making it the perfect example of a neologism.\n\nThe use and over-use of brand names is another example of neologism creation. The terms \"coke\" or \"cola\" may be used in reference to any Coca-Cola like beverage regardless of brand. Kleenex is used in reference to any facial tissue. Xerox or xerox-ing is used in reference to any photocopier or action of photocopying.\n\nNeologisms can also originate entirely online from social media and other forms of Internet media.\n\nBecause neologisms originate in one language, translations between languages can be difficult.\n\nIn the scientific community, where English is the predominant language for published research and studies, like-sounding translations (referred to as 'naturalization') are sometimes used. Alternatively, the English word is used along with a brief explanation of meaning.\nThe four translation methods are emphasized in order to translate neologisms: transliteration and transcription, the use of analogues, calque and loan translation.\n\nWhen translating from English to other languages, the naturalization method is most often used. The most common way that professional translators translate neologisms is through the Think aloud protocol (TAP), wherein translators find the most appropriate and natural sounding new word through speech. This way, translators are able to use potential translated neologisms in sentences and test them with different structures and syntax. Correct translations from English for specific purposes into other languages is crucial in various industries and legal systems. Inaccurate translations can lead to 'translation asymmetry' or conceptual misunderstandings which can lead to miscommunication. Many technical glossaries of English translations exist to combat this issue in the medical, judicial, and technological fields.\n\nIn psychiatry and neuroscience, the term \"neologism\" is used to describe words that have meaning only to the person who uses them, independent of their common meaning. The use of neologisms may also be due to aphasia acquired after brain damage resulting from a stroke or head injury.\n\nIn theology, a neologism refers to a relatively new doctrine (for example, Transcendentalism).\n\n"}

{"id": "1832038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832038", "title": "Phi features", "text": "Phi features\n\nIn linguistics, especially within generative grammar, phi features (denoted with the Greek letter φ 'phi') are the semantic features of person, number, gender, and case, as encoded in pronominal agreement with nouns and pronouns (the latter are said to consist only of phi-features, containing no lexical head). Several other features are included in the set of phi-features, such as the categorical features ±N (nominal) and ±V (verbal), which can be used to describe lexical categories and case features.\n\nPhi-features are often thought of as the \"silent\" features that exist on lexical heads (or, according to some theories, within the syntactic structure) that are understood for number, gender, person or reflexivity. Due to their silent nature, phi-features are often only understood if someone is a native speaker of a language, or if the translation includes a gloss of all these features. Many languages exhibit a pro-drop phenomenon which means that they rely on other lexical categories to determine the phi-features of the lexical heads.\n\nChomsky first proposed that the N node in a clause carries with it all the features to include person, number and gender. In English, we rely on nouns to determine the phi-features of a word, but other languages rely on inflections of the different parts of speech to determine person, number and gender of the nominal phrases to which they refer. Mainly verbs and adjectives are responsible for bearing inflections which signal the phi-features of a particular subject or object. Verbs appear to be responsible for carrying the most features and tend to carry person, number and gender agreements cross-linguistically for both subjects and objects. Adjectives also carry phi-features in some languages, they tend to agree in number and gender but rarely for person .\n\nIn English, person agreement is understood in the pronoun or noun overtly, while the verb carries the agreement marker to agree with the person phi-features on the Noun. For English, there is only one verb agreement required for the third person singular in the present tense (usually -s), as seen in the table Person Agreement for WALK: English. \n\nIn a null-subject language such as Italian, however, subjects are not required (in fact, in many null subject languages, producing overt subjects is a sign of non-nativity). Therefore, Italian uses a different inflectional morphology for each pronominal that is based not the person features of the nominal subject it agrees with:\n\n- Camminare (\"to walk\"):\ncammino (\"I walk)\", camminiamo (\"we walk\")\n\ncammini (\"you walk\"), camminate (\"you all walk\")\n\ncammina (\"he/she walks\"), camminano (\"they walk\")\nIn English, number agreement is not inflected on Verbs like they are in other languages. This is partly because English is a language that requires subjects and the subjects in English overtly express number. In English, number is a phi-feature that is understood on the noun. In terms of inflectional morphology, the most common in English is \"-s\" inflected on nouns that are plural:\n\n- Ducks, fridges, baseballs, cups, books, mirrors, cars, buildings, clowns, bridges, creams...\n\nSome cases of plurality in English require conjugation of the entire noun to express the phi-feature of plurality:\n\n- Men, women, mice, teeth...\n\nNeither verbs nor adjectives are used to agree with the phi-features of the noun that they are agreeing with in English.\nEnglish is a language that does not have gendered nominal phrases and pronouns (except in the case of proper names of nouns that are sentient beings who belong to a certain gender category) and does not have phi-feature agreement for gender. Many other languages of the world do have gendered nouns. German, for example, has three genders; feminine, masculine and neuter. Italian has two: feminine and masculine phi-features. For Italian, inflections on the adjectives and determiners are used for gender agreement within the pronominal phrase.\n\nReflexivity is overt in English for every person:\n\nmyself\", yourself\", himself, yourselves, ourselves, themselves\n\nIn many languages, reflexivity is not overt for person. A prime example is apparent in French \"se\". French \"se\" is used to express reflexivity for every expression of the third person. For this reason, some theories suggest that reflexive phi-features for languages such as French posit in a level on the syntactic structure that is silent, between the determiner and the noun.\n\nX'-theory approaches categorical features in this way: when a head X selects its' complement to project to X', the XP that it projects to then is a combination of the head X and all of its' categorical features, those being either nominal, verbal, adjectival or prepositional features.\n"}

Philosophical languages were popular in Early Modern times, partly motivated by the goal of recovering the lost Adamic or Divine language. The term ideal language is sometimes used near-synonymously, though more modern philosophical languages such as Toki Pona are less likely to involve such an exalted claim of perfection. It may be known as a language of pure ideology. The axioms and grammars of the languages together differ from commonly spoken languages today. \n\nIn most older philosophical languages, and some newer ones, words are constructed from a limited set of morphemes that are treated as \"elemental\" or fundamental. \"Philosophical language\" is sometimes used synonymously with \"taxonomic language\", though more recently there have been several conlangs constructed on philosophical principles which are not taxonomic. Vocabularies of oligosynthetic languages are made of compound words, which are coined from a small (theoretically minimal) set of morphemes; oligoisolating languages, such as Toki Pona, similarly use a limited set of root words but produce phrases which remain series of distinct words. \n\nToki Pona is based on minimalistic simplicity, incorporating elements of Taoism. Láadan is designed to lexicalize and grammaticalize the concepts and distinctions important to women, based on muted group theory. \n\nA priori languages are constructed languages where the vocabulary is invented directly, rather than being derived from other existing languages (as with Esperanto or Ido). Philosophical languages are almost all a priori languages, but most \"a priori\" languages are not philosophical languages. For example, Quenya, Sindarin, and Klingon are all \"a priori\" but not philosophical languages: they are meant to seem like natural languages, even though they have no genetic relation to any natural languages.\n\nWork on philosophical languages was pioneered by Francis Lodwick (\"A Common Writing\", 1647; \"The Groundwork or Foundation laid (or So Intended) for the Framing of a New Perfect Language and a Universal Common Writing\", 1652), Sir Thomas Urquhart (\"Logopandecteision\", 1652), George Dalgarno (\"Ars signorum\", 1661), and John Wilkins (\"An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language\", 1668). Those were systems of hierarchical classification that were intended to result in both spoken and written expression. In 1855, English writer George Edmonds modified Wilkins' system, leaving its taxonomy intact, but changing the grammar, orthography and pronunciation of the language in an effort to make it easier to speak and to read.\n\nGottfried Leibniz created \"lingua generalis\" (or \"lingua universalis\") in 1678, aiming to create a lexicon of characters upon which the user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically; as a side effect he developed binary calculus.\n\nThese projects aimed not only to reduce or model grammar, but also to arrange all human knowledge into \"characters\" or hierarchies. This idea ultimately led to the \"Encyclopédie\", in the Age of Enlightenment. Leibniz and the encyclopedists realized that it is impossible to organize human knowledge unequivocally as a tree, and so impossible to construct an \"a priori\" language based on such a classification of concepts. Under the entry \"Charactère\", D'Alembert critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century. \n\nAfter the \"Encyclopédie\", projects for \"a priori\" languages moved more and more to the fringe. Individual authors, typically unaware of the history of the idea, continued to propose taxonomic philosophical languages until the early 20th century (for example, Ro). More recent philosophical languages have usually moved away from taxonomic schemata, such as 21st century Ithkuil by John Quijada.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10511206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10511206", "title": "Register complex", "text": "Register complex\n\nIn linguistics, a register complex is a combination of phonation type, pitch, length, vowel quality and/or other variants that function dependently as distinguishing features within a single phonological system. In languages employing register systems, differences in a distinguishing feature correlate relative to the quality of another distinguishing feature.\n\nFor instance, in a system where pitch, voice quality and stress timing were distinguishing features, the meaning of a vowel-consonant cluster like \"Pai\" (as in the English word \"Pie\") may depend on whether the cluster is voiced in a high, medium or low pitch relative to the clearness, breathiness and glotteral quality of speech, as well as relative to the duration of the cluster relative to other neighboring clusters. Thus, \"Pai\" voiced in a high tone with a breathy quality and unstressed along with other unstressed clusters would connote a different meaning if any of the three features changed relative to other features.\n\nMany register languages are tonal. However, tone is not a universal distinguishing feature among register systems and register complexes are not a component of most tonal languages. In fact, tonal languages can employ either a register tone systems or a contour tone systems. Mandarin has a contour tone system, where the distinguishing feature of the tones are their shifts in pitch (their pitch shapes or contours, such as rising, falling, dipping, or peaking) rather than simply their pitch relative to each other as in a register tone system. Register tone systems are found in Bantu languages and throughout Africa. In some register tone systems, there is a default tone, usually low in a two-tone system or mid in a three-tone system, that is more common and less salient than other tones. There are also languages that combine register and contour tones, such as the Kru languages, though in such cases the register tones may be analysed as being 'level' (unvarying pitch) contour tones. Furthermore, often the term 'register,' when not in the phrase 'register tone,' is used to indicate vowel phonation combined with tone in a single phonological system. Burmese, Khmer and possibly Vietnamese are register languages. Burmese is usually considered a tonal language and Khmer a vowel-phonation language, but in both cases differences in relative pitch or pitch contours are correlated with vowel phonation, so that neither exists independently.\n"}

RID is the only organization in the United States that credentials both d/Deaf and Hearing interpreters to provide services in a wide range of settings, as well as test and certify interpreters for legal work. The RID Board is committed to the \"4 R's\" which are: Roots, Respect, Relevance and Results. As of 2014 there were over 15,000 members and 58 affiliate chapters. \n\nSince August 2004, RID has been building stronger ties with the National Association of the Deaf (NAD), including a joint Code of Professional Ethics and the merging of their respective certification programs. They jointly developed the National Interpreter Certification test (NIC), which was adopted in 2005.\n\nRID is headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, with a roughly $3,000,000 annual budget and around 20 employees. The association's operations are led by an executive director (currently vacant) and governed by an eleven-member board of directors. \n\nRID is governed by an eleven-member board of directors elected directly by the voting membership for a two-year term. Voting rights are determined by being a member in good standing of both RID (in the certified or associate category) and a sanctioned affiliate chapter. The board is made up of the following positions: \nFollowing the expiration of the president's term, they serve an ex officio non-voting term on the board of directors as Immediate Past President. \n\nThe Executive Board consists of the President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Member-at-Large, and Deaf Member-at-Large, and is elected on odd years for two-year terms. The regional representative positions are elected on even years for two-year terms. \n\nTo run for election to the Executive Board, members must collect 25 nomination signatures from voting members with at least one from each region of RID. Regional representative candidates must collect 25 nomination signatures from within their region. All positions except the Member-at Large require the candidate to be certified member of RID for four consecutive years prior to candidacy. Member-at-Large requires either associate or certified membership in RID for four consecutive years prior to candidacy. Additionally, regional representative candidates must have resided in their region at least two years prior to candidacy. If there are more than one candidates, an election is held via on-line balloting. p\n\nThe 2007–2018 board of directors are as follows:\n\nRID operations are conducted by a paid staff led by an Executive Director. Since 2014, RID has not had a permanent Executive Director following the departure of Shane Feldman. The board contracted with Anna Witter-Merithew who served as Interim Executive Director until August 2017. Since that time, the board has served as Executive Director through President Melvin Walker while continuing a permanent Executive Director search.\n\nAs part of their push to improve the ethical behavior of practitioners in the field, RID revised and updated existing guidelines from the Code of Ethics. In 2005, the Code of Professional Conduct was adopted as the newest set of principles interpreters should adhere to. Certified interpreters have an especially strong duty to follow the principles laid out by RID, for the integrity of the work, the well being of the stakeholders, and to avoid causing harm.\n\nThe tenets from the current Code of Professional Conduct are:\n\n\nRID has a national certification system with three key components: \n\n\nIn previous incarnations of the NTS, the following certifications were given to interpreters meeting the testing criteria (All credentials awarded by the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf will remain valid as long as the holder of said certification(s) maintains their membership and maintenance program.):\n\nPreviously offered certificates:\n\n\nCurrently offered certificates:\n\n\nRID granted certified membership to holders of the defunct NAD certification at levels III, IV and V as well as those who pass the Educational Interpreter Performance Assessment (EIPA) at proficiency level 4.0 with a passing score on the EIPA written exam. The certifications for these members are listed as:\nNo new certified member status is being granted for any of these categories. \n\nAs of July 2005, a new certification test, developed with the NAD, was implemented and the CI and CT tests began to be phased out. The new generalist certification for hearing interpreters is the NAD-RID National Interpreter Certification (NIC). In 2015 NAD decided to withdraw its involvement from the NIC resulting its name being removed from the test. \n\nRID formed a limited liability company called the Center for Assessment of Sign Language Interpretation (CASLI) in 2015 to carry out all testing functions. CASLI is a wholly owned subsidiary, supported operationally by RID headquarters staff and governed by a Managing Board that reports to the RID Board of Directors. As of 2017, the Board of Managers consisted of: \n\nIn 2017, CASLI's operations began direct supervision by Star Grieser, CDI who reports to the RID Deputy Director. \n\nCASLI's formation began a clearer philosophical and practical split of certification from professional testing. Under this new scheme, CASLI is granted greater autonomy to design, prepare and conduct generalist testing for both Deaf and hearing interpreters. RID retains the function of certifying interpreters based on their testing results and other certification criteria. As such, the EPS and CMP systems remain under RID's direct control. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "3911668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3911668", "title": "Screaming", "text": "Screaming\n\nA scream, shout, yell, shriek, hoot, holler, vociferation, outcry, bellow, or raising one's voice, is a loud vocalization in which air is passed through the vocal folds with greater force than is used in regular or close-distance vocalisation. This can be performed by any creature possessing lungs, including humans. There are slight differences in meaning among them; for example, \"scream\" and \"shriek\" generally refer to a higher-pitched, sharp sound, used by some birds and other animals, and a \"hoot\", such as emitted by an owl, usually does not involve words.\n\nA scream is often an instinctive or reflex action, with a strong emotional aspect, like fear, pain, surprise, joy, anger, etc.\n\nA large number of words exist to describe the act of making loud vocalizations, whether intentionally or in response to stimuli, and with specific nuances. For example, an early twentieth century synonym guide places variations under the heading of \"call\", and includes as synonyms, bawl, bellow, clamor, cry (out), ejaculate, exclaim, roar, scream, shout, shriek, vociferate, and yell, each with its own implications. This source states:\n\nAnother source proposes different implications for some of these terms, stating that \"the call is normally addressed to a specific person... and the shout projected to a distant but identifiable target, the holler is emitted to whomever may be within earshot\". Whooping is another name given to the same kind of noise making as hollering. This source separately notes that a shout \"may be angry or joyous; it may be directed to one person or many; and, sometimes, its purpose may be merely for the satisfaction of release or of hearing an echo\".\n\nIn psychology the scream is an important theme in the theories of Arthur Janov. In his book \"The Primal Scream\", Janov claims that the cure for neurosis is to confront the patient with his suppressed pain resulting from an experienced trauma. This confrontation gives birth to a scream. Janov believes that it is not necessary that it heals the patient from his trauma. The scream is only a form of expression of primal pain, which comes from one’s childhood, and the reliving of this pain and its expression. This finally appears through the scream and can cure the patient from his neurosis.\n\nJanov describes the primal scream as very distinctive and unmistakable. It is a “strangely low, rattling and involuntary sound. […] Some people are moaning, groaning and are coiling themselves up. […] One screams as result of all the other times when it had to stay still, was making fun of, was humiliated or was beaten up”. Janov also says that the primal scream has series of reactions; “the patients that could not even say “piep” at home, suddenly feels powerful. The scream seems to be a liberating experience”. Janov noticed this with all his patients. Women who seem to have baby-voices during the therapy are developing with their primal scream a very low voice.\n\nGregory Whitehead, founder of the \"Institute for Screamscape Studies\", believes that the voice is used to focus the power: “scream used to be a psychological weapon both for you and against your opponent, it raises confidence to the person using it. Creating power with yell is having to affect someone without touching them”. In this case screaming is a protective weapon, as also often used by animals, who scream as an expression of power or during fights with another animals.\n\nScreaming and yelling are also a means of expressing pleasure. Studies on monkeys have shown that when female monkeys scream during sex, it helps the male ejaculate. An approximation of 86 percent of the times, where female monkeys screamed during sexual encounter, brought a 59 percent of success rate, in comparison to the 2 percent, without the female-scream.\nGayle Brewer of the University of Central Lancashire and Colin Hendrie of the University of Leeds made a similar research with women, that shows that women also do scream often during intercourse as an encouragement for their partner to do \"a better job\".\n\nGregory Whitehead defines the giving birth scream as a \"yes scream\", because it expresses an opening into the world for a new human who begins life by screaming. Women describe this scream as unpremeditated and a reaction to the surprise of the baby’s head coming out. Some actually call this moment \"orgasmic pleasure\".\n\nThis moment is considered by most women to be very euphoric, that apparently some women are screaming of pain, pleasure and enthusiasm at the same time.\n\nIna May Gaskin, one of the biggest promoters of the natural birth, is also encouraging women to make out with their man during birth as this helps their state of mind.\n\nReni Celeste, film philosopher and publisher, notes about Michel Chion, composer, that he “locates the scream in the voice of the female and compares it to the female orgasm. The male, he explains, does not scream, he shouts. The shout marks territory, exercising will and structure. Tarzan shouts. The female scream reaches the infinite, it is a sound or cry at the brink of death. The male shout structures, the female scream opens a black hole to the limitless. The male director seeks to master the scream but he cannot-just as the female cannot herself master the scream. It exceeds control of both genders. In the scream speech reaches utter silence”.\n\nJanov believes that for babies, screaming is the only form of communication he or she can have; it is the only way a baby can express his necessities, that he needs food, he is in pain or he simply needs some love. Janov writes, “screaming is a language – a primitive one, but a human language”.\n\nDiana König, journalist and broadcasting author, writes: “If the scream of babies is their first communication method, then the scream of adults is a recession from communication. By screaming, in the opposite of calling, the voice becomes overloaded and over-amplified, and it loses its control, its fundamental sound”. The scream is there before language and it appears where the language reaches its limits.\n\nElaine Scarry, writer and literature professor, talks about language in connection to pain and she thinks that pain almost destroys the language because it brings people back into a state where sounds and screams are dominating as they were their means of communication before they learned how to speak. Pain cannot actually be communicated, as it is a personal experience and can only be experienced individually. Pain, as any other concept, is actually an individual experience that can only be communicated as an idea and it also is to be interpreted as. Hegel writes: “The biggest relief when having pain is to be able to scream it out […] through this expression, the pain becomes objective and this makes the connection between the subject, who is alone in pain, and the object, that is not in pain.”\n\nArnal and colleague demonstrated that human screams exploit a unique acoustic property, roughness, that selectively activates the auditory brain as well as the amygdala, a deep brain structure involved in danger processing.\n\n\"The Scream\" () is the popular name given to each of four versions of a composition, created as both paintings and pastels, by the Expressionist artist Edvard Munch between 1893 and 1910. \"Der Schrei der Natur\" (\"The Scream of Nature\") is the title Munch gave to these works, all of which show a figure with an agonized expression against a landscape with a tumultuous orange sky. Arthur Lubow has described \"The Scream\" as \"an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time.\"\n\nIn music there are long traditions of scream in rock, punk rock, heavy metal, rock and roll and emo music. Vocalists are developing various techniques of screaming that results in different ways of screaming. In rock and metal music singers are developing very demanding guttural and growled sounds.\n\nScream is also used predominant as an esthetic element in “cante jondo”, a vocal style in flamenco. The name of this style is translated as “deep sing”. The origins of flamenco and also of its name are still not clear. Flamenco is related to the gypsies’ music and it is said to have appeared in Andalusia in Spain. In cante jondo, that is a subdivision of flamenco, which is considered to be more serious and deep, the singer is reduced to the most rudimentary method of expression, which is the cry and the scream. Ricardo Molima, a Spanish poet, wrote \"flamenco is the primal scream in its primitive form, from a people sunk in poverty and ignorance. Thus, the original flamenco song could be described as a type of self-therapy.” \n\nDavid N. Green, musician, writer and composer, wrote in 1987 an essay about musicians using screams as a singing technique in music. He makes the distinction between harmonic scream that relates to the harmony of the music and has components of tonality, the true scream that is atonal, the lyrical scream that is related with the song’s lyrics and the pure scream that is not. The harmonic scream is the scream that is still very clear and has a defined pitch and that I actually relate to a fake scream, as it has no great disturbance, the lyrical scream that is related to words, most of the time swearing and the pure scream or the true scream, that in this case can also be called as the real scream or the primal scream.\n\nScream in music can also be seen in other ways than just a vocal action. Many musicians use scream as an inspirational source for their playing with instruments. This is usually represented in a loud hit on the instrument’s chords, in the case of the instruments that have chords, or a loud striking note, on the blowing instruments.\n\n\"Pressure of the unspeakable\" is a radio feature work by Gregory Whitehead. Initiated in 1991 the project started with the founding of the \"Institute of the Screamscape studies\" where people were asked through radio and television to call on a hot line and scream. Whitehead notes: “In addition to framing the nervous system, the telephone-microphone-tape-recorder-radio circuitry also provided the key for the acoustic demarcation of pressure in the system: distortion, the disruption of digital codes, pure unmanageable noise. The scream as an eruption in excess of prescribed circuitries, as capable of “ blowing” communications technologies not designed for such extreme and unspeakable meanings”. \nWhitehead gathered slowly an archive of screams that was edited and resulted in a theoretical narrative radio feature. \nAllen S. Weiss notes about his work that “the screamscape lies beyond any possible determination of authenticity”. The people’s vociferations are just manifestations that through their anonymity create a sense of togetherness.\n\nActors are taught from the beginning of their careers how to scream correctly. They learn how to awaken that uncomfortable feeling in the listener without necessarily having to have any psychological attachment.\n\nAntonin Artaud's' last written work \"To have done with the judgment of god\" was Artaud's last written work that was recorded by him for the French radio in 1947. One day before it was scheduled, the director of the radio prohibited it for strong anti-religious and anti-American reasons. The piece consists of intensive texts with interludes of instrumental and vocal improvised sounds and screams.\nAllen S. Weiss writes about Antonin Artaud’s scream: “the scream is the expulsion of an unbearable, impossible internal polarization between life’s forces and death’s negation, simultaneously signifying and simulation creation and destruction […] scream, as a nonmaterial double of excrement, may be both expression and expulsion, a sign of birth creation and frustration […] the scream is the desublimation of speech into the body, in opposition to the sublimation of body into meaningful speech”.\n\nThe extreme character of the scream has a life danger element that stands for denying of death. In Artaud’s case, a person that was always very close to death and has been calling himself so ever since having strong shock therapies, the scream represents exactly this border between life and death, creation and destruction, of art work and of oneself.\n\nArtaud’s screams are mostly related to words. The small interludes that are in between the texts parts sometimes contain screams.\n\nMarina Abramovic used scream as an element in different performances: together with Ulay in \"AAA AAA\", the two are facing each other and are gradually screaming louder and louder while getting closer and closer to each other's face, until they both lose their voice; \"Freeing the voice\", where Abramovic is staying with her head upside down and screaming till she is left with no voice anymore.\n\nSome people, when arguing begin to raise their voices to the point that they are screaming at each other in anger while continuing their debate exchange. Terminology includes \"shouting match\".\n\nDrill instructors frequently shout orders at trainees to train recruits into the military culture whilst fostering obedience and expedience.\n\nThe volume levels of outcries may be very high, and this has become an issue in the sport of tennis, particularly with regards to Maria Sharapova's loud tennis grunts which have been measured as high as 101.2 decibels. The loudest verified scream emitted by a human measured 129 dBA, a record set by teaching assistant Jill Drake in 2000.\n"}

In this approach, words that don’t contribute to the representation are void; they can only provide a figurative expression. Examples of phrases which lack a secondary reference are 'a black Monday' (unless it is used figuratively) and Bernard Bolzano's 'round quadrangle'. Alexius Meinong's Types of objects can be mentioned here, too.\n\nIn the first case, one may have a representation of a Monday (or at least of something one calls a Monday), as well as of something black, but not of a 'black Monday', since these qualities don’t combine ('Monday' being too abstract to be combined with a concrete quality such as a color). In the second case, there is an incongruity: a quadrangle can be represented, but not a round one; conversely, there can be a circle, but it can’t be square. It may, therefore, be debated whether a representation is created here.\n\nAnother example is presented by George Berkeley. He says: \"[...] Does it not require some pains and skill to form the general idea of a triangle (which is yet none of the most abstract, comprehensive and difficult) for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural, nor scalenon, but \"all and none\" of these at once?\" (\"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge\", Introduction, section 13.) Berkeley is here criticizing John Locke, demonstrating that each representation is particular (i.e., individual).\n\nWhether there is a meaning or not depends on the individual person: it is possible that a sentence has a meaning according to A, whereas B can’t discern any. This may, e.g., result from relevant knowledge which A possesses and B lacks, as in the case where one should decide the answer to the question 'Is 15 a prime number?' and A knows what a prime number is and B doesn’t; the sentence then doesn’t have a meaning for B.\n\n"}

The opposite of verbosity is plain language.\nSome teachers, including the author of \"The Elements of Style\", warn writers not to be verbose. Similarly, some authors, including Mark Twain and Ernest Hemingway, are known for their avoidance of verbosity. \n\nSynonyms for verbosity include wordiness, verbiage, prolixity, grandiloquence, garrulousness, expatiation, logorrhea, and sesquipedalianism. \n\nExamples of verbosity are common in political speech, academic prose, and other genres.\n\nThe word \"verbosity\" comes from Latin \"verbosus\", \"wordy\". There are many other English words that also refer to the use of excessive words.\n\n\"Prolixity\" comes from Latin \"prolixus\", \"extended\". \"Prolixity\" can also be used to refer to the length of a monologue or speech, especially a formal address such as a lawyer's oral argument.\n\n\"Grandiloquence\" is complex speech or writing judged to be pompous or bombastic diction. It is a combination of the Latin words \"grandis\" (\"great\") and \"loqui\" (\"to speak\").\n\n\"Logorrhea\" or \"logorrhoea\" (from Greek λογόρροια, \"logorrhoia\", \"word-flux\") is an excessive flow of words. It is often used pejoratively to describe prose that is hard to understand because it is needlessly complicated or uses excessive jargon. The term is also sometimes applied to unnecessarily wordy speech in general.\n\n\"Sesquipedalianism\" is a linguistic style that involves the use of long words. Roman poet Horace coined the phrase \"sesquipedalia verba\" in his Ars Poetica. It is a compound of \"sesqui\", \"one and a half\", and \"pes\", \"foot\", a reference to meter. The earliest recorded usage in English of \"sesquipedalian\" is in 1656, and of \"sesquipedalianism\", 1863.\n\n\"Garrulous\" comes from Latin \"garrulus\", \"talkative\", a form of the verb \"garrīre\", \"to chatter\". The adjective may describe a person who is excessively talkative, especially about trivial matters, or a speech that is excessively wordy or diffuse\n\nThe noun \"expatiation\" and the verb \"expatiate\" come from Latin \"expatiātus\", past participle from \"spatiārī\", \"to wander\". They refer to enlarging a discourse, text, or description.\n\nThe word \"logorrhea\" is often used pejoratively to describe highly abstract prose that contains little concrete language. Since abstract writing is hard to visualize, it often seems confusing or excessive. Works in academic fields that involve many abstract ideas, such as philosophy, often fail to include extensive concrete examples of their ideas.\nIn an attempt to prove that \"logorrhea\" accompanies a lack of academic rigor, physics professor Alan Sokal wrote a nonsensical essay, and had it published in a respected journal (\"Social Text\") as a practical joke. The journal defended the article as genuine even after Sokal denounced his own article publicly. The episode has come to be known as the Sokal Affair.\n\nThe term is sometimes also applied to unnecessarily wordy speech in general; this is more usually referred to as \"prolixity\". Some people defend the use of additional words as idiomatic, a matter of artistic preference, or helpful in explaining complex ideas or messages.\n\nWarren G. Harding, the 29th President of the United States, was notably verbose even in his era. A Democratic leader, William Gibbs McAdoo, described Harding's speeches as \"an army of pompous phrases moving across the landscape in search of an idea.\"\n\nSenator Robert C. Byrd (Democrat, of West Virginia) lost his position as Majority Leader in 1989 because his colleagues felt his speeches, which often employed obscure allusions to ancient Rome and Greece, were not an asset to the party base.\n\nThe \"Michigan Law Review\" published a 229-page parody of postmodern writing titled \"Pomobabble: Postmodern Newspeak and Constitutional 'Meaning' for the Uninitiated\". The article consists of complicated and context-sensitive self-referencing narratives. The text is peppered with number of parenthetical citations and asides, which is supposed to mock the cluttered style of postmodern writing.\n\nIn \"The King's English\", Fowler gives a passage from \"The Times\" as an example of verbosity: \"\"The Emperor\" received yesterday and to-day General Baron von Beck... It may therefore be assumed with some confidence that the terms of a feasible solution are maturing themselves in \"His Majesty's\" mind and may form the basis of further negotiations with Hungarian party leaders when \"the Monarch\" goes again to Budapest.\" Fowler objected to this passage because \"The Emperor\", \"His Majesty\", and \"the Monarch\" all refer to the same person: \"the effect\", he pointed out in \"Modern English Usage\", \"is to set readers wondering what the significance of the change is, only to conclude that there is none.\"\n\nWhile verbosity may be rhetorically useful verbose parts in communications are sometimes referred to as \"fluff\" or \"fuzz\".\n\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Callimachus is quoted as saying \"Big book, big evil\" (μέγα βιβλίον μέγα κακόν, \"mega biblion, mega kakon\"), rejecting the epic style of poetry in favor of his own.\n\nWilliam Strunk, an American professor of English advised in 1918 to \"Use the active voice: Put statements in positive form; Omit needless words.\"\n\nIn \"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage\" (1926) Henry Watson Fowler says, \"It is the second-rate writers, those intent rather on expressing themselves prettily than on conveying their meaning clearly, & still more those whose notions of style are based on a few misleading rules of thumb, that are chiefly open to the allurements of elegant variation,\" Fowler's term for the over-use of synonyms. Contrary to Fowler's criticism of several words being used to name the same thing in English prose, in some other languages, including French, it might be thought to be a good writing style.\n\nMark Twain (1835–1910) wrote \"generally, the fewer the words that fully communicate or evoke the intended ideas and feelings, the more effective the communication.\"\n\nErnest Hemingway (1899–1961), the 1954 Nobel laureate for literature, defended his concise style against a charge by William Faulkner that he \"had never been known to use a word that might send the reader to the dictionary.\" Hemingway responded by saying, \"Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don't know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use.\"\n\nAn inquiry into the 2005 London bombings found that verbosity can be dangerous if used by emergency services. It can lead to delay that could cost lives.\n\nA 2005 study from the psychology department of Princeton University found that using long and obscure words does not make people seem more intelligent. Dr. Daniel M. Oppenheimer did research which showed that students rated short, concise texts as being written by the most intelligent authors. But those who used long words or complex font types were seen as less intelligent.\n\nIn William Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\", one of Polonius's many sententious maxims reads \nShakespeare's audiences were not necessarily inclined to read Polonius as someone who is perfectly wise; his sentences, like that of much early modern drama, can easily be seen as part of a comic trope.\n\nGeorge Orwell mocked logorrhea in \"Politics and the English Language\" (1946) by taking verse (9:11) from the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible\n\n\"I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.\"\n\nand rewriting it as\n\n\"Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.\"\n\nQuantum physicist Richard Feynman has also spoken out against verbosity in scientific writing. \n"}

{"id": "1189233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1189233", "title": "Word count", "text": "Word count\n\nThe word count is the number of words in a document or passage of text. Word counting may be needed when a text is required to stay within certain numbers of words. This may particularly be the case in academia, legal proceedings, journalism and advertising. Word count is commonly used by translators to determine the price for the translation job. Word counts may also be used to calculate measures of readability and to measure typing and reading speeds (usually in words per minute). When converting character counts to words, a measure of 5 or 6 characters to a word is generally used for English.\n\nVariations in the operational definitions of how to count the words can occur (namely, what \"counts as\" a word, and which words \"don't count\" toward the total). However, especially since the advent of widespread word processing, there is a broad consensus on these operational definitions (and hence the bottom-line integer result). The consensus is to accept the text segmentation rules generally found in most word processing software (including how word boundaries are determined, which depends on how word dividers are defined). The first trait of that definition is that a space (any of various whitespace characters, such as a \"regular\" word space, an em space, or a tab character) is a word divider. Usually a hyphen or a slash is, too. Different word counting programs may give varying results, depending on the text segmentation rule details, and on whether words outside the main text (such as footnotes, endnotes, or hidden text) are counted. But the behavior of most major word processing applications is broadly similar.\n\nHowever, during the era when school assignments were done in handwriting or with typewriters, the rules for these definitions often differed from today's consensus. Most importantly, many students were drilled on the rule that \"certain words don't count\", usually articles (namely, \"a\", \"an\", \"the\"), but sometimes also others, such as conjunctions (for example, \"and\", \"or\", \"but\") and some prepositions (usually \"to\", \"of\"). Hyphenated permanent compounds such as \"follow-up\" (noun) or \"long-term\" (adjective) were counted as one word. To save the time and effort of counting word-by-word, often a rule of thumb for the average number of words per line was used, such as 10 words per line. These \"rules\" have fallen by the wayside in the word processing era; the \"word count\" feature of such software (which follows the text segmentation rules mentioned earlier) is now the standard arbiter, because it is largely consistent (across documents and applications) and because it is fast, effortless, and costless (already included with the application).\n\nAs for which sections of a document \"count\" toward the total (such as footnotes, endnotes, abstracts, reference lists and bibliographies, tables, figure captions, hidden text), the person in charge (teacher, client) can define their choice, and users (students, workers) can simply select (or exclude) the elements accordingly, and watch the word count automatically update.\n\nModern web browsers support word counting via extensions, via a JavaScript bookmarklet, or a script that is hosted in a website. Most word processors can also count words. Unix-like systems include a program, \"wc\", specifically for word counting. There are a wide variety of word counting tools available online.\n\nAs explained earlier, different word counting programs may give varying results, depending on the text segmentation rule details. The exact number of words often is not a strict requirement, thus the variation is acceptable.\n\nNovelist Jane Smiley suggests that length is an important quality of the novel. However, novels can vary tremendously in length; Smiley lists novels as typically being between 100,000 and 175,000 words, while National Novel Writing Month requires its novels to be at least 50,000 words. There are no firm rules: for example, the boundary between a novella and a novel is arbitrary and a literary work may be difficult to categorise. But while the length of a novel is to a large extent up to its writer, lengths may also vary by subgenre; many chapter books for children start at a length of about 16,000 words, and a typical mystery novel might be in the 60,000 to 80,000 word range while a thriller could be well over 100,000 words.\n\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America specifies word lengths for each category of its Nebula award categories:\n\nThe acceptable length of an academic dissertation varies greatly, dependent predominantly on the subject. Numerous American universities limit Ph.D. dissertations to 100,000 words, barring special permission for exceeding this limit.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "664811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=664811", "title": "Writer's block", "text": "Writer's block\n\nWriter's block is a condition, primarily associated with writing, in which an author loses the ability to produce new work, or experiences a creative slowdown. The condition ranges in difficulty from coming up with original ideas to being unable to produce a work for years. Throughout history, writer's block has been a documented problem.\n\nProfessionals who have struggled with the affliction include authors such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Joseph Mitchell, comic strip cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, composer Sergei Rachmaninoff, and songwriter Adele. Research concerning this topic was done in the late 1970s and 1980s. During this time, researchers were influenced by the Process and Post-Process movements, and therefore focused specifically on the writer's processes. The condition was first described in 1947 by psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler. However, some great writers may have already suffered from writer’s block years before Bergler described it, such as Herman Melville, who quit writing novels a few years after writing \"Moby-Dick\".\n\nWriter's block may have several causes. Some are creative problems that originate within an author's work itself. A writer may run out of inspiration, or be distracted by other events. A fictional example can be found in George Orwell's novel \"Keep the Aspidistra Flying\", in which the protagonist Gordon Comstock struggles in vain to complete an epic poem describing a day in London: \"It was too big for him, that was the truth. It had never really progressed, it had simply fallen apart into a series of fragments.\"\n\nOther blocks may be produced by adverse circumstances in a writer's life or career: physical illness, depression, the end of a relationship, financial pressures, or a sense of failure. The pressure to produce work may in itself contribute to writer's block, especially if they are compelled to work in ways that are against their natural inclination (i.e. with a deadline or an unsuitable style or genre). Writer's block may also come from feeling intimidated by one's previous big successes. The writer Elizabeth Gilbert, reflecting on her post-bestseller prospects, proposed that such a pressure might be released by interpreting creative writers as \"having\" genius rather than \"being\" a genius.\n\nIt has been suggested that writer's block is more than just a mentality. Under stress, a human brain will \"shift control from the cerebral cortex to the limbic system\". The limbic system is associated with the instinctual processes, such as \"fight or flight\" response; and behavior that is based on \"deeply engrained training\". The limited input from the cerebral cortex hinders a person's creative processes, which are replaced by the behaviors associated with the limbic system. The person is often unaware of the change, which may lead them to believe they are creatively \"blocked\". In her 2004 book \"The Midnight Disease: The Drive to Write, Writer's Block, and the Creative Brain\" (), the writer and neurologist Alice W. Flaherty has argued that literary creativity is a function of specific areas of the brain, and that block may be the result of brain activity being disrupted in those areas.\n\nFor a composition perspective, Lawrence Oliver says, in his article, \"Helping Students Overcome Writer's Block\", \"Students receive little or no advice on how to generate ideas or explore their thoughts, and they usually must proceed through the writing process without guidance or corrective feedback from the teacher, who withholds comments and criticism until grading the final product.\" He says, students \"learn to write by writing\", and often they are insecure and/or paralyzed by rules.\n\nPhyllis Koestenbaum wrote in her article \"The Secret Climate the Year I Stopped Writing\" about her trepidation toward writing, claiming it was tied directly to her instructor's response. She says, \"I needed to write to feel, but without feeling I couldn't write.\" To contrast Koestenbaum experience, Nancy Sommers expressed her belief that papers do not end when students finish writing and that neither should instructors' comments. She urges a \"partnership\" between writers and instructors so that responses become a conversation.\n\nJames Adams notes in his book, \"Conceptual Blockbusting\", various reasons blocks occur include fear of taking a risk, \"chaos\" in the pre-writing stage, judging versus generating ideas, an inability to incubate ideas, or a lack of motivation.\n\nAs far as strategies for coping with writer's block Clark describes: class and group discussion, journals, free writing and brainstorming, clustering, list making, and engaging with the text. To overcome writing blocks, Oliver suggests asking writers questions to uncover their writing process. Then he recommends solutions such as systematic questioning, freewriting, and encouragement. A recent study of 2500 writers aimed to find techniques that writers themselves use to overcome writer's block. The research discovered a range of solutions from altering the time of day to write and setting deadlines to lowering expectations and using mindfulness meditation. \n\nGarbriele Lusser Rico's concern with the mind links to brain lateralization, also explored by Rose and Linda Flowers and John R. Hayes among others. Rico's book, \"Writing the Natural Way\" looks into invention strategies, such as clustering, which has been noted to be an invention strategy used to help writers overcome their blocks, and further emphasizes the solutions presented in works by Rose, Oliver, and Clark. Similar to Rico, James Adams discusses right brain involvement in writing. While Downey purposes that he is basing his approach in practical concerns, his concentration on right brain techniques speaks to cognitive theory approach similar to Rico's and a more practical advice for writers to approach their writer's block.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34509791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34509791", "title": "Writing about Writing", "text": "Writing about Writing\n\nWriting about Writing (WAW), is a method or theory of teaching composition which puts emphasis on reading and writing about writing in the writing course, and reimagines first-year composition as an \"introduction to writing studies.\" This is not to say WAW only teaches a first-year writing course as if it were an introduction to a writing major, but rather it advocates merging the \"how\" of writing with its practice. An introduction course to a writing major has both a different audience and purpose than a first-year composition course framed in WAW. The development of WAW is largely credited to Elizabeth Wardle and Douglas Downs after the publication of their 2007 article \"Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions.\"\n\nComposition is not widely recognized as its own discipline. Composition instructors strive to teach students how to become better writers. As public perception often shapes public policy, this uninformed view of composition as a legitimate field of study has contributed to a lack of funding and emphasis on composition classes in academia.\n\nIn 2007, Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle published an article titled \"Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions\" in which they propose a reform of first-year composition instruction based on the results of a test course they developed. This course sought \"to improve students' understanding of writing, rhetoric, language, and literacy\" and promoted a view of reading and writing as scholarly inquiry, encouraging \"more realistic conceptions of writing.\" The article is considered to be revolutionary by other scholars in the field, and it's frequently cited by those who have continued the work in the WAW movement.\n\nIn the article, Downs and Wardle deny the existence of a universal educated discourse, which conflicts with first-year composition goals of preparing students to write across the curriculum. Downs and Wardle write that teaching students how to write across the curriculum supports the idea that \"writing is not a real subject, that writing courses do not require expert instructors, and that rhetoric and composition are not genuine research areas or legitimate intellectual pursuits.\"\n\nThe article goes on to outline the course they designed that is centered more on teaching the students about \"writing studies\", rather than how to write in college. The authors discuss readers, research assignments, reflective assignments and presentation assignments before going on to report case-studies of two students who took Downs' and Wardle's WAW-centered first-year composition course. While these were different types of students who had different learning outcomes, both stories illustrate the flexible nature of WAW and how this type of course can be tailored towards individual student needs. The authors discuss several benefits they observed of using WAW to teach first-year composition, but also indicate the presence of challenges associated with teaching this kind of course, and address both these challenges as well as critiques they received from colleagues.\n\nThe authors conclude that an implementation of WAW-centered classes in first-year composition professionalizes writing instruction, and raises awareness about writing studies as a legitimate discipline. Downs and Wardle write \"rather than purporting to teach students 'academic writing' and claiming to prepare them for writing in their disciplines, the course teaches students what we as a field have learned about writing as an object of study.\" Essentially, the aim of a WAW course is to demonstrate how writing works.\n\nAfter its publication, the article caused a stir in academia and received a lot of response from the community, prompting a follow-up article by Wardle in 2008 titled \"Continuing the Dialogue: Follow-up Comments on 'Teaching about Writing, Righting\nMisconceptions.'\" In it, Wardle addresses responders who commented that she and Downs put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field by explaining that first-year composition should not hold more value than other branches within their field, but it is of importance and merits scholarly inquiry. She reaffirms their main point as being \"that we should reconceive the nature of FYC goals and focus on the content knowledge we have as a field from which students can benefit.\" She goes on to write, \"Let me be as clear as possible: Doug and I are arguing that composition instructors should refuse to separate knowledge about writing from practice in writing and some instruction on how to complete the writing tasks at hand.\" Another misconception she addresses is misconstruing a first-year writing WAW approach as being the same as an introductory course to a writing \"major\" and dismisses the claims that a WAW approach is put in place to recruit writing majors. The differences between these two courses, she explains, are both audience and purpose. Downs and Wardle expanded have produced an accompanying textbook, \"Writing about Writing: A College Reader\", which was published in 2011.\n\nIn \"Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions,\" Downs and Wardle discuss several benefits they found WAW affords students including:\n\nWAW asks students to read about writing and various processes, which allows them to identify what works for them. By reading articles that a composition studies student might read, the first-year composition student is able to gain further insight into the ongoing conversation centered around writing. In her article \"Writing about Writing in Basic Writing,\" Shannon Carter explains \"a writing-about-writing approach foregrounds research in writing and related studies by asking students to read and discuss key research in the discipline and contribute to the scholarly conversation themselves.\" She explains that having students immerse themselves in this type of scholarship will not only improve their writing but their understanding of writing as an academic discipline will increase as well, which in turn contributes to changing the public perception that writing is only something that is a piece of other disciplines.\n\nMany instructors who use WAW are also benefited in that they themselves are able to learn more about composition studies along with their class, promoting parallel learning. In an article titled \"Seeing is Believing: Writing Studies with 'Basic Writing' Students,\" Charlton reports that some see value in teaching first-year composition from a cultural studies approach because not only does this allow for composition instructors to teach what they love, but the types of reading promote critical thinking and analysis—two goals many first-year composition courses have. Also, the article reports on several instructors incorporating graduate level writing-studies readings into their first-year writing courses with much success. Charlton writes, \"Students were engaged and were developing research questions and projects that rivaled my on senior-level composition theory class, both in terms of complexity and overall quality of finished products.\"\n\nAs WAW is a relatively recent movement and is still in its early stages of development, proponents don't always agree on how WAW should be applied to the classroom. Carter points out instructors only account for a small portion of the composition community, and therefore disagreement is common and \"often in fundamental ways.\" \n\nIn his response to Downs and Wardle's \"Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions,\" Joshua P. Kutney argues that providing students with an awareness of writing through WAW won't necessarily transfer to their writing performance. He compares WAW to students who take courses that raise their awareness of social problems. While students gain a greater sense of these issues through these courses, rarely do they display behavioral changes in regards to these issues.\n\nKutney also argues that an increased awareness of writing studies may result in students becoming more comfortable with validating their insufficiencies as a writer because they now recognize the difficulties expert writers have, and not because they now comprehend \"the nuances of the composing process.\" He goes on to say that while Downs and Wardle discuss WAW as allowing students to see academic writing as engaging in an ongoing conversation, this knowledge might overwhelm the student and cause them to avoid engaging in the conversation altogether. Kutney writes, \"While First-Year Composition may not do much to develop the writing abilities of students, Downs and Wardle offer no reason to think that Introduction to Writing Studies, a course that does not purport to teach writing, will do more.\" \n\nIn their response to Downs and Wardle, Miles et al. claim a WAW approach seems like it serves as an introduction to a writing major, which would not be beneficial to first-year students. They take issue with Downs and Wardle's \"dismissal of the importance of teaching situated procedural knowledge\", most notably the rhetorical situation. Miles et al. claim the only rhetorical situation a WAW course exposes its students to is that of scholarly research. They also argue that Downs and Wardle put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field of writing studies, seeing it as the predominant branch of the field. They also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to give voice to the students in their case study who didn't benefit from the WAW approach and that only those who did are highlighted. Another main criticism they have is WAW's reliance on one modality of research writing while they argue that their \"research and scholarship is an interesting hybrid of several modalities at once.\"\n\nDowns published a response to Miles et al. in which he expresses displeasure at the arguments the authors laid out: My first reaction to Miles et al.'s response to \"FYC as Intro to Writing Studies\" is about as magnanimous as their response itself – that is, not remotely. This disappoints me, because I do maintain the ideal of scholarship wherein a constructive dialectic stretches, shapes, and builds ideas rather than merely tearing them down. I confess my first instinct is to tear down Miles et al.'s response as they attempt to tear down the construct we forwarded. (Earning the condemnation of an entire department is bracing-and ironic when the scholarship of some of the signatories – for me, Schwegler and Shamoon – planted seeds of ideas they find unworkable.He writes Miles et al. \"seem to address us as if we are sitting at the kids' table at Thanksgiving dinner.\" His main contentions are:\nHe concludes by writing \"I am grateful not only for the opportunity to respond, but to have something to respond to. And I wonder how differently our students might understand writing if they had similar opportunities.\"\n\nA response to Downs' response to Miles et al. by Slomp and Sargent doesn't reject Downs and Wardle's ideas in the same way Miles et al. does, but calls for more research on the WAW method. The authors also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to position themselves into an ongoing conversation in the same way they advocate for in WAW. Slomp and Sargent say that Downs and Wardle paint themselves to be \"lone pioneers\" in this venture, but in the 1990s Wendy Bishop supported the use of writing as the main subject in the writing classroom. They also reference Peter Elbow as being someone who touched on similar ideas to WAW long before Downs and Wardle published \"Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions.\"\n\nShannon Carter, while a proponent of WAW, describes how it isn't always accessible to other instructors or policy makers. She describes how WAW can be \"off-putting\" to others, and the scholarship on the subject cannot be relied on in making changes to composition curriculum. She explains that while WAW can be effective for some, it is simply one way to approach teaching composition and won't work with everyone's teaching style.\n\nAs previously mentioned, many believe that because the readings are written by professionals for professionals, undergraduates will not be able to easily understand the concepts, which will negatively affect engagement with the course. Some even question Downs and Wardle's motives, and see WAW as a ploy in \"recruiting\" more students to become majors in the field.\n\nPublished in 2011, Downs and Wardle's book is described as \"encouraging students to draw on what they know in order to contribute to ongoing conversations about writing and literacy.\" \nIn the preface for the instructors, Downs and Wardle describes their frustration with composition courses that are based around themes that have nothing to do with writing. They list several reasons as to why WAW is a \"smart choice\" in terms of an approach to teaching first-year composition:\n\nThe book addresses several questions geared towards helping the student understand multiple components of writing: Why study writing? How do readers read and writers write? How do you write? How have you become the readers and writer you are today? How do communities shape writing? How do you make yourself heard as college writer? A mixture of selected readings from both scholars, authors, and students are provided, as well as various activities and discussion questions associated with the readings.\n\nBelow are some of the readings included in \"Writing about Writing: A College Reader\":\n\n\nThe book is praised for its accessibility and forward thinking. For instance, David R. Russell from Iowa State University called the book \"a milestone in composition textbooks.\" Russell is known for his work in Writing Across the Curriculum and activity theory.\n\nIts publisher's website describes it by saying \"Throughout the book, friendly explanations and scaffolded questions help students connect to readings and — even more important — develop knowledge about writing they can use at work, in their everyday lives, and in college.\" \n\n"}
{"id": "23714788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23714788", "title": "Writing system", "text": "Writing system\n\nA writing system is any conventional method of visually representing verbal communication. While both writing and speech are useful in conveying messages, writing differs in also being a reliable form of information storage and transfer. The processes of encoding and decoding writing systems involve shared understanding between writers and readers of the meaning behind the sets of characters that make up a script. Writing is usually recorded onto a durable medium, such as paper or electronic storage, although non-durable methods may also be used, such as writing on a computer display, on a blackboard, in sand, or by skywriting.\n\nThe general attributes of writing systems can be placed into broad categories such as alphabets, syllabaries, or logographies. Any particular system can have attributes of more than one category. In the alphabetic category, there is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) of consonants and vowels that encode based on the general principle that the letters (or letter pair/groups) represent speech sounds. In a syllabary, each symbol correlates to a syllable or mora. In a logography, each character represents a word, morpheme, or other semantic units. Other categories include abjads, which differ from alphabets in that vowels are not indicated, and abugidas or alphasyllabaries, with each character representing a consonant–vowel pairing. Alphabets typically use a set of 20-to-35 symbols to fully express a language, whereas syllabaries can have 80-to-100, and logographies can have several hundreds of symbols.\n\nMost systems will typically have an ordering of its symbol elements so that groups of them can be coded into larger clusters like words or acronyms (generally lexemes), giving rise to many more possibilities (permutations) in meanings than the symbols can convey by themselves. Systems will also enable the stringing together of these smaller groupings (sometimes referred to by the generic term 'character strings') in order to enable a full expression of the language. The reading step can be accomplished purely in the mind as an internal process, or expressed orally. A special set of symbols known as punctuation is used to aid in structure and organization of many writing systems and can be used to help capture nuances and variations in the message's meaning that are communicated verbally by cues in timing, tone, accent, inflection or intonation. A writing system will also typically have a method for formatting recorded messages that follows the spoken version's rules like its grammar and syntax so that the reader will have the meaning of the intended message accurately preserved.\n\nWriting systems were preceded by proto-writing, which used pictograms, ideograms and other mnemonic symbols. Proto-writing lacked the ability to capture and express a full range of thoughts and ideas. The invention of writing systems, which dates back to the beginning of the Bronze Age in the late Neolithic Era of the late 4th millennium BC, enabled the accurate durable recording of human history in a manner that was not prone to the same types of error to which oral history is vulnerable. Soon after, writing provided a reliable form of long distance communication. With the advent of publishing, it provided the medium for an early form of mass communication.\n\nThe creation of a new alphabetic writing system for a language with an existing logographic writing system is called alphabetization, as when the People's Republic of China studied the prospect of alphabetizing the Chinese languages with Latin script, Cyrillic script, Arabic script, and even numbers, although the most common instance of it, converting to Latin script, is usually called romanization.\n\nWriting systems are distinguished from other possible symbolic communication systems in that a writing system is always associated with at least one spoken language. In contrast, visual representations such as drawings, paintings, and non-verbal items on maps, such as contour lines, are not language-related. Some symbols on information signs, such as the symbols for male and female, are also not language related, but can grow to become part of language if they are often used in conjunction with other language elements. Some other symbols, such as numerals and the ampersand, are not directly linked to any specific language, but are often used in writing and thus must be considered part of writing systems.\n\nEvery human community possesses language, which many regard as an innate and defining condition of humanity. However, the development of writing systems, and the process by which they have supplanted traditional oral systems of communication, have been sporadic, uneven and slow. Once established, writing systems generally change more slowly than their spoken counterparts. Thus they often preserve features and expressions which are no longer current in the spoken language. One of the great benefits of writing systems is that they can preserve a permanent record of information expressed in a language.\n\nAll writing systems require:\n\n\nIn the examination of individual scripts, the study of writing systems has developed along partially independent lines. Thus, the terminology employed differs somewhat from field to field.\n\nThe generic term \"text\" refers to an instance of written or spoken material with the latter having been transcribed in some way. The act of composing and recording a text may be referred to as \"writing\", and the act of viewing and interpreting the text as \"reading\". \"Orthography\" refers to the method and rules of observed writing structure (literal meaning, \"correct writing\"), and particularly for alphabetic systems, includes the concept of \"spelling\".\n\nA \"grapheme\" is a specific base unit of a writing system. Graphemes are the \"minimally significant\" elements which taken together comprise the set of \"building blocks\" out of which texts made up of one or more writing systems may be constructed, along with rules of correspondence and use. The concept is similar to that of the phoneme used in the study of spoken languages. For example, in the Latin-based writing system of standard contemporary English, examples of graphemes include the majuscule and minuscule forms of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet (corresponding to various phonemes), marks of punctuation (mostly non-phonemic), and a few other symbols such as those for numerals (logograms for numbers).\n\nAn individual grapheme may be represented in a wide variety of ways, where each variation is visually distinct in some regard, but all are interpreted as representing the \"same\" grapheme. These individual variations are known as \"allographs\" of a grapheme (compare with the term allophone used in linguistic study). For example, the minuscule letter \"a\" has different allographs when written as a cursive, block, or typed letter. The choice of a particular allograph may be influenced by the medium used, the writing instrument, the stylistic choice of the writer, the preceding and following graphemes in the text, the time available for writing, the intended audience, and the largely unconscious features of an individual's handwriting.\n\nThe terms \"glyph\", \"sign\" and \"character\" are sometimes used to refer to a grapheme. Common usage varies from discipline to discipline; compare cuneiform sign, Maya glyph, Chinese character. The glyphs of most writing systems are made up of lines (or strokes) and are therefore called linear, but there are glyphs in non-linear writing systems made up of other types of marks, such as Cuneiform and Braille.\n\nWriting systems may be regarded as \"complete\" according to the extent to which they are able to represent all that may be expressed in the spoken language, while a \"partial\" writing system is limited in what it can convey.\n\nWriting systems can be independent from languages, one can have multiple writing systems for a language, e.g., Hindi and Urdu; and one can also have one writing system for multiple languages, e.g., the Arabic script. Chinese characters were also borrowed by variant countries as their early writing systems, e.g., the early writing systems of Vietnamese language until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nTo represent a conceptual system, one uses one or more languages, e.g., mathematics is a conceptual system and one may use first-order logic and a natural language together in representation.\n\nWriting systems were preceded by proto-writing, systems of ideographic and/or early mnemonic symbols. The best known examples are:\n\n\nThe invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the Bronze Age in the late Neolithic of the late 4th millennium BC. The Sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally considered the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400 to 3200 BC with earliest coherent texts from about 2600 BC. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of cultural diffusion.\n\nA similar debate exists for the Chinese script, which developed around 1200 BC. Chinese script are probably an independent invention, because there is no evidence of contact between China and the literate civilizations of the Near East, and because of the distinct differences between the Mesopotamian and Chinese approaches to logography and phonetic representation.\n\nThe pre-Columbian Mesoamerican writing systems (including among others Olmec and Maya scripts) are generally believed to have had independent origins.\n\nA hieroglyphic writing system used by pre-colonial Mi'kmaq, that was observed by missionaries from the 17th to 19th centuries, is thought to have developed independently. Although, there is some debate over whether or not this was a fully formed system or just a series of mnemonic pictographs.\n\nIt is thought that the first consonantal alphabetic writing appeared before 2000 BC, as a representation of language developed by Semitic tribes in the Sinai-peninsula (see History of the alphabet). Most other alphabets in the world today either descended from this one innovation, many via the Phoenician alphabet, or were directly inspired by its design.\n\nThe first true alphabet is the Greek script which consistently represents vowels since 800 BC. The Latin alphabet, a direct descendant, is by far the most common writing system in use.\n\nSeveral approaches have been taken to classify writing systems, the most common and basic one is a broad division into three categories: \"logographic\", \"syllabic\", and \"alphabetic\" (or \"segmental\"); however, all three may be found in any given writing system in varying proportions, often making it difficult to categorise a system uniquely. The term \"complex system\" is sometimes used to describe those where the admixture makes classification problematic. Modern linguists regard such approaches, including Diringer's\nas too simplistic, often considering the categories to be incomparable.\nHill split \"writing\" into three major categories of linguistic analysis, one of which covers discourses and is not usually considered writing proper:\nSampson draws a distinction between \"semasiography\" and \"glottography\"\nDeFrancis, criticizing Sampson's introduction of \"semasiographic writing\" and \"featural alphabets\" stresses the phonographic quality of writing proper\nFaber categorizes phonographic writing by two levels, linearity and coding:\n\nA \"logogram\" is a single written character which represents a complete grammatical word. Most traditional Chinese characters are classified as logograms.\n\nAs each character represents a single word (or, more precisely, a morpheme), many logograms are required to write all the words of language. The vast array of logograms and the memorization of what they mean are major disadvantages of logographic systems over alphabetic systems. However, since the meaning is inherent to the symbol, the same logographic system can theoretically be used to represent different languages. In practice, the ability to communicate across languages only works for the closely related varieties of Chinese, as differences in syntax reduce the crosslinguistic portability of a given logographic system. Japanese uses Chinese logograms extensively in its writing systems, with most of the symbols carrying the same or similar meanings. However, the grammatical differences between Japanese and Chinese are significant enough that a long Chinese text is not readily understandable to a Japanese reader without any knowledge of basic Chinese grammar, though short and concise phrases such as those on signs and newspaper headlines are much easier to comprehend.\n\nWhile most languages do not use wholly logographic writing systems, many languages use some logograms. A good example of modern western logograms are the Hindu-Arabic numerals: everyone who uses those symbols understands what \"1\" means whether they call it \"one\", \"eins\", \"uno\", \"yi\", \"ichi\", \"ehad\", \"ena\", or \"jedan\". Other western logograms include the ampersand \"&\", used for \"and\", the at sign \"@\", used in many contexts for \"at\", the percent sign \"%\" and the many signs representing units of currency ($, ¢, €, £, ¥ and so on.)\n\nLogograms are sometimes called ideograms, a word that refers to symbols which graphically represent abstract ideas, but linguists avoid this use, as Chinese characters are often semantic–phonetic compounds, symbols which include an element that represents the meaning and a phonetic complement element that represents the pronunciation. Some nonlinguists distinguish between lexigraphy and ideography, where symbols in lexigraphies represent words and symbols in ideographies represent words or morphemes.\n\nThe most important (and, to a degree, the only surviving) modern logographic writing system is the Chinese one, whose characters have been used with varying degrees of modification in varieties of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and other east Asian languages. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Mayan writing system are also systems with certain logographic features, although they have marked phonetic features as well and are no longer in current use. Vietnamese speakers switched to the Latin alphabet in the 20th century and the use of Chinese characters in Korean is increasingly rare. The Japanese writing system includes several distinct forms of writing including logography.\n\n\"Another type of writing system with systematic syllabic linear symbols, the abugidas, is discussed below as well.\n\nAs logographic writing systems use a single symbol for an entire word, a \"syllabary\" is a set of written symbols that represent (or approximate) syllables, which make up words. A symbol in a syllabary typically represents a consonant sound followed by a vowel sound, or just a vowel alone.\n\nIn a \"true syllabary\", there is no systematic graphic similarity between phonetically related characters (though some do have graphic similarity for the vowels). That is, the characters for , and have no similarity to indicate their common \"k\" sound (voiceless velar plosive). More recent creations such as the Cree syllabary embody a system of varying signs, which can best be seen when arranging the syllabogram set in an onset–coda or onset–rime table.\n\nSyllabaries are best suited to languages with relatively simple syllable structure, such as Japanese. The English language, on the other hand, allows complex syllable structures, with a relatively large inventory of vowels and complex consonant clusters, making it cumbersome to write English words with a syllabary. To write English using a syllabary, every possible syllable in English would have to have a separate symbol, and whereas the number of possible syllables in Japanese is around 100, in English there are approximately 15,000 to 16,000.\n\nHowever, syllabaries with much larger inventories do exist. The Yi script, for example, contains 756 different symbols (or 1,164, if symbols with a particular tone diacritic are counted as separate syllables, as in Unicode). The Chinese script, when used to write Middle Chinese and the modern varieties of Chinese, also represents syllables, and includes separate glyphs for nearly all of the many thousands of syllables in Middle Chinese; however, because it primarily represents morphemes and includes different characters to represent homophonous morphemes with different meanings, it is normally considered a logographic script rather than a syllabary.\n\nOther languages that use true syllabaries include Mycenaean Greek (Linear B) and Indigenous languages of the Americas such as Cherokee. Several languages of the Ancient Near East used forms of cuneiform, which is a syllabary with some non-syllabic elements.\n\nAn \"alphabet\" is a small set of \"letters\" (basic written symbols), each of which roughly represents or represented historically a phoneme of a spoken language. The word \"alphabet\" is derived from alpha and beta, the first two symbols of the Greek alphabet.\n\nThe first type of alphabet that was developed was the abjad. An abjad is an alphabetic writing system where there is one symbol per consonant. Abjads differ from other alphabets in that they have characters only for consonantal sounds. Vowels are not usually marked in abjads.\n\nAll known abjads (except maybe Tifinagh) belong to the Semitic family of scripts, and derive from the original Northern Linear Abjad. The reason for this is that Semitic languages and the related Berber languages have a morphemic structure which makes the denotation of vowels redundant in most cases.\n\nSome abjads, like Arabic and Hebrew, have markings for vowels as well. However, they use them only in special contexts, such as for teaching. Many scripts derived from abjads have been extended with vowel symbols to become full alphabets. Of these, the most famous example is the derivation of the Greek alphabet from the Phoenician abjad. This has mostly happened when the script was adapted to a non-Semitic language.\n\nThe term \"abjad\" takes its name from the old order of the Arabic alphabet's consonants 'alif, bā', jīm, dāl, though the word may have earlier roots in Phoenician or Ugaritic. \"Abjad\" is still the word for alphabet in Arabic, Malay and Indonesian.\nAn abugida is an alphabetic writing system whose basic signs denote consonants with an inherent vowel and where consistent modifications of the basic sign indicate other following vowels than the inherent one.\n\nThus, in an abugida there may or may not be a sign for \"k\" with no vowel, but also one for \"ka\" (if \"a\" is the inherent vowel), and \"ke\" is written by modifying the \"ka\" sign in a way that is consistent with how one would modify \"la\" to get \"le\". In many abugidas the modification is the addition of a vowel sign, but other possibilities are imaginable (and used), such as rotation of the basic sign, addition of diacritical marks and so on.\n\nThe contrast with \"true syllabaries\" is that the latter have one distinct symbol per possible syllable, and the signs for each syllable have no systematic graphic similarity. The graphic similarity of most abugidas comes from the fact that they are derived from abjads, and the consonants make up the symbols with the inherent vowel and the new vowel symbols are markings added on to the base symbol.\n\nIn the Ge'ez script, for which the linguistic term \"abugida\" was named, the vowel modifications do not always appear systematic, although they originally were more so. Canadian Aboriginal syllabics can be considered abugidas, although they are rarely thought of in those terms. The largest single group of abugidas is the Brahmic family of scripts, however, which includes nearly all the scripts used in India and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe name \"abugida\" is derived from the first four characters of an order of the Ge'ez script used in some contexts. It was borrowed from Ethiopian languages as a linguistic term by Peter T. Daniels.\n\nA \"featural\" script represents finer detail than an alphabet. Here symbols do not represent whole phonemes, but rather the elements (features) that make up the phonemes, such as voicing or its place of articulation. Theoretically, each feature could be written with a separate letter; and abjads or abugidas, or indeed syllabaries, could be featural, but the only prominent system of this sort is Korean hangul. In hangul, the featural symbols are combined into alphabetic letters, and these letters are in turn joined into syllabic blocks, so that the system combines three levels of phonological representation.\n\nMany scholars, e.g. John DeFrancis, reject this class or at least labeling hangul as such. The Korean script is a conscious script creation by literate experts, which Daniels calls a \"sophisticated grammatogeny\". These include stenographies and constructed scripts of hobbyists and fiction writers (such as Tengwar), many of which feature advanced graphic designs corresponding to phonologic properties. The basic unit of writing in these systems can map to anything from phonemes to words. It has been shown that even the Latin script has sub-character \"features\".\n\nMost writing systems are not purely one type. The English writing system, for example, includes numerals and other logograms such as #, $, and &, and the written language often does not match well with the spoken one. As mentioned above, all logographic systems have phonetic components as well, whether along the lines of a syllabary, such as Chinese (\"logo-syllabic\"), or an abjad, as in Egyptian (\"logo-consonantal\").\n\nSome scripts, however, are truly ambiguous. The semi-syllabaries of ancient Spain were syllabic for plosives such as \"p\", \"t\", \"k\", but alphabetic for other consonants. In some versions, vowels were written redundantly after syllabic letters, conforming to an alphabetic orthography. Old Persian cuneiform was similar. Of 23 consonants (including null), seven were fully syllabic, thirteen were purely alphabetic, and for the other three, there was one letter for /C\"u\"/ and another for both /C\"a\"/ and /C\"i\"/. However, all vowels were written overtly regardless; as in the Brahmic abugidas, the /C\"a\"/ letter was used for a bare consonant.\n\nThe zhuyin phonetic glossing script for Chinese divides syllables in two or three, but into onset, medial, and rime rather than consonant and vowel. Pahawh Hmong is similar, but can be considered to divide syllables into either onset-rime or consonant-vowel (all consonant clusters and diphthongs are written with single letters); as the latter, it is equivalent to an abugida but with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed. Other scripts are intermediate between the categories of alphabet, abjad and abugida, so there may be disagreement on how they should be classified.\n\nPerhaps the primary graphic distinction made in classifications is that of \"linearity\". Linear writing systems are those in which the characters are composed of lines, such as the Latin alphabet and Chinese characters. Chinese characters are considered linear whether they are written with a ball-point pen or a calligraphic brush, or cast in bronze. Similarly, Egyptian hieroglyphs and Maya glyphs were often painted in linear outline form, but in formal contexts they were carved in bas-relief. The earliest examples of writing are linear: the Sumerian script of c. 3300 BC was linear, though its cuneiform descendants were not. Non-linear systems, on the other hand, such as braille, are not composed of lines, no matter what instrument is used to write them.\n\nCuneiform was probably the earliest non-linear writing. Its glyphs were formed by pressing the end of a reed stylus into moist clay, not by tracing lines in the clay with the stylus as had been done previously. The result was a radical transformation of the appearance of the script.\n\nBraille is a non-linear adaptation of the Latin alphabet that completely abandoned the Latin forms. The letters are composed of raised bumps on the writing substrate, which can be leather (Louis Braille's original material), stiff paper, plastic or metal.\n\nThere are also transient non-linear adaptations of the Latin alphabet, including Morse code, the manual alphabets of various sign languages, and semaphore, in which flags or bars are positioned at prescribed angles. However, if \"writing\" is defined as a potentially permanent means of recording information, then these systems do not qualify as writing at all, since the symbols disappear as soon as they are used. (Instead, these transient systems serve as signals.)\n\nScripts are also graphically characterized by the direction in which they are written. Egyptian hieroglyphs were written either left to right or right to left, with the animal and human glyphs turned to face the beginning of the line. The early alphabet could be written in multiple directions: horizontally (side to side), or vertically (up or down). Prior to standardization, alphabetical writing was done both left-to-right (LTR or sinistrodextrally) and right-to-left (RTL or dextrosinistrally). It was most commonly written boustrophedonically: starting in one (horizontal) direction, then turning at the end of the line and reversing direction.\n\nThe Greek alphabet and its successors settled on a left-to-right pattern, from the top to the bottom of the page. Other scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, came to be written right-to-left. Scripts that incorporate Chinese characters have traditionally been written vertically (top-to-bottom), from the right to the left of the page, but nowadays are frequently written left-to-right, top-to-bottom, due to Western influence, a growing need to accommodate terms in the Latin script, and technical limitations in popular electronic document formats. Chinese characters sometimes, as in signage, especially when signifying something old or traditional, may also be written from right to left. The Old Uyghur alphabet and its descendants are unique in being written top-to-bottom, left-to-right; this direction originated from an ancestral Semitic direction by rotating the page 90° counter-clockwise to conform to the appearance of vertical Chinese writing. Several scripts used in the Philippines and Indonesia, such as Hanunó'o, are traditionally written with lines moving away from the writer, from bottom to top, but are read horizontally left to right; however, Kulitan, another Philippine script, is written top to bottom and right to left. Ogham is written bottom to top and read vertically, commonly on the corner of a stone.\n\nIn computers and telecommunication systems, writing systems are generally not codified as such, but graphemes and other grapheme-like units that are required for text processing are represented by \"characters\" that typically manifest in encoded form. There are many , such as ISO/IEC 8859-1 (a character repertoire and encoding scheme oriented toward the Latin script), CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) and bi-directional text. Today, many such standards are re-defined in a collective standard, the ISO/IEC 10646 \"Universal Character Set\", and a parallel, closely related expanded work, \"The Unicode Standard\". Both are generally encompassed by the term Unicode. In Unicode, each character, in every language's writing system, is (simplifying slightly) given a unique identification number, known as its \"code point\". Computer operating systems use code points to look up characters in the font file, so the characters can be displayed on the page or screen.\n\nA keyboard is the device most commonly used for writing via computer. Each key is associated with a standard code which the keyboard sends to the computer when it is pressed. By using a combination of alphabetic keys with modifier keys such as Ctrl, Alt, Shift and AltGr, various character codes are generated and sent to the CPU. The operating system intercepts and converts those signals to the appropriate characters based on the keyboard layout and input method, and then delivers those converted codes and characters to the running application software, which in turn looks up the appropriate glyph in the currently used font file, and requests the operating system to draw these on the screen.\n\n"}
