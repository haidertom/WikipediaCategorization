{"id": "1052571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1052571", "title": "Acronym", "text": "Acronym\n\nAn acronym is a word or name formed as an abbreviation from the initial components of a phrase or a word, usually individual letters (as in \"NATO\" or \"laser\") and sometimes syllables (as in \"Benelux\").\n\nThere are no universal standards for the multiple names for such abbreviations or for their orthographic styling. In English and most other languages, such abbreviations historically had limited use, but they became much more common in the 20th century. Acronyms are a type of word formation process, and they are viewed as a subtype of blending.\n\nWhereas an abbreviation may be any type of shortened form, such as words with the middle omitted (for example, \"Rd\" for \"road\" or \"Dr\" for \"Doctor\"), an acronym is a word formed from the first letter or first few letters of each word in a phrase (such as \"sonar\", created from \"und vigation and anging\"). Attestations for \"\" in German are known from 1921, and for \"acronym\" in English from 1940.\n\nAlthough the word \"acronym\" is often used to refer to any abbreviation formed from initial letters, some dictionaries and usage commentators define \"acronym\" to mean an abbreviation that is pronounced as a word, in contrast to an initialism (or alphabetism)an abbreviation formed from a string of initials (and possibly pronounced as individual letters).\nSome dictionaries include additional senses equating \"acronym\" with \"initialism\". The distinction, when made, hinges on whether the abbreviation is pronounced as a word or as a string of individual letters. Examples in reference works that make the distinction include \"NATO\" , \"scuba\" , and \"radar\" for acronyms; and \"FBI\" , \"CRT\" , and \"HTML\" for initialisms. The rest of this article uses \"acronym\" for both types of abbreviation.\n\nThe distinction is not well-maintained. According to \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage\": \"A number of commentators ... believe that acronyms can be differentiated from other abbreviations in being pronounceable as words. Dictionaries, however, do not make this distinction because writers in general do not. ... \"Initialism\", an older word than \"acronym\", seems to be too little known to the general public to serve as the customary term standing in contrast with \"acronym\" in a narrow sense.\" About the use of \"acronym\" to only mean those pronounced as words, \"Fowler's Modern English Usage\" (3rd ed.) states: \"The limitations of the term being not widely known to the general public, \"acronym\" is also often applied to abbreviations that are familiar but are not pronounceable as words. ... Such terms are also called \"initialisms\".\"\n\nA clearer distinction has also been drawn by Pyles & Algeo (1970), who divided \"acronyms\" as a general category into \"word acronyms\" pronounced as words, and \"initialisms\" sounded out as letters.\n\nThere is no special term for abbreviations whose pronunciation involves the combination of letter names and words or word-like pronunciations of strings of letters, such as \"JPEG\" and \"MS-DOS\" . There is also some disagreement as to what to call abbreviations that some speakers pronounce as letters and others pronounce as a word. For example, the terms \"URL\" and \"IRA\" can be pronounced as individual letters: and , respectively; or as a single word: and , respectively.\nThe spelled-out form of an acronym or initialism (that is, what it stands for) is called its \"expansion\".\n\n\nAcronymy, like retronymy, is a linguistic process that has existed throughout history but for which there was little to no naming, conscious attention, or systematic analysis until relatively recent times. Like retronymy, it became much more common in the 20th century than it had formerly been.\n\nAncient examples of acronymy (regardless of whether there was metalanguage at the time to describe it) include the following:\n\nDuring the mid- to late-19th century, an acronym-disseminating trend spread through the American and European business communities: abbreviating corporation names in places where space was limited for writing—such as on the sides of railroad cars (e.g., Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad → RF&P); on the sides of barrels and crates; and on ticker tape and in the small-print newspaper stock listings that got their data from it (e.g., American Telephone and Telegraph Company → AT&T). Some well-known commercial examples dating from the 1890s through 1920s include Nabisco (National Biscuit Company), Esso (from S.O., from Standard Oil), and Sunoco (Sun Oil Company).\n\nAnother driver for the adoption of acronyms was modern warfare with its many highly technical terms. While there is no recorded use of military acronyms in documents dating from the American Civil War (acronyms such as ANV for \"Army of Northern Virginia\" post-date the war itself), they had become somewhat common in World War I and were very much a part even of the vernacular language of the soldiers during World War II, who themselves were referred to as G.I.s.\n\nThe widespread, frequent use of acronyms across the whole range of registers is a relatively new linguistic phenomenon in most languages, becoming increasingly evident since the mid-20th century. As literacy rates rose, and as advances in science and technology brought with them a constant stream of new (and sometimes more complex) terms and concepts, the practice of abbreviating terms became increasingly convenient. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\") records the first printed use of the word \"initialism\" as occurring in 1899, but it did not come into general use until 1965, well after \"acronym\" had become common.\n\nBy 1943, the term \"acronym\" had been used in English to recognize abbreviations (and contractions of phrases) that were pronounced as words. (It was formed from the Greek words , ', \"topmost, extreme\" and , ', \"name.\") For example, the army offense of being \"absent without official leave\" was abbreviated to \"A.W.O.L.\" in reports, but when pronounced as a word (\"awol\"), it became an acronym. While initial letters are commonly used to form an acronym, the original definition was \"a word made from the initial letters or syllables of other words\", for example UNIVAC from UNIVersal Automatic Computer.\n\nIn English, acronyms \"pronounced as words\" may be a 20th-century phenomenon. Linguist David Wilton in \"Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends\" claims that \"forming words from acronyms is a distinctly twentieth- (and now twenty-first-) century phenomenon. There is only one known pre-twentieth-century [English] word with an acronymic origin and it was in vogue for only a short time in 1886. The word is \"colinderies\" or \"colinda\", an acronym for the Colonial and Indian Exposition held in London in that year.\" However, although acronymic words seem not to have been \"employed in general vocabulary\" before the 20th century (as Wilton points out), the \"concept of their formation\" is treated as effortlessly understood (and evidently not novel) in a Poe story of the 1830s, \"How to Write a Blackwood Article\", which includes the contrived acronym P.R.E.T.T.Y.B.L.U.E.B.A.T.C.H.\n\nThe use of Latin and Neo-Latin terms in vernaculars has been pan-European and predates modern English. Some examples of acronyms in this class are:\n\n\nThe earliest example of a word derived from an acronym listed by the \"OED\" is \"abjud\" (now \"abjad\"), formed from the original first four letters of the Arabic alphabet in the late 18th century. Some acrostics predate this, however, such as the Restoration witticism arranging the names of some members of Charles II's Committee for Foreign Affairs to produce the \"CABAL\" ministry.\n\nAcronyms are used most often to abbreviate names of organizations and long or frequently referenced terms. The armed forces and government agencies frequently employ acronyms; some well-known examples from the United States are among the \"alphabet agencies\" (also jokingly referred to as \"alphabet soup\") created by Franklin D. Roosevelt (also of course known as FDR) under the New Deal. Business and industry also are prolific coiners of acronyms. The rapid advance of science and technology in recent centuries seems to be an underlying force driving the usage, as new inventions and concepts with multiword names create a demand for shorter, more manageable names. One representative example, from the U.S. Navy, is COMCRUDESPAC, which stands for \"commander, cruisers destroyers Pacific\"; it's also seen as \"ComCruDesPac\". \"YABA-compatible\" (where YABA stands for \"yet another bloody acronym\") is used to mean that a term's acronym can be pronounced but is not an offensive word, e.g., \"When choosing a new name, be sure it is 'YABA-compatible'.\"\n\nAcronym use has been further popularized by text messaging on mobile phones with Short Message Systems (SMS). To fit messages into the 160-character SMS limit, acronyms such as \"GF\" (girlfriend), \"LOL\" (laughing out loud), and \"DL\" (download or down low) have become popular. Some prescriptivists disdain texting acronyms and abbreviations as decreasing clarity, or as failure to use \"pure\" or \"proper\" English. Others point out that language change has happened for thousands of years, and argue that it should be embraced as inevitable, or as innovation that adapts the language to changing circumstances. In this view, the modern practice is just as legitimate as those in \"proper\" English of the current generation of speakers, such as the abbreviation of corporation names in places with limited writing space (e.g., ticker tape, newspaper column inches).\n\nIn formal writing for a broad audience, the expansion is typically given at the first occurrence of the acronym within a given text, for the benefit of those readers who do not know what it stands for. The capitalization of the original term is independent of it being acronymized, being lowercase for a common noun such as frequently asked questions (FAQ) but uppercase for a proper noun such as the United Nations (UN) (as explained at Case > Casing of expansions).\n\nIn addition to expansion at first use, some publications also have a key listing all acronyms used therein and what their expansions are. This is a convenience to readers for two reasons. The first is that if they are not reading the entire publication sequentially (which is a common mode of reading), then they may encounter an acronym without having seen its expansion. Having a key at the start or end of the publication obviates skimming over the text searching for an earlier use to find the expansion. (This is especially important in the print medium, where no search utility is available.) The second reason for the key feature is its pedagogical value in educational works such as textbooks. It gives students a way to review the meanings of the acronyms introduced in a chapter after they have done the line-by-line reading, and also a way to quiz themselves on the meanings (by covering up the expansion column and recalling the expansions from memory, then checking their answers by uncovering). In addition, this feature enables readers possessing knowledge of the abbreviations not to have to encounter expansions (redundant to such readers).\n\nExpansion at first use and the abbreviation-key feature are aids to the reader that originated in the print era, and they are equally useful in print and online. In addition, the online medium offers yet more aids, such as tooltips, hyperlinks, and rapid search via search engine technology.\n\nAcronyms often occur in jargon. An acronym may have different meanings in different areas of industry, writing, and scholarship. The general reason for this is convenience and succinctness for specialists, although it has led some to obfuscate the meaning either intentionally, to deter those without such domain-specific knowledge, or unintentionally, by creating an acronym that already existed.\n\nThe medical literature has been struggling to control the proliferation of acronyms as their use has evolved from aiding communication to hindering it. This has become such a problem that it is even evaluated at the level of medical academies such as the American Academy of Dermatology.\nAcronyms are often taught as mnemonic devices, for example in physics the colors of the visible spectrum are ROY G. BIV (red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet). They are also used as mental checklists, for example in aviation: GUMPS, which is Gas-Undercarriage-Mixture-Propeller-Seatbelts. Other examples of mnemonic acronyms include CAN SLIM, and PAVPANIC as well as PEMDAS.\n\nIt is not uncommon for acronyms to be cited in a kind of false etymology, called a \"folk etymology\", for a word. Such etymologies persist in popular culture but have no factual basis in historical linguistics, and are examples of language-related urban legends. For example, \"cop\" is commonly cited as being derived, it is presumed, from \"constable on patrol,\" and \"posh\" from \"port out, starboard home\". With some of these specious expansions, the \"belief\" that the etymology is acronymic has clearly been tongue-in-cheek among many citers, as with \"gentlemen only, ladies forbidden\" for \"golf\", although many other (more credulous) people have uncritically taken it for fact. Taboo words in particular commonly have such false etymologies: \"shit\" from \"ship/store high in transit\" or \"special high-intensity training\" and \"fuck\" from \"for unlawful carnal knowledge\", or \"fornication under consent/command of the king\".\n\nIn English, abbreviations have traditionally been written with a full stop/period/point in place of the deleted part to show the ellipsis of letters—although the colon and apostrophe have also had this role—and with a space after full stops (e.g. \"A. D.\"). In the case of most acronyms, each letter is an abbreviation of a separate word and, in theory, should get its own termination mark. Such punctuation is diminishing with the belief that the presence of all-capital letters is sufficient to indicate that the word is an abbreviation.\n\nSome influential style guides, such as that of the BBC, no longer require punctuation to show ellipsis; some even proscribe it. Larry Trask, American author of \"The Penguin Guide to Punctuation\", states categorically that, in British English, \"this tiresome and unnecessary practice is now obsolete\".\n\nNevertheless, some influential style guides, many of them American, still require periods in certain instances. For example, The New York Times' guide recommends following each segment with a period when the letters are pronounced individually, as in \"K.G.B.\", but not when pronounced as a word, as in \"NATO\". The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the punctuation scheme.\n\nWhen a multiple-letter abbreviation is formed from a single word, periods are in general not used, although they may be common in informal usage. \"TV\", for example, may stand for a \"single\" word (\"television\" or \"transvestite\", for instance), and is in general spelled without punctuation (except in the plural). Although \"PS\" stands for the single word \"postscript\" (or the Latin \"postscriptum\"), it is often spelled with periods (\"P.S.\").\n\nThe slash ('/', or \"solidus\") is sometimes used to separate the letters in a two-letter acronym, as in \"N/A\" (\"not applicable, not available\"), \"c/o\" (\"care of\") and \"w/o\" (\"without\").\n\nInconveniently long words used frequently in related contexts can be represented according to their letter count. For example, \"i18n\" abbreviates \"internationalization\", a computer-science term for adapting software for worldwide use. The \"18\" represents the 18 letters that come between the first and the last in \"internationalization\". \"Localization\" can be abbreviated \"l10n\", \"multilingualization\" \"m17n\", and \"accessibility\" \"a11y\". In addition to the use of a specific number replacing that many letters, the more general \"x\" can be used to replace an unspecified number of letters. Examples include \"Crxn\" for \"crystallization\" and the series familiar to physicians for history, diagnosis, and treatment (\"hx\", \"dx\", \"tx\").\n\nThere is a question about how to pluralize acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in \"PC's\". However, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings, allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms \"only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters\". Turabian would therefore prefer \"DVDs\" and \"URLs\" and \"Ph.D.'s\". The Modern Language Association and American Psychological Association prohibit apostrophes from being used to pluralize acronyms regardless of periods (so \"compact discs\" would be \"CDs\" or \"C.D.s\"), whereas \"The New York Times\" style guide requires an apostrophe when pluralizing all abbreviations regardless of periods (preferring \"PC's, TV's and VCR's\").\n\nPossessive plurals that also include apostrophes for mere pluralization and periods appear especially complex: for example, \"the C.D.'s' labels\" (the labels of the compact discs). In some instances, however, an apostrophe may increase clarity: for example, if the final letter of an abbreviation is \"S\", as in \"SOS's\" (although abbreviations ending with S can also take \"-es\", e.g. \"SOSes\"), or when pluralizing an abbreviation that has periods.\n\nA particularly rich source of options arises when the plural of an acronym would normally be indicated in a word other than the final word if spelled out in full. A classic example is \"Member of Parliament\", which in plural is \"Members of Parliament\". It is possible then to abbreviate this as \"M's P.\" (or similar), as used by former Australian Prime Minister Ben Chifley. This usage is less common than forms with \"s\" at the end, such as \"MPs\", and may appear dated or pedantic. In common usage, therefore, \"weapons of mass destruction\" becomes \"WMDs\", \"prisoners of war\" becomes \"POWs\", and \"runs batted in\" becomes \"RBIs\".\n\nThe argument that acronyms should have no different plural form (for example, \"If \"D\" can stand for \"disc\", it can also stand for \"discs\") is in general disregarded because of the practicality in distinguishing singulars and plurals. This is not the case, however, when the abbreviation is understood to describe a plural noun already: For example, \"U.S.\" is short for \"United States, but not \"United State\". In this case, the options for making a possessive form of an abbreviation that is already in its plural form without a final \"s\" may seem awkward: for example, \"U.S.\", \"U.S.'s\", etc. In such instances, possessive abbreviations are often forgone in favor of simple attributive usage (for example, \"the U.S. economy\") or expanding the abbreviation to its full form and \"then\" making the possessive (for example, \"the United States' economy\"). On the other hand, in speech, the pronunciation \"United States's\" sometimes is used.\n\nAbbreviations that come from single, rather than multiple, words—such as \"TV\" (\"television\")—are usually pluralized without apostrophes (\"two TVs\"); most writers feel that the apostrophe should be reserved for the possessive (\"the TV's antenna\").\n\nThe most common capitalization scheme seen with acronyms is all-uppercase (all-caps), except for those few that have linguistically taken on an identity as regular words, with the acronymous etymology of the words fading into the background of common knowledge, such as has occurred with the words \"scuba\", \"laser\", and \"radar\"—these are known as \"anacronyms\". Anacronyms (note well \"-acro-\") should not be homophonously confused with anachronyms (note well \"-chron-\"), which are a type of misnomer.\n\nSmall caps are sometimes used to make the run of capital letters seem less jarring to the reader. For example, the style of some American publications, including the \"Atlantic Monthly\" and \"USA Today\", is to use small caps for acronyms longer than three letters; thus \"U.S.\" and \"FDR\" in normal caps, but \"\" in small caps. The acronyms \"AD\" and \"BC\" are often smallcapped as well, as in: \"From \".\n\nWords derived from an acronym by affixing are typically expressed in mixed case, so the root acronym is clear. For example, \"pre-WWII politics\", \"post-NATO world\", \"DNAase\". In some cases a derived acronym may also be expressed in mixed case. For example, messenger RNA and transfer RNA become mRNA and tRNA.\n\nSome publications choose to capitalize only the first letter of acronyms, reserving all-caps styling for initialisms, writing the pronounced acronyms \"Nato\" and \"Aids\" in mixed case, but the initialisms \"USA\" and \"FBI\" in all caps. For example, this is the style used in \"The Guardian\", and BBC News typically edits to this style (though its official style guide, dating from 2003, still recommends all-caps). The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the capitalization scheme.\n\nSome style manuals also base the letters' case on their number. \"The New York Times\", for example, keeps \"NATO\" in all capitals (while several guides in the British press may render it \"Nato\"), but uses lower case in \"UNICEF\" (from \"United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund\") because it is more than four letters, and to style it in caps might look ungainly (flirting with the appearance of \"shouting capitals\").\n\nWhile abbreviations typically exclude the initials of short function words (such as \"and\", \"or\", \"of\", or \"to\"), this is not always the case. (A similar set of words is sometimes left as lowercase in headers and publication titles.) Sometimes function words are included to make a pronounceable acronym, such as CORE (Congress of Racial Equality). Sometimes the letters representing these words are written in lower case, such as in the cases of TfL (Transport for London) and \"LotR\" (\"Lord of the Rings\"); this usually occurs when the acronym represents a multi-word proper noun.\n\nNumbers (both cardinal and ordinal) in names are often represented by digits rather than initial letters: as in \"4GL\" (Fourth generation language) or \"G77\" (Group of 77). Large numbers may use metric prefixes, as with \"Y2K\" for \"Year 2000\" (sometimes written \"Y2k\", because the SI symbol for 1000 is \"k\"—not \"K\", which stands for \"kelvin\"). Exceptions using initials for numbers include \"TLA\" (three-letter acronym/abbreviation) and \"GoF\" (Gang of Four). Abbreviations using numbers for other purposes include repetitions, such as \"W3C\" (\"World Wide Web Consortium\") and \"T3\" (\"Trends, Tips & Tools for Everyday Living\"); pronunciation, such as \"B2B\" (\"business to business\"); and numeronyms, such as \"i18n\" (\"internationalization\"; \"18\" represents the 18 letters between the initial \"i\" and the final \"n\").\n\nAlthough many authors of expository writing show a predisposition to capitalizing the initials of the expansion for pedagogical emphasis (trying to thrust the reader's attention toward where the letters are coming from), this sometimes conflicts with the convention of English orthography, which reserves capitals in the middle of sentences for proper nouns. Enforcing the general convention, most professional editors case-fold such expansions to their standard orthography when editing manuscripts for publication. The justification is that (1) readers are smart enough to figure out where the letters came from, even without their being capitalized for emphasis, and that (2) common nouns do not take capital initials in standard English orthography. Such house styles also usually disfavor bold or italic font for the initial letters. For example,\n\"the onset of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)\" or \"the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF)\" if found in an unpublished manuscript would be rewritten as \"the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF)\" in the final published article when following the AMA Manual of Style.\n\nSome apparent acronyms or other abbreviations do not stand for anything and cannot be expanded to some meaning. Such pseudo-acronyms may be pronunciation-based, such as BBQ (bee-bee-cue), for \"barbecue\", or K9 (kay-nine) for \"canine\". Pseudo-acronyms also frequently develop as \"orphan initialisms\"; an existing acronym is redefined as a non-acronymous name, severing its link to its previous meaning. For example, the letters of the SAT, a US college entrance test originally dubbed \"Scholastic Aptitude Test\", no longer officially stand for anything.\n\nThis is common with companies that want to retain brand recognition while moving away from an outdated image: American Telephone and Telegraph became AT&T, Kentucky Fried Chicken became KFC to de-emphasize the role of frying in the preparation of its signature dishes, and British Petroleum became BP. Russia Today has rebranded itself as RT. Genzyme Transgenics Corporation became GTC Biotherapeutics, Inc. in order to reduce perceived corporate risk of sabotage/vandalism by Luddite activists.\n\nPseudo-acronyms may have advantages in international markets: for example, some national affiliates of International Business Machines are legally incorporated as \"IBM\" (for example, \"IBM Canada\") to avoid translating the full name into local languages. Likewise, \"UBS\" is the name of the merged Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation, and \"HSBC\" has replaced \"The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.\" Sometimes, companies whose original name gives a clear indication of their place of origin will use acronyms when expanding to foreign markets—for example, Toronto-Dominion Bank continues to operate under the full name in Canada, but its U.S. subsidiary is known as TD Bank, just as Royal Bank of Canada used its full name in Canada (a constitutional monarchy), but its now-defunct U.S. subsidiary was called RBC Bank.\n\nRebranding can lead to redundant acronym syndrome, as when Trustee Savings Bank became TSB Bank, or when Railway Express Agency became REA Express. A few high-tech companies have taken the redundant acronym to the extreme: for example, ISM Information Systems Management Corp. and SHL Systemhouse Ltd. Examples in entertainment include the television shows \"\" and \"Navy: NCIS\" (\"Navy\" was dropped in the second season), where the redundancy was likely designed to educate new viewers as to what the initials stood for. The same reasoning was in evidence when the Royal Bank of Canada's Canadian operations rebranded to RBC Royal Bank, or when Bank of Montreal rebranded their retail banking subsidiary BMO Bank of Montreal.\n\nAnother common example is \"RAM memory\", which is redundant because \"RAM\" (\"random-access memory\") includes the initial of the word \"memory\". \"PIN\" stands for \"personal identification number\", obviating the second word in \"PIN number\"; in this case its retention may be motivated to avoid ambiguity with the homophonous word \"pin\". Other examples include \"ATM machine,\" \"EAB bank,\" \"CableACE Award,\" \"DC Comics,\" \"HIV virus,\" Microsoft's NT Technology, and the formerly redundant \"SAT test,\" now simply \"SAT Reasoning Test\"). TNN (The Nashville/National Network) also renamed itself \"The New TNN\" for a brief interlude.\n\nSometimes, the initials continue to stand for an expanded meaning, but the original meaning is simply replaced. Some examples:\n\nA \"backronym\" (or \"bacronym\") is a phrase that is constructed \"after the fact\" from a previously existing word. For example, the novelist and critic Anthony Burgess once proposed that the word \"book\" ought to stand for \"Box Of Organized Knowledge.\" A classic real-world example of this is the name of the predecessor to the Apple Macintosh, The Apple Lisa, which was said to refer to \"Local Integrated Software Architecture\", but was actually named after Steve Jobs's daughter, born in 1978.\n\nBackronyms are often times used to comedic effect. An example of creating a backronym for comedic effect would be in naming a group or organization, the name A.C.R.O.N.Y.M stands for (among other things) \"A Clever Regiment Of Nerdy Young Men\".\n\nAcronyms are sometimes contrived, that is, deliberately designed to be especially apt for the thing being named (by having a dual meaning or by borrowing the positive connotations of an existing word). Some examples of contrived acronyms are \"USA PATRIOT\", \"CAN SPAM\", \"CAPTCHA\" and \"ACT UP\". The clothing company French Connection began referring to itself as \"fcuk\", standing for \"French Connection United Kingdom.\" The company then created T-shirts and several advertising campaigns that exploit the acronym's similarity to the taboo word \"fuck.\"\n\nThe US Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is known for developing contrived acronyms to name projects, including \"RESURRECT\", \"NIRVANA\", and \"DUDE\". In July 2010, Wired Magazine reported that DARPA announced programs to \"..transform biology from a descriptive to a predictive field of science\" named \"BATMAN\" and \"ROBIN\" for \"Biochronicity and Temporal Mechanisms Arising in Nature\" and \"Robustness of Biologically-Inspired Networks\", a reference to the Batman and Robin comic-book superheroes.\n\nThe short-form names of clinical trials and other scientific studies constitute a large class of acronyms that includes many contrived examples, as well as many with a partial rather than complete correspondence of letters to expansion components. These trials tend to have full names that are accurately descriptive of what the trial is about but are thus also too long to serve practically as names within the syntax of a sentence, so a short name is also developed, which can serve as a syntactically useful handle and also provide at least a degree of mnemonic reminder as to the full name. Examples widely known in medicine include the ALLHAT trial (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) and the CHARM trial (Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity). The fact that RAS syndrome is often involved, as well as that the letters often don't entirely match, have sometimes been pointed out by annoyed researchers preoccupied by the idea that because the archetypal form of acronyms originated with one-to-one letter matching, there must be some moral impropriety in their ever deviating from that form. However, the raison d'être of clinical trial acronyms, as with gene and protein symbols, is simply to have a syntactically usable and recallable short name to complement the long name that is often syntactically unusable and not memorized. It is useful for the short name to give a reminder of the long name, which supports the reasonable censure of \"cutesy\" examples that provide little to no hint of it. But beyond that reasonably close correspondence, the short name's chief utility is in functioning cognitively as a name, rather than being a cryptic and forgettable string, albeit faithful to the matching of letters. However, other reasonable critiques have been (1) that it is irresponsible to mention trial acronyms without explaining them at least once by providing the long names somewhere in the document, and (2) that the proliferation of trial acronyms has resulted in ambiguity, such as 3 different trials all called ASPECT, which is another reason why failing to explain them somewhere in the document is irresponsible in scientific communication. At least one study has evaluated the citation impact and other traits of acronym-named trials compared with others, finding both good aspects (mnemonic help, name recall) and potential flaws (connotatively driven bias).\n\nSome acronyms are chosen deliberately to avoid a name considered undesirable: For example, \"Verliebt in Berlin\" (ViB), a German telenovela, was first intended to be \"Alles nur aus Liebe (All for Love)\", but was changed to avoid the resultant acronym \"ANAL\". Likewise, the Computer Literacy and Internet Technology qualification is known as \"CLaIT\", rather than \"CLIT\". In Canada, the Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance (Party) was quickly renamed to the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance when its opponents pointed out that its initials spelled CCRAP (pronounced \"see crap\"). (The satirical magazine \"Frank\" had proposed alternatives to CCRAP, namely SSHIT and NSDAP.) Two Irish Institutes of Technology (Galway and Tralee) chose different acronyms from other institutes when they were upgraded from Regional Technical colleges. Tralee RTC became the Institute of Technology Tralee (ITT), as opposed to Tralee Institute of Technology (TIT). Galway RTC became Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT), as opposed to Galway Institute of Technology (GIT). The charity sports organization Team in Training is known as \"TNT\" and not \"TIT\". Technological Institute of Textile & Sciences is still known as TITS. George Mason University was planning to name their law school the Antonin Scalia School of Law (ASSOL) in honor of the late Antonin Scalia, only to change it to the Antonin Scalia Law School later.\n\nA macronym, or nested acronym, is an acronym in which one or more letters stand for acronyms themselves. The word \"macronym\" is a portmanteau of \"macro-\" and \"acronym\".\n\nSome examples of macronyms are: \n\nSome macronyms can be multiply nested: the second-order acronym points to another one further down a hierarchy. In an informal competition run by the magazine \"New Scientist\", a fully documented specimen was discovered that may be the most deeply nested of all: RARS is the \"Regional ATOVS Retransmission Service\"; ATOVS is \"Advanced TOVS\"; TOVS is \"TIROS operational vertical sounder\"; and TIROS is \"Television infrared observational satellite\". Fully expanded, \"RARS\" might thus become \"Regional Advanced Television Infrared Observational Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder Retransmission Service\". However, to say that \"RARS\" stands directly for that string of words, or can be interchanged with it in syntax (in the same way that \"CHF\" can be usefully interchanged with \"congestive heart failure\"), is a prescriptive misapprehension rather than a linguistically accurate description; the true nature of such a term is closer to anacronymic than to being interchangeable like simpler acronyms are. The latter are fully reducible in an attempt to \"spell everything out and avoid all abbreviations,\" but the former are irreducible in that respect; they can be annotated with parenthetical explanations, but they cannot be eliminated from speech or writing in any useful or practical way. Just as the words \"laser\" and \"radar\" function as words in syntax and cognition without a need to focus on their acronymic origins, terms such as \"RARS\" and \"CHA2DS2–VASc score\" are irreducible in natural language; if they are purged, the form of language that is left may conform to some imposed rule, but it cannot be described as remaining natural. Similarly, protein and gene nomenclature, which uses symbols extensively, includes such terms as the name of the NACHT protein domain, which reflects the symbols of some proteins that contain the domain—NAIP (NLR family apoptosis inhibitor protein), C2TA (major histocompatibility complex class II transcription activator), HET-E (incompatibility locus protein from \"Podospora anserine\"), and TP1 (telomerase-associated protein)—but is not syntactically reducible to them. The name is thus itself more symbol than acronym, and its expansion cannot replace it while preserving its function in natural syntax as a name within a clause clearly parsable by human readers or listeners.\n\nA special type of macronym, the recursive acronym, has letters whose expansion refers back to the macronym itself. One of the earliest examples appears in \"The Hacker's Dictionary\" as MUNG, which stands for \"MUNG Until No Good\".\n\nSome examples of recursive acronyms are:\n\nIn English language discussions of languages with syllabic or logographic writing systems (such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), \"acronyms\" describe the short forms that take selected characters from a multi-character word.\n\nFor example, in Chinese, \"university\" (/, literally \"great learning\") is usually abbreviated simply as (\"great\") when used with the name of the institute. So \"Peking University\" () is commonly shortened to ( \"north-great\") by also only taking the first character of \"Peking\", the \"northern capital\" (). In some cases, however, other characters than the first can be selected. For example, the local short form of \"Hong Kong University\" () uses \"Kong\" () rather than \"Hong\".\n\nThere are also cases where some longer phrases are abbreviated drastically, especially in Chinese politics, where proper nouns were initially translated from Soviet Leninist terms. For instance, the full name of China's highest ruling council, the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), is \"Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China\" (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会). The term then reduced the \"Communist Party of China\" part of its name through acronyms, then the \"Standing Committee\" part, again through acronyms, to create \"中共中央政治局常委\". Alternatively, it omitted the \"Communist Party\" part altogether, creating \"Politburo Standing Committee\" (政治局常委会), and eventually just \"Standing Committee\" (常委会). The PSC's members full designations are \"Member of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China\" (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会委员); this was eventually drastically reduced to simply \"Changwei\" (常委), with the term \"Ruchang\" (入常) used increasingly for officials destined for a future seat on the PSC. In another example, the word \"全国人民代表大会\" (National People's Congress) can be broken into four parts: \"全国\" = \"the whole nation\", \"人民\" = \"people\", \"代表\" = \"representatives\", \"大会\" = \"conference\". Yet, in its short form \"人大\" (literally \"man/people big\"), only the first characters from the second and the fourth parts are selected; the first part (\"全国\") and the third part (\"代表\") are simply ignored. In describing such abbreviations, the term \"initialism\" is inapplicable.\n\nMany proper nouns become shorter and shorter over time. For example, the CCTV New Year's Gala, whose full name is literally read as \"China Central Television Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala\" (中国中央电视台春节联欢晚会) was first shortened to \"Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala\" (春节联欢晚会), but eventually referred to as simply \"Chunwan\" (春晚). Along the same vein, \"Zhongguo Zhongyang Dianshi Tai\" (中国中央电视台) was reduced to \"Yangshi\" (央视) in the mid-2000s.\n\nMany aspects of academics in Korea follow similar acronym patterns as Chinese, owing to the languages' commonalities, like using the word for \"big\" or \"great\" i.e. \"dae\" (), to refer to universities (; \"daehak,\" literally \"great learning\" although \"big school\" is an acceptable alternate). They can be interpreted similar to American university appellations, such as \"UPenn\" or \"Texas Tech.\"\n\nSome acronyms are shortened forms of the school's name, like how Hongik University (, \"Hongik Daehakgyo\") is shortened to \"Hongdae\" (, \"Hong, the big [school]\" or \"Hong-U\") Other acronyms can refer to the university's main subject, e.g. Korea National University of Education (, \"Hanguk Gyowon Daehakgyo\") is shortened to \"Gyowondae\" (교원대, \"Big Ed.\" or \"Ed.-U\"). Other schools use a Koreanized version of their English acronym. The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (, \"Hanguk Gwahak Gisulwon\") is referred to as KAIST (, \"Kaiseuteu\") in both English and Korean. The 3 most prestigious schools in Korea are known as SKY (스카이, \"seukai\"), combining the first letter of their English names (Seoul National, Korea, and Yonsei Universities). In addition, the College Scholastic Ability Test (, \"Daehak Suhang Neungryeok Siheom\") is shortened to \"Suneung\" (, \"S.A.\").\n\nThe Japanese language makes extensive use of abbreviations, but only some of these are acronyms.\n\nChinese-based words (Sino-Japanese vocabulary) uses similar acronym formation to Chinese, like for . In some cases alternative pronunciations are used, as in Saikyō for 埼京, from , rather than Saitō.\n\nNon-Chinese foreign borrowings (gairaigo) are instead frequently abbreviated as clipped compounds, rather than acronyms, using several initial sounds. This is visible in katakana transcriptions of foreign words, but is also found with native words (written in hiragana). For example, the \"Pokémon\" media franchise's name originally stood for \"pocket monsters\" ( → ), which is still the long-form of the name in Japanese, and \"wāpuro\" stands for \"word processor\" ( → ).\n\nTo a greater degree than English does, German tends toward acronyms that use initial syllables rather than initial single letters, although it uses many of the latter type as well. Some examples of the syllabic type are \"Gestapo\" rather than \"GSP\" (for ', 'secret state police'); ' rather than \"FAK\" (for ', anti-aircraft gun); ' rather than \"KP\" (for ', detective division police). The extension of such contraction to a pervasive or whimsical degree has been mockingly labeled ' (for ', strange habit of abbreviating). Examples of include ' (for ', short in the front, long in the back, i.e., a mullet) and the mocking of Adolf Hitler's title as ' (\"\", Greatest General of all Times).\n\nIt is common to take more than just one initial letter from each of the words composing the acronym; regardless of this, the abbreviation sign gershayim is always written between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym, even if by this it separates letters of the same original word. Examples (keep in mind Hebrew reads right-to-left): (for , the United States); (for , the Soviet Union); (for , Rishon LeZion); (for , the school). An example that takes only the initial letters from its component words is (\"Tzahal\", for , Israel Defense Forces). In inflected forms the abbreviation sign gershayim remains between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym (e.g. \"report\", singular: , plural: ; \"squad commander\", masculine: , feminine: ).\n\nThere is also a widespread use of acronyms in Indonesia in every aspect of social life. For example, the \"Golkar\" political party stands for Partai \"Gol\"ongan \"Kar\"ya, \"Monas\" stands for \"\"Mo\"numen \"Nas\"ional\" (National Monument), the \"Angkot\" public transport stands for \"\"Ang\"kutan \"Kot\"a\" (city public transportation), \"warnet\" stands for \"\"war\"ung inter\"net\"\" (internet cafe), and many others. Some acronyms are considered formal (or officially adopted), while many more are considered informal, slang or colloquial.\n\nThe capital's metropolitan area (Jakarta and its surrounding satellite regions), \"Jabodetabek\", is another infamous acronym. This stands for \"Ja\"karta-\"Bo\"gor-\"De\"pok-\"Ta\"ngerang-\"Bek\"asi. Many highways are also named by the acronym method; e.g. \"Jalan Tol\" (Toll Road) \"Jagorawi\" (\"Ja\"karta-Bo\"gor\"-Ci\"awi\") and \"Purbaleunyi\" (\"Pur\"wakarta-\"Ba\"ndung-Ci\"leunyi\"), Joglo Semar (\"Jog\"ja-so\"lo\"-\"semar\"ang).\n\nIn some languages, especially those that use certain alphabets, many acronyms come from the governmental use, particularly in the military and law enforcement services. The Indonesian military (TNI—\"Tentara Nasional Indonesia\") and Indonesian police (POLRI—\"Kepolisian Republik Indonesia\") are infamous for heavy acronyms use. Examples include the \"Kopassus\" (\"Ko\"mando \"Pas\"ukan Khu\"sus\"; Special Forces Command), \"Kopaska\" (\"Ko\"mando \"Pas\"ukan \"Ka\"tak; Frogmen Command), \"Kodim\" (\"Ko\"mando \"Di\"strik \"M\"iliter; Military District Command—one of the Indonesian army's administrative divisions), \"Serka\" (\"Ser\"san \"K\"ep\"a\"la; Head Sergeant), \"Akmil\" (\"Ak\"ademi \"Mil\"iter; Military Academy—in Magelang) and many other terms regarding ranks, units, divisions, procedures, etc.\n\nHeavy acronym use by Indonesians, makes it difficult for foreigners and learners of Bahasa Indonesia to seek information and news in Indonesian media.\n\nAcronyms that use parts of words (not necessarily syllables) are commonplace in Russian as well, e.g. (Gazprom), for (', gas industry). There are also initialisms, such as СМИ (\"SMI\", for ', means of mass informing, i.e. mass media). Another Russian acronym, (GULag) combines two initials and three letters of the final word: it stands for (\", Chief Administration of Camps).\n\nHistorically, OTMA was an acronym sometimes used by the daughters of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia and his consort, Alexandra Feodorovna, as a group nickname for themselves, built from the first letter of each girl's name in the order of their births : Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia.\n\nIn Swahili, acronyms are common for naming organizations such as TUKI, which stands for \" (the Institute for Swahili Research). Multiple initial letters (often the initial syllable of words) are often drawn together, as seen more in some languages than others.\n\nIn Vietnamese, which has an abundance of compound words, initialisms are very commonly used for both proper and common nouns. Examples include \"TP.HCM\" (', Ho Chi Minh City), \"THPT\" (', high school), \"CLB\" (', club), \"CSDL\" (', database), \"NXB\" (', publisher), \"ÔBACE\" (', a general form of address), and \"CTTĐVN\" (', Vietnamese Martyrs). Longer examples include \"CHXHCNVN\" (', Socialist Republic of Vietnam) and \"MTDTGPMNVN\" (\"\", Viet Cong). Long initialisms have become widespread in legal contexts in Vietnam. It is also common for a writer to coin an ad-hoc initialism for repeated use in an article.\n\nEach letter in an initialism corresponds to one morpheme—that is, one syllable. When the first letter of a syllable has a tone mark or other diacritic, the diacritic may be omitted from the initialism, for example \"ĐNA\" or \"ĐNÁ\" for \"\" (Southeast Asia) and \"LMCA\" or \"LMCÂ\" for \"Liên minh châu Âu\" (European Union). The letter \"Ư\" is often replaced by \"W\" in initialisms to avoid confusion with \"U\", for example \"UBTWMTTQVN\" or \"UBTƯMTTQVN\" for \"Ủy ban Trung ương Mặt trận Tổ quốc Việt Nam\" (Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front).\n\nInitialisms are purely a written convenience, being pronounced the same way as their expansions. As the names of many Vietnamese letters are disyllabic, it would be less convenient to pronounce an initialism by its individual letters. Acronyms pronounced as words are rare in Vietnamese, occurring when an acronym itself is borrowed from another language. Examples include ' (), a respelling of the French acronym \"SIDA\" (AIDS); ' (), a literal reading of the English initialism for Voice of America; and \"NASA\" (), borrowed directly from the English acronym.\n\nAs in Chinese, many compound words can be shortened to the first syllable when forming a longer word. For example, the term Việt Cộng is derived from the first syllables of \"Việt Nam\" (Vietnam) and \"Cộng sản\" (communist). This mechanism is limited to Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary. Unlike with Chinese, such shortened words are considered portmanteau words or blend words rather than acronyms or initialisms, because the Vietnamese alphabet still requires each component word to be written as more than one character.\n\nIn languages where nouns are declined, various methods are used. An example is Finnish, where a colon is used to separate inflection from the letters:\nThe process above is similar to how, in English, hyphens are used for clarity when prefixes are added to acronyms, thus \"pre-NATO policy\" (rather than \"preNATO\").\n\nIn languages such as Scottish Gaelic and Irish, where lenition (initial consonant mutation) is commonplace, acronyms must also be modified in situations where case and context dictate it. In the case of Scottish Gaelic, a lower case \"h\" is added after the initial consonant; for example, \"BBC Scotland\" in the genitive case would be written as \"BhBC Alba\", with the acronym pronounced \"VBC\". Likewise, the Gaelic acronym for \"television\" (\"gd: telebhisean\") is \"TBh\", pronounced \"TV\", as in English.\n\n\n\n"}

One educational technique when analyzing prose literature is to have students or teachers circle the names of characters and put rectangular boxes around phrases identifying the setting of a given scene.\n\nAnnotated bibliographies add commentary on the relevance or quality of each source, in addition to the usual bibliographic information that merely identifies the source.\n\nFrom a cognitive perspective annotation has an important role in learning and instruction. As part of guided noticing it involves highlighting, naming or labelling and commenting aspects of visual representations to help focus learners' attention on specific visual aspects. In other words, it means the assignment of typological representations (culturally meaningful categories), to topological representations (e.g. images). This is especially important when experts, such as medical doctors, interpret visualizations in detail and explain their interpretations to others, for example by means of digital technology. Here, annotation can be a way to establish common ground between interactants with different levels of knowledge. The value of annotation has been empirically confirmed, for example, in a study which shows that in computer-based teleconsultations the integration of image annotation and speech leads to significantly improved knowledge exchange compared with the use of images and speech without annotation.\n\nMarkup languages like XML and HTML annotate text in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from that text. They can be used to add information about the desired visual presentation, or machine-readable semantic information, as in the semantic web.\n\nThe \"annotate\" function (also known as \"blame\" or \"praise\") used in source control systems such as Git, Team Foundation Server and Subversion determines who committed changes to the source code into the repository. This outputs a copy of the source code where each line is annotated with the name of the last contributor to edit that line (and possibly a revision number). This can help establish blame in the event a change caused a malfunction, or identify the author of brilliant code.\n\nA special case is the Java programming language, where annotations can be used as a special form of syntactic metadata in the source code. Classes, methods, variables, parameters and packages may be annotated. The annotations can be embedded in class files generated by the compiler and may be retained by the Java virtual machine and thus influence the run-time behaviour of an application. It is possible to create meta-annotations out of the existing ones in Java.\n\nSince the 1980s, molecular biology and bioinformatics have created the need for DNA annotation. DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying the locations of genes and all of the coding regions in a genome and determining what those genes do. An annotation (irrespective of the context) is a note added by way of explanation or commentary. Once a genome is sequenced, it needs to be annotated to make sense of it.\n\nIn the digital imaging community the term annotation is commonly used for visible metadata superimposed on an image without changing the underlying master image, such as sticky notes, virtual laser pointers, circles, arrows, and black-outs (cf. redaction).\n\nIn the medical imaging community, an annotation is often referred to as a region of interest and is encoded in DICOM format.\n\nIn the United States, legal publishers such as Thomson West and Lexis Nexis publish annotated versions of statutes, providing information about court cases that have interpreted the statutes. Both the federal United States Code and state statutes are subject to interpretation by the courts, and the annotated statutes are valuable tools in legal research.\n\nIn linguistics, annotations include comments and metadata; these non-transcriptional annotations are also non-linguistic. A collection of texts with linguistic annotations is known as a corpus (plural \"corpora\"). The Linguistic Annotation Wiki describes tools and formats for creating and managing linguistic annotations.\n\n"}
{"id": "3556316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3556316", "title": "Apples and oranges", "text": "Apples and oranges\n\nA comparison of apples and oranges occurs when two items or groups of items are compared that cannot be practically compared.\n\nThe idiom, \"comparing apples and oranges\", refers to the apparent differences between items which are popularly thought to be incomparable or incommensurable, such as apples and oranges. The idiom may also be used to indicate that a false analogy has been made between two items, such as where an \"apple\" is faulted for not being a good \"orange\".\n\nThe idiom is not unique to English. In Quebec French, it may take the form \"comparer des pommes avec des oranges\" (to compare apples and oranges), while in European French the idiom says \"comparer des pommes et des poires\" (to compare apples and pears). In Latin American Spanish, it is usually \"comparar papas y boniatos\" (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or commonly for all varieties of Spanish \"comparar peras con manzanas\" (comparing pears and apples). In some other languages the term for 'orange' derives from 'apple', suggesting not only that a direct comparison between the two is possible, but that it is implicitly present in their names. Fruit other than apples and oranges can also be compared; for example, apples and pears are compared in Danish, Dutch, German, Spanish, Swedish, Croatian, Czech, Romanian, Hungarian, Italian, Slovene, Luxembourgish, Serbian, and Turkish. In fact, in the Spanish-speaking world, a common idiom is \"sumar peras con manzanas\", that is, \"to add pears and apples\"; the same thing applies in Italian (\"sommare le mele con le pere\") and Romanian (\"a aduna merele cu perele\"). In Portuguese, the expression is \"comparar laranjas com bananas\" (compare orange to banana). In Czech, the idiom \"míchat jablka s hruškami\" literally means 'to mix apples and pears'.\n\nSome languages use completely different items, such as the Serbian \"Поредити бабе и жабе\" (comparing grandmothers and toads), or the Romanian \"baba şi mitraliera\" (the grandmother and the machine gun); \"vaca şi izmenele\" (the cow and the longjohns); or \"țiganul şi carioca\" (the gypsy and the marker), or the Welsh \"mor wahanol â mêl a menyn\" (as different as honey and butter), while some languages compare dissimilar properties of dissimilar items. For example, an equivalent Danish idiom, \"Hvad er højest, Rundetårn eller et tordenskrald?\" means \"What is highest, the Round Tower or a thunderclap?\", referring to the size of the former and the sound of the latter. In Russian, the phrase \"сравнивать тёплое с мягким\" (to compare warm and soft) is used. In Argentina, a common question is \"¿En qué se parecen el amor y el ojo del hacha?\" (What do love and the eye of an axe have in common?) and emphasizes dissimilarity between two subjects; in Colombia, a similar (though more rude) version is common: \"confundir la mierda con la pomada\" (to confuse shit with ointment). In Polish, the expression \"co ma piernik do wiatraka?\" is used, meaning \"What has (is) gingerbread to a windmill?\". In Chinese, a phrase that has the similar meaning is 风马牛不相及 (fēng mǎ niú bù xiāng jí), literally meaning \"horses and cattles won't mate with each other\", and later used to describe things that are totally unrelated and incomparable.\n\nA number of more exaggerated comparisons are sometimes made, in cases in which the speaker believes the two objects being compared are radically different. For example, \"oranges with orangutans\", \"apples with dishwashers\", and so on. In English, different fruits, such as pears, plums, or lemons are sometimes substituted for oranges in this context.\n\nSometimes the two words sound similar, for example, Romanian \"merele cu perele\" (apples and pears) and the Hungarian \"szezont a fazonnal\" (the season with the fashion).\n\nAt least two tongue-in-cheek scientific studies have been conducted on the subject, each of which concluded that apples can be compared with oranges fairly easily and on a low budget and the two fruits are quite similar.\n\nThe first study, conducted by Scott A. Sandford of the NASA Ames Research Center, used infrared spectroscopy to analyze both apples and oranges. The study, which was published in the satirical science magazine \"Annals of Improbable Research\", concluded: \"[...] the comparing apples and oranges defense should no longer be considered valid. This is a somewhat startling revelation. It can be anticipated to have a dramatic effect on the strategies used in arguments and discussions in the future.\"\n\nA second study, written by Stamford Hospital's surgeon-in-chief James Barone and published in the \"British Medical Journal,\" noted that the phrase \"apples and oranges\" was appearing with increasing frequency in the medical literature, with some notable articles comparing \"Desflurane and propofol\" and \"Salmeterol and ipratropium\" with \"apples and oranges\". The study also found that both apples and oranges were sweet, similar in size, weight, and shape, that both are grown in orchards, and both may be eaten, juiced, and so on. The only significant differences found were in terms of seeds (the study used seedless oranges), the involvement of Johnny Appleseed, and color.\n\nThe \"Annals of Improbable Research\" subsequently noted that the \"earlier investigation was done with more depth, more rigour, and, most importantly, more expensive equipment\" than the \"British Medical Journal\" study.\n\nOn April Fools' Day 2014, \"The Economist\" compared worldwide production of apples and oranges from 1983 to 2013, however noted them to be \"unrelated variables\".\n\nWhile references to comparing apples and oranges are often a rhetorical device, references to adding apples and oranges are made in the case of teaching students the proper uses of units. Here, the admonition not to \"add apples and oranges\" refers to the requirement that two quantities with different units may not be combined by addition, although they may always be combined in ratio form by multiplication, so that multiplying ratios of apples and oranges is allowed. Similarly, the concept of this distinction is often used metaphorically in elementary algebra.\n\nThe admonition is really more of a mnemonic, since in general counts of objects have no intrinsic unit and, for example, a number count of apples may be dimensionless or have dimension \"fruit\"; in either of these two cases, apples and oranges may indeed be added.\n\n"}

{"id": "14322444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14322444", "title": "Comparative advertising", "text": "Comparative advertising\n\nComparative advertising or advertising war is an advertisement in which a particular product, or service, specifically mentions a competitor by name for the express purpose of showing why the competitor is inferior to the product naming it. Also referred to as \"knocking copy\", it is loosely defined as advertising where “the advertised brand is explicitly compared with one or more competing brands and the comparison is obvious to the audience.”\n\nThis should not be confused with parody advertisements, where a fictional product is being advertised for the purpose of poking fun at the particular advertisement, nor should it be confused with the use of a coined brand name for the purpose of comparing the product without actually naming an actual competitor. (\"Wikipedia tastes better and is less filling than the Encyclopedia Galactica.\")\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) defined comparative advertising as “advertisement that compares alternative brands on objectively measurable attributes or price, and identifies the alternative brand by name, illustration or other distinctive information.” This definition was used in the case Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd. Similarly, the Law Council of Australia recently suggested that comparative advertising refers to “advertising which include reference to a competitor’s trademark in a way which does not impute proprietorship in the mark to the advertiser.”\n\nComparative advertisements could be either indirectly or directly comparative, positive or negative, and seeks “to associate or differentiate the two competing brands”. Different countries apply differing views regarding the laws on comparative advertising.\n\nThe earliest court case concerning comparative advertising dates back to 1910 in the United States – Saxlehner v Wagner. Prior to the 1970s, comparative advertising was deemed unfeasible due to related risks. For instance, comparative advertising could invite misidentification of products, potential legal issues, and may even win public sympathy for their competitors as victims.\n\nIn 1972, the FTC began to encourage advertisers to make comparison with named competitors, with the broad, public welfare objective of creating more informative advertising. The FTC argued that this form of advertising could also stimulate comparison shopping, encourage product improvement and innovation, and foster a positive competitive environment. However, studies have shown that while comparative advertisements had increased since 1960, the relative amount of comparative advertising is still small.\n\nPrior to 1997, many European countries severely limited comparative claims as an advertising practice. For example, in Germany comparisons in advertising had since the 1930's been largely prohibited as an anti-competitive practice, with very limited exceptions for cases where the advertiser had a good reason for presenting a critical claim, and reference to a competitor was necessary in order to present that claim. Importantly, this only applied to \"critical\" claims - claims of equivalence were completely prohibited. A similar approach had been adopted in France, where comparative advertising was commonly seen as disparaging of competitors. However, the legalisation of comparative advertising in France in 1992, opened the door to a general legalisation of comparative advertising through EU law, which had first been proposed by the European Commission in 1978. The result was the adoption of Directive 97/55/EC, which came into force in the year 2000. The relevant provisions are now contained in Directive 2006/114/EC.\n\nThis Directive sets out rules that comparative advertising must comply with in order to be considered permissible. These include the requirements that the comparison concern goods and services that meet the same purpose, that it objectively compare the relevant characteristics of the products concerned and that it not cause confusion or denigrate the trademarks and other distinguishing signs of competitors. The Directive prohibits comparisons that take unfair advantage of the reputation of a competitor's distinguishing marks, or present goods or services as imitations of products covered by a protected trade mark or trade name. Additionally, any comparison aimed at promoting goods bearing a protected designation of origin must refer exclusively to other goods bearing the same designation. Directive 2006/114/EC constitutes a total harmonisation of the rules on comparative advertising, meaning that the Member States are neither allowed to permit comparisons that breach the requirements of the Directive, nor prohibit ones that do. \n\nFurther, while trademark rights can in principle be used to prevent comparative advertising that makes unauthorised use of a competitor's trademark, this is not the case where the comparative advertisement complies with all the requirements of Directive 2006/114/EC. Legitimate comparative advertising must therefore be seen as an exception to the exclusive rights of the trademark proprietor. However, the trademark proprietor can, thanks to the prohibition on taking unfair advantage of a trademark's reputation, oppose the use of their trademark where it is not aimed at distinguishing the products of the advertiser and trademark proprietor and to highlight their differences objectively, but rather at riding on the coat-tails of that mark in order to benefit from its reputation.\n\nThe requirements set out by the Directive have resulted in some controversy. This is particularly true of the \"per se\" prohibition on comparisons presenting goods and services as imitations of trademarked products. In this regard, EU law contrasts starkly with the US approach; the US courts have long held that traders are allowed to the trademarked names of products they have imitated in advertising. In contrast, in L'Oréal and others v. Bellure, the Court of Justice held that smell-alike perfumes marketed through comparison lists breached this condition. This decision was criticised both by the English courts and by scholars, who have considered that this places unjustified limits on advertising acts that are otherwise fully legal, such as copying that does not infringe intellectual property rights. \n\nIn the UK, most of the use of competitor’s registered trademark in a comparative advertisement was an infringement of the registration up till the end of 1994. However, the laws on comparative advertising were harmonized in 2000. The current rules on comparative advertising are regulated by a series of EU Directives. The Business Protection from Misleading Marketing Regulations 2008 implements provisions of Directive (EC) 2006/114 in the UK.\n\nOne of the classic cases of comparative advertising in the UK was the O2 v Hutchison case. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) held that there could have been a trademark infringement when a comparative advertiser used the registered trademark for the advertiser’s own goods and services. It was also held that a trademark proprietor could not prevent a competitor’s use of a sign similar or identical to his mark in a comparative advertisement, which satisfies all the conditions of the Comparative Advertising Directive. If the Advocate General's decision in the O2 case were followed by the ECJ, competitors will not be able to use trademark legislation either to prevent a comparative advertisement through an injunction or to charge in respect of its use. Conversely, in British Airways plc v Ryanair Ltd. a lenient approach was adopted by the UK courts. The use of competitors’ trademarks was no longer restricted for businesses competing within an industry, provided that compliance of the conditions set out in the legislation were performed. This meant that businesses are able to use the trademarks of other companies and trade names to distinguish the relative merits of their own products and services over those of their competitors.\n\nThe FTC and the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. (NAD), govern the laws of comparative advertising in the United States including the treatment of comparative advertising claims. FTC stated that comparative advertising could benefit consumers and encourages comparative advertising, provided that the comparisons are “clearly identified, truthful, and non-deceptive”. Although comparative advertising is encouraged, NAD has stated “claims that expressly or implicitly disparage a competing product should be held to the highest level of scrutiny in order to ensure that they are truthful, accurate, and narrowly drawn.” Another major law is the trademark protective Lanham Act, which states that one could incur liability when the message of the comparative advertisement is untrue or uncertain, but has the intention to deceive consumers through the implied message conveyed.\n\nIn Australia, no specific law governs comparative advertising although certain cases regarding this matter have occurred. Comparative advertising that is truthful, and does not lead to confusion is permitted.\n\nGenerally, Australian advertisers should make sure that the following are complied when exercising comparative advertising to avoid breaches regarding misleading advertising under Australia Consumer Law:\n\n\nThe law in Hong Kong regarding comparative advertising is the law that existed in the UK prior to the enactment of the UK Act 1994. Hong Kong has no legislation exclusively intended at limiting false or misleading advertisements. Still, the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (Cap 362) bans the use of false trade descriptions in advertisements. The tort of trade libel also exists to deal with false or misleading advertisements designed to injure the competitor. Consumer Council may have the authority to publish information with a perspective to amending false or misleading advertisements, while the Association of Accredited Advertising Agencies of Hong Kong have the authority to take action against members who organize advertisements that are inaccurate.\n\nIn Argentina, there is no specific statute dealing with comparative advertising (so it is not forbidden), but there are clear jurisprudential rules based on unfair competition law. If in some manner an advertisement is proven to be unfair or exceeds ethical standards by hiding the truth or omitting some essential aspect of the comparison, it is probable that an injunction will be granted and that the plaintiff will be able to obtain a final decision declaring the advertising illegal.\n\nNumerous cases follow international precedent in referring to the requirements of the European Union Directive on comparative advertising. By following these criteria, Argentine courts have developed standards very similar to European regulation. It is as if the judges wanted to validate the law created by the Courts with an external source. Similar conclusions reached elsewhere indicate the existence of universally accepted principles that accept that comparing products in commercial advertisements should be lawful.\n\nIn Brazil, the allow comparative advertising with certain restrictions. Its primary purpose shall be the clarification or consumer’s protection; it shall have as basic principle the objectiveness of the comparison since subjective data, psychological or emotionally based data does not constitute a valid comparison basis for consumers; the purposed or implemented comparison shall be capable of being supported byevidence; in the case of consumption goods, the comparison shall be made with models manufactured in the same year and no comparison shall be made between products manufactured in different years, unless it is only a reference to show evolution, in which case the evolution shall be clearly demonstrated; there shall be no confusion between the products and competitor’s brands; there shall be no unfair competition, denigration of the product’s image or another company’s product; and there shall be no unreasonable use of the corporate image or goodwill of third parties.\n\nLikewise, the majority of the Brazilian authors is inclined to say that its legitimacy depends to meet certain requirements, which, in general, would be stipulated by Article 3a of Directive 84/450/EEC \n\nIn an early Mercosur's rules through Resolution 126/96.\n\nComparative advertising has been increasingly implemented through the years, and the types of comparative advertising range from comparing a single attribute dimension, comparing an attribute unique to the target and absent in the referent and comparisons involving attributes unique to both brands. The contributing factors to the effectiveness of comparative advertising include believability, which refers to the extent a consumer can rely on the information provided in comparative advertisements, the level of involvement, and the convenience in evaluation, provided by spoon feeding the consumer with information that does not require extra effort in recall.\n\nComparative advertising is generally coupled with negativity, as evidenced by early industry condemnation. Stating reasons such as participation in comparative advertising damaged the honour and credibility of advertising. Studies have suggested that negative information can be stored more effectively, thus generating the impact that any advertisement is purposed for, and more importantly, strong recall. On the contrary, such negativity can either be transferred directly to the brand and the consumer’s impression of the brand, various studies through the years have proven that comparative advertising has been responded to negatively.\n\nComparative advertising has been used effectively by companies like The National Australia Bank (NAB), and its “break up” campaign has made such an impact it has won an award from Cannes, and a substantial increase in its consumer interest. Internationally acclaimed Apple Inc. has effectively utilized its Mac vs PC advertisements as part of its marketing efforts to increase its market share over the years. Such companies prove the academic view that comparative advertising is more successful when used by established brands, justified by the credibility and attention an established brand brings. Other famous examples include L’Oreal SA v Bellure NV and Coca Cola v Pepsi. Comparative advertising has to be executed with caution and deep consideration for the targeted markets as the novelty of the concept affects the effectiveness of the stipulated campaigns.\n\nIn the 1980s, during what has been referred to as the cola wars, soft-drink manufacturer Pepsi ran a series of advertisements where people, caught on hidden camera, in a blind taste test, chose Pepsi over rival Coca-Cola.\nThe use of comparative advertising has been well established in political campaigns, where typically one candidate will run ads where the record of the other candidate is displayed, for the purpose of disparaging the other candidate. The most famous of these type ads, which only ran once on TV, consisted of a child picking daisies in a field, while a voice which sounded like Barry Goldwater performed a countdown to zero before the launch of a nuclear weapon which explodes in a mushroom cloud. The ad, \"Daisy\", was produced by Lyndon B. Johnson's campaign in an attempt to prevent Goldwater from either winning the nomination of his party or being selected.\n\nAnother example took place throughout the late 1980s between the bitter rivals Nintendo and Sega. \"Genesis does what Nintendon't\" immediately became a catchphrase following the release of the Sega Genesis (known as Mega Drive in PAL countries).\n\nA 30-second commercial promoting sustainability, showing soda bottles exploding each time a person makes a drink using his Sodastream machine, was banned in the United Kingdom in 2012. Clearcast, the organization that preapproves TV advertising in the U.K., explained that they \"thought it was a denigration of the bottled drinks market.\" The same ad, crafted by Alex Bogusky, ran in the United States, Sweden, Australia, and other countries. An appeal by Sodastream to reverse Clearcast's decision to censor the commercial was rejected. A similar ad was expected to air during Super Bowl XLVII in February 2013 but was banned by CBS for jabbing at Coke and Pepsi (two of CBS's largest sponsors).\n\nIn 2012, Microsoft's Bing (formerly MSN Search) began to run a campaign about which search engine they prefer as it compared Bing to Google, and that more people preferred Bing over Google. The campaign was titled \"Bing It On\".\n"}

Similarly, gene activity in the human brain is better understood through examination of the brains of mice by the Seattle-based Allen Institute for Brain Science (see link below), yielding the freely available Allen Brain Atlas. This type of study is related to comparative cognition, but better classified as one of comparative genomics. Increasing emphasis in psychology and ethology on the biological aspects of perception and behavior is bridging the gap between genomics and behavioral analysis.\n\nIn order for scientists to better understand cognitive function across a broad range of species they can systematically compare cognitive abilities between closely and distantly related species Through this process they can determine what kinds of selection pressure has led to different cognitive abilities across a broad range of animals. For example, it has been hypothesized that there is convergent evolution of the higher cognitive functions of corvids and apes, possibly due to both being omnivorous, visual animals that live in social groups.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "917868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=917868", "title": "Comparative genomics", "text": "Comparative genomics\n\nComparative genomics is a field of biological research in which the genomic features of different organisms are compared. The genomic features may include the DNA sequence, genes, gene order, regulatory sequences, and other genomic structural landmarks. In this branch of genomics, whole or large parts of genomes resulting from genome projects are compared to study basic biological similarities and differences as well as evolutionary relationships between organisms. The major principle of comparative genomics is that common features of two organisms will often be encoded within the DNA that is evolutionarily conserved between them. Therefore, comparative genomic approaches start with making some form of alignment of genome sequences and looking for orthologous sequences (sequences that share a common ancestry) in the aligned genomes and checking to what extent those sequences are conserved. Based on these, genome and molecular evolution are inferred and this may in turn be put in the context of, for example, phenotypic evolution or population genetics.\n\nVirtually started as soon as the whole genomes of two organisms became available (that is, the genomes of the bacteria \"Haemophilus influenzae\" and \"Mycoplasma genitalium\") in 1995, comparative genomics is now a standard component of the analysis of every new genome sequence. With the explosion in the number of genome projects due to the advancements in DNA sequencing technologies, particularly the next-generation sequencing methods in late 2000s, this field has become more sophisticated, making it possible to deal with many genomes in a single study. Comparative genomics has revealed high levels of similarity between closely related organisms, such as humans and chimpanzees, and, more surprisingly, similarity between seemingly distantly related organisms, such as humans and the yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\". It has also showed the extreme diversity of the gene\ncomposition in different evolutionary lineages.\n\n\"See also\": History of genomics\n\nComparative genomics has a root in the comparison of virus genomes in the early 1980s. For example, small RNA viruses infecting animals (picornaviruses) and those infecting plants (cowpea mosaic virus) were compared and turned out to share significant sequence similarity and, in part, the order of their genes. In 1986, the first comparative genomic study at a larger scale was published, comparing the genomes of varicella-zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus that contained more than 100 genes each.\n\nThe first complete genome sequence of a cellular organism, that of \"Haemophilus influenzae\" Rd, was published in 1995. The second genome sequencing paper was of the small parasitic bacterium \"Mycoplasma genitalium\" published in the same year. Starting from this paper, reports on new genomes inevitably became comparative-genomic studies.\n\nThe first high-resolution whole genome comparison system was developed in 1998 by Art Delcher, Simon Kasif and Steven Salzberg and applied to the comparison of entire highly related microbial organisms with their collaborators at the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). The system is called MUMMER and was described in a publication in Nucleic Acids Research in 1999. The system helps researchers to identify large rearrangements, single base mutations, reversals, tandem repeat expansions and other polymorphisms. In bacteria, MUMMER enables the identification of polymorphisms that are responsible for virulence, pathogenicity, and anti-biotic resistance. The system was also applied to the Minimal Organism Project at TIGR and subsequently to many other comparative genomics projects.\n\n\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", the baker's yeast, was the first eukaryote to have its complete genome sequence published in 1996. After the publication of the roundworm \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" genome in 1998 and together with the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\" genome in 2000, Gerald M. Rubin and his team published a paper titled \"Comparative Genomics of the Eukaryotes\", in which they compared the genomes of the eukaryotes \"D. melanogaster\", \"C. elegans\", and \"S. cerevisiae\", as well as the prokaryote \"H. influenzae\". At the same time, Bonnie Berger, Eric Lander, and their team published a paper on whole-genome comparison of human and mouse.\n\nWith the publication of the large genomes of vertebrates in the 2000s, including human, the Japanese pufferfish \"Takifugu rubripes\", and mouse, precomputed results of large genome comparisons have been released for downloading or for visualization in a genome browser. Instead of undertaking their own analyses, most biologists can access these large cross-species comparisons and avoid the impracticality caused by the size of the genomes.\n\nNext-generation sequencing methods, which were first introduced in 2007, have produced an enormous amount of genomic data and have allowed researchers to generate multiple (prokaryotic) draft genome sequences at once. These methods can also quickly uncover single-nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and deletions by mapping unassembled reads against a well annotated reference genome, and thus provide a list of possible gene differences that may be the basis for any functional variation among strains.\n\nOne character of biology is evolution, evolutionary theory is also the theoretical foundation of comparative genomics, and at the same time the results of comparative genomics unprecedentedly enriched and developed the theory of evolution. When two or more of the genome sequence are compared, one can deduce the evolutionary relationships of the sequences in a phylogenetic tree. Based on a variety of biological genome data and the study of vertical and horizontal evolution processes, one can understand vital parts of the gene structure and its regulatory function.\n\nSimilarity of related genomes is the basis of comparative genomics. If two creatures have a recent common ancestor, the differences between the two species genomes are evolved from the ancestors’ genome. The closer the relationship between two organisms, the higher the similarities between their genomes. If there is close relationship between them, then their genome will display a linear behaviour (synteny), namely some or all of the genetic sequences are conserved. Thus, the genome sequences can be used to identify gene function, by analyzing their homology (sequence similarity) to genes of known function.\n\nOrthologous sequences are related sequences in different species: a gene exists in the original species, the species divided into two species, so genes in new species are orthologous to the sequence in the original species. Paralogous sequences are separated by gene cloning (gene duplication): if a particular gene in the genome is copied, then the copy of the two sequences is paralogous to the original gene. A pair of orthologous sequences is called orthologous pairs (orthologs), a pair of paralogous sequence is called collateral pairs (paralogs). Orthologous pairs usually have the same or similar function, which is not necessarily the case for collateral pairs. In collateral pairs, the sequences tend to evolve into having different functions.\nComparative genomics exploits both similarities and differences in the proteins, RNA, and regulatory regions of different organisms to infer how selection has acted upon these elements. Those elements that are responsible for similarities between different species should be conserved through time (stabilizing selection), while those elements responsible for differences among species should be divergent (positive selection). Finally, those elements that are unimportant to the evolutionary success of the organism will be unconserved (selection is neutral).\n\nOne of the important goals of the field is the identification of the mechanisms of eukaryotic genome evolution. It is however often complicated by the multiplicity of events that have taken place throughout the history of individual lineages, leaving only distorted and superimposed traces in the genome of each living organism. For this reason comparative genomics studies of small model organisms (for example the model Caenorhabditis elegans and closely related Caenorhabditis briggsae) are of great importance to advance our understanding of general mechanisms of evolution.\n\nComputational approaches to genome comparison have recently become a common research topic in computer science. A public collection of case studies and demonstrations is growing, ranging from whole genome comparisons to gene expression analysis. This has increased the introduction of different ideas, including concepts from systems and control, information theory, strings analysis and data mining. It is anticipated that computational approaches will become and remain a standard topic for research and teaching, while multiple courses will begin training students to be fluent in both topics.\n\nComputational tools for analyzing sequences and complete genomes are developing quickly due to the availability of large amount of genomic data. At the same time, comparative analysis tools are progressed and improved. In the challenges about these analyses, it is very important to visualize the comparative results.\n\nVisualization of sequence conservation is a tough task of comparative sequence analysis. As we know, it is highly inefficient to examine the alignment of long genomic regions manually. Internet-based genome browsers provide many useful tools for investigating genomic sequences due to integrating all sequence-based biological information on genomic regions. When we extract large amount of relevant biological data, they can be very easy to use and less time-consuming.\n\n\nAn advantage of using online tools is that these websites are being developed and updated constantly. There are many new settings and content can be used online to improve efficiency.\n\nAgriculture is a field that reaps the benefits of comparative genomics. Identifying the loci of advantageous genes is a key step in breeding crops that are optimized for greater yield, cost-efficiency, quality, and disease resistance. For example, one genome wide association study conducted on 517 rice landraces revealed 80 loci associated with several categories of agronomic performance, such as grain weight, amylose content, and drought tolerance. Many of the loci were previously uncharacterized. Not only is this methodology powerful, it is also quick. Previous methods of identifying loci associated with agronomic performance required several generations of carefully monitored breeding of parent strains, a time consuming effort that is unnecessary for comparative genomic studies.\n\nThe medical field also benefits from the study of comparative genomics. Vaccinology in particular has experienced useful advances in technology due to genomic approaches to problems. In an approach known as reverse vaccinology, researchers can discover candidate antigens for vaccine development by analyzing the genome of a pathogen or a family of pathogens. Applying a comparative genomics approach by analyzing the genomes of several related pathogens can lead to the development of vaccines that are multiprotective. A team of researchers employed such an approach to create a universal vaccine for Group B Streptococcus, a group of bacteria responsible for severe neonatal infection. Comparative genomics can also be used to generate specificity for vaccines against pathogens that are closely related to commensal microorganisms. For example, researchers used comparative genomic analysis of commensal and pathogenic strains of E. coli to identify pathogen specific genes as a basis for finding antigens that result in immune response against pathogenic strains but not commensal ones.\n\nComparative genomics also opens up new avenues in other areas of research. As DNA sequencing technology has become more accessible, the number of sequenced genomes has grown. With the increasing reservoir of available genomic data, the potency of comparative genomic inference has grown as well. A notable case of this increased potency is found in recent primate research. Comparative genomic methods have allowed researchers to gather information about genetic variation, differential gene expression, and evolutionary dynamics in primates that were indiscernible using previous data and methods. The Great Ape Genome Project used comparative genomic methods to investigate genetic variation with reference to the six great ape species, finding healthy levels of variation in their gene pool despite shrinking population size. Another study showed that patterns of DNA methylation, which are a known regulation mechanism for gene expression, differ in the prefrontal cortex of humans versus chimps, and implicated this difference in the evolutionary divergence of the two species.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9435784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9435784", "title": "Comparative physiology", "text": "Comparative physiology\n\nComparative physiology is a subdiscipline of physiology that studies and exploits the diversity of functional characteristics of various kinds of organisms. It is closely related to evolutionary physiology and environmental physiology. Many universities offer undergraduate courses that cover comparative aspects of animal physiology. According to Clifford Ladd Prosser, \"Comparative Physiology\nis not so much a defined discipline as a viewpoint, a philosophy.\"\n\nOriginally, physiology focused primarily on human beings, in large part from a desire to improve medical practices. When physiologists first began comparing different species it was sometimes out of simple curiosity to understand how organisms work but also stemmed from a desire to discover basic physiological principles. This use of specific organisms convenient to study specific questions is known as the Krogh Principle.\n\nC. Ladd Prosser, a founder of modern comparative physiology, outlined a broad agenda for comparative physiology in his 1950 edited volume (see summary and discussion in Garland and Carter):\n\n1. To describe how different kinds of animals meet their needs.\n\n2. The use of physiological information to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of organisms.\n\n3. To elucidate how physiology mediates interactions between organisms and their environments.\n\n4. To identify \"model systems\" for studying particular physiological functions.\n\n5. To use the \"kind of animal\" as an experimental variable.\n\nComparative physiologists often study organisms that live in \"extreme\" environments (e.g., deserts) because they expect to find especially clear examples of evolutionary adaptation. One example is the study of water balance in desert-inhabiting mammals, which have been found to exhibit kidney specializations.\n\nSimilarly, comparative physiologists have been attracted to \"unusual\" organisms, such as very large or small ones. As an example, of the latter, hummingbirds have been studied. As another example, giraffe have been studied because of their long necks and the expectation that this would lead to specializations related to the regulation of blood pressure. More generally, ectothermic vertebrates have been studied to determine how blood acid-base balance and pH change as body temperature changes.\n\nIn the United States, research in comparative physiology is funded by both the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.\n\nA number of scientific societies feature sections on comparative physiology, including:\n\nKnut Schmidt-Nielsen (1915–2007) was a major figure in vertebrate comparative physiology, serving on the faculty at Duke University for many years and training a large number of students (obituary). He also authored several books, including an influential text, all known for their accessible writing style.\n\nGrover C. Stephens (1925–2003) was a well-known invertebrate comparative physiologist, serving on the faculty of the University of Minnesota until becoming the founding chairman of the Department of Organismic Biology at the University of California at Irvine in 1964. He was the mentor for numerous graduate students, many of whom have gone on to further build the field (obituary). He authored several books and in addition to being an accomplished biologist was also an accomplished pianist and philosopher.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1719952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1719952", "title": "Comparative research", "text": "Comparative research\n\nComparative research is a research methodology in the social sciences that aims to make comparisons across different countries or cultures. A major problem in comparative research is that the data sets in different countries may not use the same categories, or define categories differently (for example by using different definitions of poverty).\n\nAs Moutsios argues, cross-cultural and comparative research should be seen as part of the scientific spirit that arose in Greece in the 6th century and the overall appreciation of knowledge and learning that was characteristic of the 5th century. In other words, it is part of the emergence of \"episteme\" and \"philo-sophia\", as a love for knowledge that is independent from material benefits. \"Episteme\", as a form and activity in the field of \"logos\", marked the break of cognitive closure and advanced empirical inquiry, logical argumentation and the search for truth. And the high esteem for intellectual activity gave rise to a genuine curiosity about other cultures – which has lain thereafter at the heart of comparative inquiry.\n\nMoreover, behind the Greek comparative gaze also was the philosophical and political questioning which characterised the life of the democratic \"polis\". Philosophical inquiry, from the Milesians down to the Sophists, questioned the representations and the cognitive traditions of their own people; the inquiry of the traditions of other peoples was, as Herodotus’ \"Histories\" demonstrate, an activity associated with the ethos of philosophical critique that characterised democratic life in Greece. Similarly, questioning of the Greek laws and institutions and its related values and practices (e.g. \"isegoria\" and \"parrhesia\"), as part of Greek politics, is associated with the effort of the first historians to reflect on home institutions through researching those of others.\n\nAccording also to Karl Deutsch, we have been using this form of investigation for over 2,000 years. Comparing things is essential to basic scientific and philosophic inquiry, which has been done for a long time. Most authors are more conservative in their estimate of how long comparative research has been with us. It is largely an empty debate over the definition of the tradition with those questioning whether comparing things counts as comparative research.\n\nTextbooks on this form of study were beginning to appear by the 1880s, but its rise to extreme popularity began after World War II. There are numerous reasons that comparative research has come to take a place of honour in the toolbox of the social scientist. Globalization has been a major factor, increasing the desire and possibility for educational exchanges and intellectual curiosity about other cultures. Information technology has enabled greater production of quantitative data for comparison, and international communications technology has facilitated this information to be easily spread.\n\nComparative research, simply put, is the act of comparing two or more things with a view to discovering something about one or all of the things being compared. This technique often utilizes multiple disciplines in one study. When it comes to method, the majority agreement is that there is no methodology peculiar to comparative research. The multidisciplinary approach is good for the flexibility it offers, yet comparative programs do have a case to answer against the call that their research lacks a \"seamless whole.\" \n\nThere are certainly methods that are far more common than others in comparative studies, however. Quantitative analysis is much more frequently pursued than qualitative, and this is seen by the majority of comparative studies which use quantitative data. The general method of comparing things is the same for comparative research as it is in our everyday practice of comparison. Like cases are treated alike, and different cases are treated differently; the extent of difference determines how differently cases are to be treated. If one is able to sufficiently distinguish two carry the research conclusions will not be very helpful. \n\nSecondary analysis of quantitative data is relatively widespread in comparative research, undoubtedly in part because of the cost of obtaining primary data for such large things as a country's policy environment. This study is generally aggregate data analysis. Comparing large quantities of data (especially government sourced) is prevalent. A typical method of comparing welfare states is to take balance of their levels of spending on social welfare.\n\nIn line with how a lot of theorizing has gone in the last century, comparative research does not tend to investigate \"grand theories,\" such as Marxism. It instead occupies itself with middle-range theories that do not purport to describe our social system in its entirety, but a subset of it. A good example of this is the common research program that looks for differences between two or more social systems, then looks at these differences in relation to some other variable coexisting in those societies to see if it is related. The classic case of this is Esping-Andersen's research on social welfare systems. He noticed there was a difference in types of social welfare systems, and compared them based on their level of decommodification of social welfare goods. He found that he was able to class welfare states into three types, based on their level of decommodification. He further theorized from this that decommodification was based on a combination of class coalitions and mobilization, and regime legacy. Here, Esping-Andersen is using comparative research: he takes many western countries and compares their level of decommodification, then develops a theory of the divergence based on his findings.\n\nComparative research can take many forms. Two key factors are space and time. Spatially, cross-national comparisons are by far the most common, although comparisons within countries, contrasting different areas, cultures or governments also subsist and are very constructive, especially in a country like New Zealand, where policy often changes depending on which race it pertains to. Recurrent interregional studies include comparing similar or different countries or sets of countries, comparing one's own country to others or to the whole world.\n\nThe historical comparative research involves comparing different time-frames. The two main choices within this model are comparing two stages in time (either snapshots or time-series), or just comparing the same thing over time, to see if a policy's effects differ over a stretch of time.\n\nWhen it comes to subject matter of comparative inquiries, many contend there is none unique to it. This may indeed be true, but a brief perusal of comparative endeavours reveals there are some topics more recurrent than others. Determining whether socioeconomic or political factors are more important in explaining government action is a familiar theme. In general, however, the only thing that is certain in comparative research issues is the existence of differences to be analysed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11797804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11797804", "title": "Comparison (grammar)", "text": "Comparison (grammar)\n\nComparison is a feature in the morphology or syntax of some languages, whereby adjectives and adverbs are inflected or modified to indicate the relative degree of the property defined by the adjective or adverb. The comparative expresses a comparison between two (or more) entities or groups of entities in quality, quantity, or degree; the superlative is the form of an adverb or adjective that is the greatest degree of a given descriptor.\n\nThe grammatical category associated with comparison of adjectives and adverbs is degree of comparison. The usual degrees of comparison are the \"positive\", which simply denotes a property (as with the English words \"big\" and \"fully\"); the \"comparative\", which indicates \"greater degree (as \"bigger\" and \"more fully\"); and the \"superlative\", which indicates \"greatest degree (as \"biggest\" and \"most fully\"). Some languages have forms indicating a very large degree of a particular quality (called elative in Semitic linguistics). Other languages (e.g. English) can express lesser degree, e.g. \"beautiful\", \"less beautiful\", \"least beautiful\".\n\nThe comparative is frequently associated with adjectives and adverbs because these words take the \"-er\" suffix or modifying word \"more\" or \"less\" (e.g., \"faster\", \"more intelligent\", \"less wasteful\"); it can also, however, appear when no adjective or adverb is present, for instance with nouns (e.g., \"more men than women\"). One preposition, \"near\", also has a superlative form, as in \"Find the restaurant nearest your house\".\n\nComparatives and superlatives may be formed morphologically, by inflection, as with the English and German \"-er\" and \"-(e)st\" forms, or syntactically, as with the English \"more...\" and \"most...\" and the French \"plus...\" and \"le plus...\" forms. Common adjectives and adverbs often produce irregular forms, such as \"better\" and \"best\" (from \"good\") and \"less\" and \"least\" (from \"little/few\") in English, and \"meilleur\" (from \"bon\") and \"mieux\" (from the adverb \"bien\") in French.\n\nMost if not all languages have some means of forming the comparative, although these means can vary significantly from one language to the next.\n\nComparatives are often used with a conjunction or other grammatical means to indicate with what the comparison is being made, as with \"than\" in English, \"als\" in German, etc. In Russian and Greek (Ancient, Koine and Modern) this can be done by placing the compared noun in the genitive case. With superlatives, the class of things being considered for comparison may be indicated, as in \"the best swimmer out of all the girls\".\n\nLanguages also possess other structures for comparing adjectives and adverbs; English examples include \"as... as\" and \"less/least...\".\n\nА few languages apply comparison to nouns and even verbs. One such language is Bulgarian, where expressions like \"по̀ човек (po chovek), най човек (nay chovek), по-малко човек (po malko chovek)\" (literally \"more person\", \"most person\", \"less person\" but normally \"better kind of a person\", \"best kind of person\", \"not that good kind of a person\") and \"по̀ обичам (po obicham), най-малко обичам (nay malko obicham)\" (\"I like more\", \"I like the least\") are quite usual.\n\nIn many languages, including English, traditional grammar requires the comparative form to be used when exactly two things are being considered, even in constructions where the superlative would be used when considering a larger number. For instance, \"May the better man win\" would be considered correct if there are only two individuals competing. However, this rule is not always observed in informal usage; the form \"May the best man win\" will often be used in that situation, as it would if there were three or more competitors involved.\n\nIn some contexts, such as advertising or political speeches, absolute and relative comparatives are intentionally employed in a way that invites a comparison, and yet the basis of comparison is not established. This is a common rhetorical device used to create an implication of significance where one may not actually be present. Although such usage is common, it is sometimes considered ungrammatical.\n\nFor example:\n\nEnglish has two parallel systems of comparison, a morphological one formed using the suffixes \"-er\" (the \"comparative\") and \"-est\" (the \"superlative\"), with some irregular forms; and a syntactic one, formed with the adverbs \"more\" and \"most\".\n\nAs a general rule, words with one syllable require the suffix (except for the four words: fun, real, right, wrong), words with three or more syllables require \"more\" or \"most\", and words with two syllables may use one system or the other; which words use which system is a matter of idiom. Some adjectives, \"e.g.\" 'polite', can use either form, with different frequencies according to context.\n\nMorphological comparison uses the suffixes \"-er\" (the \"comparative\") and \"-est\" (the \"superlative\"). These inflections are of Germanic origin and are cognate with the Latin suffixes -\"ior\" and -\"issimus\" and Ancient Greek -\"īōn\" and -\"istos\". They are typically added to shorter words, words of Anglo-Saxon origin, and borrowed words which have been fully assimilated into the English vocabulary. Usually the words which take these inflections have fewer than three syllables.\n\nThis system also contains a number of irregular forms, some of which, like \"good\", \"better\", and \"best\", contain suppletive forms. These irregular forms include:\n\nThe second system of comparison in English appends the grammatical particles \"more\" and \"most\", themselves the irregular comparatives of \"many\" and \"much\", to the adjective or adverb being modified. This series can be compared to a system containing the diminutives \"less\" and \"least\".\n\nThis system is most commonly used with words of French or Latin derivation; with adjectives and adverbs formed with suffixes other than \"-ly\" (e.g., \"beautiful\"); and with longer, technical, or infrequently used words. For example:\n\nSome adjectives, the absolute or ungradable adjectives do not appear to logically allow degrees. Some qualities are either \"present\" or \"absent\", such as being Cretaceous or igneous, so it appears illogical to call anything \"very Cretaceous\", or to characterize something as \"more igneous\" than something else.\n\nSome grammarians object to the use of the superlative or comparative with words such as \"full\", \"complete\", \"unique\", or \"empty\", which by definition already denote either a totality, an absence, or an absolute. However, such words are routinely and frequently qualified in contemporary speech and writing. This type of usage conveys more of a figurative than a literal meaning, because in a strictly literal sense, something cannot be more or less unique or empty to a greater or lesser degree.\n\nMany prescriptive grammars and style guides include adjectives for inherently superlative qualities to be ungradable. Thus, they reject expressions such as \"more perfect\", \"most unique\", and \"most parallel\" as illogical pleonasms: after all, if something is unique, it is one of a kind, so nothing can be \"very unique\", or \"more unique\" than something else.\n\nOther style guides argue that terms like \"perfect\" and \"parallel\" never apply \"exactly\" to things in real life, so they are commonly used to mean \"nearly perfect\", \"nearly parallel\", and so on; in this sense, \"more perfect\" (\"i.e.\", more nearly perfect, closer to perfect) and \"more parallel\" (\"i.e.\", more nearly parallel, closer to parallel) are meaningful.\n\nIn most Balto-Slavic languages (such as Czech, Polish, Lithuanian and Latvian), the comparative and superlative forms are also declinable adjectives.\n\nIn Bulgarian, comparative and superlative forms are formed with the clitics \"по-\" (\"more\") and \"най-\" (\"most\"):\n\nIn Czech, Polish, Slovak and Slovene, comparative is formed from the base form of an adjective with a suffix and superlative is formed with a circumfix (equivalent to adding a prefix to the comparative).\n\nIn Russian, comparative and superlative forms are usually formed with a suffix:\n\nIn contrast to English, the relative and the superlative are joined into the same degree (the superlative), which can be of two kinds: comparative (e.g. \"the most beautiful\") and absolute (e.g. \"very beautiful\").\n\nFrench: The superlative is created from the comparative by inserting the definitive article (la, le, or les), or the possessive article (\"mon\", \"ton\", \"son\", etc.), before \"plus\" or \"moins\" and the adjective determining the noun. For instance: \"Elle est la plus belle femme\" → (she is the most beautiful woman); \"Cette ville est la moins chère de France\" → (this town is the least expensive in France); \"C'est sa plus belle robe\" → (It is her most beautiful dress). It can also be created with the suffix \"-issime\" but only with certain words, for example: \"C'est un homme richissime\" → (That is the most rich man). Its use is often rare and ironic.\n\nPortuguese and Italian distinguish comparative superlative \"(superlativo relativo)\" and absolute superlative \"(superlativo absoluto/assoluto).\nFor the comparative superlative they use the words \"mais\" and \"più\" between the article and the adjective, like \"most\" in English.\nFor the absolute superlative they either use \"muito\"/\"molto\" and the adjective or modify the adjective by taking away the final vowel and adding \"issimo\" (singular masculine), \"issima\" (singular feminine), \"íssimos\"/\"issimi\" (plural masculine), or \"íssimas\"/\"issime\" (plural feminine). For example:\nThere are some irregular forms for some words ending in \"-re\" and \"-le\" (deriving from Latin words ending in \"-er\" and \"-ilis\") that have a superlative form similar to the Latin one. In the first case words lose the ending \"-re\" and they gain the endings \"errimo\" (singular masculine), \"errima\" (singular feminine), \"érrimos\"/\"errimi\" (plural masculine), or \"érrimas\"/\"errime\" (plural feminine); in the second case words lose the \"-l\"/\"-le\" ending and gain \"ílimo\"/\"illimo\" (singular masculine), \"ílima\"/\"illima\" (singular feminine), \"ílimos\"/\"illimi\" (plural masculine), or \"íli\nRomanian, similar to Portuguese and Italian, distinguishes comparative and absolute superlatives. The comparative uses the word \"mai\" before the adjective, which operates like \"more\" or \"-er\" in English. For example: \"luminos\" → bright, \"mai luminos\" → brighter. To weaken the adjective, the word \"puțin\" (little) is added between \"mai\" and the adjective, for example \"mai puțin luminos\" → less bright. For absolute superlatives, the gender-dependent determinant \"cel\" precedes \"mai,\" conjugated as \"cel / cei\" for male singular / plural and \"cea / cele\" for female singular / plural. For example: \"cea mai luminoasă stea\" → the brightest star; \"cele mai frumoase fete\" → the most beautiful girls; \"cel mai mic morcov\" → the smallest carrot.\n\nScottish Gaelic: When comparing one entity to another in the present or the future tense, the adjective is changed by adding an \"e\" to the end and \"i\" before the final consonant(s) if the final vowel is broad. Then, the adjective is preceded by \"nas\" to say \"more,\" and \"as\" to say \"most.\" (The word \"na\" is used to mean \"than\".) Adjectives that begin with \"f\" are lenited. and \"as\" use different syntax constructions. For example:\nTha mi nas àirde na mo pheathraichean.\" → I am taller than my sisters.\nIs mi as àirde.\" → I am the tallest.\n\nAs in English, some forms are irregular, i.e. nas fheàrr (better), nas miosa (worse), etc.\n\nIn other tenses, \"nas\" is replaced by \"na bu\" and \"as\" by \"a bu,\" both of which lenite the adjective if possible. If the adjective begins with a vowel or an \"f\" followed by a vowel, the word \"bu\" is reduced to \"b\"'. For example:\n\n\nWelsh is similar to English in many respects. The ending \"-af\" is added onto regular adjectives in a similar manner to the English \"-est\", and with (most) long words \"mwyaf\" precedes it, as in the English \"most\". Also, many of the most common adjectives are irregular. Unlike English, however, when comparing just two things, the superlative \"must\" be used, e.g. of two people - \"John ydy'r talaf\" (John is the tallest).\n\nIn Akkadian cuneiform, (on a 12 paragraph clay tablet), from the time period of the 1350 BC Amarna letters (a roughly 20-year body of letters), two striking examples of the superlative extend the common grammatical use. The first is the numeral \"10,\" as well as \"7 and 7.\" The second is a verb-spacement adjustment.\n\nThe term \"7 and 7\" means 'over and over'. The phrase itself is a superlative, but an addition to some of the Amarna letters adds \"more\" at the end of the phrase (EA 283, \"Oh to see the King-(pharaoh)):\" \"... I fall at the feet of the king, my lord. I fall at the feet of the king, my lord, 7 and 7 times\" more, \"...\". The word 'more' is Akkadian \"mila\", and by Moran is 'more' or 'overflowing'. The meaning in its letter context is \"...over and over again, overflowing,\" (as 'gushingly', or 'obsequiously', as an underling of the king).\n\nThe numeral 10 is used for \"ten times greater\" in EA 19, \"Love and Gold\", one of King Tushratta's eleven letters to the Pharaoh-(Amenhotep IV-\"Akhenaton\"). The following quote using 10, also closes out the small paragraph by the second example of the superlative, where the verb that ends the last sentence is spread across the letter in s-p-a-c-i-n-g, to accentuate the last sentence, and the verb itself (i.e. the relational kingly topic of the paragraph):\n\nThe actual last paragraph line contains three words: 'may it be', 'flourish', and 'us'. The verb flourish (from napāhu?, \"to light up, to rise\"), uses: -e-le-né-ep-pi-, and the spaces. The other two words on the line, are made from two characters, and then one: \"...may it be, flourish-our (relations).\"\n\nIn Estonian, the superlative form can usually be formed in two ways. One is a periphrastic construction with \"kõige\" followed by the comparative form. This form exists for all adjectives. For example: the comparative form of \"sinine\" 'blue' is \"sinisem\" and therefore the periphrastic superlative form is \"kõige sinisem\". There is also a synthetic (\"short\") superlative form, which is formed by adding \"-m\" to the end of the plural partitive case. For \"sinine\" the plural partitive form is \"siniseid\" and so \"siniseim\" is the short superlative. The short superlative does not exist for all adjectives and, in contrast to the \"kõige\"-form, has a lot of exceptions.\n\n"}

It is a lexicographical reference that shows inter-relationships among the data.\n\nA broad distinction is made between general and specialized dictionaries. Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, rather than a complete range of words in the language. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, although there is no consensus whether lexicology and terminology are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries are supposed to be semasiological, mapping word to definition, while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be onomasiological, first identifying concepts and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In practice, the two approaches are used for both types. There are other types of dictionaries that do not fit neatly into the above distinction, for instance bilingual (translation) dictionaries, dictionaries of synonyms (thesauri), and rhyming dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a general purpose monolingual dictionary.\n\nThere is also a contrast between \"prescriptive\" or \"descriptive\" dictionaries; the former reflect what is seen as correct use of the language while the latter reflect recorded actual use. Stylistic indications (e.g. \"informal\" or \"vulgar\") in many modern dictionaries are also considered by some to be less than objectively descriptive.\n\nAlthough the first recorded dictionaries date back to Sumerian times (these were bilingual dictionaries), the systematic study of dictionaries as objects of scientific interest themselves is a 20th-century enterprise, called lexicography, and largely initiated by Ladislav Zgusta. The birth of the new discipline was not without controversy, the practical dictionary-makers being sometimes accused by others of \"astonishing\" lack of method and critical-self reflection.\n\nThe oldest known dictionaries were Akkadian Empire cuneiform tablets with bilingual Sumerian–Akkadian wordlists, discovered in Ebla (modern Syria) and dated roughly 2300 BCE. The early 2nd millennium BCE \"Urra=hubullu\" glossary is the canonical Babylonian version of such bilingual Sumerian wordlists. A Chinese dictionary, the c. 3rd century BCE \"Erya\", was the earliest surviving monolingual dictionary; although some sources cite the c. 800 BCE Shizhoupian as a \"dictionary\", modern scholarship considers it a calligraphic compendium of Chinese characters from Zhou dynasty bronzes. Philitas of Cos (fl. 4th century BCE) wrote a pioneering vocabulary \"Disorderly Words\" (Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι, \"\") which explained the meanings of rare Homeric and other literary words, words from local dialects, and technical terms. Apollonius the Sophist (fl. 1st century CE) wrote the oldest surviving Homeric lexicon. The first Sanskrit dictionary, the Amarakośa, was written by Amara Sinha c. 4th century CE. Written in verse, it listed around 10,000 words. According to the \"Nihon Shoki\", the first Japanese dictionary was the long-lost 682 CE \"Niina\" glossary of Chinese characters. The oldest existing Japanese dictionary, the c. 835 CE \"Tenrei Banshō Meigi\", was also a glossary of written Chinese. In \"Frahang-i Pahlavig\", Aramaic heterograms are listed together with their translation in Middle Persian language and phonetic transcription in Pazand alphabet. A 9th-century CE Irish dictionary, Sanas Cormaic, contained etymologies and explanations of over 1,400 Irish words. In India around 1320, Amir Khusro compiled the Khaliq-e-bari which mainly dealt with Hindustani and Persian words.\nArabic dictionaries were compiled between the 8th and 14th centuries CE, organizing words in rhyme order (by the last syllable), by alphabetical order of the radicals, or according to the alphabetical order of the first letter (the system used in modern European language dictionaries). The modern system was mainly used in specialist dictionaries, such as those of terms from the Qur'an and hadith, while most general use dictionaries, such as the \"Lisan al-`Arab\" (13th century, still the best-known large-scale dictionary of Arabic) and \"al-Qamus al-Muhit\" (14th century) listed words in the alphabetical order of the radicals. The \"Qamus al-Muhit\" is the first handy dictionary in Arabic, which includes only words and their definitions, eliminating the supporting examples used in such dictionaries as the \"Lisan\" and the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\nIn medieval Europe, glossaries with equivalents for Latin words in vernacular or simpler Latin were in use (e.g. the Leiden Glossary). The \"Catholicon\" (1287) by Johannes Balbus, a large grammatical work with an alphabetical lexicon, was widely adopted. It served as the basis for several bilingual dictionaries and was one of the earliest books (in 1460) to be printed. In 1502 Ambrogio Calepino's \"Dictionarium\" was published, originally a monolingual Latin dictionary, which over the course of the 16th century was enlarged to become a multilingual glossary. In 1532 Robert Estienne published the \"Thesaurus linguae latinae\" and in 1572 his son Henri Estienne published the \"Thesaurus linguae graecae\", which served up to the 19th century as the basis of Greek lexicography. The first monolingual dictionary written in Europe was the Spanish, written by Sebastián Covarrubias' \"Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española\", published in 1611 in Madrid, Spain. In 1612 the first edition of the \"Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca\", for Italian, was published. It served as the model for similar works in French and English. In 1690 in Rotterdam was published, posthumously, the \"Dictionnaire Universel\" by Antoine Furetière for French. In 1694 appeared the first edition of the \"Dictionnaire de l'Académie française\". Between 1712 and 1721 was published the \"Vocabulario portughez e latino\" written by Raphael Bluteau. The Real Academia Española published the first edition of the \"Diccionario de la lengua española\" in 1780, but their \"Diccionario de Autoridades\", which included quotes taken from literary works, was published in 1726. The \"Totius Latinitatis lexicon\" by Egidio Forcellini was firstly published in 1777; it has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been published.\n\nThe first edition of \"A Greek-English Lexicon\" by Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott appeared in 1843; this work remained the basic dictionary of Greek until the end of the 20th century. And in 1858 was published the first volume of the Deutsches Wörterbuch by the Brothers Grimm; the work was completed in 1961. Between 1861 and 1874 was published the \"Dizionario della lingua italiana\" by Niccolò Tommaseo. Between 1862 and 1874 was published the six volumes of \"A magyar nyelv szótára\" (Dictionary of Hungarian Language) by Gergely Czuczor and János Fogarasi. Émile Littré published the Dictionnaire de la langue française between 1863 and 1872. In the same year 1863 appeared the first volume of the \"Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal\" which was completed in 1998. Also in 1863 Vladimir Ivanovich Dahl published the \"Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language\". The Duden dictionary dates back to 1880, and is currently the prescriptive source for the spelling of German. The decision to start work on the \"Svenska Akademiens ordbok\" was taken in 1787.\n\nThe earliest dictionaries in the English language were glossaries of French, Spanish or Latin words along with their definitions in English. The word \"dictionary\" was invented by an Englishman called John of Garland in 1220 — he had written a book \"Dictionarius\" to help with Latin \"diction\". An early non-alphabetical list of 8000 English words was the \"Elementarie\", created by Richard Mulcaster in 1582.\n\nThe first purely English alphabetical dictionary was \"A Table Alphabeticall\", written by English schoolteacher Robert Cawdrey in 1604. The only surviving copy is found at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. This dictionary, and the many imitators which followed it, was seen as unreliable and nowhere near definitive. Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield was still lamenting in 1754, 150 years after Cawdrey's publication, that it is \"a sort of disgrace to our nation, that hitherto we have had no… standard of our language; our dictionaries at present being more properly what our neighbors the Dutch and the Germans call theirs, word-books, than dictionaries in the superior sense of that title.\" \n\nIn 1616, John Bullokar described the history of the dictionary with his \"English Expositor\". \"Glossographia\" by Thomas Blount, published in 1656, contains more than 10,000 words along with their etymologies or histories. Edward Phillips wrote another dictionary in 1658, entitled \"The New World of English Words: Or a General Dictionary\" which boldly plagiarized Blount's work, and the two denounced each other. This created more interest in the dictionaries. John Wilkins' 1668 essay on philosophical language contains a list of 11,500 words with careful distinctions, compiled by William Lloyd. Elisha Coles published his \"English Dictionary\" in 1676.\n\nIt was not until Samuel Johnson's \"A Dictionary of the English Language\" (1755) that a more reliable English dictionary was produced. Many people today mistakenly believe that Johnson wrote the first English dictionary: a testimony to this legacy. By this stage, dictionaries had evolved to contain textual references for most words, and were arranged alphabetically, rather than by topic (a previously popular form of arrangement, which meant all animals would be grouped together, etc.). Johnson's masterwork could be judged as the first to bring all these elements together, creating the first \"modern\" dictionary.\n\nJohnson's dictionary remained the English-language standard for over 150 years, until the Oxford University Press began writing and releasing the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in short fascicles from 1884 onwards. It took nearly 50 years to complete this huge work, and they finally released the complete \"OED\" in twelve volumes in 1928. It remains the most comprehensive and trusted English language dictionary to this day, with revisions and updates added by a dedicated team every three months. One of the main contributors to this modern dictionary was an ex-army surgeon, William Chester Minor, a convicted murderer who was confined to an asylum for the criminally insane.\n\nIn 1806, American Noah Webster published his first dictionary, \"\". In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, \"An American Dictionary of the English Language;\" it took twenty-seven years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-six languages, including Old English (Anglo-Saxon), German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Arabic, and Sanskrit.\n\nWebster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, France, and at the University of Cambridge. His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. As a spelling reformer, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced American English spellings, replacing \"colour\" with \"color\", substituting \"wagon\" for \"waggon\", and printing \"center\" instead of \"centre\". He also added American words, like \"skunk\" and \"squash\", that did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of seventy, Webster published his dictionary in 1828; it sold 2500 copies. In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes.\n\nIn a general dictionary, each word may have multiple meanings. Some dictionaries include each separate meaning in the order of most common usage while others list definitions in historical order, with the oldest usage first.\n\nIn many languages, words can appear in many different forms, but only the undeclined or unconjugated form appears as the headword in most dictionaries. Dictionaries are most commonly found in the form of a book, but some newer dictionaries, like StarDict and the \"New Oxford American Dictionary\" are dictionary software running on PDAs or computers. There are also many online dictionaries accessible via the Internet.\n\nAccording to the \"Manual of Specialized Lexicographies\", a specialized dictionary, also referred to as a technical dictionary, is a dictionary that focuses upon a specific subject field. Following the description in \"The Bilingual LSP Dictionary\", lexicographers categorize specialized dictionaries into three types: A multi-field dictionary broadly covers several subject fields (e.g. a business dictionary), a single-field dictionary narrowly covers one particular subject field (e.g. law), and a sub-field dictionary covers a more specialized field (e.g. constitutional law). For example, the 23-language Inter-Active Terminology for Europe is a multi-field dictionary, the American National Biography is a single-field, and the African American National Biography Project is a sub-field dictionary. In terms of the coverage distinction between \"minimizing dictionaries\" and \"maximizing dictionaries\", multi-field dictionaries tend to minimize coverage across subject fields (for instance, \"Oxford Dictionary of World Religions\" and \"Yadgar Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms\") whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to maximize coverage within a limited subject field (\"The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology\").\n\nAnother variant is the glossary, an alphabetical list of defined terms in a specialized field, such as medicine (medical dictionary).\n\nThe simplest dictionary, a defining dictionary, provides a core glossary of the simplest meanings of the simplest concepts. From these, other concepts can be explained and defined, in particular for those who are first learning a language. In English, the commercial defining dictionaries typically include only one or two meanings of under 2000 words. With these, the rest of English, and even the 4000 most common English idioms and metaphors, can be defined.\n\nLexicographers apply two basic philosophies to the defining of words: \"prescriptive\" or \"descriptive\". Noah Webster, intent on forging a distinct identity for the American language, altered spellings and accentuated differences in meaning and pronunciation of some words. This is why American English now uses the spelling \"color\" while the rest of the English-speaking world prefers \"colour\". (Similarly, British English subsequently underwent a few spelling changes that did not affect American English; see further at American and British English spelling differences.)\n\nLarge 20th-century dictionaries such as the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (OED) and \"Webster's Third\" are descriptive, and attempt to describe the actual use of words. Most dictionaries of English now apply the descriptive method to a word's definition, and then, outside of the definition itself, and information alerting readers to attitudes which may influence their choices on words often considered vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or easily confused. \"Merriam-Webster\" is subtle, only adding italicized notations such as, \"sometimes offensive\" or \"stand\" (nonstandard). \"American Heritage\" goes further, discussing issues separately in numerous \"usage notes.\" \"Encarta\" provides similar notes, but is more prescriptive, offering warnings and admonitions against the use of certain words considered by many to be offensive or illiterate, such as, \"an offensive term for...\" or \"a taboo term meaning...\".\n\nBecause of the widespread use of dictionaries in schools, and their acceptance by many as language authorities, their treatment of the language does affect usage to some degree, with even the most descriptive dictionaries providing conservative continuity. In the long run, however, the meanings of words in English are primarily determined by usage, and the language is being changed and created every day. As Jorge Luis Borges says in the prologue to \"El otro, el mismo\": \"It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial repositories, put together well after the languages they define. The roots of language are irrational and of a magical nature.\"\n\nSometimes the same dictionary can be descriptive in some domains and prescriptive in others. For example, according to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, the \"Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary\" is \"at war with itself\": whereas its coverage (lexical items) and glosses (definitions) are descriptive and colloquial, its vocalization is prescriptive. This internal conflict results in absurd sentences such as \"hi taharóg otí kshetiré me asíti lamkhonít\" (she'll tear me apart when she sees what I've done to the car). Whereas \"hi taharóg otí\", literally 'she will kill me', is colloquial, me (a variant of ma 'what') is archaic, resulting in a combination that is unutterable in real life.\n\nA historical dictionary is a specific kind of descriptive dictionary which describes the development of words and senses over time, usually using citations to original source material to support its conclusions.\n\nIn contrast to traditional dictionaries, which are designed to be used by human beings, dictionaries for natural language processing (NLP) are built to be used by computer programs. The final user is a human being but the direct user is a program. Such a dictionary does not need to be able to be printed on paper. The structure of the content is not linear, ordered entry by entry but has the form of a complex network (see Diathesis alternation). Because most of these dictionaries are used to control machine translations or cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) the content is usually multilingual and usually of huge size. In order to allow formalized exchange and merging of dictionaries, an ISO standard called Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) has been defined and used among the industrial and academic community.\n\n\nIn many languages, such as the English language, the pronunciation of some words is not consistently apparent from their spelling. In these languages, dictionaries usually provide the pronunciation. For example, the definition for the word \"dictionary\" might be followed by the International Phonetic Alphabet spelling . American English dictionaries often use their ownpronunciation respelling systems with diacritics, for example \"dictionary\" is respelled as \"dĭk′shə-nĕr′ē\" in the American Heritage Dictionary. The IPA is more commonly used within the British Commonwealth countries. Yet others use their own pronunciation respelling systems without diacritics: for example, \"dictionary\" may be respelled as . Some online or electronic dictionaries provide audio recordings of words being spoken.\n\nHistories and descriptions of the dictionaries of other languages on Wikipedia include:\n\n\nThe age of the Internet brought online dictionaries to the desktop and, more recently, to the smart phone. David Skinner in 2013 noted that \"Among the top ten lookups on Merriam-Webster Online at this moment are 'holistic, pragmatic, caveat, esoteric' and 'bourgeois.'

{"id": "8366559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8366559", "title": "Difference theory", "text": "Difference theory\n\nDifference theory has roots in the studies of John Gumperz, who examined differences in cross-cultural communication. While difference theory deals with cross-gender communication, the male and female genders are often presented as being two separate cultures, hence the relevance of Gumperz's studies. In her development of the difference theory, Deborah Tannen drew on the work of Daniel Maltz and Ruth Borker, in particular their 1982 paper, \"A Cultural Approach to Male-Female Miscommunication\", which itself drew on the work of Gumperz. Mary Talbot makes reference to the term \"gender-specific culture\" in her critique of the difference theory, and this idea of genders being culturally separated is embodied by the 1992 publication \"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus\". Difference theory is often compared with dominance theory and deficit theory, and together with the more contemporary dynamic theory they make up four of the theories most widely referred to and compared in the study of language and gender.\n\nThe reason for the popularity of Tannen's book \"You Just Don't Understand\", and the resultant popularisation of difference theory, is generally attributed to the style of Tannen's work, in which she adopts a neutral position on differences in genderlect by making no value-judgements about use of language by either gender. Talbot comments that this means the book provides explanations for domestic disputes without \"pointing the finger\" at anyone.\n\nDifference theory as postulated by Tannen is generally summarised into six categories, each of which pairs contrasting uses of language by males and females.\n\nTannen states that, for men, the world is a competitive place in which conversation and speech are used to build status, whereas for women the world is a network of connections, and that they use language to seek and offer support. In demonstrating this, Tannen uses the example of her husband and herself, who at one point had jobs in different cities. She remarks that whenever someone commented on this, she interpreted it as being an offer of sympathy or support. Her husband, on the other hand, took such comments as being criticisms and attempts to put him down. Tannen remarks that this displays the different approaches that women and men take in terms of status and support. Furthermore, men are also more likely to interrupt to get their point across and hence gain status.\n\nWomen seek comfort and sympathy for their problems, whilst men will seek a solution to the problem.\n\nTannen states that men's conversation is message-oriented, i.e. based upon communicating information. For women, conversation is much more important for building relationships and strengthening social links.\n\nMen will use direct imperatives (\"close the door\", \"switch on the light\") when speaking to others. Women encourage the use of superpolite forms, however (\"let's\", \"would you mind if ...?\").\n\nTannen asserts that most women avoid conflict in language at all costs, and instead attempt to resolve disagreements without any direct confrontation, to maintain positive connection and rapport. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to use confrontation as a way of resolving differences and thereby negotiating status. Tannen supports this view by making reference to the work of Walter J. Ong, whose 1981 publication, \"Fighting for Life\", asserts that \"expressed adversativeness\" is more an element of male culture than female culture. Tannen stresses that both forms of communication are valid ways of creating involvement and forming bonds.\n\nDifference theory asserts that in general men favour independence, while women are more likely to seek intimacy. Tannen demonstrates this with the example of a husband making a decision without consulting his wife. She theorises that he does so because he doesn't want to feel a loss of independence that would come from saying, \"Let me consult this with my wife first.\" Women, by contrast, like to demonstrate that they have to consult with their partner, as this is seen to be proof of the intimacy of the relationship. Tannen asserts that women, seeing the world as a network of connections and relationships, view intimacy as key to achieving consensus and avoiding the appearance of superiority, whereas men, who are more likely to view the world in terms of status, see independence as being key to establishing their status. Tannen also clarifies that while both men and women seek independence and intimacy, men tend to be focused on the former, while women tend to focus on the latter.\n\nGeneral criticisms are that Tannen's observations are largely anecdotal and cannot be said for all conjugal conversations, let alone mixed-gender interactions as a whole.\n\n\n"}

The \"law\" is a statement regarding the difficulty of accurately estimating the time it will take to complete tasks of substantial complexity. It is often cited by programmers, especially in discussions of techniques to improve productivity, such as \"The Mythical Man-Month\" or extreme programming. The recursive nature of the law is a reflection of the widely experienced difficulty of estimating complex tasks despite all best efforts, including knowing that the task is complex.\n\nThe law was initially introduced in connection with a discussion of chess-playing computers, where top-level players were continually beating machines, even though the machines outweighed the players in recursive analysis. The intuition was that the players were able to focus on particular positions instead of following every possible line of play to its conclusion. Hofstadter wrote in 1979, \"In the early days of computer chess, people used to estimate that it would be ten years until a computer (or program) was world champion. But after ten years had passed, it seemed that the day a computer would become world champion was still more than ten years away ... This is just one more piece of evidence for the rather recursive Hofstadter's Law:\" Notably, that day did indeed come, when Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997, which indicates that the Law of Accelerating Returns may take effect when the task is repeated, thus counteracting -- and [in some cases] overpowering -- Hofstadter's law.\n\n"}

It is used to refer to one's self and is capitalized, although other pronouns, such as \"he\" or \"she\", are not capitalized.\n\nThe grammatical variants of \"I\" are \"me\", \"my\", \"mine\", and \"myself\".\n\nEnglish \"I\" originates from Old English (OE) \"ic\". Its predecessor \"ic\" had in turn originated from the continuation of Proto-Germanic *\"ik\", and \"ek\"; the asterisk denotes an unattested form, \"ek\" was attested in the Elder Futhark inscriptions (in some cases notably showing the variant \"eka\"; see also ek erilaz). Linguists assume \"ik\" to have developed from the unstressed variant of \"ek\". Variants of \"ic\" were used in various English dialects up until the 1600s.\n\nGermanic cognates are: Old Frisian \"ik\", Old Norse \"ek\" (Danish, Norwegian \"jeg\", Swedish \"jag\", Icelandic ég), Old High German \"ih\" (German \"ich\") and Gothic \"ik\" and in Dutch also \"ik\".\n\nThe Proto-Germanic root came, in turn, from the Proto Indo-European language (PIE). The reconstructed PIE pronoun is *\"egō, egóm\", with cognates including\nSanskrit \"aham\", Hittite \"uk\", Latin \"ego\", Greek \"egō\", Old Slavonic \"azъ\" and Alviri-Vidari (an Iranian language) \"az\".\n\nThe oblique forms are formed from a stem \"*me-\" (English \"me\"), the plural from \"*wei-\" (English \"we\"), the oblique plurals from \"*ns-\" (English \"us\") and from Proto-Germanic \"*unseraz\", PIE \"*no-s-ero-\" (\"our, ours\").\n\n\"I\" (and only this form of the pronoun) is the only pronoun that is always capitalized in English. This practice became established in the late 15th century, though lowercase \"i\" was sometimes found as late as the 17th century.\n\nLike the other English personal pronouns \"we\" (\"us\"), \"he\" (\"him\"), \"she\" (\"her\"), and \"they\" (\"them\"), the pronoun \"I\" has several singular case forms.\nThese are: \n\nThere are some situations in which only the nominative form (\"I\") is grammatically correct and others in which only the accusative form (\"me\") is correct.

The accusative \"me\" is also required in a number of constructions such as \"Silly me!\"\n\nIn many situations, both the nominative \"I\" and the accusative \"me\" are encountered.\n\nWhen the pronoun is used as a subjective predicative complement, the nominative \"I\" is sometimes encountered in (very) formal style:\nBut this is often seen as hypercorrect and may be unacceptable, as in:\n\"Me\" is usually preferred as a subjective predicate, especially in informal style:\nThe nominative \"I\" is more common in this role when it is followed by a relative clause:\nthough even here \"me\" is more common in non-formal style:\n\nFollowing \"as\" or \"than\" (without a following explicit verb), the accusative form is common:\nHowever, where it is possible to think of the pronoun as the subject of an implicit verb and \"than\" or \"as\" as a conjunction, the nominative \"I\" is found in formal style:\n\nIn Australian English, British English and Irish English, many speakers have an unstressed form of \"my\" that is identical to \"me\" (see archaic and non-standard forms of English personal pronouns).\n\nThe above applies when the pronoun stands alone as the subject or object.\nIn some varieties English (particularly formal English), those rules also apply in coordinative constructions such as \"you and I\".

{"id": "1930406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930406", "title": "Impredicativity", "text": "Impredicativity\n\nSomething that is impredicative, in mathematics, logic and philosophy of mathematics, is a self-referencing definition. Roughly speaking, a definition is impredicative if it invokes (mentions or quantifies over) the set being defined, or (more commonly) another set that contains the thing being defined. There is no generally accepted precise definition of what it means to be predicative or impredicative. Authors have given different but related definitions.\n\nThe opposite of impredicativity is predicativity, which essentially entails building stratified (or ramified) theories where quantification over lower levels results in variables of some new type, distinguished from the lower types that the variable ranges over. A prototypical example is intuitionistic type theory, which retains ramification so as to discard impredicativity.\n\nRussell's paradox is a famous example of an impredicative construction—namely the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. The paradox is that such a set cannot exist: If it would exist, the question could be asked whether it contains itself or not — if it does then by definition it should not, and if it does not then by definition it should.\n\nThe greatest lower bound of a set , , also has an impredicative definition: if and only if for all elements of , is less than or equal to , and any less than or equal to all elements of is less than or equal to . This definition quantifies over the set (potentially infinite, depending on the order in question) whose members are the lower bounds of , one of which being the glb itself. Hence predicativism would reject this definition.\n\nThe terms \"predicative\" and \"impredicative\" were introduced by , though the meaning has changed a little since then. \n\nSolomon Feferman provides a historical review of predicativity, connecting it to current outstanding research problems.\n\nThe vicious circle principle was suggested by Henri Poincaré (1905-6, 1908) and Bertrand Russell in the wake of the paradoxes as a requirement on legitimate set specifications. Sets that do not meet the requirement are called \"impredicative\".\n\nThe first modern paradox appeared with Cesare Burali-Forti's 1897 \"A question on transfinite numbers\" and would become known as the Burali-Forti paradox. Cantor had apparently discovered the same paradox in his (Cantor's) \"naive\" set theory and this become known as Cantor's paradox. Russell's awareness of the problem originated in June 1901 with his reading of Frege's treatise of mathematical logic, his 1879 \"Begriffsschrift\"; the offending sentence in Frege is the following:\nIn other words, given the function is the variable and is the invariant part. So why not substitute the value for itself? Russell promptly wrote Frege a letter pointing out that:\nFrege promptly wrote back to Russell acknowledging the problem:\nWhile the problem had adverse personal consequences for both men (both had works at the printers that had to be emended), van Heijenoort observes that \"The paradox shook the logicians' world, and the rumbles are still felt today. ... Russell's paradox, which uses the bare notions of set and element, falls squarely in the field of logic. The paradox was first published by Russell in \"The principles of mathematics\" (1903) and is discussed there in great detail ...\". Russell, after six years of false starts, would eventually answer the matter with his 1908 theory of types by \"propounding his \"axiom of reducibility\". It says that any function is coextensive with what he calls a \"predicative\" function: a function in which the types of apparent variables run no higher than the types of the arguments\". But this \"axiom\" was met with resistance from all quarters.\n\nThe rejection of impredicatively defined mathematical objects (while accepting the natural numbers as classically understood) leads to the position in the philosophy of mathematics known as predicativism, advocated by Henri Poincaré and Hermann Weyl in his \"Das Kontinuum\". Poincaré and Weyl argued that impredicative definitions are problematic only when one or more underlying sets are infinite.\n\nErnst Zermelo in his 1908 \"A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering\" presents an entire section \"b. \"Objection concerning nonpredicative definition\"\" where he argued against \"Poincaré (1906, p. 307) [who states that] a definition is 'predicative' and logically admissible only if it \"excludes\" all objects that are dependent upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it\". He gives two examples of impredicative definitions – (i) the notion of Dedekind chains and (ii) \"in analysis wherever the maximum or minimum of a previously defined \"completed\" set of numbers is used for further inferences. This happens, for example, in the well-known Cauchy proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, and up to now it has not occurred to anyone to regard this as something illogical\". He ends his section with the following observation: \"A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed, in every definition \"definiens\" and \"definiendum\" are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible\".\n\nZermelo's example of minimum and maximum of a previously defined \"completed\" set of numbers reappears in Kleene 1952:42-42 where Kleene uses the example of Least upper bound in his discussion of impredicative definitions; Kleene does not resolve this problem. In the next paragraphs he discusses Weyl's attempt in his 1918 \"Das Kontinuum\" (\"The Continuum\") to eliminate impredicative definitions and his failure to retain the \"theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (cf. also Weyl 1919)\".\n\nRamsey argued that \"impredicative\" definitions can be harmless: for instance, the definition of \"tallest person in the room\" is impredicative, since it depends on a set of things of which it is an element, namely the set of all persons in the room. Concerning mathematics, an example of an impredicative definition is the smallest number in a set, which is formally defined as: if and only if for all elements of , is less than or equal to , and is in .\n\nBurgess (2005) discusses predicative and impredicative theories at some length, in the context of Frege's logic, Peano arithmetic, second order arithmetic, and axiomatic set theory.\n\n\n"}

Any function passed as an argument to f is invoked with itself as an argument, and thus in any use of that argument is indirectly referring to itself.\n\nThis example is similar to the Scheme expression \"((lambda(x)(x x)) (lambda(x)(x x)))\", which is expanded to itself by beta reduction, and so its evaluation loops indefinitely despite the lack of explicit looping constructs. An equivalent example can be formulated in lambda calculus.\n\nIndirect self-reference is special in that its self-referential quality is not explicit, as it is in the sentence \"this sentence is false.\" The phrase \"this sentence\" refers directly to the sentence as a whole. An indirectly self-referential sentence would replace the phrase \"this sentence\" with an expression that effectively still referred to the sentence, but did not use the pronoun \"this.\"\n\nAn example will help to explain this. Suppose we define the quine of a phrase to be the quotation of the phrase followed by the phrase itself. So, the quine of:\nwould be:\nwhich, incidentally, is a true statement.\n\nNow consider the sentence:\n\nThe quotation here, plus the phrase \"when quined,\" indirectly refers to the entire sentence. The importance of this fact is that the remainder of the sentence, the phrase \"makes quite a statement,\" can now make a statement about the sentence as a whole. If we had used a pronoun for this, we could have written something like \"this sentence makes quite a statement.\"\n\nIt seems silly to go through this trouble when pronouns will suffice (and when they make more sense to the casual reader), but in systems of mathematical logic, there is generally no analog of the pronoun. It is somewhat surprising, in fact, that self-reference can be achieved at all in these systems.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it can be seen that in fact, the Scheme example above uses a quine, and f(x) is actually the quine function itself.\n\nIndirect self-reference was studied in great depth by W. V. Quine (after whom the operation above is named), and occupies a central place in the proof of Gödel's incompleteness theorem. Among the paradoxical statements developed by Quine is the following:\n\n"}

{"id": "5629066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5629066", "title": "Nomina sacra", "text": "Nomina sacra\n\nIn Christian scribal practice, nomina sacra (singular: nomen sacrum from Latin sacred name) is the abbreviation of several frequently occurring divine names or titles, especially in Greek manuscripts of Holy Scripture. A nomen sacrum consists of two or more letters from the original word spanned by an overline.\n\nMetzger lists 15 such expressions from Greek papyri: the Greek counterparts of \"God\", \"Lord\", \"Jesus\", \"Christ\", \"Son\", \"Spirit\", \"David\", \"Cross\", \"Mother\", \"Father\", \"Israel\", \"Savior\", \"Man\", \"Jerusalem\", and \"Heaven\". These \"nomina sacra\" are all found in Greek manuscripts of the 3rd century and earlier, except \"Mother\", which appears in the 4th.\n\n\"Nomina sacra\" also occur in some form in Latin, Coptic, Armenian (indicated by the \"pativ\"), Gothic, Old Nubian, and Cyrillic (indicated by the \"titlo\").\n\n\"Nomina sacra\" are consistently observed in even the earliest extant Christian writings, along with the codex form rather than the roll, implying that when these were written, in approximately the second century, the practice had already been established for some time. However, it is not known precisely when and how the \"nomina sacra\" first arose.\n\nThe initial system of \"nomina sacra\" apparently consisted of just four or five words, called \"nomina divina\": the Greek words for \"Jesus\", \"Christ\", \"Lord\", \"God\", and possibly \"Spirit\". The practice quickly expanded to a number of other words regarded as sacred.\n\nIn the system of \"nomina sacra\" that came to prevail, abbreviation is by \"contraction\", meaning that the first and last letter (at least) of each word are used. In a few early cases, an alternate practice is seen of abbreviation by \"suspension\", meaning that the initial two letters (at least) of the word are used; e.g., the opening verses of Revelation in write (\"Jesus Christ\") as . Contraction, however, offered the practical advantage of indicating the case of the abbreviated noun.\n\nIt is evident that the use of \"nomina sacra\" was an act of reverence rather than a purely practical space-saving device, as they were employed even where well-established abbreviations of far more frequent words such as \"and\" were avoided, and the \"nomen sacrum\" itself was written with generous spacing. Furthermore, early scribes often distinguished between mundane and sacred occurrences of the same word, e.g. a \"spirit\" vs. the \"Spirit\", and applied \"nomina sacra\" only to the latter (at times necessarily revealing an exegetical choice), although later scribes would mechanically abbreviate all occurrences.\n\nScholars have advanced a number of theories on the origin of the \"nomina sacra\". An obvious parallel that likely offered some inspiration is the Jewish practice of writing the divine name of God, commonly rendered as Jehovah or Yahweh in English, as the Hebrew tetragrammaton (transliterated as YHWH) even in Greek Scriptures. The Septuagint manuscript LXX P.Oxy.VII.1007 uses two Paleo-Hebrew \"yodh's\" with a horizontal line through them for YHWH (an abbreviated form of the Name of God translitered as ). Pavlos Vasileiadis, a Doctor of Theology at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, quoting Gerard Gertoux, states that \"the subsequent use of the contracted forms of the original nomina sacra κ[ύριο]ς [()] and θ[εό]ς [()] within Christian manuscripts probably reflects the Jewish practice of replacing the Tetragrammaton by י[הו]ה.\", transliterated in koine Greek as ιά.\n\nGreek culture also employed a number of ways of abbreviating even proper names, though none in quite the same form as the \"nomina sacra\". Inspiration for the contracted forms (using the first and last letter) has also been seen in Revelation, where Jesus speaks of himself as \"the beginning and the end\" and \"the first and the last\" as well \"the Alpha and the Omega\". Greek numerals have been suggested as the origin of the overline spanning the whole \"nomen sacrum\", with the suspended form being simply the ordinary way of writing \"eighteen\", for example.\n\n"}
{"id": "1091767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1091767", "title": "Non-well-founded set theory", "text": "Non-well-founded set theory\n\nNon-well-founded set theories are variants of axiomatic set theory that allow sets to contain themselves and otherwise violate the rule of well-foundedness. In non-well-founded set theories, the foundation axiom of ZFC is replaced by axioms implying its negation.\n\nThe study of non-well-founded sets was initiated by Dmitry Mirimanoff in a series of papers between 1917 and 1920, in which he formulated the distinction between well-founded and non-well-founded sets; he did not regard well-foundedness as an axiom. Although a number of axiomatic systems of non-well-founded sets were proposed afterwards, they did not find much in the way of applications until Peter Aczel’s hyperset theory in 1988.\n\nThe theory of non-well-founded sets has been applied in the logical modelling of non-terminating computational processes in computer science (process algebra and final semantics), linguistics and natural language semantics (situation theory), philosophy (work on the Liar Paradox), and in a different setting, non-standard analysis.\n\nIn 1917, Dmitry Mirimanoff introduced the concept of well-foundedness of a set:\n\nIn ZFC, there is no infinite descending ∈-sequence by the axiom of regularity. In fact, the axiom of regularity is often called the \"foundation axiom\" since it can be proved within ZFC (that is, ZFC without the axiom of regularity) that well-foundedness implies regularity. In variants of ZFC without the axiom of regularity, the possibility of non-well-founded sets with set-like ∈-chains arises. For example, a set \"A\" such that \"A\" ∈ \"A\" is non-well-founded.\n\nAlthough Mirimanoff also introduced a notion of isomorphism between possibly non-well-founded sets, he considered neither an axiom of foundation nor of anti-foundation. In 1926, Paul Finsler introduced the first axiom that allowed non-well-founded sets. After Zermelo adopted Foundation into his own system in 1930 (from previous work of von Neumann 1925–1929) interest in non-well-founded sets waned for decades. An early non-well-founded set theory was Willard Van Orman Quine’s New Foundations, although it is not merely ZF with a replacement for Foundation.\n\nSeveral proofs of the independence of Foundation from the rest of ZF were published in 1950s particularly by Paul Bernays (1954), following an announcement of the result in earlier paper of his from 1941, and by Ernst Specker who gave a different proof in his Habilitationsschrift of 1951, proof which was published in 1957. Then in 1957 Rieger's theorem was published, which gave a general method for such proof to be carried out, rekindling some interest in non-well-founded axiomatic systems. The next axiom proposal came in a 1960 congress talk of Dana Scott (never published as a paper), proposing an alternative axiom now called SAFA. Another axiom proposed in the late 1960s was Maurice Boffa's axiom of superuniversality, described by Aczel as the highpoint of research of its decade. Boffa's idea was to make foundation fail as badly as it can (or rather, as extensionality permits): Boffa's axiom implies that every extensional set-like relation is isomorphic to the elementhood predicate on a transitive class.\n\nA more recent approach to non-well-founded set theory, pioneered by M. Forti and F. Honsell in the 1980s, borrows from computer science the concept of a bisimulation. Bisimilar sets are considered indistinguishable and thus equal, which leads to a strengthening of the axiom of extensionality. In this context, axioms contradicting the axiom of regularity are known as anti-foundation axioms, and a set that is not necessarily well-founded is called a hyperset.\n\nFour mutually independent anti-foundation axioms are well-known, sometimes abbreviated by the first letter in the following list:\nThey essentially correspond to four different notions of equality for non-well-founded sets. The first of these, AFA, is based on accessible pointed graphs (apg) and states that two hypersets are equal if and only if they can be pictured by the same apg. Within this framework, it can be shown that the so-called Quine atom, formally defined by Q={Q}, exists and is unique.\n\nEach of the axioms given above extends the universe of the previous, so that: V ⊆ A ⊆ S ⊆ F ⊆ B. In the Boffa universe, the distinct Quine atoms form a proper class.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that hyperset theory is an extension of classical set theory rather than a replacement: the well-founded sets within a hyperset domain conform to classical set theory.\n\nAczel’s hypersets were extensively used by Jon Barwise and John Etchemendy in their 1987 book \"The Liar\", on the liar's paradox; The book is also good introduction to the topic of non-well-founded sets.\n\nBoffa’s superuniversality axiom has found application as a basis for axiomatic nonstandard analysis.\n\n\n\n"}

The note can provide an author's comments on the main text or citations of a reference work in support of the text, or both.\n\nFootnotes are notes at the foot of the page while endnotes are collected under a separate heading at the end of a chapter, volume, or entire work. Unlike footnotes, endnotes have the advantage of not affecting the layout of the main text, but may cause inconvenience to readers who have to move back and forth between the main text and the endnotes.\n\nIn some editions of the Bible, notes are placed in a narrow column in the middle of each page between two columns of biblical text.\n\nIn English, a footnote is normally flagged by a superscripted number immediately following that portion of the text the note references, each such footnote being numbered sequentially. Occasionally a number between brackets or parentheses is used instead, thus: [1], which can also be superscripted, as in Wikipedia's own citation style rendered within this very page.\n\nTypographical devices such as the asterisk (*) or dagger (†) may also be used to point to footnotes; the traditional order of these symbols in English is *, †, ‡, §, ‖, ¶. Other symbols, including the #, Δ, ◊, ↓, and ☞, have also been used. In documents like timetables, many different symbols, letters and numbers may be used to refer the reader to particular notes.\n\nNotes are most often used as an alternative to long explanatory notes that can be distracting to readers. Most literary style guidelines (including the Modern Language Association and the American Psychological Association) recommend limited use of foot and endnotes. However, publishers often encourage note references in lieu of parenthetical references. Aside from use as a bibliographic element, notes are used for additional information or explanatory notes that might be too digressive for the main text. Footnotes are heavily utilized in academic institutions to support claims made in academic essays covering myriads of topics.\n\nIn particular, footnotes are the normal form of citation in historical journals. This is due, firstly, to the fact that the most important references are often to archive sources or interviews which do not readily fit standard formats, and secondly, to the fact that historians expect to see the exact nature of the evidence which is being used at each stage.\n\nThe MLA (Modern Language Association) requires the superscript numbers in the main text to be placed following the punctuation in the phrase or clause the note is in reference to. The exception to this rule occurs when a sentence contains a dash, in which case the superscript would precede it.\n\nAside from their technical use, authors use notes for a variety of reasons:\n\nThe US Government Printing Office Style Manual devotes over 660 words to the topic of footnotes. NASA has guidance for footnote usage in its historical documents.\nAssociate Justice Stephen Breyer of the Supreme Court of the United States is famous in the American legal community for his writing style, in which he never uses notes. He prefers to keep all citations within the text (which is permitted in American legal citation). Richard A. Posner has also written against the use of notes in judicial opinions. Bryan A. Garner, however, advocates using notes instead of inline citations.\n\nHTML, the predominant markup language for web pages, has no mechanism for marking up notes. Despite a number of different proposals over the years, and repeated pleas from the user base, the working group has been unable to reach a consensus on it. Because of this, MediaWiki, for example, has had to introduce its own codice_1 tag for citing references in notes, an idea which has since also been implemented for generic use by the \"Nelson\" HTML preprocessor.\n\nIt might be argued that the hyperlink partially eliminates the need for notes, being the web's way to refer to another document. However, it does not allow citing to offline sources and if the destination of the link changes, the link can become dead or irrelevant.\n\nThe sign is historically equal to the asterisks used by Aristarchus of Samothrace at the Mouseion at Alexandria. It was used for the critical editions of Homer's writings where it \"marked a verse incorrectly repeated in another passage\" and was used together with other signs such as the obelus.\n\nThe London printer Richard Jugge is generally credited as the inventor of the footnote, first used in the Bishops' Bible of 1568.\n\nEarly printings of the Douay Bible used two closely spaced colons (actually squared four dot punctuation mark U+2E2C) to indicate a marginal note.\n\nAt times, notes have been used for their comical effect, or as a literary device.\n\n\n\n"}

They covered a variety of topics including hobbies, art, history and wildlife. The aim of these books was to interest the observer and they have also been popular amongst children. Some of them have become collector's items. For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now rare. The values of the books can vary from 50 pence to hundreds of pounds. \n\nThe books were produced with paper dust covers up until 1969. Each one had a unique pattern of squiggly lines at the top but these were not especially practical because they were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. These types are often referred to as \"Glossies\". From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books to make them sturdier and more resistant to wear.\n\nThe first Observer's guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British birds. This is now rare, and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second Observer's book on British wild flowers. A mint copy of this book is worth around £220. When the popularity of these was recognized, several more titles were added 'uniform in the series', but during World War II production was limited due to paper and labour shortages. Even so, by 1941 Warne had published the first six Observer's books.\n\nIn 1942 a special edition book was brought out on \"airplanes\" . This book had no number in the series, as it was brought out to help people spot enemy warplanes. It was reprinted in 1943 and 1945. \n\nThe first few Observer's titles had focused on nature, but gradually subjects like geology, music and architecture were introduced. 'Spotter' titles like \"Aircraft\", \"Automobiles\" and \"Railway Locomotives\" proved popular. During the 1950s and 60s collecting sets of these books was popular among children and adults alike. \n\nWhen Warne was acquired by Penguin books in 1983, Warne brought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the original books, and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year Penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up-to-date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals, but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, the dust covers were laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the Penguin Observer's books: Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions).\n\nAfter a hiatus of 17 years, Peregrine Books published the appropriately titled \"Observer's Book of Observer's Books\" in 1999, in a format that matched the original editions and was numbered 99 so as to follow on from the last 'official' title. As the title implies, it is a guide to the series with details of its history, authors, and print-runs. As a sign of the series' popularity, this potentially obscure book has been reprinted no fewer than six times. More recently the series has been rounded up to 100 with the publication of \"Wayside and Woodland\" in 2003.\n"}

Using a structured reference interview, the librarian works with the library user to clarify their needs and determine what information sources will fill them. To borrow a medical analogy, reference librarians diagnose and treat information deficiencies.\n\nThe ultimate help provided may consist of reading material in the form of a book or journal article, instruction in the use of specific searchable information resources such as the library's online catalog or subscription bibliographic/fulltext databases, or simply factual information drawn from the library's print or online reference collection. Information is also provided to patrons through electronic resources. Typically, a reference desk can be consulted either in person, by telephone, through email or online chat, although a library user may be asked to come to the library in person for help with more involved research questions. A staffed and knowledgeable reference desk is an essential part of a library.\n\nThe services that are provided at a reference desk may vary depending on the type of library, its purpose, its resources, and its staff.\n\nReference services did not become commonplace in libraries until the late 1800s. These services initially began in public libraries. At first librarians were hesitant to offer reference services because many libraries did not have a large enough staff to provide the services without other duties being neglected. Beginning in 1883 with the Boston Public Library, libraries began to hire librarians whose primary duty was to provide reference services.\n\nOne of the earliest proponents of references services was Samuel Swett Green. He wrote an article titled \"Personal Relations Between Librarians and Readers\" which had a large impact on the future of reference services.\nthen, it operated to incorporate ... making the following variables relevant in offering reference services: the user's query; the reference librarian; and, the reference sources. Until hitherto the communication between the reference librarian and the user are through direct contact. Hence, Utor (2008), defined reference services as a direct personal assistance to readers seeking information. That is during the traditional era. towards the later decades of 19th century, however, reference and information services witnessed an insidious yet drastic paradigm-shift following the incorporation of information communication technology in reference services (and in library operations, by extension). Thus leading to an entirely new era, otherwise known as digital era with different information technologies coming in to aid the work of a reference librarian; changing information sources, reference processes and communication medium.\n\nResources that are often kept at a library reference desk may include:\n\nServices that are often available at a library reference desk include:\n\nThe librarian who staffs the reference desk can usually do the following by virtue of their professional training and experience:\n\nIn the United States, those who staff library reference desks are usually required to have a master's degree in library science from a program accredited by the American Library Association. However, if there is a lack of qualified applicants, particularly in rural areas, a person with an associate degree, a certificate in library technology, or a bachelor's degree in library science may perform these duties. In many academic libraries, student assistants are used as the primary contact, sometimes at an \"information desk.\"\n\nIn Sri Lanka, librarians at reference desks typically have master's degrees from the Sri Lankan Library Association's accredited programs.\n\nWith the development of the Web, digital reference services are beginning to take over some of the roles of the traditional reference desk in a library. There is disagreement over whether or not this development is desirable or inevitable.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5550409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5550409", "title": "Reference interview", "text": "Reference interview\n\nA reference interview is a conversation between a librarian and a library user, usually at a reference desk, in which the librarian responds to the user's initial explanation of his or her information need by first attempting to clarify that need and then by directing the user to appropriate information resources.\n\nBopp & Smith (1995) defines the reference interview as the \"conversation between a member of the library reference staff and a library user for the purpose of clarifying the user’s needs and aiding the user in meeting those needs\". \n\nAccording to ODLIS, the reference interview is \"the interpersonal communication that occurs between a reference librarian and a library user to determine the person's specific information need(s), which may turn out to be different from the reference question as initially posed...A reference interview may occur in person, by telephone, or electronically (usually via e-mail) at the request of the user, but a well-trained reference librarian will sometimes initiate communication if a hesitant user appears to need assistance\".\n\nThe reference interview is structured to help the librarian provide answers to the library user. In general, the interview is composed of the following stages.\n\n\nThese stages may occur in loops, for example when a clarification of the question leads to the need to establish more background information on the query topic. These steps are designed to put the user at their ease, and then help ensure that they have correctly explained what they require. When the reference librarian believes that the query is fully understood, they attempt to provide resources that help satisfy it. An important and often overlooked final step is checking that the information or service provided was indeed what the library user required.\n\nThe purpose behind the reference interview structure is to ensure that the library user's information need is satisfied. The librarian can use a number of interview techniques to help identify the user's exact need. Poor reference interview skills may lead to misinterpretation of the real question, a lack of real help and an unsatisfied library user.\n\nLibrarians use many techniques to help identify a user’s information need. With body language, repetition and paraphrasing of what the user says, the interviewer can encourage the user to give more information about what they need. Asking open questions establishes context and helps to identify exactly what is required. A lack of follow-up, or checking that the user found what they required, is arguably one of the most common mistakes made in the reference interview.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with providing an effective reference service is that of badly formed queries. In this instance, the user's reference question doesn't match up to the information they actually need. Badly formed queries may lead to user frustration, as they perceive that the reference interview is not solving their problem. \n\nMany of the techniques used in the reference interview are geared towards developing a badly formed query until a sense of the user's true information need is gained. A great degree of care must be taken when helping users to develop their query. The librarian typically has little insight into the social and psychological barriers that might be preventing the user from explaining their question accurately. Anything from anxiety from an approaching deadline to lack of confidence with language can get in the way.\n\nAs libraries have begun to adopt electronic technology into their operations, the idea of the virtual reference interview has come to light. Virtual reference is a reference service initiated electronically, often in real-time. The user and librarian do not meet face-to-face. Virtual reference services can be conducted, for example, in internet chat, videoconferencing, email, co-browsing and instant messaging. \n\nUptake of virtual reference has not been as swift as some had predicted. The complexity of virtual reference may be to blame, as users want information quickly and with the minimum of fuss. Some evidence suggests that the problem lies with poor uptake and training among library staff.\n\nLibrary users are not always comfortable with reference services, let alone satisfied with them. Unobtrusive user studies suggest that only around 55% to 65% of users leave a reference interview satisfied with the result and willing to return. Demographics, social factors and users’ preconceptions about libraries all contribute to this figure. Embarrassment, shyness, and anxiety can prevent a user from approaching the reference desk, and poor signposting and explanation of services can mean that some customers aren't aware that the reference service exists. To be as effective as possible, libraries must be proactive in publicizing their services and reducing the stigma of asking for help.\n\nFor a long time, the value of the reference interview has stood unquestioned. More recently, with technological developments streamlining some of the tasks which once comprised the interview, some researchers are beginning to question the validity of the reference interview, and the investment that a reference librarian represents. Others argue that reference services should broaden their target audience. As people increasingly use the internet to make major, life-affecting decisions, so they also require the services of professionals who are able to provide help in this environment. If this proves to be the case, it will become more vital that the reference interview be conducted professionally and successfully. In the age of information overload, a successful reference interview may empower users to confidently make such decisions in their lives.\n\n\n\n"}

The information is intended to be found quickly when needed. Reference works are usually \"referred\" to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid use of the first person, and emphasize facts. Many reference works are compiled by a team of contributors whose work is coordinated by one or more editors rather than by an individual author. Indices are commonly provided in many types of reference work. Updated editions are usually published as needed, in some cases annually (e.g. \"Whitaker's Almanack\", \"Who's Who\"). Reference works include dictionaries, thesauruses, encyclopedias, almanacs, bibliographies, and catalogs (e.g. catalogs of libraries, museums or the works of individual artists). Many reference works are available in electronic form and can be obtained as application software, CD-ROMs, DVDs, or online through the Internet.\n\nA reference work is useful to its users if they attribute some degree of trust.\n\nIn comparison, a reference book or reference-only book in a library is one that may only be used in the library and may not be borrowed from the library. Many such books are reference works (in the first sense), which are, usually, used briefly or photocopied from, and therefore, do not need to be borrowed. Keeping reference books in the library assures that they will always be available for use on demand. Some reference-only books are too valuable to permit borrowers to take them out. Reference-only items may be shelved in a reference collection located separately from circulating items. Some libraries consist entirely, or to a large extent, of books which may not be borrowed.\n\nAn electronic resource is a piece of information that is stored electronically, which is usually found on a computer, including information that is available on the internet.

{"id": "56067306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56067306", "title": "SDS-PAGE", "text": "SDS-PAGE\n\nSDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) is a variant of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, an analytical method in biochemistry for the separation of charged molecules in mixtures by their molecular masses in an electric field. It uses sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) molecules to help identify and isolate protein molecules.\n\nSDS-PAGE is a discontinuous electrophoretic system developed by Ulrich K. Laemmli which is commonly used as a method to separate proteins with molecular masses between 5 and 250 KDa. The publication describing it is the most frequently cited paper by a single author, and the second most cited overall.\n\nSDS-PAGE is an electrophoresis method that allows protein separation by mass. The medium (also referred to as ′matrix′) is a polyacrylamide-based discontinuous gel. In addition, SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) is used. About 1.4 grams of SDS bind to a gram of protein, corresponding to one SDS molecule per two amino acids. SDS acts as a surfactant, covering the proteins' intrinsic charge and conferring them very similar charge-to-mass ratios. The intrinsic charges of the proteins are negligible in comparison to the SDS loading, and the positive charges are also greatly reduced in the basic pH range of a separating gel. Upon application of a constant electric field, the protein migrate towards the anode, each with a different speed, depending on its mass. This simple procedure allows precise protein separation by mass.\n\nSDS tends to form spherical micelles in aqueous solutions above a certain concentration called the critical micellar concentration (CMC). Above the critical micellar concentration of 7 to 10 millimolar in solutions, the SDS simultaneously occurs as single molecules (monomer) and as micelles, below the CMC SDS occurs only as monomers in aqueous solutions. At the critical micellar concentration, a micelle consists of about 62 SDS molecules. However, only SDS monomers bind to proteins via hydrophobic interactions, whereas the SDS micelles are anionic on the outside and do not adsorb any protein. SDS is amphipathic in nature, which allows it to unfold both polar and nonpolar sections of protein structure. In SDS concentrations above 0.1 millimolar, the unfolding of proteins begins, and above 1 mM, most proteins are denatured. Due to the strong denaturing effect of SDS and the subsequent dissociation of protein complexes, quaternary structures can generally not be determined with SDS. Exceptions are e.g. proteins that were previously stabilised by covalent cross-linking and the SDS-resistant protein complexes, which are stable even in the presence of SDS (the latter, however, only at room temperature). To denature the SDS-resistant complexes a high activation energy is required, which is achieved by heating. SDS resistance is based on a metastability of the protein fold. Although the native, fully folded, SDS-resistant protein does not have sufficient stability in the presence of SDS, the chemical equilibrium of denaturation at room temperature occurs slowly. Stable protein complexes are characterised not only by SDS resistance but also by stability against proteases and an increased biological half-life.\n\nAlternatively, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis can also be performed with the cationic surfactants CTAB in a CTAB-PAGE, or 16-BAC in a BAC-PAGE.\n\nThe SDS-PAGE method is composed of gel preparation, sample preparation, electrophoresis, protein staining or western blotting and analysis of the generated banding pattern.\n\nWhen using different buffers in the gel (discontinuous gel electrophoresis), the gels are made up to one day prior to electrophoresis, so that the diffusion does not lead to a mixing of the buffers. The gel is produced by radical polymerisation in a mold consisting of two sealed glass plates with spacers between the glass plates. In a typical mini-gel setting, the spacers have a thickness of 0.75 mm or 1.5 mm, which determines the loading capacity of the gel. For pouring the gel solution, the plates are usually clamped in a stand which temporarily seals the otherwise open underside of the glass plates with the two spacers. For the gel solution, acrylamide is mixed as gel-former (usually 4% V/V in the stacking gel and 10-12 % in the separating gel), methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linker, stacking or separating gel buffer, water and SDS. By adding the catalyst TEMED and the radical initiator ammonium persulfate (APS) the polymerisation is started. The solution is then poured between the glass plates without creating bubbles. Depending on the amount of catalyst and radical starter and depending on the temperature, the polymerisation lasts between a quarter of an hour and several hours. The lower gel (separating gel) is poured first and covered with a few drops of a barely water-soluble alcohol (usually buffer-saturated butanol or isopropanol), which eliminates bubbles from the meniscus and protects the gel solution of the radical scavenger oxygen. After the polymerisation of the separating gel, the alcohol is discarded and the residual alcohol is removed with filter paper. After addition of APS and TEMED to the stacking gel solution, it is poured on top of the solid separation gel. Afterwards, a suitable sample comb is inserted between the glass plates without creating bubbles. The sample comb is carefully pulled out after polymerisation, leaving pockets for the sample application. For later use of proteins for protein sequencing, the gels are often prepared the day before electrophoresis to reduce reactions of unpolymerised acrylamide with cysteines in proteins.\n\nBy using a gradient mixer, gradient gels with a gradient of acrylamide (usually from 4 to 12%) can be cast, which have a larger separation range of the molecular masses. Commercial gel systems (so-called \"pre-cast gels\") usually use the buffer substance Bis-tris methane with a pH value between 6.4 and 7.2 both in the stacking gel and in the separating gel. These gels are delivered cast and ready-to-use. Since they use only one buffer (continuous gel electrophoresis) and have a nearly neutral pH, they can be stored for several weeks. The more neutral pH slows the hydrolysis and thus the decomposition of the polyacrylamide. Furthermore, there are fewer acrylamide-modified cysteines in the proteins. Due to the constant pH in collecting and separating gel there is no stacking effect. Proteins in BisTris gels can not be stained with ruthenium complexes. This gel system has a comparatively large separation range, which can be varied by using MES or MOPS in the running buffer.\n\nDuring sample preparation, the sample buffer, and thus SDS, is added in excess to the proteins, and the sample is then heated to 95 °C for five minutes, or alternatively 70°C for ten minutes. Heating disrupts the secondary and tertiary structures of the protein by disrupting hydrogen bonds and stretching the molecules. Optionally, disulfide bridges can be cleaved by reduction. For this purpose, reducing thiols such as β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME, 5% by volume), dithiothreitol (DTT, 10 millimolar) or dithioerythritol (DTE, 10 millimolar) are added to the sample buffer. After cooling to room temperature, each sample is pipetted into its own well in the gel, which was previously immersed in electrophoresis buffer in the electrophoresis apparatus.\n\nIn addition to the samples, a molecular-weight size marker is usually loaded onto the gel. This consists of proteins of known sizes and thereby allows the estimation (with an error of ± 10%) of the sizes of the proteins in the actual samples, which migrate in parallel in different tracks of the gel. The size marker is often pipetted into the first or last pocket of a gel.\n\nFor separation, the denatured samples are loaded onto a gel of polyacrylamide, which is placed in an electrophoresis buffer with suitable electrolytes. Thereafter, a voltage (usually around 100 V, 10-20 V per cm gel length) is applied, which causes a migration of negatively charged molecules through the gel in the direction of the positively charged anode. The gel acts like a sieve. Small proteins migrate relatively easily through the mesh of the gel, while larger proteins are more likely to be retained and thereby migrate more slowly through the gel, thereby allowing proteins to be separated by molecular size. The electrophoresis lasts between half an hour to several hours depending on the voltage and length of gel used.\n\nThe fastest-migrating proteins (with a molecular weight of less than 5 KDa) form the buffer front together with the anionic components of the electrophoresis buffer, which also migrate through the gel. The area of the buffer front is made visible by adding the comparatively small, anionic dye bromophenol blue to the sample buffer. Due to the relatively small molecule size of bromophenol blue, it migrates faster than proteins. By optical control of the migrating colored band, the electrophoresis can be stopped before the dye and also the samples have completely migrated through the gel and leave it.\n\nThe most commonly used method is the discontinuous SDS-PAGE. In this method, the proteins migrate first into a collecting gel with neutral pH, in which they are concentrated and then they migrate into a separating gel with basic pH, in which the actual separation takes place. Stacking and separating gels differ by different pore size (4-6 % T and 10-20 % T), ionic strength and pH values (pH 6.8 or pH 8.8). The electrolyte most frequently used is an SDS-containing Tris-glycine-chloride buffer system. At neutral pH, glycine predominantly forms the zwitterionic form, at high pH the glycines lose positive charges and become predominantly anionic. In the collection gel, the smaller, negatively charged chloride ions migrate in front of the proteins (as leading ions) and the slightly larger, negatively and partially positively charged glycinate ions migrate behind the proteins (as initial trailing ions), whereas in the comparatively basic separating gel both ions migrate in front of the proteins. The pH gradient between the stacking and separation gel buffers leads to a stacking effect at the border of the stacking gel to the separation gel, since the glycinate partially loses its slowing positive charges as the pH increases and then, as the former trailing ion, overtakes the proteins and becomes a leading ion, which causes the bands of the different proteins (visible after a staining) to become narrower and sharper - the stacking effect. For the separation of smaller proteins and peptides, the TRIS-Tricine buffer system of Schägger and von Jagow is used due to the higher spread of the proteins in the range of 0.5 to 50 KDa.\n\nAt the end of the electrophoretic separation, all proteins are sorted by size and can then be analyzed by other methods, e. g. protein staining such as Coomassie staining (most common and easy to use), silver staining (highest sensitivity), stains all staining, Amido black 10B staining, Fast green FCF staining, fluorescent stains such as epicocconone stain and SYPRO orange stain, and immunological detection such as the Western Blot. The fluorescent dyes have a comparatively higher linearity between protein quantity and color intensity of about three orders of magnitude above the detection limit, i. e. the amount of protein can be estimated by color intensity. When using the fluorescent protein dye trichloroethanol, a subsequent protein staining is omitted if it was added to the gel solution and the gel was irradiated with UV light after electrophoresis.\n\nProtein staining in the gel creates a documentable banding pattern of the various proteins. Glycoproteins have differential levels of glycosylations and adsorb SDS more unevenly at the glycosylations, resulting in broader and blurred bands. Membrane proteins, because of their transmembrane domain, are often composed of the more hydrophobic amino acids, have lower solubility in aqueous solutions, tend to bind lipids, and tend to precipitate in aqueous solutions due to hydrophobic effects when sufficient amounts of detergent are not present. This precipitation manifests itself for membrane proteins in a SDS-PAGE in \"tailing\" above the band of the transmembrane protein. In this case, more SDS can be used (by using more or more concentrated sample buffer) and the amount of protein in the sample application can be reduced. An overloading of the gel with a soluble protein creates a semicircular band of this protein (e. g. in the marker lane of the image at 66 KDa), allowing other proteins with similar molecular weights to be covered. A low contrast (as in the marker lane of the image) between bands within a lane indicates either the presence of many proteins (low purity) or, if using purified proteins and a low contrast occurs only below one band, it indicates a proteolytic degradation of the protein, which first causes degradation bands, and after further degradation produces a homogeneous color (\"smear\") below a band. The documentation of the banding pattern is usually done by photographing or scanning. For a subsequent recovery of the molecules in individual bands, a gel extraction can be performed.\n\nAfter protein staining and documentation of the banding pattern, the polyacrylamide gel can be dried for archival storage. Proteins can be extracted from it at a later date. The gel is either placed in a drying frame (with or without the use of heat) or in a vacuum dryer. The drying frame consists of two parts, one of which serves as a base for a wet cellophane film to which the gel and a one percent glycerol solution are added. Then a second wet cellophane film is applied bubble-free, the second frame part is put on top and the frame is sealed with clips. The removal of the air bubbles avoids a fragmentation of the gel during drying. The water evaporates through the cellophane film. In contrast to the drying frame, a vacuum dryer generates a vacuum and heats the gel to about 50 °C.\n\nFor a more accurate determination of the molecular weight, the relative migration distances of the individual protein bands are measured in the separating gel. The measurements are usually performed in triplicate for increased accuracy. The relative mobility (called Rf value or Rm value) is the quotient of the distance of the band of the protein and the distance of the buffer front. The distances of the bands and the buffer front are each measured from the beginning of the separation gel. The distance of the buffer front roughly corresponds to the distance of the bromophenol blue contained in the sample buffer. The relative distances of the proteins of the size marker are plotted semi-logarithmically against their known molecular weights. By comparison with the linear part of the generated graph or by a regression analysis, the molecular weight of an unknown protein can be determined by its relative mobility. Bands of proteins with glycosylations can be blurred. Proteins with many basic amino acids (e. g. histones) can lead to an overestimation of the molecular weight or even not migrate into the gel at all, because they move slower in the electrophoresis due to the positive charges or even to the opposite direction. Accordingly, many acidic amino acids can lead to accelerated migration of a protein and an underestimation of its molecular mass.\n\nThe SDS-PAGE in combination with a protein stain is widely used in biochemistry for the quick and exact separation and subsequent analysis of proteins. It has comparatively low instrument and reagent costs and is an easy-to-use method. Because of its low scalability, it is mostly used for analytical purposes and less for preparative purposes, especially when larger amounts of a protein are to be isolated.\n\nAdditionally, SDS-PAGE is used in combination with the western blot for the determination of the presence of a specific protein in a mixture of proteins - or for the analysis of post-translational modifications. Post-translational modifications of proteins can lead to a different relative mobility (i.e. a \"band shift\") or to a change in the binding of a detection antibody used in the western blot (i.e. a band disappears or appears).\n\nIn mass spectrometry of proteins, SDS-PAGE is a widely used method for sample preparation prior to spectrometry, mostly using in-gel digestion. In regards to determining the molecular mass of a protein, the SDS-PAGE is a bit more exact than an analytical ultracentrifugation, but less exact than a mass spectrometry or - ignoring post-translational modifications - a calculation of the protein molecular mass from the DNA sequence.\n\nIn medical diagnostics, SDS-PAGE is used as part of the HIV test and to evaluate proteinuria. In the HIV test, HIV proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently detected by Western Blot with HIV-specific antibodies of the patient, if they are present in his blood serum. SDS-PAGE for proteinuria evaluates the levels of various serum proteins in the urine, e.g. Albumin, Alpha-2-macroglobulin and IgG.\n\nSDS-PAGE is the most widely used method for gel electrophoretic separation of proteins. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis sequentially combines isoelectric focusing or BAC-PAGE with a SDS-PAGE. Native PAGE is used if native protein folding is to be maintained. For separation of membrane proteins, BAC-PAGE or CTAB-PAGE may be used as an alternative to SDS-PAGE. For electrophoretic separation of larger protein complexes, agarose gel electrophoresis can be used, e.g. the SDD-AGE. Some enzymes can be detected via their enzyme activity by zymography.\n\nWhile being one of the more precise and low-cost protein separation and analysis methods, the SDS-PAGE denatures proteins. Where non-denaturing conditions are necessary, proteins are separated by a native PAGE or different chromatographic methods with subsequent photometric quantification, for example affinity chromatography (or even tandem affinity purification), size exclusion chromatography, ion exchange chromatography. Proteins can also be separated by size in a tangential flow filtration or a ultrafiltration. Single proteins can be isolated from a mixture by affinity chromatography or by a pull-down assay. Some historically early and cost effective but crude separation methods usually based upon a series of extractions and precipitations using kosmotropic molecules, for example the ammonium sulfate precipitation and the polyethyleneglycol precipitation.\n\nIn 1948, Arne Tiselius was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of the principle of electrophoresis as the migration of charged and dissolved atoms or molecules in an electric field. The use of a solid matrix (initially paper discs) in a zone electrophoresis improved the separation. The discontinuous electrophoresis of 1964 by L. Ornstein and B. J. Davis made it possible to improve the separation by the stacking effect. The use of cross-linked polyacrylamide hydrogels, in contrast to the previously used paper discs or starch gels, provided a higher stability of the gel and no microbial decomposition. The denaturing effect of SDS in continuous polyacrylamide gels and the consequent improvement in resolution was first described in 1965 by David F. Summers in the working group of James E. Darnell to separate poliovirus proteins. The current variant of the SDS-PAGE was described in 1970 by Ulrich K. Laemmli and initially used to characterise the proteins in the head of bacteriophage T4.\n\n"}

In open nomenclature it indicates that available material or evidence suggests that the proposed species is \"related to\", has an \"affinity\" to, but is \"not identical to\", the species with the binomial name that follows. The Latin word \"affinis\" can be translated as \"closely related to\", or \"akin to\".\n\nAn author who inserts \"n.sp.,\" or \"sp. nov., aff\" before a species name thereby states the opinion that the specimen is a new, previously undescribed species, but that there may not (yet) be enough information to complete a formal description. To use aff. alone, implies that the specimen differs suggestively from the holotype but that further progress is necessary to confirm that it is a novel species.\n\nAn example would be: a gastropod shell listed as \"Lucapina\" aff. \"aegis\" would mean that this shell somewhat resembles the shell of \"Lucapina aegis\", but is thought more likely to be another species, either closely related to, or closely resembling \"Lucapina aegis\". In a suitable context it also may suggest the possibility that the shell belongs to a species that has not yet been described.\n\nThe use of aff. is similar to other indicators of open nomenclature such as cf., sp., or ?, but the latter indicate that the species is \"uncertain\" rather than undescribed.\n\n"}
{"id": "738307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=738307", "title": "Stephanus pagination", "text": "Stephanus pagination\n\nStephanus pagination is a system of reference and organization used in modern editions and translations of Plato (and less famously, Plutarch) based on the three volume 1578 edition of Plato's complete works translated by Joannes Serranus (Jean de Serres) and published by Henricus Stephanus (Henri Estienne) in Geneva.\n\nIn the case of Plato's works, Stephanus pagination first divides the works into numbers that are the page numbers of each of the Stephanus edition's three volumes, and each such page and page number is further subdivided into lettered sections which correspond to parallel Greek/Latin translated passages on a given page, mostly commonly a, b, c, d, and e. This system is used in modern scholarship to cite Plato. For Plato's works, unique coordinates for a passage can therefore be given with three pieces of information: the work's name, the (Stephanus) page number, and the letter denoting the passage. For example, \"\"Symposium\" 172a\" cites \"Symposium\", Stephanus page 172 (the volume in which \"Symposium\" occurs, as it happens, volume 3), passage a. To avoid ambiguity in this scheme, either the Platonic work or the volume must be cited; absent this, \"page 50\" might refer to any of the \"pages 50\" across Stephanus' three volumes. Reference to Stephanus manifestly presupposes the existing ordering of the work in its given volumes, but given historical disagreement as to the chronology and proper ordering of Plato's works, care should therefore be taken when referring to Stephanus pagination as opposed to another scheme.\n\nMore specific citations may add line numbers, e.g. \"Symposium\" 209a5–9, but these generally refer to the lines in John Burnet's Oxford Classical Text, not to Estienne's line divisions.\n\nThere are some peculiarities in the Stephanus page numbers. The length of each page and each paragraph can vary if extra commentary appears on the page of the 1578 edition. Thus Stephanus pages are not all of the same length. Some pages do not have all the paragraphs a through e. There are also gaps in the sequence of Stephanus page numbers for Plato's \"Republic\" and \"Laws\". The reason is that the editors added separate introductions to each 'book' of these longer works, and thus the page numbers of these introductions are not used to refer to pages in Plato's dialogues. \n\nThe spurious dialogue \"Halcyon\" was included in the corpus of Lucian's works and does not have Stephanus numbers.\n\nBekker numbering is the comparable system for the works of Aristotle, and Diels–Kranz numbering is the comparable system for Pre-Socratic philosophy. Unlike Stephanus pagination, Bekker numbering starts with page 1 and proceeds through all of Aristotle's works without starting over, regardless of the number of volumes needed for a given edition. Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage, not shared by Stephanus pagination, of giving compact, unambiguous numerical citation of a given passage, page, etc, without the absolute necessity in order to avoid ambiguity to specify the dialogue, work or volume which exists in the case of Stephanus.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Some tertiary sources are not to be used for academic research, unless they can also be used as secondary sources, or to find other sources.\n\nDepending on the topic of research, a scholar may use a bibliography, dictionary, or encyclopedia as either a tertiary or a secondary source. This causes difficulty in defining many sources as either one type or the other.\n\nIn some academic disciplines the differentiation between a secondary and tertiary source is relative. \n\nIn the United Nations International Scientific Information System (UNISIST) model, a secondary source is a bibliography, whereas a tertiary source is a synthesis of primary sources.\n\nAs tertiary sources, encyclopedias, textbooks, and compendia attempt to summarize, collect, and consolidate the source materials into an overview, but may also present subjective, or biased commentary and analysis (which are characteristics of secondary sources).\n\nIndexes, bibliographies, concordances, and databases may not provide much textual information, but as aggregates of primary and secondary sources, they are often considered tertiary sources. So although tertiary sources are both primary and secondary, they are more towards a secondary source because of commentary and bias.\n\nAlmanacs, travel guides, field guides, and timelines are also examples of tertiary sources.\n\nSurvey or overview articles are usually tertiary, though review articles in peer-reviewed academic journals are secondary (not be confused with film, book, etc. reviews, which are primary-source opinions).\n\nSome usually primary sources, such as user guides and manuals, are secondary or tertiary (depending on the nature of the material) when written by third parties.\n\n"}

The main purpose of such reference works for users \"to find the word, or words, by which [an] idea may be most fitly and aptly expressed\" – to quote Peter Mark Roget, architect of the best known thesaurus in the English language.\n\nAlthough including synonyms, a thesaurus should not be taken as a complete list of all the synonyms for a particular word. The entries are also designed for drawing distinctions between similar words and assisting in choosing exactly the right word. Unlike a dictionary, a thesaurus entry does not give the definition of words.\n\nIn library science and information science, thesauri have been widely used to specify domain models. Recently, thesauri have been implemented with Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS).\n\nThe word \"thesaurus\" is derived from 16th-century New Latin, in turn from Latin \"thēsaurus\", which is the Latinisation of the Greek (\"thēsauros\"), \"treasure, treasury, storehouse\". The word \"thēsauros\" is of uncertain etymology. Douglas Harper derives it from the root of the Greek verb τιθέναι \"tithenai\", \"to put, to place.\" Robert Beekes rejected an Indo-European derivation and suggested a Pre-Greek suffix .\n\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, the term \"thesaurus\" was applied to any dictionary or encyclopedia, as in the \"Thesaurus linguae latinae\" (1532), and the \"Thesaurus linguae graecae\" (1572). The meaning \"collection of words arranged according to sense\" is first attested in 1852 in Roget's title and \"thesaurer\" is attested in Middle English for \"treasurer\".\n\nIn antiquity, Philo of Byblos authored the first text that could now be called a thesaurus. In Sanskrit, the Amarakosha is a thesaurus in verse form, written in the 4th century. Eventhough Amarakosha mentions 18 prior works, they have all been lost.\n\nThe first modern thesaurus was \"Roget's Thesaurus\", first compiled in 1805 by Peter Mark Roget, and published in 1852. Since its publication it has never been out of print and is still a widely used work across the English-speaking world. Entries in \"Roget's Thesaurus\" are listed conceptually rather than alphabetically.\nRoget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:\n\nIt is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.\nThesauri have been used to perform automatic word-sense disambiguation and text simplification for machine translation systems.\n\n"}

These are usually the initial letters of the words of the phrase abbreviated, and are written in capital letters (upper case); three-letter abbreviations such as \"etc.\" and \"Mrs.\" are not three-letter acronyms, but \"TLA\" is a TLA (an example of an autological abbreviation).\n\nMost three-letter abbreviations are \"initialisms\": all the letters are pronounced as the names of letters, as in \"APA\" . Some are acronyms pronounced as a word; computed axial tomography, CAT, is almost always pronounced as the animal's name in \"CAT scan\".\n\n\nThe exact phrase \"three-letter acronym\" appeared in the sociology literature in 1975. Three-letter acronyms were used as mnemonics in biological sciences, from 1977 and their practical advantage was promoted by Weber in 1982. They are used in many other fields, but the term TLA is particularly associated with computing. In 1980, the manual for the Sinclair ZX81 home computer used and explained TLA. The specific generation of three-letter acronyms in computing was mentioned in a JPL report of 1982. In 1988, in a paper titled \"On the cruelty of really teaching computer science\", eminent computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra wrote \n\"Because no endeavour is respectable these days without a TLA ...\" By 1992 it was in a Microsoft handbook.\n\nThe number of possible three-letter abbreviations (or permutations) using the 26 letters of the alphabet from A to Z (AAA, AAB ... to ZZY, ZZZ) is 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576. Another 26 × 26 × 10 = 6760 can be produced if the third element is allowed to be a digit 0-9, giving a total of 24,336.\n\nIn English, WWW is the longest possible TLA to pronounce, typically requiring nine syllables. The usefulness of TLAs typically comes from how it is quicker to say the acronym instead of than the phrase they represent, however saying 'WWW' in English requires three times as many syllables than the phrase it is meant to abbreviate (World Wide Web). Consequently, \"www\" is sometimes abbreviated as \"dubdubdub\" in speech.\n\n\n"}
