{"id": "1171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1171", "title": "Abbreviation", "text": "Abbreviation\n\nAn abbreviation (from Latin \"brevis\", meaning \"short\" ) is a shortened form of a word or phrase. It consists of a group of letters taken from the word or phrase. For example, the word \"abbreviation\" can itself be represented by the abbreviation \"abbr.\", \"abbrv.\", or \"abbrev.\"\n\nIn strict analysis, abbreviations should not be confused with contractions, crasis, acronyms, or initialisms, with which they share some semantic and phonetic functions, though all four are connected by the term \"abbreviation\" in loose parlance.An abbreviation is a shortening by any method; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts. A contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or syllables and bringing together the first and last letters or elements; an abbreviation may be made by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a part. A contraction is an abbreviation, but an abbreviation is not necessarily a contraction. Acronyms and initialisms are regarded as subsets of abbreviations (e.g. by the Council of Science Editors). They are abbreviations that consist of the initial letters or parts of words.\n\nAbbreviations have a long history, created so that spelling out a whole word could be avoided. This might be done to save time and space, and also to provide secrecy. Shortened words were used and initial letters were commonly used to represent words in specific applications. In classical Greece and Rome, the reduction of words to single letters was common. In Roman inscriptions, \"Words were commonly abbreviated by using the initial letter or letters of words, and most inscriptions have at least one abbreviation.\" However, \"some could have more than one meaning, depending on their context. (For example, \"A\" can be an abbreviation for many words, such as \"ager\", \"amicus\", \"annus\", \"as\", \"Aulus\", \"Aurelius\", \"aurum\" and \"avus\".)\"\n\nAbbreviations in English were frequently used from its earliest days. Manuscripts of copies of the old English poem \"Beowulf\" used many abbreviations, for example \"7\" or \"&\" for \"and\", and \"y\" for \"since\", so that \"not much space is wasted\". The standardisation of English in the 15th through 17th centuries included such a growth in the use of abbreviations. At first, abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs, not only periods. For example, sequences like ‹er› were replaced with ‹ɔ›, as in ‹mastɔ› for \"master\" and ‹exacɔbate› for \"exacerbate\". While this may seem trivial, it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce the copy time. An example from the Oxford University Register, 1503:\n\nThe Early Modern English period, between the 15th and 17th centuries, had abbreviations like \"y\" for \"Þ\", used for the word \"the\": \"hence, by later misunderstanding, Ye Olde Tea Shoppe.\"\n\nDuring the growth of philological linguistic theory in academic Britain, abbreviating became very fashionable. The use of abbreviation for the names of J. R. R. Tolkien and his friend C. S. Lewis, and other members of the Oxford literary group known as the Inklings, are sometimes cited as symptomatic of this. Likewise, a century earlier in Boston, a fad of abbreviation started that swept the United States, with the globally popular term OK generally credited as a remnant of its influence.\n\nAfter World War II, the British greatly reduced the use of the full stop and other punctuation points after abbreviations in at least semi-formal writing, while the Americans more readily kept such use until more recently, and still maintain it more than Britons. The classic example, considered by their American counterparts quite curious, was the maintenance of the internal comma in a British organisation of secret agents called the \"Special Operations, Executive\"—\"S.O., E\"—which is not found in histories written after about 1960.\n\nBut before that, many Britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the French form. In French, the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is \"not\" the last letter of its antecedent: \"M.\" is the abbreviation for \"monsieur\" while \"Mme\" is that for \"madame\". Like many other cross-channel linguistic acquisitions, many Britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves, while the Americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously.\n\nOver the years, however, the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not. The U.S. media tend to use periods in two-word abbreviations like United States (U.S.), but not personal computer (PC) or television (TV). Many British publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations.\n\nMinimization of punctuation in typewritten material became economically desirable in the 1960s and 1970s for the many users of carbon-film ribbons since a period or comma consumed the same length of non-reusable expensive ribbon as did a capital letter.\n\nWidespread use of electronic communication through mobile phones and the Internet during the 1990s allowed for a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation. This was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as instant- and text messaging. SMS, for instance, supports message lengths of 160 characters at most (using the GSM 03.38 character set). This brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called Textese, with which 10% or more of the words in a typical SMS message are abbreviated. More recently Twitter, a popular social networking service, began driving abbreviation use with 140 character message limits.\n\nIn modern English, there are several conventions for abbreviations, and the choice may be confusing. The only rule universally accepted is that one should be \"consistent\", and to make this easier, publishers express their preferences in a style guide. Questions which arise include those in the following subsections.\n\nIf the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital, for example Lev. for \"Leviticus\". When a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization. However, when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken, then all letters should be capitalized, as in YTD for \"year-to-date\", PCB for \"printed circuit board\" and FYI for \"for your information\". However, see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary: these are no longer written with capital letters.\n\nA period (full stop) is often used to signify an abbreviation, but opinion is divided as to when and if this should happen.\n\nAccording to Hart's Rules, the traditional rule is that abbreviations (in the narrow sense that includes only words with the ending, and not the middle, dropped) terminate with a full stop, whereas contractions (in the sense of words missing a middle part) do not, but there are exceptions. Fowler's Modern English Usage says full stops are used to mark both abbreviations and contractions, but recommends against this practice: advising them only for abbreviations and lower-case initialisms and not for upper-case initialisms and contractions.\n\nIn American English, the period is usually included regardless of whether or not it is a contraction, e.g. \"Dr.\" or \"Mrs.\". In some cases, periods are optional, as in either \"US\" or \"U.S.\" for \"United States\", \"EU\" or \"E.U.\" for \"European Union\", and \"UN\" or \"U.N.\" for \"United Nations\". There are some house styles, however—American ones included—that remove the periods from almost all abbreviations. For example:\n\nAcronyms that were originally capitalized (with or without periods) but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods. Examples are sonar, radar, lidar, laser, snafu, and scuba.\n\nToday, spaces are generally not used between single-letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase, so one almost never encounters \"U. S.\"\n\nWhen an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence, only one period is used: \"The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C\".\n\nThere is a question about how to pluralize abbreviations, particularly acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in \"PC's\". However, this style is not preferred by many style guides. For instance, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings, allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms \"only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters\". Turabian would therefore prefer \"DVDs\" and \"URLs\" and \"Ph.D.'s\", while the Modern Language Association explicitly says, \"do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation\". Also, the American Psychological Association specifically says, \"without an apostrophe\".\n\nHowever, the 1999 style guide for \"The New York Times\" states that the addition of an apostrophe is necessary when pluralizing all abbreviations, preferring \"PC's, TV's and VCR's\".\n\nFollowing those who would generally omit the apostrophe, to form the plural of run batted in, simply add an s to the end of RBI.\n\n\nFor all other rules, see below:\n\nTo form the plural of an abbreviation, a number, or a capital letter used as a noun, simply add a lowercase \"s\" to the end. Apostrophes following decades and single letters are also common.\n\nTo indicate the plural of the abbreviation or symbol of a unit of measure, the same form is used as in the singular.\n\nWhen an abbreviation contains more than one full point, \"Hart's Rules\" recommends putting the \"s\" after the final one.\nHowever, subject to any house style or consistency requirement, the same plurals may be rendered less formally as:\n\nAccording to \"Hart's Rules\", an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it, for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects.\nHowever, the apostrophe can be dispensed with if the items are set in italics or quotes:\n\nIn Latin, and continuing to the derivative forms in European languages as well as English, single-letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note-taking. Most of these deal with writing and publishing. A few longer abbreviations use this as well.\n\nPublications based in the U.S. tend to follow the style guides of \"The Chicago Manual of Style\" and the Associated Press. The U.S. Government follows a style guide published by the U.S. Government Printing Office. The National Institute of Standards and Technology sets the style for abbreviations of units.\n\nMany British publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation:\n\n\nWriters often use shorthand to denote units of measure. Such shorthand can be an abbreviation, such as \"in\" for \"inch\" or can be a symbol such as \"km\" for \"kilometre/kilometer\".\n\nThe shorthand \"in\" applies to English only—in Afrikaans for example, the shorthand \"dm\" is used for the equivalent Afrikaans word \"duim\". Since both \"in\" and \"dm\" are contractions of the same word, but in different languages, they are abbreviations. A symbol on the other hand, defined as \"Mark or character taken as the conventional sign of some object or idea or process\" applies the appropriate shorthand by \"substitution\" rather than by \"contraction\". Since the shorthand for kilometre/kilometer (\"\" in Portuguese or \"\" in Greek) is \"km\" in both languages and the letter \"k\" does not appear in the expansion of either translation, \"km\" is a symbol as it is a substitution rather than a contraction. It is a logogram rather than an abbreviation.\n\nIn the International System of Units (SI) manual the word \"symbol\" is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various SI units of measure. The manual also defines the way in which units should be written, the principal rules being:\n\nA syllabic abbreviation is usually formed from the initial syllables of several words, such as \"Interpol\" = International\" + police\". It is a variant of the acronym. Syllabic abbreviations are usually written using lower case, sometimes starting with a capital letter, and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter. Syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from portmanteaus, which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each.\n\nSyllabic abbreviations are not widely used in English. Some UK government ministries such as Ofcom (Office of Communications\") and Oftel (Office of Telecommunications\") use this style.\n\nNew York City has various neighborhoods named by syllabic abbreviation, such as Tribeca (Triangle below Canal Street\") and SoHo (South of Houston Street\"). This usage has spread into other American cities, giving SoMa, San Francisco (South of Market\") and LoDo, Denver (Lower Downtown\"), among others.\n\nOn the other hand, syllabic abbreviations prevailed both in Germany under the Nazis and in the Soviet Union for naming the plethora of new bureaucratic organisations. For example, \"Gestapo\" stands for Geheime Staats-Polizei\", or \"secret state police\". Similarly, Leninist organisations such as the \"Comintern\" (\"Communist International\") and \"Komsomol\" (Kommunisticheskii Soyuz Molodyozhi\", or \"Communist youth union\") used Russian language syllabic abbreviations. This has given syllabic abbreviations negative connotations in some countries, (as in Orwell's Newspeak), notwithstanding that such abbreviations were used in Germany even before the Nazis came to power, e.g., \"\" for \"Schutzpolizei\", and are still used, e.g. \"\" for \"\".\n\nIn the modern Russian language words like \"Minoborony\" (from Ministerstvo oborony — Ministry of Defence) and \"Minobrnauki\" (from Ministerstvo obrazovaniya i nauki — Ministry of Education and Science) are still commonly used.\n\nSyllabic abbreviations were also typical for the German language used in the German Democratic Republic, e.g. \"Stasi\" for Staatssicherheit\" (\"state security\", the secret police) or \"Vopo\" for \"Volkspolizist\" (\"people's policeman\"). Other uses are in company or product names such as Aldi, from the name of the founder, Theo Albrecht, and the German word Diskont\" (discount) or Haribo, from the name of the founder and the headquarters of the company, Hans Riegl Bonn.\n\nSyllabic abbreviations are \"de rigueur\" in Spanish; examples abound in organization names such as Pemex for Petróleos Mexicanos\" (\"Mexican Petroleums\") or Fonafifo for Fondo Nacional de Financimiento Forestal\" (National Forestry Financing Fund).\n\nEast Asian languages whose writing systems use Chinese characters form abbreviations similarly by using key Chinese characters from a term or phrase. For example, in Japanese the term for the United Nations, \"kokusai rengō\" (国際連合) is often abbreviated to \"kokuren\" (国連). (Such abbreviations are called (略語) in Japanese; see also Japanese abbreviated and contracted words). The syllabic abbreviation is frequently used for universities: for instance, \"Běidà\" (北大) for \"Běijīng Dàxué\" (北京大学, Peking University) and \"Tōdai\" (東大) for \"Tōkyō daigaku\" (東京大学, University of Tokyo). The English phrase \"Gung ho\" originated as a Chinese abbreviation.\n\nPartially syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the US Navy, as it increases readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms. Hence \"DESRON 6\" is used (in the full capital form) to mean \"Destroyer Squadron 6\", while \"COMNAVAIRLANT\" would be \"Commander, Naval Air Force (in the) Atlantic.\"\n\n"}

Similarly, gene activity in the human brain is better understood through examination of the brains of mice by the Seattle-based Allen Institute for Brain Science (see link below), yielding the freely available Allen Brain Atlas. This type of study is related to comparative cognition, but better classified as one of comparative genomics. Increasing emphasis in psychology and ethology on the biological aspects of perception and behavior is bridging the gap between genomics and behavioral analysis.\n\nIn order for scientists to better understand cognitive function across a broad range of species they can systematically compare cognitive abilities between closely and distantly related species Through this process they can determine what kinds of selection pressure has led to different cognitive abilities across a broad range of animals. For example, it has been hypothesized that there is convergent evolution of the higher cognitive functions of corvids and apes, possibly due to both being omnivorous, visual animals that live in social groups.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "380406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=380406", "title": "Comparative psychology", "text": "Comparative psychology\n\nComparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area addresses many different issues, uses many different methods and explores the behavior of many different species from insects to primates.\n\nComparative psychology is sometimes assumed to emphasize cross-species comparisons, including those between humans and animals. However, some researchers feel that direct comparisons should not be the sole focus of comparative psychology and that intense focus on a single organism to understand its behavior is just as desirable; if not more so. Donald Dewsbury reviewed the works of several psychologists and their definitions and concluded that the object of comparative psychology is to establish principles of generality focusing on both proximate and ultimate causation. \n\nUsing a comparative approach to behavior allows one to evaluate the target behavior from four different, complementary perspectives, developed by Niko Tinbergen. First, one may ask how pervasive the behavior is across species (i.e. how common is the behavior between animal species?). Second, one may ask how the behavior contributes to the lifetime reproductive success of the individuals demonstrating the behavior (i.e. does the behavior result in animals producing more offspring than animals not displaying the behavior)? Theories addressing the ultimate causes of behavior are based on the answers to these two questions.\n\nThird, what mechanisms are involved in the behavior (i.e. what physiological, behavioral, and environmental components are necessary and sufficient for the generation of the behavior)? Fourth, a researcher may ask about the development of the behavior within an individual (i.e. what maturational, learning, social experiences must an individual undergo in order to demonstrate a behavior)? Theories addressing the proximate causes of behavior are based on answers to these two questions. For more details see Tinbergen's four questions.\n\nThe 9th century scholar al-Jahiz wrote works on the social organization and communication methods of animals like ants. The 11th century Arabic writer Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) wrote the \"Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals\", an early treatise dealing with the effects of music on an imals. In the treatise, he demonstrates how a camel's pace could be hastened or retarded with the use of music, and shows other examples of how music can affect animal behavior, experimenting with horses, birds and reptiles. Through to the 19th century, a majority of scholars in the Western world continued to believe that music was a distinctly human phenomenon, but experiments since then have vindicated Ibn al-Haytham's view that music does indeed have an effect on animals.\n\nCharles Darwin was central in the development of comparative psychology; it is thought that psychology should be spoken in terms of \"pre-\" and \"post-Darwin\" because his contributions were so influential. theory led to several hypotheses, one being that the factors that set humans apart, such as higher mental, moral and spiritual faculties, could be accounted for by evolutionary principles. In response to the vehement opposition to Darwinism was the \"anecdotal movement\" led by George Romanes who set out to demonstrate that animals possessed a \"rudimentary human mind\". Romanes is most famous for two major flaws in his work: his focus on anecdotal observations and entrenched anthropomorphism.\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, several scientists existed whose work was also very influential. Douglas Alexander Spalding was called the \"first experimental biologist\", and worked mostly with birds; studying instinct, imprinting, and visual and auditory development. Jacques Loeb emphasized the importance of objectively studying behavior, Sir John Lubbock is credited with first using mazes and puzzle devices to study learning and Conwy Lloyd Morgan is thought to be \"the first ethologist in the sense in which we presently use the word\".\n\nThroughout the long history of comparative psychology, repeated attempts have been made to enforce a more disciplined approach, in which similar studies are carried out on animals of different species, and the results interpreted in terms of their different phylogenetic or ecological backgrounds. Behavioral ecology in the 1970s gave a more solid base of knowledge against which a true comparative psychology could develop. However, the broader use of the term \"comparative psychology\" is enshrined in the names of learned societies and academic journals, not to mention in the minds of psychologists of other specialisms, so the label of the field is never likely to disappear completely.\n\nA persistent question with which comparative psychologists have been faced is the relative intelligence of different species of animal. Indeed, some early attempts at a genuinely comparative psychology involved evaluating how well animals of different species could learn different tasks. These attempts floundered; in retrospect it can be seen that they were not sufficiently sophisticated, either in their analysis of the demands of different tasks, or in their choice of species to compare. However, the definition of \"intelligence\" in comparative psychology is deeply affected by anthropomorphism, and focuses on simple tasks, complex problems, reversal learning, learning sets, and delayed alternation are plagued with practical and theoretical problems. In the literature, \"intelligence\" is defined as whatever is closest to human performance and neglects behaviors that humans are usually incapable of (e.g. echolocation). Specifically, comparative researchers encounter problems associated with individual differences, differences in motivation, differences in reinforcement, differences in sensory function, differences in motor capacities, and species-typical preparedness (i.e. some species have evolved to acquire some behaviors quicker than other behaviors).\n\nA wide variety of species have been studied by comparative psychologists. However, a small number have dominated the scene. Ivan Pavlov's early work used dogs; although they have been the subject of occasional studies, since then they have not figured prominently. Increasing interest in the study of abnormal animal behavior has led to a return to the study of most kinds of domestic animal. Thorndike began his studies with cats, but American comparative psychologists quickly shifted to the more economical rat, which remained the almost invariable subject for the first half of the 20th century and continues to be used.\n\nSkinner introduced the use of pigeons, and they continue to be important in some fields. There has always been interest in studying various species of primate; important contributions to social and developmental psychology were made by Harry F. Harlow's studies of maternal deprivation in rhesus monkeys. Cross-fostering studies have shown similarities between human infants and infant chimpanzees. Kellogg and Kellogg (1933) aimed to look at heredity and environmental effects of young primates. They found that a cross-fostered chimpanzee named Gua was better at recognizing human smells and clothing and that the Kelloggs' infant (Donald) recognised humans better by their faces. The study ended 9 months after it had begun, after the infant began to imitate the noises of Gua.\n\nNonhuman primates have also been used to show the development of language in comparison with human development. For example, Gardner (1967) successfully taught the female chimpanzee Washoe 350 words in American Sign Language. Washoe subsequently passed on some of this teaching to her adopted offspring, Loulis. A criticism of Washoe's acquisition of sign language focused on the extent to which she actually understood what she was signing. Her signs may have just based on an association to get a reward, such as food or a toy. Other studies concluded that apes do not understand linguistic input, but may form an intended meaning of what is being communicated. All great apes have been reported to have the capacity of allospecific symbolic production.\n\nInterest in primate studies has increased with the rise in studies of animal cognition. Other animals thought to be intelligent have also been increasingly studied. Examples include various species of corvid, parrots — especially the grey parrot — and dolphins. Alex (Avian Learning EXperiment) is a well known case study (1976–2007) which was developed by Pepperberg, who found that the African gray parrot Alex did not only mimic vocalisations but understood the concepts of same and different between objects. The study of non-human mammals has also included the study of dogs. Due to their domestic nature and personalities, dogs have lived closely with humans, and parallels in communication and cognitive behaviours have therefore been recognised and further researched. Joly-Mascheroni and colleagues (2008) demonstrated that dogs may be able to catch human yawns and suggested a level of empathy in dogs, a point that is strongly debated. Pilley and Reid found that a Border Collie named Chaser was able to successfully identify and retrieve 1022 distinct objects/toys.\n\nResearchers who study animal cognition are interested in understanding the mental processes that control complex behavior, and much of their work parallels that of cognitive psychologists working with humans. For example, there is extensive research with animals on attention, categorization, concept formation, memory, spatial cognition, and time estimation. Much research in these and other areas is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings, such as navigation, tool use, and numerical competence. Thus, comparative psychology and animal cognition are heavily overlapping research categories.\n\nVeterinary surgeons recognize that the psychological state of a captive or domesticated animal must be taken into account if its behavior and health are to be understood and optimized.\n\nCommon causes of disordered behavior in captive or pet animals are lack of stimulation, inappropriate stimulation, or overstimulation. These conditions can lead to disorders, unpredictable and unwanted behavior, and sometimes even physical symptoms and diseases. For example, rats who are exposed to loud music for a long period will ultimately develop unwanted behaviors that have been compared with human psychosis, like biting their owners.\n\nThe way dogs behave when understimulated is widely believed to depend on the breed as well as on the individual animal's character. For example, huskies have been known to ruin gardens and houses if they are not allowed enough activity. Dogs are also prone to psychological damage if they are subjected to violence. If they are treated very badly, they may become dangerous.\n\nThe systematic study of disordered animal behavior draws on research in comparative psychology, including the early work on conditioning and instrumental learning, but also on ethological studies of natural behavior. However, at least in the case of familiar domestic animals, it also draws on the accumulated experience of those who have worked closely with the animals.\n\nThe relationship between humans and animals has long been of interest to anthropologists as one pathway to an understanding the evolution of human behavior. Similarities between the behavior of humans and animals have sometimes been used in an attempt to understand the evolutionary significance of particular behaviors. Differences in the treatment of animals have been said to reflect a society's understanding of human nature and the place of humans and animals in the scheme of things. Domestication has been of particular interest. For example, it has been argued that, as animals became domesticated, humans treated them as property and began to see them as inferior or fundamentally different from humans.\nIngold remarks that in all societies children have to learn to differentiate and separate themselves from others. In this process, strangers may be seen as \"not people,\" and like animals. Ingold quoted Sigmund Freud: \"Children show no trace of arrogance which urges adult civilized men to draw a hard-and-fast line between their own nature and that of all other animals. Children have no scruples over allowing animals to rank as their full equals.\" With maturity however, humans find it hard to accept that they themselves are animals, so they categorize, separating humans from animals, and animals into wild animals and tame animals, and tame animals into house pets and livestock. Such divisions can be seen as similar to categories of humans: who is part of a human community and someone who isn't, that is, the outsider.\n\n\"The New York Times\" ran an article that showed the psychological benefits of animals, more specifically of children with their pets. It's been proven that having a pet does in fact improve kids' social skills. In the article, Dr. Sue Doescher, a psychologist involved in the study, stated, \"It made the children more cooperative and sharing.\" It was also shown that these kids were more confident with themselves and able to be more empathic with other children.\n\nFurthermore, in an edition of \"Social Science and Medicine\" it was stated, \"A random survey of 339 residents from Perth, Western Australia were selected from three suburbs and interviewed by telephone. Pet ownership was found to be positively associated with some forms of social contact and interaction, and with perceptions of neighborhood friendliness. After adjustment for demographic variables, pet owners scored higher on social capital and civic engagement scales.\" Results like these let us know that owning a pet provides opportunities for neighborly interaction, among many other chances for socialization among people.\n\nNoted comparative psychologists, in this broad sense, include:\n\nMany of these were active in fields other than animal psychology; this is characteristic of comparative psychologists.\n\nFields of psychology and other disciplines that draw upon, or overlap with, comparative psychology include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1719952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1719952", "title": "Comparative research", "text": "Comparative research\n\nComparative research is a research methodology in the social sciences that aims to make comparisons across different countries or cultures. A major problem in comparative research is that the data sets in different countries may not use the same categories, or define categories differently (for example by using different definitions of poverty).\n\nAs Moutsios argues, cross-cultural and comparative research should be seen as part of the scientific spirit that arose in Greece in the 6th century and the overall appreciation of knowledge and learning that was characteristic of the 5th century. In other words, it is part of the emergence of \"episteme\" and \"philo-sophia\", as a love for knowledge that is independent from material benefits. \"Episteme\", as a form and activity in the field of \"logos\", marked the break of cognitive closure and advanced empirical inquiry, logical argumentation and the search for truth. And the high esteem for intellectual activity gave rise to a genuine curiosity about other cultures – which has lain thereafter at the heart of comparative inquiry.\n\nMoreover, behind the Greek comparative gaze also was the philosophical and political questioning which characterised the life of the democratic \"polis\". Philosophical inquiry, from the Milesians down to the Sophists, questioned the representations and the cognitive traditions of their own people; the inquiry of the traditions of other peoples was, as Herodotus’ \"Histories\" demonstrate, an activity associated with the ethos of philosophical critique that characterised democratic life in Greece. Similarly, questioning of the Greek laws and institutions and its related values and practices (e.g. \"isegoria\" and \"parrhesia\"), as part of Greek politics, is associated with the effort of the first historians to reflect on home institutions through researching those of others.\n\nAccording also to Karl Deutsch, we have been using this form of investigation for over 2,000 years. Comparing things is essential to basic scientific and philosophic inquiry, which has been done for a long time. Most authors are more conservative in their estimate of how long comparative research has been with us. It is largely an empty debate over the definition of the tradition with those questioning whether comparing things counts as comparative research.\n\nTextbooks on this form of study were beginning to appear by the 1880s, but its rise to extreme popularity began after World War II. There are numerous reasons that comparative research has come to take a place of honour in the toolbox of the social scientist. Globalization has been a major factor, increasing the desire and possibility for educational exchanges and intellectual curiosity about other cultures. Information technology has enabled greater production of quantitative data for comparison, and international communications technology has facilitated this information to be easily spread.\n\nComparative research, simply put, is the act of comparing two or more things with a view to discovering something about one or all of the things being compared. This technique often utilizes multiple disciplines in one study. When it comes to method, the majority agreement is that there is no methodology peculiar to comparative research. The multidisciplinary approach is good for the flexibility it offers, yet comparative programs do have a case to answer against the call that their research lacks a \"seamless whole.\" \n\nThere are certainly methods that are far more common than others in comparative studies, however. Quantitative analysis is much more frequently pursued than qualitative, and this is seen by the majority of comparative studies which use quantitative data. The general method of comparing things is the same for comparative research as it is in our everyday practice of comparison. Like cases are treated alike, and different cases are treated differently; the extent of difference determines how differently cases are to be treated. If one is able to sufficiently distinguish two carry the research conclusions will not be very helpful. \n\nSecondary analysis of quantitative data is relatively widespread in comparative research, undoubtedly in part because of the cost of obtaining primary data for such large things as a country's policy environment. This study is generally aggregate data analysis. Comparing large quantities of data (especially government sourced) is prevalent. A typical method of comparing welfare states is to take balance of their levels of spending on social welfare.\n\nIn line with how a lot of theorizing has gone in the last century, comparative research does not tend to investigate \"grand theories,\" such as Marxism. It instead occupies itself with middle-range theories that do not purport to describe our social system in its entirety, but a subset of it. A good example of this is the common research program that looks for differences between two or more social systems, then looks at these differences in relation to some other variable coexisting in those societies to see if it is related. The classic case of this is Esping-Andersen's research on social welfare systems. He noticed there was a difference in types of social welfare systems, and compared them based on their level of decommodification of social welfare goods. He found that he was able to class welfare states into three types, based on their level of decommodification. He further theorized from this that decommodification was based on a combination of class coalitions and mobilization, and regime legacy. Here, Esping-Andersen is using comparative research: he takes many western countries and compares their level of decommodification, then develops a theory of the divergence based on his findings.\n\nComparative research can take many forms. Two key factors are space and time. Spatially, cross-national comparisons are by far the most common, although comparisons within countries, contrasting different areas, cultures or governments also subsist and are very constructive, especially in a country like New Zealand, where policy often changes depending on which race it pertains to. Recurrent interregional studies include comparing similar or different countries or sets of countries, comparing one's own country to others or to the whole world.\n\nThe historical comparative research involves comparing different time-frames. The two main choices within this model are comparing two stages in time (either snapshots or time-series), or just comparing the same thing over time, to see if a policy's effects differ over a stretch of time.\n\nWhen it comes to subject matter of comparative inquiries, many contend there is none unique to it. This may indeed be true, but a brief perusal of comparative endeavours reveals there are some topics more recurrent than others. Determining whether socioeconomic or political factors are more important in explaining government action is a familiar theme. In general, however, the only thing that is certain in comparative research issues is the existence of differences to be analysed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10485277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10485277", "title": "Comparison microscope", "text": "Comparison microscope\n\nA comparison microscope is a device used to analyze side-by-side specimens. It consists of two microscopes connected by an optical bridge, which results in a split view window enabling two separate objects to be viewed simultaneously. This avoids the observer having to rely on memory when comparing two objects under a conventional microscope.\n\nIn the 1920s forensic ballistics was waiting at its inception. In 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the purpose by Calvin Goddard and his partner Phillip Gravelle used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.\n\n Philip O. Gravelle, a chemist, developed a comparison microscope for use in the identification of fired bullets and cartridge cases with the support and guidance of forensic ballistics pioneer Calvin Goddard. It was a significant advance in the science of firearms identification in forensic science. The firearm from which a bullet or cartridge case has been fired is identified by the comparison of the unique striae left on the bullet or cartridge case from the worn, machined metal of the barrel, breach block, extractor, or firing pin in the gun. It was Gravelle who mistrusted his memory. \"As long as he could inspect only one bullet at a time with his microscope, and had to keep the picture of it in his memory until he placed the comparison bullet under the microscope, scientific precision could not be attained. He therefore developed the comparison microscope and Goddard made it work.\" Calvin Goddard perfected the comparison microscope and subsequently popularized its use.Sir Sydney Smith also appreciated the idea, emphasizing its importance in forensic science and firearms identification. He took the comparison microscope to Scotland and introduced it to the European scientists for firearms identification and other forensic science needs.\n\nThe modern instrument has many optical, mechanical and electronic refinements, including fiber optic illumination, video capabilities, digital imaging, automatic exposure for conventional photography, etc. Despite this evolution, however, the basic tools and techniques have remained unchanged which are to determine whether or not ammunition components were fired by a single firearm based on unique and reproducible microscopic and class characteristics, or to reach a \"no conclusion\" result if insufficient marks are present.\n\nSince, ballistic identification has benefited from a long series of structural, scientific and technological advances, law enforcement agencies have established forensic laboratories and researchers have learned much more about how to match bullets and cartridge cases to the guns used to fire them, and comparison microscopes have become more sophisticated. By the end of the 1980s, ballistic identification was an established sub-specialty of forensic science.\n\nVisualization tools have also been developed to allows the firearms examiner to verify the degree of similarity between any two tool-marks in question. These are designed to simulate the operation of the comparison microscope but is capable of rendering a 2D view of the 3D surfaces in a manner similar to that of the conventional comparison microscope.\n\nThe prevalence of hand-gun related crime in the United States compared to most other developed countries provided the impetus for the development of the comparison microscope. As with most firearms, the fired ammunition components may acquire sufficient unique and reproducible microscopic marks to be identifiable as having been fired by a single firearm. Making these comparisons is correctly referred to as firearms identification, or sometimes called as \"ballistics\".\n\nHistorically, and currently, this forensic discipline ultimately requires a microscopic side-by-side comparison of fired bullets or cartridge cases, one pair at a time, by a forensic examiner to confirm or eliminate the two items as having been fired by a single firearm. For this purpose, the traditional tool of the firearms examiner has been what is often called the ballistics comparison microscope.\n\nThe interior of a gun's barrel is machined to have grooves (called rifling) that force the bullet to rotate as it travels along it. These grooves and their counterpart, called \"lands\" imprint groove and land impressions on the surface of the bullet. Together with these land and groove impressions, imperfections on the barrel surface are incidentally transferred to the bullet's surface. Because these imperfections are randomly generated, during manufacture or due to use, they are unique to each barrel. These patterns or imperfections, therefore, amount to a \"signature\" that each barrel imprints on each of the bullets fired through it. It is this \"signature\" on the bullets imparted due to the unique imperfections on the barrel that enable the validation and identification of bullets as having originated from a particular gun. Comparison microscope is used to analyze the matching of the microscopic impressions found on the surface of bullets and casings.\n\nWhen a firearm or a bullet or cartridge case are recovered from a crime scene, forensic examiners compare the ballistic fingerprint of the recovered bullet or cartridge case with the ballistic fingerprint of a second bullet or cartridge case test-fired from the recovered firearm. If the ballistic fingerprint on the test-fired bullet or cartridge case matches the ballistic fingerprint on the recovered bullet or cartridge case, investigators know that the recovered bullet or cartridge case was also fired from the recovered gun. A confirmed link between a specific firearm and a bullet or cartridge case recovered from a crime scene constitutes a valuable lead, because investigators may be able to connect the firearm to a person, who may then become either a suspect or a source of information helpful to the investigation.\n\nForensic innovator Calvin Goddard offered ballistic identification evidence in 1921 to help secure convictions of accused murderers and anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. On April 8, 1927, Sacco and Vanzetti were finally sentenced to death in the electric chair. A worldwide outcry arose and Governor Alvin T. Fuller finally agreed to postpone the executions and set up a committee to reconsider the case. By this time, firearms examination had improved considerably, and it was now known that a semi-automatic pistol could be traced by several different methods if both bullet and casing were recovered from the scene. Automatic pistols could now be traced by unique markings of the rifling on the bullet, by firing pin indentations on the fired primer, or by unique ejector and extractor marks on the casing. The committee appointed to review the case used the services of Calvin Goddard in 1927.\nGoddard used Philip Gravelle's newly invented comparison microscope and helixometer, a hollow, lighted magnifier probe used to inspect gun barrels, to make an examination of Sacco's .32 Colt, the bullet that killed Berardelli, and the spent casings recovered from the scene of the crime. In the presence of one of the defense experts, he fired a bullet from Sacco's gun into a wad of cotton and then put the ejected casing on the comparison microscope next to casings found at the scene. Then he looked at them carefully. The first two casings from the robbery did not match Sacco's gun, but the third one did. Even the defense expert agreed that the two cartridges had been fired from the same gun. The second original defense expert also concurred. The committee upheld the convictions.\nIn October 1961, ballistics tests were run with improved technology using Sacco's Colt automatic. The results confirmed that the bullet that killed the victim, Berardelli in 1920 came from the same .32 Colt Auto taken from the pistol in Sacco's possession. Subsequent investigations in 1983 also supported Goddard's findings.\n\nColonel Goddard was the key forensic expert in solving the 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre in which seven gangsters were killed by rival Al Capone mobsters dressed as Chicago police officers. It also led to the establishment of the United States' first independent criminological laboratory, which was located at Northwestern University and headed by Goddard. At this new lab, ballistics, fingerprinting, blood analysis and trace evidence were all brought under one roof.\nIn 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the ballistics comparison by his partner, Phillip Gravelle, Goddard used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. The case of Sacco and Vanzetti, which took place in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, is responsible for popularizing the use of the comparison microscope for bullet comparison. Forensic expert Calvin Goddard's conclusions were upheld when the evidence was re-examined in 1961.\n\n\n"}

The two franchises are dominant in this setting of storytelling and have offered various forms of media productions for decades that manage billions of dollars of intellectual property, providing employment and entertainment for billions of people around the world.\n\n\"Star Trek\" was introduced as in 1966 that lasted three years. \"\" commenced in 1973 (based directly on the original series) but lasted only two seasons with a combined total of 22 episodes. With the subsequent publication of novels, comics, animated series, toys and feature films, \"Star Trek\" grew into a popular media franchise.\n\n\"Star Wars\" was introduced as a feature film, \"A New Hope\" (1977). A novelization titled \"\", based on the original script of the film, was published about a year earlier. Upon the release of the first film, \"Star Wars\" quickly grew into a popular media franchise.\n\n\"Star Trek\" debuted in television. The franchise was conceived in the style of the television Western \"Wagon Train\" and the adventure stories of Horatio Hornblower, but evolved into an idealistic, utopian prospect of future human society. Inspired by \"Gulliver's Travels\", \"Star Trek\"s main focus is of space exploration and a galactic society consisting of multiple planets and species, where conflict occasionally occurs. \"Star Trek\" occurs in the relatively distant future, specifically the 22nd through 24th centuries, with occasional time travel and interdimensional travel. The Earth of the \"Star Trek\" universe shares most of its history with the real world.\n\n\"Star Wars\" debuted in film, despite the novel based on the film's original script having been published a year before the film itself. \"Star Wars\" mainly belongs to the space opera subgenre of science fiction that follows The Hero's Journey and was inspired by works such as Beowulf, King Arthur and other mythologies, world religions, as well as ancient and medieval history. It depicts a galactic society in constant conflict. Though there are periods of peace, these are only documented in novels, comics, video games, non-feature films and other spin-off media. \"Star Wars\" is set \"a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away\", although many characters are human, occasionally use Earth metaphors and exhibit human character traits.\n\nAlthough both \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\" populate various forms of media, not all types have been produced that are mutual to both franchises. \"Star Wars\" has not produced any live-action television series while \"Star Trek\" has produced seven live-action television series.\n\n\"Star Trek\" likewise has not produced any television films; whereas \"Star Wars\" has produced at least three live-action television films outside the \"Star Wars\" film saga. The \"Star Wars Holiday Special\", \"\" and \"\" are all live-action television spin-off films set in the \"Star Wars\" universe, but not considered part of the official \"Star Wars canon\".\n\n\nAside from both having the word \"star\" in their titles, the two franchises share many similarities and commonalities. Both franchises have their origins in the space western subgenre.\n\nBoth stories depict societies consisting of multiple planets and species. The main galaxy in \"Star Trek\" consists of various planets, each inhabited by different species, united into a single state, the United Federation of Planets. \"Star Wars\" depicts a galaxy that is mostly part of a single state known as the Old Republic, inhabited by humans and countless other species, which later became the Galactic Empire and was again later reformed into a new society called the New Republic after a series of wars.\n\nBoth franchises promote philosophical and political messages.\n\nThe primary philosophies of \"Star Trek\" convey the morals of exploration and interference and how to properly confront and ethically resolve a new situation. Creator Gene Roddenberry was inspired by morality tales such as \"Gulliver's Travels\".\n\nThe primary philosophical messages of \"Star Wars\" are the ethics of good against evil and how to distinguish them from one another. \"Star Wars\" preaches against totalitarian systems and favors societies that offer equality. In an interview on the \"Star Wars\" 20th Anniversary UK Programme aired in 1997 referring to the mythology of the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, Patrick Stewart stated \"A belief in one's own powers; especially one's own powers to do good because the underlying morality of \"Star Wars\" is a very very positive one.\"\n\nThere have been actors from both franchises who have appeared on common television series such as \"The Outer Limits\" and \"Seaquest\".\n\nBoth franchises also derive significantly from history and ancient mythology, including Greco-Roman mythology. Many planets and alien species in \"Star Trek\", for instance, are named after ancient Roman deities. Several episodes from various \"Star Trek\" television series, such as \"Who Mourns for Adonais\", are directly based on ancient Greek-Roman themes and settings. The series also make references to Ancient Babylon and its mythic folklore. The Klingons and their warrior culture are a representation of the 12th-century Mongols.\n\nMuch of \"Star Wars\" story plots and character developments are based on ancient history, including classical Greece and Rome, such as the fall of the Old Republic in \"Star Wars\", followed by the rise of the Galactic Empire, which parallels the fall of the ancient Roman Republic followed by the rise of the Roman Empire.\n\nA 1983 documentary on the making of \"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi\" was hosted by Leonard Nimoy, who also made mention of Lucas's original plan to do two other trilogies preceding and proceeding the original trilogy.\n\nJ. J. Abrams, director and producer of \"Star Trek\" (2009) and \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013) and producer of \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016), directed and produced \"\" (2015). \"Star Trek\" (2009) and \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" (2015) are each the first entries in expected trilogies. These films received favorable critical and commercial response and revived interest for both franchises. In addition to Abrams, actors such as Simon Pegg starred in both series.\n\n\"\" (2002) was poorly received and \"\" (2005) had capped off the prequel trilogy, which overall had a mixed to positive reception.\n\nThe newer films of the two franchises filmed major scenes in the United Arab Emirates. The desert scenes on the planet Jakku in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" (2015) were filmed in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, while scenes for cities in the film \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016) were filmed in the Emirate of Dubai.\n\nThe two franchises now offer almost all forms of media ranging from novels, television series, comic books, toys for younger audience, magazines, themed merchandise, board games and video games, as well as fan works. These include canonical and non-canonical works, including works made both by series producers and fans jointly.\n\nDespite the difference in the numbers of films, the profit made by the \"Star Wars\" film series exceed the profit of the \"Star Trek\" film series by almost five times, while the entire franchise outgrosses the other by four times. It is difficult to accurately judge the total worth of each franchise as television series, memorabilia and video games must be taken into account.\n\nScience fiction writer David Brin criticized \"Star Wars\" at the time of the release of \"The Phantom Menace\", arguing that while the \"Star Wars\" movies provide special effects and action/adventure, audiences are not encouraged to engage with their overriding themes. Among his issues with \"Star Wars\" and George Lucas, whom he accused of \"having an agenda\", is that the \"Star Wars\" galaxy is too \"elitist\", with arbitrary rulers on both the evil and good sides, replacing one another without any involvement of the population. He criticizes both sides of the Galactic Civil War as part of the \"same genetically superior royal family\". He finds the \"Star Wars\" universe flawed with additional forms of absolutism, such as justified emotions leading a good person to evil - for example citing the idea that Luke Skywalker killing Palpatine would somehow turn him to the dark side, despite the act potentially saving millions of lives.\n\nAmong the many other flaws he sees with \"Star Wars\" is that Anakin Skywalker becomes a hero in the ending of \"Return of the Jedi\" simply because he saved his son's life, while the atrocities he committed during his time in power go largely ignored. In contrast, he argues that, despite its flaws, \"Star Trek\" is \"democratic\" and follows genuine issues and strong questioning.\n\nWilliam Shatner argues that \"Star Trek\" is superior to \"Star Wars\". According to him, \"\"Star Trek\" had relationships and conflict among the relationships and stories that involved humanity and philosophical questions.\" Shatner believes that \"Star Wars\" was only better than \"Star Trek\" in terms of special effects, and that once J.J. Abrams became involved, \"Star Trek\" was able to \"supersede \"Star Wars\" on every level\".\n\nTim Russ, who played Tuvok on \"\", claims that it is difficult to find common enough elements to be able to compare the two. Among those common elements are their similar settings of unique characters and technologies. He echoed Shatner that \"Star Trek\" reflects common human issues, the morals of exploration and considers ethical questions. \"Star Wars\" in his view is a classic medieval tale dressed up as action-adventure, and that embraces the Eastern philosophy of inner-strength. Russ concludes that despite both their success and popularity, \"Star Trek\" comes out as the better of the two, as it is set in \"our\" galaxy and therefore people can relate better to it, whereas \"Star Wars\" takes place in another galaxy. He acknowledged that he could be biased.\n\nJeremy Bulloch is best known for his role as Boba Fett in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. He is a huge fan of \"Star Trek: The Original Series\". He argued that while both franchises are popular, \"Star Wars\" comes out as the superior, for its soundtracks and special effects.\n\nContrasting the focus of the two franchises, contributor J.C. Herzthe of \"The New York Times\" argued, \"\"Trek\" fandom revolves around technology because the \"Star Trek\" universe was founded on ham-fisted dialogue and \"Gong Show\"-caliber acting. But the fictional science has always been brilliant. The science in \"Star Wars\" is nonsense, and everyone knows it. But no one cares because \"Star Wars\" isn't about science. It's epic drama. It's about those incredibly well-developed characters and the moral decisions they face. People don't get into debates about how the second Death Star works. They get into debates about the ethics of blowing it up.\"\n\nJohn Wenzel of \"The Denver Post\" highlighted two differences in approach, noting the \"swashbuckling\" and \"gunslinger\" style of \"Star Wars\" compared with \"Star Trek\"s \"broader themes of utopian living, justice and identity\" and that the spiritual aspect of \"Star Wars\" contrasts with the balance of emotion and logic seen in \"Star Trek\".\n\nBillionaire Peter Thiel told Dowd \"I'm a capitalist. \"Star Wars\" is the capitalist show. \"Star Trek\" is the communist one\". He further stated \"There is no money in \"Star Trek\" because you just have the transporter machine that can make anything you need. The whole plot of \"Star Wars\" starts with Han Solo having this debt that he owes and so the plot in \"Star Wars\" is driven by money.\"\n\nArchived footage in \"Trek Nation\" showed Gene Roddenberry saying, \"I like \"Star Wars\". It was young King Arthur growing up, slaying the evil emperor finally. There's nothing wrong with that kind of entertainment - everything doesn't have to create a philosophy for you - for your whole life. You can also have fun.\"\n\nThe two franchises have a \"symbiotic relationship\" stated Shatner, who credits \"Star Wars\" for launching the \"Star Trek\" films. He repeated this sentiment at a 2016 \"Star Trek\" fan convention in Las Vegas by stating \"\"Star Wars\" created \"Star Trek\"\". He clarified this statement by explaining that at the time of the release of the first \"Star Wars\" film (\"A New Hope\"), Paramount, then under new management, was struggling to come up with something that could compete with it. A \"Star Trek\" relaunch was the choice. Since then, public interest has returned to \"Star Trek\". \"It was \"Star Wars\" that thrust \"Star Trek\" into the people of Paramount's consciousness\" Shatner stated.\n\nThe documentary \"Trek Nation\" features interviews where both Lucas and Roddenberry praise each other's respective franchises, with the former stating that \"Star Trek\" was an influence while writing the original screenplay for \"Star Wars\". He explained that while both franchises were so \"far out\", \"Star Trek\" produced a fanbase that \"softened up the entertainment arena\" so that \"Star Wars\" could \"come along and stand on its shoulders.\" This is also acknowledged by Shatner, who went as far as to call \"Star Wars\" a \"derivative\" of \"Star Trek\".\n\nA few references to \"Star Wars\" have been inserted into \"Star Trek\" films. For fleeting moments, one can see ships and droids from \"Star Wars\" in both \"Star Trek\" (2009) and \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013). Some \"Star Trek\" films and television episodes used the \"Star Wars\" animation shop, Industrial Light & Magic, for their special effects.\n\nWhen Roddenberry was honored at a \"Star Trek\" convention late in life, a congratulatory letter from Lucas was presented by an actor dressed as Darth Vader. A few years earlier, Roddenberry had contributed an entry in honor of \"Star Wars\" and Lucas at a convention honoring the latter.\n\nWilliam Shatner was a presenter at Lucas' American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony in 2007 and did a comical stage performance honoring Lucas.\n\nAt a live concert, Shatner dressed as an imperial stormtrooper singing \"Girl Crush\" alongside Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley.\n\nIn 2011, Shatner and Carrie Fisher posted a series of humorous YouTube videos satirizing each other's franchises.\n\nIn a 2016 interview, Shatner commented that Captain Kirk and Princess Leia eloping and running off into the sunset would be the \"perfect union\" between \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\".\n\nShatner has also posted a number of humorous tweets on his Twitter account mocking \"Star Wars\". Amongst them were commemorating the 35th anniversary of the poorly received \"Star Wars Holiday Special\". It was then that \"Star Wars\" actor Peter Mayhew posted a \"retaliation\" tweet congratulating Shatner for the directing of \"\", another poorly received film.\n\nBoth franchises are set to grow throughout the next decade.\n\n\"Star Trek\" was rebooted with a series of feature films starting with the \"Star Trek\" reboot (2009), which was followed by \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013) and \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016) and a number of sequels are set to follow. A new television series based in the original timeline, subtitled \"\", serving as a prequel to the original series, debuted on CBS All Access, an online streaming platform, in 2017.\n\n\"Star Wars\" picked up from where \"Return of the Jedi\" left off, with \"\" the first in the new trilogy, and \"\" following two years later. Additionally, more spin-off media is also underway after the debut of \"Star Wars Rebels\", a television series set in between the \"Star Wars\" prequels and the original trilogy, and an anthology of stand-alone \"Star Wars\" films, starting with \"Rogue One\", which was released in December 2016, and \"\" following in May 2018.\n\nAside from official works by the producers of \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\", many fan films and webisodes set in the two universes of the franchises are also constantly produced and posted on the Internet by fans, but are not officially considered canon in relation to either franchise.\n\n"}

But while Scott and his four companions died on the return journey, Amundsen's party managed to reach the geographic south pole first and subsequently return to their base camp at Framheim without loss of life, suggesting that they were better prepared for the expedition. The contrasting fates of the two teams seeking the same prize at the same time invites comparison.\n\nThe outcomes of the two expeditions were as follows.\n\nHistorically, several factors have been discussed and many contributing factors claimed, including:\n\nSullivan states that it was the last factor that probably was decisive. he states \"Man is a poor beast of burden, as was shown in the terrible experience of Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson in their thrust to the south of 1902–3. However, Scott relied chiefly on man-hauling in 1911–12 because ponies could not ascend the glacier midway to the Pole. The Norwegians correctly estimated that dog teams could go all the way. Furthermore, they used a simple plan, based on their native skill with skis and on dog-driving methods that were tried and true. In a similar fashion to the way the moon was reached by expending a succession of rocket stages and then casting each aside; the Norwegians used the same strategy, sacrificing the weaker animals along the journey to feed the other animals and the men themselves.\"\n\nScott and his financial backers saw the expedition as having a scientific basis, while also wishing to reach the pole. However, it was recognised by all involved that the South Pole was the primary objective (\"The Southern Journey involves the most important object of the Expedition\" – Scott), and had priority in terms of resources, such as the best ponies and all the dogs and motor sledges as well as involvement of the vast majority of the expedition personnel. Scott and his team knew the expedition would be judged on his attainment of the pole (\"The ... public will gauge the result of the scientific work of the expedition largely in accordance with the success or failure of the main object\" – Scott). He was prepared to make a second attempt the following year (1912–13) if this attempt failed and had Indian Army mules and additional dogs delivered in anticipation. In fact the mules were used by the team that discovered the dead bodies of Scott, Henry Robertson Bowers, and Edward Adrian Wilson in November 1912, but proved even less useful than the ponies, according to Cherry-Garrard.\n\nAmundsen's expedition was planned to reach the South Pole. This was a plan he conceived in 1909. Amundsen's expedition did conduct geographical work under Kristian Prestrud who conducted an expedition to King Edward VII Land while Amundsen was undertaking his attempt at the pole.\n\nAmundsen camped on the Ross Ice Shelf at the Bay of Whales which is 60 miles (96 km) closer to the pole than Scott's camp (which was 350 miles west of Amundsen). Amundsen had deduced that, as the Trans-Antarctic Mountains ran northwest to southeast then if he were to meet a mountain range on his route then the time spent at the high altitude of the Antarctic plateau would be less than Scott's.\nScott's base was at Cape Evans on Ross Island, with access to the Trans-Antarctic mountain range to the west, and was a better base for geological exploration. He had based his previous expedition in the same area. However, he knew it to be poor as a route to the pole as he had to start before sea ice melted and had suffered delay in returning while waiting for the sea ice to freeze. They also had to make detours around Ross Island and its known crevassed areas which meant a longer journey. The crossing of the Ross Ice Shelf was an onerous task for the ponies. Scott had advanced considerable stores across the ice shelf the year before to allow the ponies to carry lighter loads over the early passage across the ice. Even so, he had to delay the departure of the ponies until 1 November rather than 24 October when the dogs and motor sledges set off.\nConsequently, the Motor Party spent 6 days at the Mount Hooper Depot waiting for Scott to arrive.\n\nThe major comparison between Scott and Amundsen has focused on the choice of draft transport —dog versus pony/man-hauling. In fact Scott took dogs, ponies and three \"motor sledges\". Scott spent nearly seven times the amount of money on his motor sledges than on the dogs and horses combined. They were therefore a vital part of the expedition. Unfortunately, Scott decided to leave behind the engineer, Lieutenant Commander Reginald William Skelton who had created and trialled the motor sledges. This was due to the selection of Lieutenant E.R.G.R. \"Teddy\" Evans as the expedition's second in command. As Evans was junior in rank to Skelton, he insisted that Skelton could not come on the expedition. Scott agreed to this request and Skelton's experience and knowledge was lost. One of the original three motor sledges was a failure even before the expedition set out; the heavy sledge was lost through thin ice on unloading it from the ship. The two remaining motor sledges failed relatively early in the main expedition because of repeated faults. Skelton's experience might have been valuable in overcoming the failures.\n\nScott had used dogs on his first (Discovery) expedition and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow with the use of dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them. As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down. Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not agree with them and soon they began to deteriorate. The whole team of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds.\n\nScott's opinion was reinforced by Shackleton's experience on his Nimrod expedition that got to within of the pole. Shackleton used ponies. Scott planned to use ponies only to the base of the Beardmore Glacier (one-quarter of the total journey) and man-haul the rest of the journey. Scott's team had developed snow shoes for his ponies, and trials showed they could significantly increase daily progress. However, Lawrence Oates, whom Scott had made responsible for the ponies, was reluctant to use the snow shoes and Scott failed to insist on their use.\n\nThere was plenty of evidence that dogs could succeed in the achievements of William Speirs Bruce in his Arctic, Antarctic, and Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, Amundsen in the \"Gjøa\" North West passage expedition, Fridtjof Nansen's crossing of Greenland, Robert Peary's three attempts at the North Pole, Eivind Astrup's work supporting Peary, Frederick Cook's discredited North Pole expedition, and Otto Sverdrup's explorations of Ellesmere Island. Moreover, Scott ignored the direct advice he received (while attending trials of the motor sledges in Norway) from Nansen, the most famous explorer of the day, who told Scott to take \"dogs, dogs and more dogs\".\n\nAt the time of the events, the expert view in England had been that dogs were of dubious value as a means of Antarctic transport. Broadly speaking, Scott saw two ways in which dogs may be used—they may be taken with the idea of bringing them all back safe and sound, or they may be treated as pawns in the game, from which the best value is to be got regardless of their lives. He stated that if, and only if, the comparison was made with a dog sledge journey which aimed to preserve the dogs' lives, 'I am inclined to state my belief that in the polar regions properly organised parties of men will perform as extended journeys as teams of dogs.' On the other hand, if the lives of the dogs were to be sacrificed, then 'the dog-team is invested with a capacity for work which is beyond the emulation of men. To appreciate this is a matter of simple arithmetic'. But efficiency notwithstanding, he expressed \"reluctance\" to use dogs in this way: \"One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality, which have frequently such endearing qualities, and which very possibly one has learnt to regard as friends and companions.\"\n\nAmundsen, by contrast, took an entirely utilitarian approach. Amundsen planned from the start to have weaker animals killed to feed the other animals and the men themselves. He expressed the opinion that it was less cruel to feed and work dogs correctly before shooting them, than it would be to starve and overwork them to the point of collapse. Amundsen and his team had similar affection for their dogs as those expressed above by the English, but they \"also had agreed to shrink from nothing in order to achieve our goal\". The British thought such a procedure was distasteful, though they were willing to eat their ponies.\n\nAmundsen had used the opportunity of learning from the Inuit while on his \"Gjøa\" North West passage expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To make the most of the dogs he paced them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey, and his team spent up to 16 hours a day resting. His dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the Antarctic while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.\n\nWhat Scott did not realise is a sledge dog, if it is to do the same work as a man, will require the same amount of food. Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given insufficient food they become difficult to handle. The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility. Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how to feed them and not overwork them.\n\nScott took the Norwegian pilot and skier Tryggve Gran to the Antarctic on the recommendation of Nansen to train his expedition to ski, but although a few of his party began to learn, he made no arrangements for compulsory training for the full party. Gran (possibly because he was Norwegian) was not included in the South Pole party, which could have made a difference. Gran was, one year later, the first to locate the deceased Scott and his remaining companions in their tent just some 18 km (11 miles) short of One Ton depot, that might have saved their lives had they reached it.\n\nScott would subsequently complain in his diary, while well into his journey and therefore too late to take any corrective action and after over 10 years since the Discovery expedition, that \"Skis are the thing, and here are my tiresome fellow countrymen too prejudiced to have prepared themselves for the event\".\n\nAmundsen on his side recruited a team of well experienced skiers, all Norwegians who had skied from an early age. He also recruited a champion skier, Olav Bjaaland, as the front runner. The Amundsen party gained weight on their return travel from the South Pole.\n\nScott and Shackleton's experience in 1903 and 1907 gave them first-hand experience of average conditions in Antarctica. Simpson, Scott's meteorologist 1910–1912, charted the weather during their expedition, often taking two readings a day. On their return to the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's group experienced prolonged low temperatures from 27 February until 10 March which have only been matched once in 15 years of current records. The exceptional severity of the weather meant they failed to make the daily distances they needed to get to the next depot. This was a serious position as they were short of fuel and food. When Scott, Wilson, and Bowers died (Petty Officer Edgar Evans and Lawrence Oates had died earlier during the return from the South Pole) they were short of One-Ton Depot, which was from Corner Camp, where they would have been safe.\n\nOn the other hand, Cherry-Garrard had travelled nearly in the same area, during the same time period and same temperatures, using a dog team. Scott also blamed \"a prolonged blizzard\". But while there is evidence to support the low temperatures, there is only evidence for a \"normal\" two- to four-day blizzard, and not the ten days that Scott claims.\n\nDuring depot laying in February 1911, Roald Amundsen had his first (and last) of his route marked like a Norwegian ski course using marker flags initially every eight miles. He added to this by using food containers painted black, resulting in a marker every mile. From 82 degrees on, Amundsen built a cairn every three miles with a note inside recording the cairn's position, the distance to the next depot, and direction to the next cairn. In order not to miss a depot considering the snow and great distances, Amundsen took precautions. Each depot laid out up to 85 degrees (laid out every degree of latitude) had a line of bamboo flags laid out transversely every half-mile for five miles on either side of the depot, ensuring that the returning party could locate the designated depot.\n\nScott relied on depots much less frequently laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes were marked by the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots. It is also clear that Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they would have been able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.\n\nBy the time they arrived at the pole, the health of Scott's team had significantly deteriorated, whereas Amundsen's team actually gained weight during the expedition. While Scott's team managed to maintain the scheduled pace for most of the return leg, and hence was virtually always on full rations, their condition continued to worsen rapidly. (The only delay occurred when they were held for four days by a blizzard, and had to open their summit rations early as a consequence.)\n\nApsley Cherry-Garrard in his analysis of the expedition estimated that even under optimistic assumptions the summit rations contained only a little more than half the calories actually required for the man-hauling of sledges. A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the BBC, confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members. The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.\n\nScott's calculations for the supply requirements were based on a number of expeditions, both by members of his team (e.g., Wilson's trip with Cherry-Garrard and Bowers to the Emperor penguin colony which had each man on a different type of experimental ration), and by Shackleton. Apparently, Scott didn't take the strain of prolonged man-hauling at high altitudes sufficiently into account.\n\nSince the rations contained no B and C vitamins, the only source of these vitamins during the trek was from the slaughter of ponies or dogs. This made the men progressively malnourished, manifested most clearly in the form of scurvy.\n\nScott also had to fight with a shortage of fuel due to leakage from stored fuel cans which used leather washers. This was a phenomenon that had been noticed previously by other expeditions, but Scott took no measures to prevent it. Amundsen, in contrast, had learned the lesson and had his fuel cans soldered closed. A fuel depot he left on Betty's Knoll was found 50 years later still full.\n\nDehydration may also have been a factor. Amundsen's team had plenty of fuel due to better planning and soldered fuel cans. Scott had a shortage of fuel and was unable to melt as much water as Amundsen. At the same time Scott's team were more physically active in man-hauling the sledges.\n\nIt has been said (by the present-day explorer Ranulph Fiennes amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.\n\nAmundsen's team did initially have problems with their boots. However, the depot-laying trips of January and February 1911 and an abortive departure to the South Pole on 8 September 1911 allowed changes to be made before it was too late.\n\nScott's team suffered regularly from snow blindness and sometimes this affected over half the team at any one time. By contrast, there was no recorded case of snow blindness during the whole of Amundsen's expedition. On the return journey, Amundsen's team rested during the \"day\" (when the sun was in front of them) and travelled during the \"night\" (when the sun was behind them) to minimise the effects of snow blindness.\n\nIn 1921, 'Teddy' Evans wrote in his book \"South with Scott\" that Scott had left the following written orders at Cape Evans.\n\nHe did however place a lesser importance upon this journey than that of replenishing the food rations at One Ton Depot.\n\nHe continued his instructions in the next paragraph \"You will of course understand that whilst the object of your third journey is important, that of the second is vital. At all hazards three X.S. units of provision must be got to One Ton Camp by the date named (19th January), and if the dogs are unable to perform this task, a man party must be organised.\" with that qualification he closed his notes regarding his instructions for the dogs.\n\nExpedition member Apsley Cherry-Garrard did not mention Scott's order in his 1922 book \"The Worst Journey in the World\". However, in the 1948 preface to his book, he discusses Scott's order. Cherry-Garrard writes that he and Edward Atkinson reached Cape Evans on 28 January. Scott had estimated Atkinson would reach camp by 13 January. Atkinson, now the senior officer discovered that the dog handler Cecil Meares had resigned from the expedition and that neither Meares nor anyone else had resupplied dog food to the depots. Cherry-Garrard also wrote \"In my opinion he [Atkinson] would not have been fit to take out the dogs in the first week of February\".\n\nOn 13 February, Atkinson set off on the first lap southwards to Hut Point with the dog assistant, Dimitri Gerov, and the dogs to avoid being cut off by disintegrating sea ice. Atkinson and Gerov were still at Hut Point when, on 19 February, Tom Crean arrived on foot from the Barrier and reported that Lt Edward Evans was lying seriously ill in a tent some to the south, and in urgent need of rescue. Atkinson decided that this mission was his priority, and set out with the dogs to bring Evans back. This was achieved; the party was back at Hut Point on 22 February.\n\nAtkinson sent a note back to the Cape Evans base camp requesting either the meteorologist Wright or Cherry-Garrard to take over the task of meeting Scott with the dogs. Chief meteorologist Simpson was unwilling to release Wright from his scientific work, and Atkinson therefore selected Apsley Cherry-Garrard. It was still not in Atkinson's mind that Cherry-Garrard's was a relief mission, and according to Cherry-Garrard's account, told him to \"use his judgement\" as to what to do in the event of not meeting the polar party by One Ton, and that Scott's orders were that the dogs must not be risked. Cherry-Garrard left with Gerov and the dogs on 26 February, carrying extra rations for the polar party to be added to the depot and 24 days' of dog food. They arrived at One Ton Depot on 4 March and did not proceed further south. Instead, he and Gerov, after waiting there for Scott for several days, apparently mostly in blizzard conditions (although no blizzard was recorded by Scott some 100 miles further south until 10 March), they returned to Hut Point on 16 March, in poor physical condition and without news of the polar party.\n\nOn the return journey from the pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams three days ahead of schedule, around 27 February 1912. Scott's diary for that day notes \"We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt.\" By 10 March it became clear that the dog teams were not coming: \"The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [the dog-driver] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble.\"\n\nAround 25 March, awaiting death in his tent at latitude 79.30°S, Scott speculated, in a farewell letter to his expedition treasurer Sir Edgar Speyer, that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing \"We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support.\" (Farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, cited from Karen May 2012.)\n\n"}
{"id": "1338683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1338683", "title": "Corecursion", "text": "Corecursion\n\nIn computer science, corecursion is a type of operation that is dual to recursion. Whereas recursion works analytically, starting on data further from a base case and breaking it down into smaller data and repeating until one reaches a base case, corecursion works synthetically, starting from a base case and building it up, iteratively producing data further removed from a base case. Put simply, corecursive algorithms use the data that they themselves produce, bit by bit, as they become available, and needed, to produce further bits of data. A similar but distinct concept is \"generative recursion\" which may lack a definite \"direction\" inherent in corecursion and recursion.\n\nWhere recursion allows programs to operate on arbitrarily complex data, so long as they can be reduced to simple data (base cases), corecursion allows programs to produce arbitrarily complex and potentially infinite data structures, such as streams, so long as it can be produced from simple data (base cases) in a sequence of \"finite\" steps. Where recursion may not terminate, never reaching a base state, corecursion starts from a base state, and thus produces subsequent steps deterministically, though it may proceed indefinitely (and thus not terminate under strict evaluation), or it may consume more than it produces and thus become non-\"productive\". Many functions that are traditionally analyzed as recursive can alternatively, and arguably more naturally, be interpreted as corecursive functions that are terminated at a given stage, for example recurrence relations such as the factorial.\n\nCorecursion can produce both finite and infinite data structures as results, and may employ self-referential data structures. Corecursion is often used in conjunction with lazy evaluation, to produce only a finite subset of a potentially infinite structure (rather than trying to produce an entire infinite structure at once). Corecursion is a particularly important concept in functional programming, where corecursion and codata allow total languages to work with infinite data structures.\n\nCorecursion can be understood by contrast with recursion, which is more familiar. While corecursion is primarily of interest in functional programming, it can be illustrated using imperative programming, which is done below using the generator facility in Python. In these examples local variables are used, and assigned values imperatively (destructively), though these are not necessary in corecursion in pure functional programming. In pure functional programming, rather than assigning to local variables, these computed values form an invariable sequence, and prior values are accessed by self-reference (later values in the sequence reference earlier values in the sequence to be computed). The assignments simply express this in the imperative paradigm and explicitly specify where the computations happen, which serves to clarify the exposition.\n\nA classic example of recursion is computing the factorial, which is defined recursively by \"0! := 1\" and \"n! := n × (n - 1)!\".\n\nTo \"recursively\" compute its result on a given input, a recursive function calls (a copy of) \"itself\" with a different (\"smaller\" in some way) input and uses the result of this call to construct its result. The recursive call does the same, unless the \"base case\" has been reached. Thus a call stack develops in the process. For example, to compute \"fac(3)\", this recursively calls in turn \"fac(2)\", \"fac(1)\", \"fac(0)\" (\"winding up\" the stack), at which point recursion terminates with \"fac(0) = 1\", and then the stack unwinds in reverse order and the results are calculated on the way back along the call stack to the initial call frame \"fac(3)\" that uses the result of \"fac(2) = 2\" to calculate the final result as \"3 × 2 = 3 × fac(2) =: fac(3)\" and finally return \"fac(3) = 6\". In this example a function returns a single value.\n\nThis stack unwinding can be explicated, defining the factorial \"corecursively\", as an iterator, where one \"starts\" with the case of formula_1, then from this starting value constructs factorial values for increasing numbers \"1, 2, 3...\" as in the above recursive definition with \"time arrow\" reversed, as it were, by reading it \"backwards\" as The corecursive algorithm thus defined produces a \"stream\" of \"all\" factorials. This may be concretely implemented as a generator. Symbolically, noting that computing next factorial value requires keeping track of both \"n\" and \"f\" (a previous factorial value), this can be represented as:\nor in Haskell, \n\nmeaning, \"starting from formula_3, on each step the next values are calculated as formula_4\". This is mathematically equivalent and almost identical to the recursive definition, but the formula_5 emphasizes that the factorial values are being built \"up\", going forwards from the starting case, rather than being computed after first going backwards, \"down\" to the base case, with a formula_6 decrement. Note also that the direct output of the corecursive function does not simply contain the factorial formula_7 values, but also includes for each value the auxiliary data of its index \"n\" in the sequence, so that any one specific result can be selected among them all, as and when needed.\n\nNote the connection with denotational semantics, where the denotations of recursive programs is built up corecursively in this way.\n\nIn Python, a recursive factorial function can be defined as:\n\nThis could then be called for example as codice_1 to compute \"5!\".\n\nA corresponding corecursive generator can be defined as:\n\nThis generates an infinite stream of factorials in order; a finite portion of it can be produced by:\n\nThis could then be called to produce the factorials up to \"5!\" via:\n\nIf we're only interested in a certain factorial, just the last value can be taken, or we can fuse the production and the access into one function,\n\nAs can be readily seen here, this is practically equivalent (just by substituting codice_2 for the only codice_3 there) to the accumulator argument technique for tail recursion, unwound into an explicit loop. Thus it can be said that the concept of corecursion is an explication of the embodiment of iterative computation processes by recursive definitions, where applicable.\n\nIn the same way, the Fibonacci sequence can be represented as:\nNote that because the Fibonacci sequence is a recurrence relation of order 2, the corecursive relation must track two successive terms, with the formula_9 corresponding to shift forward by one step, and the formula_10 corresponding to computing the next term. This can then be implemented as follows (using parallel assignment):\n\nIn Haskell, \n\nTree traversal via a depth-first approach is a classic example of recursion. Dually, breadth-first traversal can very naturally be implemented via corecursion.\n\nWithout using recursion or corecursion specifically, one may traverse a tree by starting at the root node, placing its child nodes in a data structure, then iterating by removing node after node from the data structure while placing each removed node's children back into that data structure. If the data structure is a stack (LIFO), this yields depth-first traversal, and if the data structure is a queue (FIFO), this yields breadth-first traversal.\n\nUsing recursion, a (post-order) depth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node and recursively traversing each child subtree in turn (the subtree based at each child node) – the second child subtree does not start processing until the first child subtree is finished. Once a leaf node is reached or the children of a branch node have been exhausted, the node itself is visited (e.g., the value of the node itself is outputted). In this case, the call stack (of the recursive functions) acts as the stack that is iterated over.\n\nUsing corecursion, a breadth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node, outputting its value, then breadth-first traversing the subtrees – i.e., passing on the \"whole list\" of subtrees to the next step (not a single subtree, as in the recursive approach) – at the next step outputting the value of all of their root nodes, then passing on their child subtrees, etc. In this case the generator function, indeed the output sequence itself, acts as the queue. As in the factorial example (above), where the auxiliary information of the index (which step one was at, \"n\") was pushed forward, in addition to the actual output of \"n\"!, in this case the auxiliary information of the remaining subtrees is pushed forward, in addition to the actual output. Symbolically:\nmeaning that at each step, one outputs the list of values of root nodes, then proceeds to the child subtrees. Generating just the node values from this sequence simply requires discarding the auxiliary child tree data, then flattening the list of lists (values are initially grouped by level (depth); flattening (ungrouping) yields a flat linear list). In Haskell, \nThese can be compared as follows. The recursive traversal handles a \"leaf node\" (at the \"bottom\") as the base case (when there are no children, just output the value), and \"analyzes\" a tree into subtrees, traversing each in turn, eventually resulting in just leaf nodes – actual leaf nodes, and branch nodes whose children have already been dealt with (cut off \"below\"). By contrast, the corecursive traversal handles a \"root node\" (at the \"top\") as the base case (given a node, first output the value), treats a tree as being \"synthesized\" of a root node and its children, then produces as auxiliary output a list of subtrees at each step, which are then the input for the next step – the child nodes of the original root are the root nodes at the next step, as their parents have already been dealt with (cut off \"above\"). Note also that in the recursive traversal there is a distinction between leaf nodes and branch nodes, while in the corecursive traversal there is no distinction, as each node is treated as the root node of the subtree it defines.\n\nNotably, given an infinite tree, the corecursive breadth-first traversal will traverse all nodes, just as for a finite tree, while the recursive depth-first traversal will go down one branch and not traverse all nodes, and indeed if traversing post-order, as in this example (or in-order), it will visit no nodes at all, because it never reaches a leaf. This shows the usefulness of corecursion rather than recursion for dealing with infinite data structures.\n\nIn Python, this can be implemented as follows.\nThe usual post-order depth-first traversal can be defined as:\n\nThis can then be called by codice_4 to print the values of the nodes of the tree in post-order depth-first order.\n\nThe breadth-first corecursive generator can be defined as:\n\nThis can then be called to print the values of the nodes of the tree in breadth-first order:\n\nInitial data types can be defined as being the least fixpoint (up to isomorphism) of some type equation; the isomorphism is then given by an initial algebra. Dually, final (or terminal) data types can be defined as being the greatest fixpoint of a type equation; the isomorphism is then given by a final coalgebra.\n\nIf the domain of discourse is the category of sets and total functions, then final data types may contain infinite, non-wellfounded values, whereas initial types do not. On the other hand, if the domain of discourse is the category of complete partial orders and continuous functions, which corresponds roughly to the Haskell programming language, then final types coincide with initial types, and the corresponding final coalgebra and initial algebra form an isomorphism.\n\nCorecursion is then a technique for recursively defining functions whose range (codomain) is a final data type, dual to the way that ordinary recursion recursively defines functions whose domain is an initial data type.\n\nThe discussion below provides several examples in Haskell that distinguish corecursion. Roughly speaking, if one were to port these definitions to the category of sets, they would still be corecursive. This informal usage is consistent with existing textbooks about Haskell. Also note that the examples used in this article predate the attempts to define corecursion and explain what it is.\n\nThe rule for \"primitive corecursion\" on codata is the dual to that for primitive recursion on data. Instead of descending on the argument by pattern-matching on its constructors (that \"were called up before\", somewhere, so we receive a ready-made datum and get at its constituent sub-parts, i.e. \"fields\"), we ascend on the result by filling-in its \"destructors\" (or \"observers\", that \"will be called afterwards\", somewhere - so we're actually calling a constructor, creating another bit of the result to be observed later on). Thus corecursion \"creates\" (potentially infinite) codata, whereas ordinary recursion \"analyses\" (necessarily finite) data. Ordinary recursion might not be applicable to the codata because it might not terminate. Conversely, corecursion is not strictly necessary if the result type is data, because data must be finite.\n\nIn \"Programming with streams in Coq: a case study: the Sieve of Eratosthenes\" we find\n\nwhere primes \"are obtained by applying the primes operation to the stream (Enu 2)\". Following the above notation, the sequence of primes (with a throwaway 0 prefixed to it) and numbers streams being progressively sieved, can be represented as \nor in Haskell, \n\nThe authors discuss how the definition of codice_5 is not guaranteed always to be \"productive\", and could become stuck e.g. if called with codice_6 as the initial stream.\n\nHere is another example in Haskell. The following definition produces the list of Fibonacci numbers in linear time:\nThis infinite list depends on lazy evaluation; elements are computed on an as-needed basis, and only finite prefixes are ever explicitly represented in memory. This feature allows algorithms on parts of codata to terminate; such techniques are an important part of Haskell programming.\n\nThis can be done in Python as well:\nThe definition of codice_7 can be inlined, leading to this:\n\nThis example employs a self-referential \"data structure\". Ordinary recursion makes use of self-referential \"functions\", but does not accommodate self-referential data. However, this is not essential to the Fibonacci example. It can be rewritten as follows:\n\nThis employs only self-referential \"function\" to construct the result. If it were used with strict list constructor it would be an example of runaway recursion, but with non-strict list constructor this guarded recursion gradually produces an indefinitely defined list.\n\nCorecursion need not produce an infinite object; a corecursive queue is a particularly good example of this phenomenon. The following definition produces a breadth-first traversal of a binary tree in linear time:\n\nThis definition takes an initial tree and produces a list of subtrees. This list serves dual purpose as both the queue and the result ( produces its output notches after its input back-pointer, , along the ). It is finite if and only if the initial tree is finite. The length of the queue must be explicitly tracked in order to ensure termination; this can safely be elided if this definition is applied only to infinite trees. \n\nAnother particularly good example gives a solution to the problem of breadth-first labeling. The function codice_8 visits every node in a binary tree in a breadth first fashion, and replaces each label with an integer, each subsequent integer is bigger than the last by one. This solution employs a self-referential data structure, and the binary tree can be finite or infinite.\n\nAn apomorphism (such as an anamorphism, such as unfold) is a form of corecursion in the same way that a paramorphism (such as a catamorphism, such as fold) is a form of recursion.\n\nThe Coq proof assistant supports corecursion and coinduction using the CoFixpoint command.\n\nCorecursion, referred to as \"circular programming,\" dates at least to , who credits John Hughes and Philip Wadler; more general forms were developed in . The original motivations included producing more efficient algorithms (allowing 1 pass over data in some cases, instead of requiring multiple passes) and implementing classical data structures, such as doubly linked lists and queues, in functional languages.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7931", "title": "Dictionary", "text": "Dictionary\n\nA dictionary, sometimes known as a wordbook, is a collection of words in one or more specific languages, often arranged alphabetically (or by radical and stroke for ideographic languages), which may include information on definitions, usage, etymologies, pronunciations, translation, etc. or a book of words in one language with their equivalents in another, sometimes known as a lexicon. It is a lexicographical reference that shows inter-relationships among the data.\n\nA broad distinction is made between general and specialized dictionaries. Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, rather than a complete range of words in the language. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, although there is no consensus whether lexicology and terminology are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries are supposed to be semasiological, mapping word to definition, while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be onomasiological, first identifying concepts and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In practice, the two approaches are used for both types. There are other types of dictionaries that do not fit neatly into the above distinction, for instance bilingual (translation) dictionaries, dictionaries of synonyms (thesauri), and rhyming dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a general purpose monolingual dictionary.\n\nThere is also a contrast between \"prescriptive\" or \"descriptive\" dictionaries; the former reflect what is seen as correct use of the language while the latter reflect recorded actual use. Stylistic indications (e.g. \"informal\" or \"vulgar\") in many modern dictionaries are also considered by some to be less than objectively descriptive.\n\nAlthough the first recorded dictionaries date back to Sumerian times (these were bilingual dictionaries), the systematic study of dictionaries as objects of scientific interest themselves is a 20th-century enterprise, called lexicography, and largely initiated by Ladislav Zgusta. The birth of the new discipline was not without controversy, the practical dictionary-makers being sometimes accused by others of \"astonishing\" lack of method and critical-self reflection.\n\nThe oldest known dictionaries were Akkadian Empire cuneiform tablets with bilingual Sumerian–Akkadian wordlists, discovered in Ebla (modern Syria) and dated roughly 2300 BCE. The early 2nd millennium BCE \"Urra=hubullu\" glossary is the canonical Babylonian version of such bilingual Sumerian wordlists. A Chinese dictionary, the c. 3rd century BCE \"Erya\", was the earliest surviving monolingual dictionary; although some sources cite the c. 800 BCE Shizhoupian as a \"dictionary\", modern scholarship considers it a calligraphic compendium of Chinese characters from Zhou dynasty bronzes. Philitas of Cos (fl. 4th century BCE) wrote a pioneering vocabulary \"Disorderly Words\" (Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι, \"\") which explained the meanings of rare Homeric and other literary words, words from local dialects, and technical terms. Apollonius the Sophist (fl. 1st century CE) wrote the oldest surviving Homeric lexicon. The first Sanskrit dictionary, the Amarakośa, was written by Amara Sinha c. 4th century CE. Written in verse, it listed around 10,000 words. According to the \"Nihon Shoki\", the first Japanese dictionary was the long-lost 682 CE \"Niina\" glossary of Chinese characters. The oldest existing Japanese dictionary, the c. 835 CE \"Tenrei Banshō Meigi\", was also a glossary of written Chinese. In \"Frahang-i Pahlavig\", Aramaic heterograms are listed together with their translation in Middle Persian language and phonetic transcription in Pazand alphabet. A 9th-century CE Irish dictionary, Sanas Cormaic, contained etymologies and explanations of over 1,400 Irish words. In India around 1320, Amir Khusro compiled the Khaliq-e-bari which mainly dealt with Hindustani and Persian words.\nArabic dictionaries were compiled between the 8th and 14th centuries CE, organizing words in rhyme order (by the last syllable), by alphabetical order of the radicals, or according to the alphabetical order of the first letter (the system used in modern European language dictionaries). The modern system was mainly used in specialist dictionaries, such as those of terms from the Qur'an and hadith, while most general use dictionaries, such as the \"Lisan al-`Arab\" (13th century, still the best-known large-scale dictionary of Arabic) and \"al-Qamus al-Muhit\" (14th century) listed words in the alphabetical order of the radicals. The \"Qamus al-Muhit\" is the first handy dictionary in Arabic, which includes only words and their definitions, eliminating the supporting examples used in such dictionaries as the \"Lisan\" and the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\nIn medieval Europe, glossaries with equivalents for Latin words in vernacular or simpler Latin were in use (e.g. the Leiden Glossary). The \"Catholicon\" (1287) by Johannes Balbus, a large grammatical work with an alphabetical lexicon, was widely adopted. It served as the basis for several bilingual dictionaries and was one of the earliest books (in 1460) to be printed. In 1502 Ambrogio Calepino's \"Dictionarium\" was published, originally a monolingual Latin dictionary, which over the course of the 16th century was enlarged to become a multilingual glossary. In 1532 Robert Estienne published the \"Thesaurus linguae latinae\" and in 1572 his son Henri Estienne published the \"Thesaurus linguae graecae\", which served up to the 19th century as the basis of Greek lexicography. The first monolingual dictionary written in Europe was the Spanish, written by Sebastián Covarrubias' \"Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española\", published in 1611 in Madrid, Spain. In 1612 the first edition of the \"Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca\", for Italian, was published. It served as the model for similar works in French and English. In 1690 in Rotterdam was published, posthumously, the \"Dictionnaire Universel\" by Antoine Furetière for French. In 1694 appeared the first edition of the \"Dictionnaire de l'Académie française\". Between 1712 and 1721 was published the \"Vocabulario portughez e latino\" written by Raphael Bluteau. The Real Academia Española published the first edition of the \"Diccionario de la lengua española\" in 1780, but their \"Diccionario de Autoridades\", which included quotes taken from literary works, was published in 1726. The \"Totius Latinitatis lexicon\" by Egidio Forcellini was firstly published in 1777; it has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been published.\n\nThe first edition of \"A Greek-English Lexicon\" by Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott appeared in 1843; this work remained the basic dictionary of Greek until the end of the 20th century. And in 1858 was published the first volume of the Deutsches Wörterbuch by the Brothers Grimm; the work was completed in 1961. Between 1861 and 1874 was published the \"Dizionario della lingua italiana\" by Niccolò Tommaseo. Between 1862 and 1874 was published the six volumes of \"A magyar nyelv szótára\" (Dictionary of Hungarian Language) by Gergely Czuczor and János Fogarasi. Émile Littré published the Dictionnaire de la langue française between 1863 and 1872. In the same year 1863 appeared the first volume of the \"Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal\" which was completed in 1998. Also in 1863 Vladimir Ivanovich Dahl published the \"Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language\". The Duden dictionary dates back to 1880, and is currently the prescriptive source for the spelling of German. The decision to start work on the \"Svenska Akademiens ordbok\" was taken in 1787.\n\nThe earliest dictionaries in the English language were glossaries of French, Spanish or Latin words along with their definitions in English. The word \"dictionary\" was invented by an Englishman called John of Garland in 1220 — he had written a book \"Dictionarius\" to help with Latin \"diction\". An early non-alphabetical list of 8000 English words was the \"Elementarie\", created by Richard Mulcaster in 1582.\n\nThe first purely English alphabetical dictionary was \"A Table Alphabeticall\", written by English schoolteacher Robert Cawdrey in 1604. The only surviving copy is found at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. This dictionary, and the many imitators which followed it, was seen as unreliable and nowhere near definitive. Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield was still lamenting in 1754, 150 years after Cawdrey's publication, that it is \"a sort of disgrace to our nation, that hitherto we have had no… standard of our language; our dictionaries at present being more properly what our neighbors the Dutch and the Germans call theirs, word-books, than dictionaries in the superior sense of that title.\" \n\nIn 1616, John Bullokar described the history of the dictionary with his \"English Expositor\". \"Glossographia\" by Thomas Blount, published in 1656, contains more than 10,000 words along with their etymologies or histories. Edward Phillips wrote another dictionary in 1658, entitled \"The New World of English Words: Or a General Dictionary\" which boldly plagiarized Blount's work, and the two denounced each other. This created more interest in the dictionaries. John Wilkins' 1668 essay on philosophical language contains a list of 11,500 words with careful distinctions, compiled by William Lloyd. Elisha Coles published his \"English Dictionary\" in 1676.\n\nIt was not until Samuel Johnson's \"A Dictionary of the English Language\" (1755) that a more reliable English dictionary was produced. Many people today mistakenly believe that Johnson wrote the first English dictionary: a testimony to this legacy. By this stage, dictionaries had evolved to contain textual references for most words, and were arranged alphabetically, rather than by topic (a previously popular form of arrangement, which meant all animals would be grouped together, etc.). Johnson's masterwork could be judged as the first to bring all these elements together, creating the first \"modern\" dictionary.\n\nJohnson's dictionary remained the English-language standard for over 150 years, until the Oxford University Press began writing and releasing the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in short fascicles from 1884 onwards. It took nearly 50 years to complete this huge work, and they finally released the complete \"OED\" in twelve volumes in 1928. It remains the most comprehensive and trusted English language dictionary to this day, with revisions and updates added by a dedicated team every three months. One of the main contributors to this modern dictionary was an ex-army surgeon, William Chester Minor, a convicted murderer who was confined to an asylum for the criminally insane.\n\nIn 1806, American Noah Webster published his first dictionary, \"\". In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, \"An American Dictionary of the English Language;\" it took twenty-seven years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-six languages, including Old English (Anglo-Saxon), German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Arabic, and Sanskrit.\n\nWebster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, France, and at the University of Cambridge. His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. As a spelling reformer, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced American English spellings, replacing \"colour\" with \"color\", substituting \"wagon\" for \"waggon\", and printing \"center\" instead of \"centre\". He also added American words, like \"skunk\" and \"squash\", that did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of seventy, Webster published his dictionary in 1828; it sold 2500 copies. In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes.\n\nIn a general dictionary, each word may have multiple meanings. Some dictionaries include each separate meaning in the order of most common usage while others list definitions in historical order, with the oldest usage first.\n\nIn many languages, words can appear in many different forms, but only the undeclined or unconjugated form appears as the headword in most dictionaries. Dictionaries are most commonly found in the form of a book, but some newer dictionaries, like StarDict and the \"New Oxford American Dictionary\" are dictionary software running on PDAs or computers. There are also many online dictionaries accessible via the Internet.\n\nAccording to the \"Manual of Specialized Lexicographies\", a specialized dictionary, also referred to as a technical dictionary, is a dictionary that focuses upon a specific subject field. Following the description in \"The Bilingual LSP Dictionary\", lexicographers categorize specialized dictionaries into three types: A multi-field dictionary broadly covers several subject fields (e.g. a business dictionary), a single-field dictionary narrowly covers one particular subject field (e.g. law), and a sub-field dictionary covers a more specialized field (e.g. constitutional law). For example, the 23-language Inter-Active Terminology for Europe is a multi-field dictionary, the American National Biography is a single-field, and the African American National Biography Project is a sub-field dictionary. In terms of the coverage distinction between \"minimizing dictionaries\" and \"maximizing dictionaries\", multi-field dictionaries tend to minimize coverage across subject fields (for instance, \"Oxford Dictionary of World Religions\" and \"Yadgar Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms\") whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to maximize coverage within a limited subject field (\"The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology\").\n\nAnother variant is the glossary, an alphabetical list of defined terms in a specialized field, such as medicine (medical dictionary).\n\nThe simplest dictionary, a defining dictionary, provides a core glossary of the simplest meanings of the simplest concepts. From these, other concepts can be explained and defined, in particular for those who are first learning a language. In English, the commercial defining dictionaries typically include only one or two meanings of under 2000 words. With these, the rest of English, and even the 4000 most common English idioms and metaphors, can be defined.\n\nLexicographers apply two basic philosophies to the defining of words: \"prescriptive\" or \"descriptive\". Noah Webster, intent on forging a distinct identity for the American language, altered spellings and accentuated differences in meaning and pronunciation of some words. This is why American English now uses the spelling \"color\" while the rest of the English-speaking world prefers \"colour\". (Similarly, British English subsequently underwent a few spelling changes that did not affect American English; see further at American and British English spelling differences.)\n\nLarge 20th-century dictionaries such as the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (OED) and \"Webster's Third\" are descriptive, and attempt to describe the actual use of words. Most dictionaries of English now apply the descriptive method to a word's definition, and then, outside of the definition itself, and information alerting readers to attitudes which may influence their choices on words often considered vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or easily confused. \"Merriam-Webster\" is subtle, only adding italicized notations such as, \"sometimes offensive\" or \"stand\" (nonstandard). \"American Heritage\" goes further, discussing issues separately in numerous \"usage notes.\" \"Encarta\" provides similar notes, but is more prescriptive, offering warnings and admonitions against the use of certain words considered by many to be offensive or illiterate, such as, \"an offensive term for...\" or \"a taboo term meaning...\".\n\nBecause of the widespread use of dictionaries in schools, and their acceptance by many as language authorities, their treatment of the language does affect usage to some degree, with even the most descriptive dictionaries providing conservative continuity. In the long run, however, the meanings of words in English are primarily determined by usage, and the language is being changed and created every day. As Jorge Luis Borges says in the prologue to \"El otro, el mismo\": \"It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial repositories, put together well after the languages they define. The roots of language are irrational and of a magical nature.\"\n\nSometimes the same dictionary can be descriptive in some domains and prescriptive in others. For example, according to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, the \"Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary\" is \"at war with itself\": whereas its coverage (lexical items) and glosses (definitions) are descriptive and colloquial, its vocalization is prescriptive. This internal conflict results in absurd sentences such as \"hi taharóg otí kshetiré me asíti lamkhonít\" (she'll tear me apart when she sees what I've done to the car). Whereas \"hi taharóg otí\", literally 'she will kill me', is colloquial, me (a variant of ma 'what') is archaic, resulting in a combination that is unutterable in real life.\n\nA historical dictionary is a specific kind of descriptive dictionary which describes the development of words and senses over time, usually using citations to original source material to support its conclusions.\n\nIn contrast to traditional dictionaries, which are designed to be used by human beings, dictionaries for natural language processing (NLP) are built to be used by computer programs. The final user is a human being but the direct user is a program. Such a dictionary does not need to be able to be printed on paper. The structure of the content is not linear, ordered entry by entry but has the form of a complex network (see Diathesis alternation). Because most of these dictionaries are used to control machine translations or cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) the content is usually multilingual and usually of huge size. In order to allow formalized exchange and merging of dictionaries, an ISO standard called Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) has been defined and used among the industrial and academic community.\n\n\nIn many languages, such as the English language, the pronunciation of some words is not consistently apparent from their spelling. In these languages, dictionaries usually provide the pronunciation. For example, the definition for the word \"dictionary\" might be followed by the International Phonetic Alphabet spelling . American English dictionaries often use their ownpronunciation respelling systems with diacritics, for example \"dictionary\" is respelled as \"dĭk′shə-nĕr′ē\" in the American Heritage Dictionary. The IPA is more commonly used within the British Commonwealth countries. Yet others use their own pronunciation respelling systems without diacritics: for example, \"dictionary\" may be respelled as . Some online or electronic dictionaries provide audio recordings of words being spoken.\n\nHistories and descriptions of the dictionaries of other languages on Wikipedia include:\n\n\nThe age of the Internet brought online dictionaries to the desktop and, more recently, to the smart phone. David Skinner in 2013 noted that \"Among the top ten lookups on Merriam-Webster Online at this moment are 'holistic, pragmatic, caveat, esoteric' and 'bourgeois.' Teaching users about words they don’t already know has been, historically, an aim of lexicography, and modern dictionaries do this well.\"\nThere exist a number of websites which operate as online dictionaries, usually with a specialized focus. Some of them have exclusively user driven content, often consisting of neologisms. Some of the more notable examples include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46842976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46842976", "title": "Diels–Kranz numbering", "text": "Diels–Kranz numbering\n\nDiels–Kranz (DK) numbering is the standard system for referencing the works of the ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosophers, based on the collection of quotations from and reports of their work, \"Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker\" (The Fragments of the Pre-Socratics), by Hermann Alexander Diels. The \"Fragmente\" was first published in 1903, was later revised and expanded three times by Diels, and was finally revised in a fifth edition (1934–7) by Walther Kranz and again in a sixth edition (1952). In Diels-Kranz, each passage, or item, is assigned a number which is used to uniquely identify the ancient personality with which it is concerned, and the type of item given. Diels-Kranz is used in academia to cite pre-Socratic philosophers, and the system also encompasses Sophists and pre-Homeric poets such as Orpheus.\n\nStephanus pagination is the comparable system for referring to Plato, and Bekker numbering is the comparable system for referring to Aristotle.\n\nThe works of the pre-Socratics have not survived extant to the present day. Our knowledge of them exists only through references in the works of later philosophers (known as doxography) in the form of quotations and paraphrases. For example, our knowledge of Thales of Miletus comes largely from the works of Aristotle, who lived centuries after him. Another interesting example of such a source is Hippolytus of Rome, whose polemic \"Refutation of All Heresies\" is a source of many direct quotations of Heraclitus as well as of other philosophers, thereby perpetuating the work of those he was refuting.\n\nThese quotations, paraphrases and other references to pre-Socratic philosophers were collected by Diels and Kranz in their book, which became a standard text in modern pre-Socratic education and scholarship. Because of its influence, Diels-Kranz numbering became the standard way of referencing the material: in literature, conferences, and even in conversation.\n\nThe number corresponding to an item was made up of three parts:\n\n\nWhy, take the case of Thales, Theodorus. While he was studying the stars and looking upwards, he fell into a pit, and a neat, witty Thracian servant girl jeered at him, they say, because he was so eager to know the things in the sky that he could not see what was there before him at his very feet.\n\nThe above text has a DK number of 11A9, since it refers to Thales who is, as mentioned above, chapter 11's subject. The source is \"Theaetetus\" (one of Plato's dialogues), and gives an account of Thales' life, hence it is a \"testimonium\", represented by the letter \"A\". Finally, it is the ninth item in its chapter, giving it the overall number of DK 11A9.\n\nSometimes, the chapter (personality) number may simply be replaced by the name, which can be helpful in cases where the former is the same as the passage number, to avoid ambiguity. For example:\n\nThose who seek for gold dig up much earth and find a little.\n\nRather than \"22B22\" the above may also instead be referred to as \"Heraclitus B22\" as it is a direct transmission of the words of Heraclitus (thus, B) and is the 22nd item in the chapter about Heraclitus (whose chapter number is also 22) in the \"Fragmente\".\n\nThe following table gives the Diels-Kranz numbering of Pre-Socratic philosophers. Note that the numbering scheme presented is that of the fifth edition of \"Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker\", the first to be revised by Kranz. The fifth edition's numbering is the scheme which has since gained the most traction in modern Pre-Socratic scholarship, and it is the one used consistently throughout this article. It should not be confused with the numberings given in other versions, which changed frequently depending on the particular edition of the \"Fragmente\".\n\nMost entries (78) are concerned with a single, named individual, while the remaining minority of entries (12) have more complex context. Of these latter, eight (10, 19, 39, 46, 53-56) are each concerned with groups of named personalties, who typically have a clear relationship of some kind to justify their association in each entry. Two entries (58, 79) are devoted not to individuals, but to schools of thought (Pythagoreanism and Sophism), and the last two (89, 90) reproduce contemporaneous anonymous texts. Although \"the Seven Sages of Greece\" implies a clearly defined set of seven people, historical disagreement renders intractable the problem of exactly who they were, with multiple sources suggesting several different candidates. If one takes the Seven Sages as a group of seven and includes the later Iamblichus, Diels-Kranz encompasses 106 named personalities and two anonymous authors. The chapter on Sophism is concerned with the named sophists who take up most of the rest of the scheme, and \nper Freeman with regard to the chapter on Pythagoreanism, a catalogue due to Iamblichus lists 218 named men and 17 named women as Pythagoreans, along with other probable, anonymous adherents.\n\nIn several cases, the personalities listed are so obscure that they are merely mentioned by name in other sources, commonly with hints as to their geographical and philosophical associations, and without even surviving \"paraphrases\" of any of their ideas, or what they might have written. That is, these more obscure personalities survive in the historical record only as names cited by others, and so came to be included in Diels-Kranz for the sake of scholarly completeness.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1902180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1902180", "title": "Digital reference", "text": "Digital reference\n\nDigital reference (or virtual reference) is a service by which a library reference service is conducted online, and the reference transaction is a computer-mediated communication. It is the remote, NextNextcomputer-mediated delivery of reference information provided by library professionals to users who cannot access or do not want face-to-face communication. Virtual reference service is most often an extension of a library's existing reference service program. The word \"reference\" in this context refers to the task of providing assistance to library users in finding information, answering questions, and otherwise fulfilling users’ information needs. Reference work often but not always involves using reference works, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc. This form of reference work expands reference services from the physical reference desk to a \"virtual\" reference desk where the patron could be writing from home, work or a variety of other locations.\n\nThe terminology surrounding virtual reference services may involve multiple terms used for the same definition. The preferred term for remotely delivered, computer-mediated reference services is \"virtual reference\", with the secondary non-preferred term \"digital reference\" having gone out of use in recent years. \"Chat reference\" is often used interchangeably with virtual reference, although it represents only one aspect of virtual reference. Virtual reference includes the use of both synchronous (i.e., IM, videoconferencing) and asynchronous communication (i.e., texting and email). Here, \"synchronous virtual reference\" refers to any real-time computer-mediated communication between patron and information professional. Asynchronous virtual reference is all computer-mediated communication that is sent and received at different times.\n\nThe earliest digital reference services were launched in the mid-1980s, primarily by academic and medical libraries, and provided by e-mail. These early-adopter libraries launched digital reference services for two main reasons: to extend the hours that questions could be submitted to the reference desk, and to explore the potential of campus-wide networks, which at that time was a new technology.\n\nWith the advent of the graphical World Wide Web, libraries quickly adopted webforms for question submission. Since then, the percentage of questions submitted to services via webforms has outstripped the percentage submitted via email.\n\nIn the early- to mid-1990s, digital reference services began to appear that were not affiliated with any library. These digital reference services are often referred to as \"AskA\" services. Examples of AskA services are the Internet Public Library, Ask Dr. Math, and Ask Joan of Art.\n\nProviding remote-based services for patrons has been a steady practice of libraries over the years. For example, before the widespread use of chat software, reference questions were often answered via phone, fax, email and audio conferencing. Email is the oldest type of virtual reference service used by libraries. Library services in America and the UK are just now gaining visibility in their use of virtual reference services using chat software. However, a survey in America revealed that by 2001 over 200 libraries were using chat reference services. \nThe rapid global proliferation of information technology (IT) often leaves libraries at a disadvantage in terms of keeping their services current. However, libraries are always striving to understand their user demographics in order to provide the best possible services. Therefore, libraries continue to take notes from current cyberculture and are continually incorporating a diversified range of interactive technologies in their service repertoires. Virtual reference represents only one small part of a larger library mission to meet the needs of a new generation, sometimes referred to as the \"Google Generation\", of users who have grown up with the internet. For instance, virtual reference may be used in conjunction with embedded Web 2.0 (online social media such as Facebook, YouTube, blogs, del.icio.us, Flickr, etc.) applications in a library's suite of online services. As technological innovations continue, libraries will be watching to find new, more personalized ways of interacting with remote reference users.\n\nThe range of cost-per-transaction of reference interactions has been found to be large, due to the differences in librarian salaries and infrastructural costs required by reference interviews.\n\nWebforms are created for digital reference services in order to help the patron be more productive in asking their question. This document helps the librarian locate exactly what the patron is asking for. Creation of webforms requires design consideration. Because webforms substitute for the reference interview, receiving as much information as possible from the patron is a key function.\n\nAspects commonly found within webforms:\n\n\nSeveral applications exist for providing chat-based reference. Some of these applications are: QuestionPoint, OmniReference, Tutor.com, LibraryH3lp, AspiringKidz.com, and Vienova.com. These applications bear a resemblance to commercial help desk applications. These applications possess functionality such as: chat, co-browsing of webpages, webpage and document pushing, customization of pre-scripted messages, storage of chat transcripts, and statistical reporting.\n\nInstant messaging (IM) services are used by some libraries as a low-cost means of offering chat-based reference, since most IM services are free. Utilizing IM for reference services allows a patron to contact the library from any location via the internet. This service is like the traditional reference interview because it is a live interaction between the patron and the librarian. On the other side the reference interview is different because the conversation does not float away but instead is in print on the screen for the librarian to review if needed to better understand the patron. IM reference services may be for the use of in-house patrons as well as patrons unable to go to the library. If library computers support IM chat programs, patrons may IM from within the library to avoid losing their use of a computer or avoid making embarrassing questions public.\n\nSuccessful IM reference services will:\n\nAt times, IM becomes challenging because of lack of non-verbal cues such as eye contact, and the perceived time pressure. Moreover, formulating the question online without the give and take of nonverbal cues and face to face conversation presents an added obstacle. In addition, to provide effective reference service through IM, it is important to meet higher level of information literacy standards. These standards include evaluating the information and its source, synthesizing the information to create new ideas or products, and understanding the societal, legal, and economic issues surrounding its use.\n\nThe article Live, Digital Reference Marketplace by Buff Hirko contains a comparison of the features of applications for chat-based reference.\n\nSee the entries in the Library Success Wiki's Online Reference Section, including software recommended for web-based chat reference, IM reference, SMS (text messaging) reference, and other types like digital audio or video reference.\n\nVirtual service software programs offered by libraries are often unique, and tailored to the individual library's needs. However, each program may have several distinct features. A knowledge base is a chunk of information that users can access independently. An example of this is a serialized listing of frequently asked questions (FAQ) that a user can read and use at his or her leisure.\n\nOnline chat, or instant messaging (IM) has become a very popular Web-based feature. Instant messaging is a real time conversation that utilizes typed text instead of language. Users may feel a sense of satisfaction with the use of this tool because of their personalized interaction with staff.\n\nThe use of electronic mail (email) in responding to reference questions in libraries has been in use for years. Also, in some cases with the IM feature, a question may be asked that cannot be resolved in online chat. In this instance the staff member may document the inquiring patron’s email address and will the user a response.\n\nWith the increase in use of text messaging (Short Message Service or SMS), some libraries are also adopting text messaging in their virtual reference services. Librarians can use mobile phones, text-to-instant messaging or web-based services to respond to reference questions via text messaging.\n\nCo-browsing, or cooperative browsing, is a virtual reference function that involves interactive control of a user’s web browser. This function enables the librarian to see what the patron has on his or her computer screen. Several types of co-browsing have been offered in mobile devices of late; libraries may have software that incorporates dual modes of co-browsing in a variety of formats. For instance, it is possible to browse on a mobile device within and between documents (such as Word), webpages, and images.\n\nVirtual reference services are growing in popularity in the UK with more institutions accepting queries via email, instant messaging and other chat based services. A study of the use of virtual reference within UK academic institutions showed that 25% currently offer a form of virtual reference, with 54% of academic institutions surveyed considering adding this service.\n\nUK public libraries were instrumental in some of the first steps towards UK-wide internet collaboration amongst libraries with the EARL Consortium (Electronic Access to Resources in Libraries) in 1995, in a time where internet access was a rare commodity for both library staff and the public. Resources were collated and lines of communication opened between libraries across the UK, paving the way for services all over the world to follow suit. There are now a number of area-specific reference services across the UK including Ask A Librarian (UK-wide, established in 1997), Ask Cymru (Welsh and English language service), Enquire (Government funded through the People's Network, also UK-wide), and Ask Scotland. Ask Scotland was created by the Scottish Government's advisory body on libraries, SLIC (Scottish Library and Information Council), and funded by the Public Library Quality Improvement Fund (PLQIF) in June 2009. It uses the Online Computer Library Center's QuestionPoint software.\n\nThe definition formulated by the American Library Association's (ALA) 2004 MARS Digital Reference Guidelines Ad Hoc Committee contains three components:\n\n\nIn January 2011 QuestionPoint and the American Library Association were in talks about offering a National Ask A Librarian service across the whole United States of America. At present the Ask services in the US are run at a local level.\n\nIn Europe some countries offer services in both their own national language and in English. European countries include: Finland, the Netherlands (in Dutch only), Denmark, and France.\n\nOther countries which offer virtual reference services include: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the state of Colorado in the United States.\n\nA collaboration between UK and Australian library services, entitled Chasing the Sun, has been initiated using QuestionPoint software so that an all-hours digital reference chat service can be offered. Targeted at health libraries where reference queries from health professionals could occur at any time of the day or night due to medical emergencies, the collaboration between the two countries means that someone will be on hand to field the query at any time. Although the UK libraries involved are currently based in England the programme may expand to other countries and health services if successful.\n\n\n\n\nThe following provide software and technology infrastructure for digital/virtual reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1054566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1054566", "title": "Ditloid", "text": "Ditloid\n\nA ditloid is a type of word puzzle, in which a phrase, quotation, date, or fact must be deduced from the numbers and abbreviated letters in the clue. Common words such as 'the', 'in', 'a', 'an', 'of', 'to', etc. are not normally abbreviated. The name 'ditloid' was given by the \"Daily Express\" newspaper, originating from the clue: 1 = DitLoID ≡ \"1 Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\".\n\nWill Shortz originated the current form of this puzzle and first published it in the May–June 1981 issue of \"Games\" magazine, calling it the Equation Analysis Test. In its annual 1981 issue of \"What's hot and what's not,\" \"Us\" magazine named the Equation Analysis Test in the \"what's hot\" category – the only nonperson so recognized. Shortz reports:\nSome anonymous person had retyped the puzzle from \"Games\" (word for word, except for my byline),\nphotocopied it, and passed it along. This page was then rephotocopied ad infinitum, like a chain letter,\nand circulated around the country. \"Games\" readers who hadn't seen the original even started sending\nit back to \"Games\" as something the magazine ought to consider publishing!\nShortz based the puzzle on the Formula Analysis Test - Revised Form published in Morgan Worthy's 1975 book \"AHA! A Puzzle Approach to Creative Thinking\" (Chicago: Nelson Hall). Worthy's equations were in a different format, for example:\n\nWorthy gives the source of his inspiration and speculates about the perennial popularity\nof this puzzle:\nI got the idea for linguistic equations from graffiti someone had\nwritten in the form of an obscene formula on a restroom wall at the\nUniversity of Florida. When the answer suddenly came to me, I realized\nthe format was a good one for eliciting the \"aha effect\". After that I\nused such items as exercise material when teaching workshops on\ncreative thinking.\nMy guess is that one reason a person enjoys linguistic equations is\nthat the answer hits him or her all at once rather than being solved in\nan incremental fashion. It is similar to what happens when we suddenly\nsee an embedded figure pop into focus; the satisfaction is visceral\nrather than just intellectual. My experience was that people often had\nthe answer to an item come to them when they were not consciously\nthinking about the puzzles, but relaxed, such as in the shower or about\nto fall asleep.\nAnother factor is that with well-written items, success does not hinge\non obscure information. Ideally, a person should never have to feel, \"I\ncould never have gotten that one no matter how long I worked on it.\"\nThere is something ego enhancing about knowing you have the answer\ninside and just need to find it.\n"}

This mark is placed between the last two letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym (e.g. \"report\" in singular is \",\" hence the plural \"\"). Acronyms can be formed from strings of single initial letters, e.g. \"\" pazátsta (for ), or multiple initial letters, e.g. (for , the Holy Land) or ráshlats (for , Rishon LeZion).\n\nIf the acronym is read as is, then the spelling should be with a final form letter. If, on the other hand, the acronym is read as the complete phrase or read as the individual letters, then it should be spelled with a medial form letter. In practice, this rule is more often than not ignored, and the acronyms spelled either way.\n\nAbbreviations that are truncations of a single word, consisting of the first letter or first several letters of that word (as opposed to acronyms formed from initials or truncations of more than one word) are denoted using the punctuation mark geresh () by placing the sign after the last letter of the abbreviation (e.g. \"Ms.\": \"\"). However, in practice, single and double quotes are often used instead of the special punctuation marks (for which most keyboards do not have keys), with the single quote used both in acronyms and abbreviations.\n\nOften (and especially when they describe a noun), Hebrew acronyms are pronounced by the insertion of a vowel sound (usually ) between the letters. These vowels often appear in transliterations to other scripts. Examples include Shas (), Tanakh () and Shabak (). There are exceptions to the use of \"a\", such as Etzel ().\n\nWhen one of the letters is vav or yud, these may be read as vowels (\"u\"/“o” and \"i\") instead: (\"duakh\"/\"dokh\" = , judgement and account); (\"admor\" = , hasidic rebbe; (\"shut\" = , questions and answers); (\"sakum\" = , knife spoon and fork); (\"tapuz\" = , orange, lit. golden apple); (\"um\" = , the United Nations); Bilu; Lehi. (An exception is , Beitar, pronounced \"beytar\".)\n\nHebrew numbers (e.g. year numbers in the Hebrew calendar) are written the same way as acronyms, with gershayim before the last character, but pronounced as separate letter names. For example,  (5775 AM, or 2014-2015 CE) is pronounced hei-tav-shin-ayin-hei.\n\nAcronyms have been widely used in Hebrew since at least the Middle Ages. Several important rabbis are referred to with acronyms of their names. For example, Rabbi Shlomo ben Yitzchak is known as Rashi, Rav Moshe ben Maimon (Maimonides) is commonly known as \"Rambam\" (Hebrew: ), Rabbi Moshe ben Nahman (Nahmanides) is likewise known as the \"Ramban\" (Hebrew: ), and Baal Shem Tov is called the \"Besht\" (Hebrew: ).\n\nA number of such acronyms differ only in their last letter. They all begin with \"Mahara-\", as an acronym of the words ... (\"Morenu Ha-Rav rabi ...\", Our teacher the Rabbi ...).\" \n\nThe usage of Hebrew acronyms extends to liturgical groupings: the word \"Tanakh\" (Hebrew: תנ״ך) is an acronym for Torah (Five Books of Moses), Nevi'im (Book of Prophets), and Ketuvim (Hagiographa).\n\nMost often, though, one will find use of acronyms as acrostics, in both prayer, poetry (see Piyyut), and kabbalistic works. Because each Hebrew letter also has a numeric value, embedding an acrostic may give an additional layer of meaning to these works.\n\nOne purpose of acrostics was as a mnemonic or a way for an author to weave his name as a signature, or some other spiritual thought, into his work, at a time when much was memorized. Examples of prayers which contain acrostics include:\n\n\nישי נוימן, גורמים פגרמטיים, סמנטיים וגרפופונמיים במילוּן קיצורי הכתב, החוג הישראלי לבלשנו ת 18, 2011\n"}

The \"law\" is a statement regarding the difficulty of accurately estimating the time it will take to complete tasks of substantial complexity. It is often cited by programmers, especially in discussions of techniques to improve productivity, such as \"The Mythical Man-Month\" or extreme programming. The recursive nature of the law is a reflection of the widely experienced difficulty of estimating complex tasks despite all best efforts, including knowing that the task is complex.\n\nThe law was initially introduced in connection with a discussion of chess-playing computers, where top-level players were continually beating machines, even though the machines outweighed the players in recursive analysis. The intuition was that the players were able to focus on particular positions instead of following every possible line of play to its conclusion. Hofstadter wrote in 1979, \"In the early days of computer chess, people used to estimate that it would be ten years until a computer (or program) was world champion. But after ten years had passed, it seemed that the day a computer would become world champion was still more than ten years away ... This is just one more piece of evidence for the rather recursive Hofstadter's Law:\" Notably, that day did indeed come, when Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997, which indicates that the Law of Accelerating Returns may take effect when the task is repeated, thus counteracting -- and [in some cases] overpowering -- Hofstadter's law.\n\n"}

The previous reference should be immediately visible, e.g. within the same paragraph or page.

The term KWIC was first coined by Hans Peter Luhn. The system was based on a concept called \"keyword in titles\" which was first proposed for Manchester libraries in 1864 by Andrea Crestadoro.\n\nA KWIC index is formed by sorting and aligning the words within an article title to allow each word (except the stop words) in titles to be searchable alphabetically in the index. It was a useful indexing method for technical manuals before computerized full text search became common.\n\nFor example, a search query including all of the words in the title statement of this article (\"KWIC is an acronym for Key Word In Context, the most common format for concordance lines\") and the in English (\"the free encyclopedia\"), searched against this very web page, might yield a KWIC index as follows. A KWIC index usually uses a wide layout to allow the display of maximum 'in context' information (not shown in the following example).\n\nA KWIC index is a special case of a \"permuted index\". This term refers to the fact that it indexes all cyclic permutations of the headings. Books composed of many short sections with their own descriptive headings, most notably collections of manual pages, often ended with a permuted index section, allowing the reader to easily find a section by any word from its heading. This practice, also known as KWOC (“Key Word Out of Context”), is no longer common.\n\n\"Note: The first reference does not show the KWIC index unless you pay to view the paper.

{"id": "30795401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30795401", "title": "Liar paradox in early Islamic tradition", "text": "Liar paradox in early Islamic tradition\n\nMany early Islamic philosophers and logicians discussed the liar paradox. Their work on the subject began in the 10th century and continued to Athīr al-Dīn al-Abharī and Nasir al-Din al-Tusi of the middle 13th century and beyond. Although the Liar paradox has been well known in Greek and Latin traditions, the works of Arabic scholars have only recently been translated into English.\n\nEach group of early Islamic philosophers discussed different problems presented by the paradox. They pioneered unique solutions that were not influenced by Western ideas.\n\nAthīr al-Dīn Mufaḍḍal (b. ʿUmar Abharī, d. 663/1264) was a Persian philosopher, astronomer and mathematician from the city of Abhar in Persia. There is some speculation that his works on the Liar paradox could have been known to Western logicians, and in particular to Thomas Bradwardine.\n\nHe analyzed the Liar sentence as follows:\n\nIn other words, Athīr says that if the Liar sentence is false, which means that the Liar falsely declares that all he says at the moment is false, then the Liar sentence is true; and, if the Liar sentence is true, which means that the Liar truthfully declares that all he says at the moment is false, then the Liar sentence is false. In any case, the Liar sentence is both true and false at the same time, which is a paradox.\n\nAthīr offers the following solution for the paradox:\n\nAccording to the traditional idealization that presumably was used by Athīr, the sentence as an universal proposition is false only, when \"either it has a counter-instance or its subject term is empty\".\n\n\nThe Liar sentence, however, has neither an empty subject nor counter-instance. This fact creates obstacles for Athīr's view, who must show what is unique about the Liar sentence, and how the Liar sentence still could be only true or false in view of the \"true\" and \"false\" conditions set up in the universal proposition's description. Athīr tries to solve the paradox by applying to it the laws of negation of a conjunction and negation of a disjunction.\n\nAhmed Alwishah, who has a Ph.D. in Islamic Philosophy and David Sanson, who has a Ph.D. in Philosophy explain that Athīr actually claims that:\n\n(1) \"It is not the case that, if the Liar Sentence is not both true and false, then it is true.\"\n\nAlwishah and Sanson continue:\n\"The general principle behind (1) is clear enough: the negation of a conjunction does not entail the negation of a conjunct; so from not both true and false you cannot infer not false and so true. Abharī appears to be saying that the Liar rests on an elementary scope fallacy! But, of course, Abharī is not entitled to (1). In some cases, the negation of a conjunction does entail the negation of a conjunct: 'not both P and P' for example, entails 'not P'. As a general rule, the negation of a conjunction entails the negation of each conjunct whenever the conjuncts are logically equivalent, i.e., whenever the one follows from the other and vice verse. So Abharī is entitled to (1) only if he is entitled to assume that ‘The Liar Sentence is true’ and ‘The Liar Sentence is false’ are not logically equivalent.\"\n\nThe Liar sentence is a universal proposition (The Liar says All I say ...), so \"if it is (non–vacuously) false it must have a counter–instance\". But in this case scenario, when the only thing that the liar is saying is the single sentence declaring that what he is saying at the moment is false, the only available counter–instance is the Liar sentence itself. When staging the paradox Abharī said: \"if it is not true, then it is necessary that one of his sentences at this moment is true, as long as he utters something. But, he says nothing at this moment other than this sentence. Thus, this sentence is necessarily true and false\" So the explanation provided by Abharī himself demonstrates that both \"'The Liar Sentence is false' and 'The Liar Sentence is true' are logically equivalent. If they are logically equivalent, then, contrary to (1), the negation of the conjunction does entail the negation of each conjunct. Abharī’s 'solution; therefore fails.\"\n\nNaṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī was a Persian polymath and prolific writer: an astronomer, biologist, chemist, mathematician, philosopher, physician, physicist, scientist, theologian and Marja Taqleed. He adhered to the Ismaili, and subsequently Twelver Shī‘ah Islamic belief systems. The Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) considered Tusi to be the greatest of the later Persian scholars.\n\nṬūsī's work on the paradox begins with a discussion of the paradox and the solution offered by Abharī, with which Ṭūsī disagrees. As Alwishah and Sanson point out \"Ṭūsī argues that whatever fancy thing (conjunction, conditional) Abharī wants to identify as the truth condition for the Liar Sentence, it will not matter, because pace Abharī, we can generate the paradox without inferring, from the negation of a complex truth condition, the negation of one of its parts. We can argue directly that its being false entails the negation of its being false, and so entails its being true.\"\n\nṬūsī then prepares a stage for his own solution of the Liar paradox, writing that:\nHe does not see a reason that could prevent a declarative sentence to declare something about another declarative sentence.\n\nWith an example of two declarative sentences, (D1) \"It is false\" and (D2) \"Zayd is sitting\", Ṭūsī explains how one declarative sentence (D1) can declare another declarative sentence (D2) to be false: \"It is false that Zayd is sitting\". There is no paradox in the above two declarative sentences because they have different subjects. To generate a paradox a declarative sentence must declare something about itself. If (D1) falsely declares itself to be not (D1) then this false declaration referencing to itself as being \"false\" creates a paradox.\n\nṬūsī writes: \n\nThe above conclusions are very important to the history of Liar Paradox. Alwishah and Sanson point out: \"It is hard to overemphasize how remarkable this passage is. The contemporary reader will be familiar with the idea that the Liar Paradox is a paradox of selfreference. But Ṭūsī is, as far as we know, the first person to express this idea. This passage has no precedent in any tradition. Ṭūsī has performed three remarkable feats in short order. First, his Liar Sentence is singular: its subject is itself, and it declares itself to be false. Gone, then, is the choice between universal or particular Liar Sentence, and the associated problem of adding further assumptions to generate a genuine paradox. Second, he has characterized the paradox as one of self-reference. Third, he has identified a key assumption that might be responsible for generating the entire problem: the assumption that a declarative sentence, by its nature, can declare-something-about anything.\"\n\nRecognizing that, if a declarative sentence that declares itself being false, is false, this does not necessitate it being true. Ṭūsī says that it would be absurd to say that this declarative sentence is true only because it is not false. Ṭūsī writes:\n\nṬūsī then interprets the definitions of \"true\" and \"false\", in an attempt to prove that those definitions should not be taken into consideration when dealing with a declarative sentence that declares itself, as its own subject, to be false.\n\nAl-Baghdādī's definition of \"truth\" and \"falsity\" says that: \"truth is an agreement with the subject, and falsity is the opposite of that\". Ṭūsī argues that this definition cannot be applied to a declarative sentence that declares its own subject to be false because then there are at least two opposite parts that are in disagreement with each other. The same subject cannot be in disagreement with itself. Therefore a self–referenced declarative sentence that declares itself to be false is neither false nor true, and truth/falsity definitions are not applicable to those sentences.\n\nṬūsī stopped short from offering a solution for the Liar sentences discussed by Āmidī \"All that I say at this moment is false\". This sentence presents a different case scenario because it can be interpreted as declaring something about itself, and something about another sentence. The solution for this paradox is absent from Ṭūsī's papers.\n"}

{"id": "5629066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5629066", "title": "Nomina sacra", "text": "Nomina sacra\n\nIn Christian scribal practice, nomina sacra (singular: nomen sacrum from Latin sacred name) is the abbreviation of several frequently occurring divine names or titles, especially in Greek manuscripts of Holy Scripture. A nomen sacrum consists of two or more letters from the original word spanned by an overline.\n\nMetzger lists 15 such expressions from Greek papyri: the Greek counterparts of \"God\", \"Lord\", \"Jesus\", \"Christ\", \"Son\", \"Spirit\", \"David\", \"Cross\", \"Mother\", \"Father\", \"Israel\", \"Savior\", \"Man\", \"Jerusalem\", and \"Heaven\". These \"nomina sacra\" are all found in Greek manuscripts of the 3rd century and earlier, except \"Mother\", which appears in the 4th.\n\n\"Nomina sacra\" also occur in some form in Latin, Coptic, Armenian (indicated by the \"pativ\"), Gothic, Old Nubian, and Cyrillic (indicated by the \"titlo\").\n\n\"Nomina sacra\" are consistently observed in even the earliest extant Christian writings, along with the codex form rather than the roll, implying that when these were written, in approximately the second century, the practice had already been established for some time. However, it is not known precisely when and how the \"nomina sacra\" first arose.\n\nThe initial system of \"nomina sacra\" apparently consisted of just four or five words, called \"nomina divina\": the Greek words for \"Jesus\", \"Christ\", \"Lord\", \"God\", and possibly \"Spirit\". The practice quickly expanded to a number of other words regarded as sacred.\n\nIn the system of \"nomina sacra\" that came to prevail, abbreviation is by \"contraction\", meaning that the first and last letter (at least) of each word are used. In a few early cases, an alternate practice is seen of abbreviation by \"suspension\", meaning that the initial two letters (at least) of the word are used; e.g., the opening verses of Revelation in write (\"Jesus Christ\") as . Contraction, however, offered the practical advantage of indicating the case of the abbreviated noun.\n\nIt is evident that the use of \"nomina sacra\" was an act of reverence rather than a purely practical space-saving device, as they were employed even where well-established abbreviations of far more frequent words such as \"and\" were avoided, and the \"nomen sacrum\" itself was written with generous spacing. Furthermore, early scribes often distinguished between mundane and sacred occurrences of the same word, e.g. a \"spirit\" vs. the \"Spirit\", and applied \"nomina sacra\" only to the latter (at times necessarily revealing an exegetical choice), although later scribes would mechanically abbreviate all occurrences.\n\nScholars have advanced a number of theories on the origin of the \"nomina sacra\". An obvious parallel that likely offered some inspiration is the Jewish practice of writing the divine name of God, commonly rendered as Jehovah or Yahweh in English, as the Hebrew tetragrammaton (transliterated as YHWH) even in Greek Scriptures. The Septuagint manuscript LXX P.Oxy.VII.1007 uses two Paleo-Hebrew \"yodh's\" with a horizontal line through them for YHWH (an abbreviated form of the Name of God translitered as ). Pavlos Vasileiadis, a Doctor of Theology at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, quoting Gerard Gertoux, states that \"the subsequent use of the contracted forms of the original nomina sacra κ[ύριο]ς [()] and θ[εό]ς [()] within Christian manuscripts probably reflects the Jewish practice of replacing the Tetragrammaton by י[הו]ה.\", transliterated in koine Greek as ιά.\n\nGreek culture also employed a number of ways of abbreviating even proper names, though none in quite the same form as the \"nomina sacra\". Inspiration for the contracted forms (using the first and last letter) has also been seen in Revelation, where Jesus speaks of himself as \"the beginning and the end\" and \"the first and the last\" as well \"the Alpha and the Omega\". Greek numerals have been suggested as the origin of the overline spanning the whole \"nomen sacrum\", with the suspended form being simply the ordinary way of writing \"eighteen\", for example.\n\n"}

Pronouncing the letters and numbers may sound similar to the full word: \"K9\" for \"canine\" (phonetically: \"kay\" + \"nine\").\n\nAlternatively, the letters between the first and last are replaced with a number representing the number of letters omitted, such as \"i18n\" for \"internationalization\". Sometimes the last letter is also counted and omitted. These word shortenings are sometimes called \"alphanumeric acronyms\", \"alphanumeric abbreviations\", or \"numerical contractions\".\n\nAccording to Tex Texin, the first numeronym of this kind was \"S12n\", the electronic mail account name given to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) employee Jan Scherpenhuizen by a system administrator because his surname was too long to be an account name. By 1985, colleagues who found Jan's name unpronounceable often referred to him verbally as \"S12n\" (\"ess-twelve-en\"). The use of such numeronyms became part of DEC corporate culture.\n\nA number may also denote how many times the character before or after it is repeated. This is typically used to represent a name or phrase in which several consecutive words start with the same letter, as in W3 (World Wide Web) or W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).\n\nSome numeronyms are composed entirely of numbers, such as \"212\" for \"New Yorker\", \"4-1-1\" for \"information\", \"9-1-1\" for \"help\", and \"101\" for \"basic introduction to a subject\". Words of this type have existed for decades, including those in 10-code, which has been in use since before World War II.\n\nChapter or title numbers of some jurisdictions' statutes have become numeronyms, for example 5150 and 187 from California's penal code. Largely because the production of many American movies and television programs are based in California, usage of these terms has spread beyond its original location and user population.\n\nThe concept of incorporating numbers into words can also be found in Leet-speak, where numbers are frequently substituted for orthographically similar letters (e.g. \"H4CK3D\" for \"HACKED\").\n\nAnne H. Soukhanov, editor of the new \"Microsoft Encarta College Dictionary\", gives the original meaning of the term as \"a telephone number that spells a word or a name\" on a telephone dial.\n\nWhere words have multiple meanings, abbreviations such as these are almost always used to refer to their computing sense; for example, \"G11n\" for \"globalization\" refers to software preparedness for global distribution, and not the social trend of globalization. In some cases, the use of appropriate case makes it easier to distinguish between letters such as uppercase I/i and lower case L/l.\n\n"}

They covered a variety of topics including hobbies, art, history and wildlife. The aim of these books was to interest the observer and they have also been popular amongst children. Some of them have become collector's items. For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now rare. The values of the books can vary from 50 pence to hundreds of pounds. \n\nThe books were produced with paper dust covers up until 1969. Each one had a unique pattern of squiggly lines at the top but these were not especially practical because they were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. These types are often referred to as \"Glossies\". From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books to make them sturdier and more resistant to wear.\n\nThe first Observer's guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British birds. This is now rare, and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second Observer's book on British wild flowers. A mint copy of this book is worth around £220. When the popularity of these was recognized, several more titles were added 'uniform in the series', but during World War II production was limited due to paper and labour shortages. Even so, by 1941 Warne had published the first six Observer's books.\n\nIn 1942 a special edition book was brought out on \"airplanes\" . This book had no number in the series, as it was brought out to help people spot enemy warplanes. It was reprinted in 1943 and 1945. \n\nThe first few Observer's titles had focused on nature, but gradually subjects like geology, music and architecture were introduced. 'Spotter' titles like \"Aircraft\", \"Automobiles\" and \"Railway Locomotives\" proved popular. During the 1950s and 60s collecting sets of these books was popular among children and adults alike. \n\nWhen Warne was acquired by Penguin books in 1983, Warne brought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the original books, and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year Penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up-to-date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals, but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, the dust covers were laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the Penguin Observer's books: Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions).\n\nAfter a hiatus of 17 years, Peregrine Books published the appropriately titled \"Observer's Book of Observer's Books\" in 1999, in a format that matched the original editions and was numbered 99 so as to follow on from the last 'official' title. As the title implies, it is a guide to the series with details of its history, authors, and print-runs. As a sign of the series' popularity, this potentially obscure book has been reprinted no fewer than six times. More recently the series has been rounded up to 100 with the publication of \"Wayside and Woodland\" in 2003.\n"}

{"id": "18134289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18134289", "title": "Qualitative comparative analysis", "text": "Qualitative comparative analysis\n\nIn statistics, qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is a data analysis technique for determining which logical conclusions a data set supports. The analysis begins with listing and counting all the combinations of variables observed in the data set, followed by applying the rules of logical inference to determine which descriptive inferences or implications the data supports. The technique was originally developed by Charles Ragin in 1987.\n\nIn the case of categorical variables, QCA begins by listing and counting all types of cases which occur, where each type of case is defined by its unique combination of values of its independent and dependent variables. For instance, if there were four categorical variables of interest, {A,B,C,D}, and A and B were dichotomous (could take on two values), C could take on five values, and D could take on three, then there would be 60 possible types of observations determined by the possible combinations of variables, not all of which would necessarily occur in real life. By counting the number of observations that exist for each of the 60 unique combination of variables, QCA can determine which descriptive inferences or implications are empirically supported by a data set. Thus, the input to QCA is a data set of any size, from small-N to large-N, and the output of QCA is a set of descriptive inferences or implications the data supports.\n\nIn QCA's next step, inferential logic or Boolean algebra is used to simplify or reduce the number of inferences to the minimum set of inferences supported by the data. This reduced set of inferences is termed the \"prime implicates\" by QCA adherents. For instance, if the presence of conditions A and B is always associated with the presence of a particular value of D, regardless of the observed value of C, then the value that C takes is irrelevant. Thus, all five inferences involving A and B and any of the five values of C may be replaced by the single descriptive inference \"(A and B) implies the particular value of D\".\n\nTo establish that the prime implicants or descriptive inferences derived from the data by the QCA method are causal requires establishing the existence of causal mechanism using another method such as process tracing, formal logic, intervening variables, or established multidisciplinary knowledge. The method is used in social science and is based on the binary logic of Boolean algebra, and attempts to ensure that all possible combinations of variables that can be made across the cases under investigation are considered.\n\nThe technique of listing case types by potential variable combinations assists with case selection by making investigators aware of all possible case types that would need to be investigated, at a minimum, if they exist, in order to test a certain hypothesis or to derive new inferences from an existing data set. In situations where the available observations constitute the entire population of cases, this method alleviates the small N problem by allowing inferences to be drawn by evaluating and comparing the number of cases exhibiting each combination of variables. The small N problem arises when the number of units of analysis (e.g. countries) available is inherently limited. For example: a study where countries are the unit of analysis is limited in that are only a limited number of countries in the world (less than 200), less than necessary for some (probabilistic) statistical techniques. By maximizing the number of comparisons that can be made across the cases under investigation, causal inferences are according to Ragin possible. This technique allows the identification of multiple causal pathways and interaction effects that may not be detectable via statistical analysis that typically requires its data set to conform to one model. Thus, it is the first step to identifying subsets of a data set conforming to particular causal pathway based on the combinations of covariates prior to quantitative statistical analyses testing conformance to a model; and helps qualitative researchers to correctly limit the scope of claimed findings to the type of observations they analyze.\n\nAs this is a logical (deterministic) and not a statistical (probabilistic) technique, with \"crisp-set\" QCA (csQCA), the original application of QCA, variables can only have two values, which is problematic as the researcher has to determine the values of each variable. For example: GDP per capita has to be divided by the researcher in two categories (e.g. low = 0 and high = 1). But as this variable is essentially a continuous variable, the division will always be arbitrary. A second, related problem is that the technique does not allow an assessment of the effect of the relative strengths of the independent variables (as they can only have two values). Ragin, and other scholars such as Lasse Cronqvist, have tried to deal with these issues by developing new tools that extend QCA, such as multi-value QCA (mvQCA) and fuzzy set QCA (fsQCA). Note: Multi-value QCA is simply QCA applied to observations having categorical variables with more than two values. Crisp-Set QCA can be considered a special case of Multi-value QCA. \n\nStatistical methodologists have argued that QCA's strong assumptions render its findings both fragile and prone to type I error. Simon Hug argues that deterministic hypotheses and error-free measures are exceedingly rare in social science and uses Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the fragility of QCA results if either assumption is violated. Chris Krogslund, Donghyun Danny Choi, and Mathias Poertner further demonstrate that QCA results are highly sensitive to minor parametric and model-susceptibility changes and are vulnerable to type I error. Bear F. Braumoeller further explores the vulnerability of the QCA family of techniques to both type I error and multiple inference. Braumoeller also offers a formal test of the null hypothesis and demonstrates that even very convincing QCA findings may be the result of chance.\n\nQCA can be performed probabilistically or deterministically with observations of categorical variables. For instance, the existence of a descriptive inference or implication is supported deterministically by the absence of any counter-example cases to the inference; i.e. if a researcher claims condition X implies condition Y, then, deterministically, there must not exist any counterexample cases having condition X, but not condition Y. However, if the researcher wants to claim that condition X is a probabilistic 'predictor' of condition Y, in another similar set of cases, then the proportion of counterexample cases to an inference to the proportion of cases having that same combination of conditions can be set at a threshold value of for example 80% or higher. For each prime implicant that QCA outputs via its logical inference reduction process, the \"coverage\" — percentage out of all observations that exhibit that implication or inference — and the \"consistency\" — the percentage of observations conforming to that combination of variables having that particular value of the dependent variable or outcome — are calculated and reported, and can be used as indicators of the strength of such a explorative probabilistic inference. In real-life complex societal processes, QCA enables the identification of multiple sets of conditions that are consistently associated with a particular output value in order to explore for causal predictors.\n\nFuzzy set QCA aims to handle variables, such as GDP per capita, where the number of categories, decimal values of monetary units, becomes too large to use mvQCA, or in cases were uncertainty or ambiguity or measurement error in the classification of a case needs to be acknowledged.\n\nQCA has now become used in many more fields than political science which Ragin first developed the method for. Today the method has been used in:\n"}
{"id": "25407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25407", "title": "Recursion", "text": "Recursion\n\nRecursion occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.\n\nIn mathematics and computer science, a class of objects or methods exhibit recursive behavior when they can be defined by two properties:\n\nFor example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestors:\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of recursion:\n\nformula_1\n\nformula_2\n\nformula_3\n\nMany mathematical axioms are based upon recursive rules. For example, the formal definition of the natural numbers by the Peano axioms can be described as: \"0 is a natural number, and each natural number has a successor, which is also a natural number.\" By this base case and recursive rule, one can generate the set of all natural numbers.\n\nRecursively defined mathematical objects include functions, sets, and especially fractals.\n\nThere are various more tongue-in-cheek \"definitions\" of recursion; see recursive humor.\n\nRecursion is the process a procedure goes through when one of the steps of the procedure involves invoking the procedure itself. A procedure that goes through recursion is said to be 'recursive'.\n\nTo understand recursion, one must recognize the distinction between a procedure and the running of a procedure. A procedure is a set of steps based on a set of rules. The running of a procedure involves actually following the rules and performing the steps. An analogy: a procedure is like a written recipe; running a procedure is like actually preparing the meal.\n\nRecursion is related to, but not the same as, a reference within the specification of a procedure to the execution of some other procedure. For instance, a recipe might refer to cooking vegetables, which is another procedure that in turn requires heating water, and so forth. However, a recursive procedure is where (at least) one of its steps calls for a new instance of the very same procedure, like a sourdough recipe calling for some dough left over from the last time the same recipe was made. This immediately creates the possibility of an endless loop; recursion can only be properly used in a definition if the step in question is skipped in certain cases so that the procedure can complete, like a sourdough recipe that also tells you how to get some starter dough in case you've never made it before. Even if properly defined, a recursive procedure is not easy for humans to perform, as it requires distinguishing the new from the old (partially executed) invocation of the procedure; this requires some administration of how far various simultaneous instances of the procedures have progressed. For this reason recursive definitions are very rare in everyday situations. An example could be the following procedure to find a way through a maze. Proceed forward until reaching either an exit or a branching point (a dead end is considered a branching point with 0 branches). If the point reached is an exit, terminate. Otherwise try each branch in turn, using the procedure recursively; if every trial fails by reaching only dead ends, return on the path that led to this branching point and report failure. Whether this actually defines a terminating procedure depends on the nature of the maze: it must not allow loops. In any case, executing the procedure requires carefully recording all currently explored branching points, and which of their branches have already been exhaustively tried.\n\nLinguist Noam Chomsky among many others has argued that the lack of an upper bound on the number of grammatical sentences in a language, and the lack of an upper bound on grammatical sentence length (beyond practical constraints such as the time available to utter one), can be explained as the consequence of recursion in natural language. This can be understood in terms of a recursive definition of a syntactic category, such as a sentence. A sentence can have a structure in which what follows the verb is another sentence: \"Dorothy thinks witches are dangerous\", in which the sentence \"witches are dangerous\" occurs in the larger one. So a sentence can be defined recursively (very roughly) as something with a structure that includes a noun phrase, a verb, and optionally another sentence. This is really just a special case of the mathematical definition of recursion.\n\nThis provides a way of understanding the creativity of language—the unbounded number of grammatical sentences—because it immediately predicts that sentences can be of arbitrary length: \"Dorothy thinks that Toto suspects that Tin Man said that...\". There are many structures apart from sentences that can be defined recursively, and therefore many ways in which a sentence can embed instances of one category inside another. Over the years, languages in general have proved amenable to this kind of analysis.\n\nRecently, however, the generally accepted idea that recursion is an essential property of human language has been challenged by Daniel Everett on the basis of his claims about the Pirahã language. Andrew Nevins, David Pesetsky and Cilene Rodrigues are among many who have argued against this. Literary self-reference can in any case be argued to be different in kind from mathematical or logical recursion.\n\nRecursion plays a crucial role not only in syntax, but also in natural language semantics. The word \"and\", for example, can be construed as a function that can apply to sentence meanings to create new sentences, and likewise for noun phrase meanings, verb phrase meanings, and others. It can also apply to intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, or ditransitive verbs. In order to provide a single denotation for it that is suitably flexible, \"and\" is typically defined so that it can take any of these different types of meanings as arguments. This can be done by defining it for a simple case in which it combines sentences, and then defining the other cases recursively in terms of the simple one. \n\nA recursive grammar is a formal grammar that contains recursive production rules.\n\nRecursion is sometimes used humorously in computer science, programming, philosophy, or mathematics textbooks, generally by giving a circular definition or self-reference, in which the putative recursive step does not get closer to a base case, but instead leads to an infinite regress. It is not unusual for such books to include a joke entry in their glossary along the lines of:\n\nA variation is found on page 269 in the index of some editions of Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie's book \"The C Programming Language\"; the index entry recursively references itself (\"recursion 86, 139, 141, 182, 202, 269\"). The earliest version of this joke was in \"Software Tools\" by Kernighan and Plauger, and also appears in \"The UNIX Programming Environment\" by Kernighan and Pike. It did not appear in the first edition of \"The C Programming Language\".\n\nAnother joke is that \"To understand recursion, you must understand recursion.\" In the English-language version of the Google web search engine, when a search for \"recursion\" is made, the site suggests \"Did you mean: \"recursion\".\" An alternative form is the following, from Andrew Plotkin: \"If you already know what recursion is, just remember the answer. Otherwise, find someone who is standing closer to Douglas Hofstadter than you are; then ask him or her what recursion is.\"\n\nRecursive acronyms can also be examples of recursive humor. PHP, for example, stands for \"PHP Hypertext Preprocessor\", WINE stands for \"WINE Is Not an Emulator.\" and GNU stands for \"GNU's not Unix\".\n\nThe canonical example of a recursively defined set is given by the natural numbers:\n\nAnother interesting example is the set of all \"true reachable\" propositions in an axiomatic system.\n\n\nThis set is called 'true reachable propositions' because in non-constructive approaches to the foundations of mathematics, the set of true propositions may be larger than the set recursively constructed from the axioms and rules of inference. See also Gödel's incompleteness theorems.\n\nFinite subdivision rules are a geometric form of recursion, which can be used to create fractal-like images. A subdivision rule starts with a collection of polygons labelled by finitely many labels, and then each polygon is subdivided into smaller labelled polygons in a way that depends only on the labels of the original polygon. This process can be iterated. The standard `middle thirds' technique for creating the Cantor set is a subdivision rule, as is barycentric subdivision.\n\nA function may be partly defined in terms of itself. A familiar example is the Fibonacci number sequence: \"F\"(\"n\") = \"F\"(\"n\" − 1) + \"F\"(\"n\" − 2). For such a definition to be useful, it must lead to non-recursively defined values, in this case \"F\"(0) = 0 and \"F\"(1) = 1.\n\nA famous recursive function is the Ackermann function, which—unlike the Fibonacci sequence—cannot easily be expressed without recursion.\n\nApplying the standard technique of proof by cases to recursively defined sets or functions, as in the preceding sections, yields structural induction, a powerful generalization of mathematical induction widely used to derive proofs in mathematical logic and computer science.\n\nDynamic programming is an approach to optimization that restates a multiperiod or multistep optimization problem in recursive form. The key result in dynamic programming is the Bellman equation, which writes the value of the optimization problem at an earlier time (or earlier step) in terms of its value at a later time (or later step).\n\nIn set theory, this is a theorem guaranteeing that recursively defined functions exist. Given a set \"X\", an element \"a\" of \"X\" and a function formula_7, the theorem states that there is a unique function formula_8 (where formula_4 denotes the set of natural numbers including zero) such that\nfor any natural number \"n\".\n\nTake two functions formula_8 and formula_13 such that:\n\nwhere \"a\" is an element of \"X\".\n\nIt can be proved by mathematical induction that formula_18 for all natural numbers \"n\":\n\nBy induction, formula_18 for all formula_25.\n\nA common method of simplification is to divide a problem into subproblems of the same type. As a computer programming technique, this is called divide and conquer and is key to the design of many important algorithms. Divide and conquer serves as a top-down approach to problem solving, where problems are solved by solving smaller and smaller instances. A contrary approach is dynamic programming. This approach serves as a bottom-up approach, where problems are solved by solving larger and larger instances, until the desired size is reached.\n\nA classic example of recursion is the definition of the factorial function, given here in C code:\n\nIf not having reached the base case and returning with value every instantiation of the above function creates a new instance of the function, passing to it an input reduced by (), and returns the result of this (recursive) call, multiplied by its own value of , analogously to the mathematical definition of the factorial.\n\nRecursion in computer programming is exemplified when a function is defined in terms of simpler, often smaller versions of itself. The solution to the problem is then devised by combining the solutions obtained from the simpler versions of the problem. One example application of recursion is in parsers for programming languages. The great advantage of recursion is that an infinite set of possible sentences, designs or other data can be defined, parsed or produced by a finite computer program.\n\nRecurrence relations are equations to define one or more sequences recursively. Some specific kinds of recurrence relation can be \"solved\" to obtain a non-recursive definition.\n\nUse of recursion in an algorithm has both advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is usually simplicity. The main disadvantage is often that the algorithm may require large amounts of memory if the depth of the recursion is very large.\n\nThe Russian Doll or Matryoshka Doll is a physical artistic example of the recursive concept.\n\nRecursion has been used in paintings since Giotto's \"Stefaneschi Triptych\", made in 1320. Its central panel contains the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych itself as an offering.\n\nM. C. Escher's \"Print Gallery\" (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which recursively contains the picture, and so \"ad infinitum\".\n\n\n"}

In general, the interview is composed of the following stages.\n\n\nThese stages may occur in loops, for example when a clarification of the question leads to the need to establish more background information on the query topic. These steps are designed to put the user at their ease, and then help ensure that they have correctly explained what they require. When the reference librarian believes that the query is fully understood, they attempt to provide resources that help satisfy it. An important and often overlooked final step is checking that the information or service provided was indeed what the library user required.\n\nThe purpose behind the reference interview structure is to ensure that the library user's information need is satisfied. The librarian can use a number of interview techniques to help identify the user's exact need. Poor reference interview skills may lead to misinterpretation of the real question, a lack of real help and an unsatisfied library user.\n\nLibrarians use many techniques to help identify a user’s information need. With body language, repetition and paraphrasing of what the user says, the interviewer can encourage the user to give more information about what they need. Asking open questions establishes context and helps to identify exactly what is required. A lack of follow-up, or checking that the user found what they required, is arguably one of the most common mistakes made in the reference interview.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with providing an effective reference service is that of badly formed queries. In this instance, the user's reference question doesn't match up to the information they actually need. Badly formed queries may lead to user frustration, as they perceive that the reference interview is not solving their problem. \n\nMany of the techniques used in the reference interview are geared towards developing a badly formed query until a sense of the user's true information need is gained. A great degree of care must be taken when helping users to develop their query. The librarian typically has little insight into the social and psychological barriers that might be preventing the user from explaining their question accurately. Anything from anxiety from an approaching deadline to lack of confidence with language can get in the way.\n\nAs libraries have begun to adopt electronic technology into their operations, the idea of the virtual reference interview has come to light. Virtual reference is a reference service initiated electronically, often in real-time. The user and librarian do not meet face-to-face. Virtual reference services can be conducted, for example, in internet chat, videoconferencing, email, co-browsing and instant messaging. \n\nUptake of virtual reference has not been as swift as some had predicted. The complexity of virtual reference may be to blame, as users want information quickly and with the minimum of fuss. Some evidence suggests that the problem lies with poor uptake and training among library staff.\n\nLibrary users are not always comfortable with reference services, let alone satisfied with them. Unobtrusive user studies suggest that only around 55% to 65% of users leave a reference interview satisfied with the result and willing to return. Demographics, social factors and users’ preconceptions about libraries all contribute to this figure. Embarrassment, shyness, and anxiety can prevent a user from approaching the reference desk, and poor signposting and explanation of services can mean that some customers aren't aware that the reference service exists. To be as effective as possible, libraries must be proactive in publicizing their services and reducing the stigma of asking for help.\n\nFor a long time, the value of the reference interview has stood unquestioned. More recently, with technological developments streamlining some of the tasks which once comprised the interview, some researchers are beginning to question the validity of the reference interview, and the investment that a reference librarian represents. Others argue that reference services should broaden their target audience. As people increasingly use the internet to make major, life-affecting decisions, so they also require the services of professionals who are able to provide help in this environment. If this proves to be the case, it will become more vital that the reference interview be conducted professionally and successfully. In the age of information overload, a successful reference interview may empower users to confidently make such decisions in their lives.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8912106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8912106", "title": "Reference scenario", "text": "Reference scenario\n\nA reference scenario is an imagined situation where a library patron brings a question to a librarian and there is then a conversation, called in the field a reference interview, where the librarian works to help the patron find what he or she wants. These scenarios are used in training future librarians how to help patrons. Basically, a scenario is as short as a couple of sentences, including a question and a situation that underlies that question.\n\nA great deal of reference teaching puts students to researching the answers to made-up questions. This focuses the student on learning about the reference sources at hand by using them to answer those questions. Scenarios are something different. They focus the student on the interaction with patrons. In class practice sessions, one student can be the patron and the other the librarian, as long as the one practicing as the librarian doesn't know the whole scenario in advance.\n\nScenarios are valued because often the question asked is not the end of the patron's information hunt, but the start. Patrons often start by voicing a question that they think the library can answer, rather than the question they are really seeking to answer. Or they pose a question that the librarian doesn't understand. Reference librarian skills are very much about mediating a gap between what the patron wants and what the library can provide. This can involve the librarian making him or herself a partner in the patron's search, teaching them what the library really has to offer, or even just clarifying a confusing word: Does the patron want information about soaps to clean with or soaps as in soap operas?\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23499848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23499848", "title": "Secondary source", "text": "Secondary source\n\nIn scholarship, a secondary source is a document or recording that relates or discusses information originally presented elsewhere. A secondary source contrasts with a primary source, which is an original source of the information being discussed; a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document created by such a person. \n\nA secondary source is one that gives information about a primary source. In this source, the original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format. Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. \nThe most accurate classification for any given source is not always obvious. \"Primary\" and \"secondary\" are relative terms, and some sources may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on how they are used. A third level, the tertiary source, such as an encyclopedia or dictionary, resembles a secondary source in that it contains analysis, but attempts to provide a broad introductory overview of a topic.\n\nInformation can be taken from a wide variety of objects, but this classification system is only useful for a class of sources that are called symbolic sources. Symbolic sources are sources that are intended to communicate information to someone. Common symbolic sources include written documents such as letters and notes, but not, for example, bits of broken pottery and scraps of food excavated from a midden, regardless of how much information can be extracted from an ancient trash heap, or how little can be extracted from a written document. \n\nMany sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are used. Moreover, the distinction between \"primary\" and \"secondary\" sources is subjective and contextual, so that precise definitions are difficult to make. For example, if a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion, but a secondary source of information found in the old documents. Other examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.\n\nWhether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field. For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered \"primary\", since it is the closest known thing to an original source, but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered \"secondary\".\n\nAttempts to map or model scientific and scholarly communication need the concepts of primary, secondary and further \"levels\". One such model is the UNISIST model of information dissemination. Within such a model these concepts are defined in relation to each other, and the acceptance of this way of defining the concepts are connected to the acceptance of the model.\n\nSome other modern languages use more than one word for the English word \"source\". German usually uses \"Sekundärliteratur\" (\"secondary literature\") for secondary sources for historical facts, leaving \"Sekundärquelle\" (\"secondary source\") to historiography. A \"Sekundärquelle\" is a source which can tell about a lost \"Primärquelle\" (\"primary source\"), such as a letter quoting from minutes which are no longer known to exist, and so cannot be consulted by the historian.\n\nIn general, secondary sources are self-described as review articles or meta-analysis.\n\nPrimary source materials are typically defined as \"original research papers written by the scientists who actually conducted the study.\" An example of primary source material is the Purpose, Methods, Results, Conclusions sections of a research paper (in IMRAD style) in a scientific journal by the authors who conducted the study. In some fields, a secondary source may include a summary of the literature in the Introduction of a scientific paper, a description of what is known about a disease or treatment in a chapter in a reference book, or a synthesis written to review available literature. A survey of previous work in the field in a primary peer-reviewed source is secondary source information. This allows secondary sourcing of recent findings in areas where full review articles have not yet been published.\n\nA book review that contains the judgment of the reviewer about the book is a primary source for the reviewer's opinion, and a secondary source for the contents of the book. A summary of the book within a review is a secondary source.\n\nIn library and information sciences, secondary sources are generally regarded as those sources that summarize or add commentary to primary sources in the context of the particular information or idea under study.\n\nAn important use of secondary sources in the field of mathematics has been to make difficult mathematical ideas and proofs from primary sources more accessible to the public; in other sciences tertiary sources are expected to fulfill the introductory role.\n\nSecondary sources in history and humanities are usually books or scholarly journals, from the perspective of a later interpreter, especially by a later scholar. In the humanities, a peer reviewed article is always a secondary source.\nThe delineation of sources as primary and secondary first arose in the field of historiography, as historians attempted to identify and classify the sources of historical writing. In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources. In original scholarly writing, historians rely on primary sources, read in the context of the scholarly interpretations.\n\nFollowing the Rankean model established by German scholarship in the 19th century, historians use archives of primary sources. Most undergraduate research projects rely on secondary source material, with perhaps snippets of primary sources.\n\nIn the legal field, source classification is important because the persuasiveness of a source usually depends upon its history. Primary sources may include cases, constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, and other sources of binding legal authority, while secondary legal sources may include books, the headnotes of case reports, articles, and encyclopedias. Legal writers usually prefer to cite primary sources because only primary sources are authoritative and precedential, while secondary sources are only persuasive at best.\n\n\"A secondary source is a record or statement of an event or circumstance made by a non-eyewitness or by someone not closely connected with the event or circumstances, recorded or stated verbally either at or sometime after the event, or by an eye-witness at a time after the event when the fallibility of memory is an important factor.\" Consequently, according to this definition, a first-hand account written long after the event \"when the fallibility of memory is an important factor\" is a secondary source, even though it may be the first published description of that event.\n\nAn autobiography can be a secondary source in history or the humanities when used for information about topics other than its subject. For example, many first hand accounts of events in World War I written in the post-war years were influenced by the then prevailing perception of the war which was significantly different from contemporary opinion.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40849944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40849944", "title": "Sources for the historicity of Jesus", "text": "Sources for the historicity of Jesus\n\nChristian sources, such as the New Testament books in the Christian Bible, include detailed stories about Jesus but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus. The only two events subject to \"almost universal assent\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate.\n\nNon-Christian sources that are used to study and establish the historicity of Jesus include Jewish sources such as Josephus, and Roman sources such as Tacitus. These sources are compared to Christian sources such as the Pauline Epistles and the Synoptic Gospels. These sources are usually independent of each other (e.g. Jewish sources do not draw upon Roman sources), and similarities and differences between them are used in the authentication process.\n\nIn a review of the state of research, the Jewish scholar Amy-Jill Levine stated that \"no single picture of Jesus has convinced all, or even most scholars\" and that all portraits of Jesus are subject to criticism by some group of scholars.\n\nThe writings of the 1st century Romano-Jewish historian Flavius Josephus include references to Jesus and the origins of Christianity. Josephus' \"Antiquities of the Jews\", written around 93–94 CE, includes two references to Jesus in Books and .\n\nOf the two passages, the James passage in Book 20 is used by scholars to support the existence of Jesus, the \"Testimonium Flavianum\" in Book 18 his crucifixion. Josephus' James passage attests to the existence of Jesus as a historical person and that some of his contemporaries considered him the Messiah. According to Bart Ehrman, Josephus' passage about Jesus was altered by a Christian scribe, including the reference to Jesus as the Messiah.\n\nA textual argument against the authenticity of the James passage is that the use of the term \"Christos\" there seems unusual for Josephus. An argument based on the flow of the text in the document is that, given that the mention of Jesus appears in the \"Antiquities\" before that of the John the Baptist, a Christian interpolator may have inserted it to place Jesus in the text before John. A further argument against the authenticity of the James passage is that it would have read well even without a reference to Jesus.\n\nThe passage deals with the death of \"James the brother of Jesus\" in Jerusalem. Whereas the works of Josephus refer to at least twenty different people with the name Jesus, this passage specifies that this Jesus was the one \"who was called Christ\". Louis Feldman states that this passage, above others, indicates that Josephus did say something about Jesus.\n\nModern scholarship has almost universally acknowledged the authenticity of the reference in of the \"Antiquities\" to \"the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James\", and considers it as having the highest level of authenticity among the references of Josephus to Christianity.\n\nThe \"Testimonium Flavianum\" (meaning the testimony of Flavius [Josephus]) is the name given to the passage found in of the \"Antiquities\" in which Josephus describes the condemnation and crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of the Roman authorities. Scholars have differing opinions on the total or partial authenticity of the reference in the passage to the execution of Jesus by Pontius Pilate. The general scholarly view is that while the \"Testimonium Flavianum\" is most likely not authentic in its entirety, it is broadly agreed upon that it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus with a reference to the execution of Jesus by Pilate which was then subject to Christian interpolation. Although the exact nature and extent of the Christian redaction remains unclear, there is broad consensus as to what the original text of the \"Testimonium\" by Josephus would have looked like.\n\nThe references found in \"Antiquities\" have no parallel texts in the other work by Josephus such as the \"Jewish War\", written twenty years earlier, but some scholars have provided explanations for their absence, such as that the \"Antiquities\" covers a longer time period and that during the twenty-year gap between the writing of the \"Jewish Wars\" (c. 70 CE) and \"Antiquities\" (after 90 CE) Christians had become more important in Rome and were hence given attention in the \"Antiquities\".\n\nA number of variations exist between the statements by Josephus regarding the deaths of James and the New Testament accounts. Scholars generally view these variations as indications that the Josephus passages are not interpolations, because a Christian interpolator would more likely have made them correspond to the Christian traditions. Robert Eisenman provides numerous early Christian sources that confirm the Josephus testament, that James was the brother of Jesus.\n\nThe Roman historian and senator Tacitus referred to Christ, his execution by Pontius Pilate and the existence of early Christians in Rome in his final work, \"Annals\" (c. AD 116), . The relevant passage reads: \"called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus.\"\n\nScholars generally consider Tacitus's reference to the execution of Jesus by Pontius Pilate to be both authentic, and of historical value as an independent Roman source about early Christianity that is in unison with other historical records. William L. Portier has stated that the consistency in the references by Tacitus, Josephus and the letters to Emperor Trajan by Pliny the Younger reaffirm the validity of all three accounts.\n\nTacitus was a patriotic Roman senator and his writings shows no sympathy towards Christians. Andreas Köstenberger and separately Robert E. Van Voorst state that the tone of the passage towards Christians is far too negative to have been authored by a Christian scribe – a conclusion shared by John P. Meier Robert E. Van Voorst states that \"of all Roman writers, Tacitus gives us the most precise information about Christ\".\n\nJohn Dominic Crossan considers the passage important in establishing that Jesus existed and was crucified, and states: \"That he was crucified is as sure as anything historical can ever be, since both Josephus and Tacitus... agree with the Christian accounts on at least that basic fact.\" Bart D. Ehrman states: \"Tacitus's report confirms what we know from other sources, that Jesus was executed by order of the Roman governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate, sometime during Tiberius's reign.\" Eddy and Boyd state that it is now \"firmly established\" that Tacitus provides a non-Christian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesus.\n\nAlthough the majority of scholars consider it to be genuine, a few scholars question the authenticity of the passage given that Tacitus was born 25 years after Jesus' death.\n\nSome scholars have debated the historical value of the passage given that Tacitus does not reveal the source of his information. Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz argue that Tacitus at times had drawn on earlier historical works now lost to us, and he may have used official sources from a Roman archive in this case; however, if Tacitus had been copying from an official source, some scholars would expect him to have labeled Pilate correctly as a \"prefect\" rather than a \"procurator\". Theissen and Merz state that Tacitus gives us a description of widespread prejudices about Christianity and a few precise details about \"Christus\" and Christianity, the source of which remains unclear. However, Paul R. Eddy has stated that given his position as a senator Tacitus was also likely to have had access to official Roman documents of the time and did not need other sources.\n\nMichael Martin notes that the authenticity of this passage of the Annals has also been disputed on the grounds that Tacitus would not have used the word “messiah” in an authentic Roman document.\n\nWeaver notes that Tacitus spoke of the persecution of Christians, but no other Christian author wrote of this persecution for a hundred years.\n\nHotema notes that this passage was not quoted by any Church father up to the 15th century, although the passage would have been very useful to them in their work; and that the passage refers to the Christians in Rome being a multitude, while at that time the Christian congregation in Rome would actually have been very small.\n\nRichard Carrier has put forward the ideas that the 'Christ, the author of this name, was executed by the procurator Pontius Pilate in the reign of Tiberius' line is a Christian interpolation and that Tacitus wrote about Chrestians not Christians.\n\nScholars have also debated the issue of hearsay in the reference by Tacitus. Charles Guignebert argued that \"So long as there is that possibility [that Tacitus is merely echoing what Christians themselves were saying], the passage remains quite worthless\". R. T. France states that the Tacitus passage is at best just Tacitus repeating what he had heard through Christians. However, Paul R. Eddy has stated that as Rome's preeminent historian, Tacitus was generally known for checking his sources and was not in the habit of reporting gossip. Tacitus was a member of the Quindecimviri sacris faciundis, a council of priests whose duty it was to supervise foreign religious cults in Rome, which as Van Voorst points out, makes it reasonable to suppose that he would have acquired knowledge of Christian origins through his work with that body.\n\nMara (son of Sarapion) was a Stoic philosopher from the Roman province of Syria. Sometime between 73 AD and the 3rd century, Mara wrote a letter to his son (also called Sarapion) which may contain an early non-Christian reference to the crucifixion of Jesus.\n\nThe letter refers to the unjust treatment of \"three wise men\": the murder of Socrates, the burning of Pythagoras, and the execution of \"the wise king\" of the Jews. The author explains that in all three cases the wrongdoing resulted in the future punishment of those responsible by God and that when the wise are oppressed, not only does their wisdom triumph in the end, but God punishes their oppressors.\n\nThe letter includes no Christian themes and the author is presumed to be a pagan. Some scholars see the reference to the execution of the \"wise king\" of the Jews as an early non-Christian reference to Jesus. Criteria that support the non-Christian origin of the letter include the observation that \"king of the Jews\" was not a Christian title, and that the letter's premise that Jesus lives on based on the wisdom of his teachings is in contrast to the Christian concept that Jesus continues to live through his resurrection.\n\nScholars such as Robert Van Voorst see little doubt that the reference to the execution of the \"king of the Jews\" is about the death of Jesus. Others such as Craig A. Evans see less value in the letter, given its uncertain date, and the possible ambiguity in the reference.\n\nThe Roman historian Suetonius (c. 69 – after 122 CE) made references to early Christians and their leader in his work \"Lives of the Twelve Caesars\" (written 121 CE). The references appear in and which describe the lives of Roman Emperors Claudius and Nero. The Nero 16 passage refers to the abuses by Nero and mentions how he inflicted punishment on Christians – which is generally dated to around AD 64. This passage shows the clear contempt of Suetonius for Christians - the same contempt expressed by Tacitus and Pliny the younger in their writings, but does not refer to Jesus himself.\n\nThe earlier passage in Claudius, may include a reference to Jesus, but is subject to debate among scholars. In Suetonius refers to the expulsion of Jews by Claudius and states:\n\nThe reference in Claudius 25 involves the agitations in the Jewish community which led to the expulsion of some Jews from Rome by Claudius, and is likely the same event mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles (). Most historians date this expulsion to around AD 49–50. Suetonius refers to the leader of the Christians as \"Chrestus\", a term also used by used by Tacitus, referred in Latin dictionaries as a (amongst other things) version of 'Christus'. However, the wording used by Suetonius implies that Chrestus was alive at the time of the disturbance and was agitating the Jews in Rome. This weakens the historical value of his reference as a whole, and there is no overall scholarly agreement about its value as a reference to Jesus. However, the confusion of Suetonius also points to the lack of Christian interpolation, for a Christian scribe would not have confused the Jews with Christians.\n\nMost scholars assume that in the reference Jesus is meant and that the disturbances mentioned were due to the spread of Christianity in Rome. However, scholars are divided on the value of the Suetonius' reference. Some scholars such as Craig A. Evans, John Meier and Craig S. Keener see it as a likely reference to Jesus. Others such as Stephen Benko and H. Dixon Slingerland see it as having little or no historical value.\n\nMenahem Stern states Suetonius definitely was referring to Jesus; because he would have added \"a certain\" to Chrestus if he had meant some unknown agitator.\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud in a few cases includes possible references to Jesus using the terms \"Yeshu\", \"Yeshu ha-Notzri\", \"ben Stada\", and \"ben Pandera\". Some of these references probably date back to the Tannaitic period (70–200 CE). In some cases, it is not clear if the references are to Jesus, or other people, and scholars continue to debate their historical value, and exactly which references, if any, may be to Jesus.\n\nRobert Van Voorst states that the scarcity of Jewish references to Jesus is not surprising, given that Jesus was not a prominent issue for the Jews during the first century, and after the devastation caused by the Siege of Jerusalem in the year 70, Jewish scholars were focusing on preserving Judaism itself, rather than paying much attention to Christianity.\n\nRobert Eisenman argues that the derivation of Jesus of Nazareth from \"ha-Notzri\" is impossible on etymological grounds, as it would suggest rather \"the Nazirite\" rather than \"the Nazarene\".\n\nVan Voorst states that although the question of who was referred to in various points in the Talmud remains subject to debate among scholars, in the case of \"Sanhedrin 43a\" (generally considered the most important reference to Jesus in rabbinic literature), Jesus can be confirmed as the subject of the passage, not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it, and there is little doubt that it refers to the death of Jesus of Nazareth. Christopher M. Tuckett states that if it is accepted that death narrative of Sanhedrin 43a refers to Jesus of Nazareth then it provides evidence of Jesus' existence and execution.\n\nAndreas Kostenberger states that the passage is a Tannaitic reference to the trial and death of Jesus at Passover and is most likely earlier than other references to Jesus in the Talmud. The passage reflects hostility toward Jesus among the rabbis and includes this text:\n\nIt is taught: On the eve of Passover they hung Yeshu and the crier went forth for forty days beforehand declaring that \"[Yeshu] is going to be stoned for practicing witchcraft, for enticing and leading Israel astray. Anyone who knows something to clear him should come forth and exonerate him.\" But no one had anything exonerating for him and they hung him on the eve of Passover. \n\nPeter Schäfer states that there can be no doubt that the narrative of the execution of Jesus in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth, but states that the rabbinic literature in question are not Tannaitic but from a later Amoraic period and may have drawn on the Christian gospels, and may have been written as responses to them. Bart Ehrman and separately Mark Allan Powell state that given that the Talmud references are quite late, they can give no historically reliable information about the teachings or actions of Jesus during his life.\n\nAnother reference in early second century Rabbinic literature (Tosefta Hullin II 22) refers to Rabbi Eleazar ben Dama who was bitten by a snake, but was denied healing in the name of Jesus by another Rabbi for it was against the law, and thus died. This passage reflects the attitude of Jesus' early Jewish opponents, i.e. that his miracles were based on evil powers.\n\nEddy and Boyd, who question the value of several of the Talmudic references state that the significance of the Talmud to historical Jesus research is that it never denies the existence of Jesus, but accuses him of sorcery, thus indirectly confirming his existence. R. T. France and separately Edgar V. McKnight state that the divergence of the Talmud statements from the Christian accounts and their negative nature indicate that they are about a person who existed. Craig Blomberg states that the denial of the existence of Jesus was never part of the Jewish tradition, which instead accused him of being a sorcerer and magician, as also reflected in other sources such as Celsus. Andreas Kostenberger states that the overall conclusion that can be drawn from the references in the Talmud is that Jesus was a historical person whose existence was never denied by the Jewish tradition, which instead focused on discrediting him.\n\nPliny the Younger (c. 61 – c. 112), the provincial governor of Pontus and Bithynia, wrote to Emperor Trajan \"c\". 112 concerning how to deal with Christians, who refused to worship the emperor, and instead worshiped \"Christus\". Charles Guignebert, who does not doubt that Jesus of the Gospels lived in Gallilee in the 1st century, nevertheless dismisses this letter as acceptable evidence for a historical Jesus.\n\nThallus, of whom very little is known, and none of whose writings survive, wrote a history allegedly around the middle to late first century CE, to which Eusebius referred. Julius Africanus, writing \"c\" 221, links a reference in the third book of the \"History\" to the period of darkness described in the crucifixion accounts in three of the Gospels . It is not known whether Thallus made any mention to the crucifixion accounts; if he did, it would be the earliest noncanonical reference to a gospel episode, but its usefulness in determining the historicity of Jesus is uncertain. The dating of Thallus is dependent on him writing about an event during the 207th Olympiad (49–52 AD), which means he wrote after that date, not near that date. This depends on the text being corrupt, which would mean Thallus could have been writing after the 217th Olympiad (89–92 AD), or even the 167th Olympiad (112–109 BC). He is first referenced by Theophilus, writing around 180 AD, which means Thallus could have written any time between 109 BC and 180 AD. All we know is Thallus mentioned a solar eclipse, and as solar eclipses are not possible at Passover, that would mean Thallus was not talking about the crucifixion of Jesus at all.\n\nPhlegon of Tralles, AD 80–140, similar to Thallus, Julius Africanus mentions a historian named Phlegon who wrote a chronicle of history around AD 140, where he records:\n“Phlegon records that, in the time of Tiberius Caesar, at full moon, there was a full eclipse of the sun from the sixth to the ninth hour.” (Africanus, Chronography, 18:1) Phlegon is also mentioned by Origen (an early church theologian and scholar, born in Alexandria):\n“Now Phlegon, in the thirteenth or fourteenth book, I think, of his Chronicles, not only ascribed to Jesus a knowledge of future events . . . but also testified that the result corresponded to His predictions.” (Origen Against Celsus, Book 2, Chapter 14)\n“And with regard to the eclipse in the time of Tiberius Caesar, in whose reign Jesus appears to have been crucified, and the great earthquakes which then took place … ” (Origen Against Celsus, Book 2, Chapter 33)\n“Jesus, while alive, was of no assistance to himself, but that he arose after death, and exhibited the marks of his punishment, and showed how his hands had been pierced by nails.” (Origen Against Celsus, Book 2, Chapter 59). However, Eusebius in The Chronicon (written in the 4th century AD) records what Phlegon said verbatim. \"Now, in the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad [32 AD], a great eclipse of the sun occurred at the sixth hour [noon] that excelled every other before it, turning the day into such darkness of night that the stars could be seen in heaven, and the earth moved in Bithynia, toppling many buildings in the city of Nicaea.\" Phlegon never mentions Jesus or the 3 hour darkness. He also mentions a solar eclipse, which can not occur at Passover. Apart from the year (which may be a corruption), this description fits an earthquake and eclipse that occurred in North West Turkey on November, 29 AD.\n\nCelsus writing late in the second century produced the first full-scale attack on Christianity. Celsus' document has not survived but in the third century Origen replied to it, and what is known of Celsus' writing is through the responses of Origen. According to Origen, Celsus accused Jesus of being a magician and a sorcerer. While the statements of Celsus may be seen as valuable, they have little historical value, given that the wording of the original writings can not be examined.\n\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls are first century or older writings that show the language and customs of some Jews of Jesus' time. Scholars such as Henry Chadwick see the similar uses of languages and viewpoints recorded in the New Testament and the Dead Sea Scrolls as valuable in showing that the New Testament portrays the first century period that it reports and is not a product of a later period. However, the relationship between the Dead Sea scrolls and the historicity of Jesus has been the subject of highly controversial theories, and although new theories continue to appear, there is no overall scholarly agreement about their impact on the historicity of Jesus, despite the usefulness of the scrolls in shedding light on first-century Jewish traditions.\n\nThe following sources are disputed, and of limited historical value, but they are at least proof of Christians existing and being known and talked about in the first and second centuries.\n\nThere is a limestone burial box from the 1st century known as the James Ossuary with the Aramaic inscription, \"James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus.\" The authenticity of the inscription was challenged by the Israel Antiquities Authority, who filed a complaint with the Israeli police. In 2012, the owner of the ossuary was found not guilty, with the judge ruling that the authenticity of the ossuary inscription had not been proven either way. It has been suggested it was a forgery.\n\nVarious books, memoirs and stories were written about Jesus by the early Christians. The most famous are the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. All but one of these are believed to have been written within 50–70 years of the death of Jesus, with the Gospel of Mark believed to be the earliest, and the last the Gospel of John. Blainey writes that the oldest surviving record written by an early Christian is a short letter by St Paul: the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, which appeared about 25 years after the death of Jesus. This letter, while important in describing issues for the development of Gentilic Christianity, contains little of significance for understanding the life of the historic Jesus.\n\nBart Ehrman, Robert Eisenman and others critical of traditional Christian views, in assessing the problems involved in conducting historical Jesus research, say the Gospels are full of discrepancies, were written decades after Jesus' death, by authors who had not witnessed any events in Jesus' life. They go on to say the Gospels were authored not by eyewitnesses who were contemporary with the events that they narrate but rather by people who did not know Jesus, see anything he did, or hear anything he taught, and that the authors did not even share a language with Jesus. The accounts they produced are not disinterested; they are narratives produced by Christians who actually believed in Jesus, and were not immune from slanting the stories in light of their biases. Ehrman points out that the texts are widely inconsistent, full of discrepancies and contradictions in both details and larger portraits of who Jesus was.\n\nIn the context of Christian sources, even if all other texts are ignored, the Pauline epistles can provide some information regarding Jesus. This information does not include a narrative of the life of Jesus, and refers to his existence as a person, but adds few specific items apart from his death by crucifixion. This information comes from those letters of Paul whose authenticity is not disputed. Paul was not a companion of Jesus and claims his information comes from the holy spirit acquired after Jesus' death.\n\nOf the thirteen letters that bear Paul's name, seven are considered authentic by almost all scholars, and the others are generally considered pseudepigraphic. The 7 undisputed letters (and their approximate dates) are: 1 Thessalonians (c. 51 CE), Philippians (c. 52–54 CE), Philemon (c. 52–54 CE), 1 Corinthians (c. 53–54 CE), Galatians (c. 55 CE), 2 Corinthians (c. 55–56 CE) and Romans (c. 55–58 CE). The authenticity of these letters is accepted by almost all scholars, and they have been referenced and interpreted by early authors such as Origen and Eusebius.\n\nGiven that the Pauline epistles are generally dated to AD 50 to AD 60, they are the earliest surviving Christian texts that include information about Jesus. These letters were written approximately twenty to thirty years after the generally accepted time period for the death of Jesus, around AD 30–36. The letters were written during a time when Paul recorded encounters with the disciples of Jesus, e.g. states that several years after his conversion Paul went to Jerusalem and stayed with Apostle Peter for fifteen days. During this time, Paul disputed the nature of Jesus' message with Jesus's brother James, concerning the importance of adhering to kosher food restrictions and circumcision, important features of determining Jewish identity.\n\nThe Pauline letters were not intended to provide a narrative of the life of Jesus, but were written as expositions of Christian teachings. In Paul's view, the earthly life of Jesus was of a lower importance than the theology of his death and resurrection,a theme that permeates Pauline writings. However, the Pauline letters clearly indicate that for Paul Jesus was a real person (born of a woman as in Gal 4.4), a Jew (\"born under the law\", Romans 1.3) who had disciples (1 Corinthians 15.5), who was crucified (as in 1 Corinthians 2.2 and Galatians 3.1) and who resurrected from the dead (1 Corinthians 15.20, Romans 1.4 and 6.5, Philippians 3:10–11). And the letters reflect the general concept within the early Gentillic Christian Church that Jesus existed, was crucified and was raised from the dead.\n\nThe references by Paul to Jesus do not in themselves prove the existence of Jesus, but they do establish that the existence of Jesus was the accepted norm within the early Christians (including the Christian community in Jerusalem, given the references to collections there) twenty to thirty years after the death of Jesus, at a time when those who could have been acquainted with him could still be alive.\n\nThe seven Pauline epistles that are widely regarded as authentic include the following information that along with other historical elements are used to study the historicity of Jesus:\n\nThe existence of only these references to Jesus in the Pauline epistles has given rise to criticism of them by G. A. Wells, who is generally accepted as a leader of the movement to deny the historicity of Jesus. When Wells was still denying the existence of Jesus, he criticized the Pauline epistles for not mentioning items such as John the Baptist or Judas or the trial of Jesus and used that argument to conclude that Jesus was not a historical figure.\n\nJames D. G. Dunn addressed Wells' statement and stated that he knew of no other scholar that shared that view, and most other scholars had other and more plausible explanations for the fact that Paul did not include a narrative of the life of Jesus in his letters, which were primarily written as religious documents rather than historical chronicles at a time when the life story of Jesus could have been well known within the early Church. Dunn states that despite Wells' arguments, the theories of the non-existence of Jesus are a \"thoroughly dead thesis\".\n\nWhile Wells no longer denies the existence of Jesus, he has responded to Dunn, stating that his arguments from silence not only apply to Paul but all early Christian authors, and that he still has a low opinion of early Christian texts, maintaining that for Paul Jesus may have existed a good number of decades before.\n\nThe Pauline letters sometimes refer to creeds, or confessions of faith, that predate their writings. For instance reads: \"For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.\" refers to Romans 1:2 just before it which mentions an existing gospel, and in effect may be treating it as an earlier creed.\n\nOne of the keys to identifying a pre-Pauline tradition is given in \n\nHere Paul refers to others before him who preached the creed. James Dunn states that indicates that in the 30s Paul was taught about the death of Jesus a few years earlier.\n\nThe Pauline letters thus contain Christian creed elements of pre-Pauline origin. The antiquity of the creed has been located by many Biblical scholars to less than a decade after Jesus' death, originating from the Jerusalem apostolic community. Concerning this creed, Campenhausen wrote, \"This account meets all the demands of historical reliability that could possibly be made of such a text,\" whilst A. M. Hunter said, \"The passage therefore preserves uniquely early and verifiable testimony. It meets every reasonable demand of historical reliability.\"\n\nThese creeds date to within a few years of Jesus' death, and developed within the Christian community in Jerusalem. Although embedded within the texts of the New Testament, these creeds are a distinct source for Early Christianity. This indicates that existence and death of Jesus was part of Christian belief a few years after his death and over a decade before the writing of the Pauline epistles.\n\nThe four canonical gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, are the main sources for the biography of Jesus' life, the teachings and actions attributed to him. Three of these (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) are known as the synoptic Gospels, from the Greek σύν (syn \"together\") and ὄψις (opsis \"view\"), given that they display a high degree of similarity in content, narrative arrangement, language and paragraph structure. The presentation in the fourth canonical gospel, i.e. John, differs from these three in that it has more of a thematic nature rather than a narrative format. Scholars generally agree that it is impossible to find any direct literary relationship between the synoptic gospels and the Gospel of John.\n\nThe authors of the New Testament generally showed little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. The gospels were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity with the chronological timelines as a secondary consideration. One manifestation of the gospels being theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one third of their text to just seven days, namely the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem. Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, scholars have used them to reconstruct a number of portraits of Jesus. However, as stated in the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus.\n\nScholars have varying degrees of certainty about the historical reliability of the accounts in the gospels, and the only two events whose historicity is the subject of almost universal agreement among scholars are the baptism and crucifixion of Jesus. Scholars such as E.P. Sanders and separately Craig A. Evans go further and assume that two other events in the gospels are historically certain, namely that Jesus called disciples, and caused a controversy at the Temple.\n\nEver since the Augustinian hypothesis, scholars continue to debate the order in which the gospels were written, and how they may have influenced each other, and several hypothesis exist in that regard, e.g. the Markan priority hypothesis holds that the Gospel of Mark was written first c. 70 CE. In this approach, Matthew is placed at being sometime after this date and Luke is thought to have been written between 70 and 100 CE. However, according to the competing, and more popular, Q source hypothesis, the gospels were not independently written, but were derived from a common source called Q. The two-source hypothesis then proposes that the authors of Matthew and Luke drew on the Gospel of Mark as well as on Q.\n\nThe gospels can be seen as having three separate lines: A literary line which looks at it from a textual perspective, secondly a historical line which observes how Christianity started as a renewal movement within Judaism and eventually separated from it, and finally a theological line which analyzes Christian teachings. Within the historical perspective, the gospels are not simply used to establish the existence of Jesus as sources in their own right alone, but their content is compared and contrasted to non-Christian sources, and the historical context, to draw conclusions about the historicity of Jesus.\n\nTwo possible patristic sources that may refer to eye witness encounters with Jesus are the early references of Papias and Quadratus, reported by Eusebius of Caesarea in the 4th century.\n\nThe works of Papias have not survived, but Eusebius quotes him as saying:\n\nRichard Bauckham states that while Papias was collecting his information (c. 90), Aristion and the elder John (who were Jesus' disciples) were still alive and teaching in Asia minor, and Papias gathered information from people who had known them. However, the exact identity of the \"elder John\" is wound up in the debate on the authorship of the Gospel of John, and scholars have differing opinions on that, e.g. Jack Finegan states that Eusebius may have misunderstood what Papias wrote, and the elder John may be a different person from the author of the fourth gospel, yet still a disciple of Jesus. Gary Burge, on the other hand sees confusion on the part of Eusebius and holds the elder John to be different person from the apostle John.\n\nThe letter of Quadratus (possibly the first Christian apologist) to emperor Hadrian (who reigned 117 – 138) is likely to have an early date and is reported by Eusebius in his \"Ecclesiastical History\" 4.3.2 to have stated:\n\nBy \"our Savior\" Quadratus means Jesus and the letter is most likely written before AD 124. Bauckham states that by \"our times\" he may refer to his early life, rather than when he wrote (117–124), which would be a reference contemporary with Papias. Bauckham states that the importance of the statement attributed to Quadratus is that he emphasizes the \"eye witness\" nature of the testimonies to interaction with Jesus. Such \"eye witness statements\" abound in early Christian writings, particularly the pseudonymous Christian Apocrypha, Gospels and Letters, in order to give them credibility.\n\nA number of later Christian texts, usually dating to the second century or later, exist as New Testament apocrypha, among which the gnostic gospels have been of major recent interest among scholars. The 1945 discovery of the Nag Hammadi library created a significant amount of scholarly interest and many modern scholars have since studied the gnostic gospels and written about them. However, the trend among the 21st century scholars has been to accept that while the gnostic gospels may shed light on the progression of early Christian beliefs, they offer very little to contribute to the study of the historicity of Jesus, in that they are rather late writings, usually consisting of sayings (rather than narrative, similar to the hypothesised Q documents), their authenticity and authorship remain questionable, and various parts of them rely on components of the New Testament. The focus of modern research into the historical Jesus has been away from gnostic writings and towards the comparison of Jewish, Greco-Roman and canonical Christian sources.\n\nAs an example, Bart Ehrman states that gnostic writings of the Gospel of Thomas (part of the Nag Hammadi library) have very little value in historical Jesus research, because the author of that gospel placed no importance on the physical experiences of Jesus (e.g. his crucifixion) or the physical existence of believers, and was only interested in the secret teachings of Jesus rather than any physical events. Similarly, the Apocryphon of John (also part of the Nag Hammadi library) has been useful in studying the prevailing attitudes in the second century, and questions of authorship regarding the Book of revelation, given that it refers to , but is mostly about the post ascension teachings of Jesus in a vision, not a narrative of his life. Some scholars such as Edward Arnal contend that the Gospel of Thomas continues to remain useful for understanding how the teachings of Jesus were transmitted among early Christians, and sheds light on the development of early Christianity.\n\nThere is overlap between the sayings of Jesus in the apocryphal texts and canonical Christian writings, and those not present in the canonical texts are called agrapha. There are at least 225 agrapha but most scholars who have studied them have drawn negative conclusions about the authenticity of most of them and see little value in using them for historical Jesus research. Robert Van Voorst states that the vast majority of the agrapha are certainly inauthentic. Scholars differ on the number of authentic agrapha, some estimating as low as seven as authentic, others as high as 18 among the more than 200, rendering them of little value altogether. While research on apocryphal texts continues, the general scholarly opinion holds that they have little to offer to the study of the historicity of Jesus given that they are often of uncertain origin, and almost always later documents of lower value.\n\n\n"}

The main purpose of such reference works for users \"to find the word, or words, by which [an] idea may be most fitly and aptly expressed\" – to quote Peter Mark Roget, architect of the best known thesaurus in the English language.\n\nAlthough including synonyms, a thesaurus should not be taken as a complete list of all the synonyms for a particular word. The entries are also designed for drawing distinctions between similar words and assisting in choosing exactly the right word. Unlike a dictionary, a thesaurus entry does not give the definition of words.\n\nIn library science and information science, thesauri have been widely used to specify domain models. Recently, thesauri have been implemented with Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS).\n\nThe word \"thesaurus\" is derived from 16th-century New Latin, in turn from Latin \"thēsaurus\", which is the Latinisation of the Greek (\"thēsauros\"), \"treasure, treasury, storehouse\". The word \"thēsauros\" is of uncertain etymology. Douglas Harper derives it from the root of the Greek verb τιθέναι \"tithenai\", \"to put, to place.\" Robert Beekes rejected an Indo-European derivation and suggested a Pre-Greek suffix .\n\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, the term \"thesaurus\" was applied to any dictionary or encyclopedia, as in the \"Thesaurus linguae latinae\" (1532), and the \"Thesaurus linguae graecae\" (1572). The meaning \"collection of words arranged according to sense\" is first attested in 1852 in Roget's title and \"thesaurer\" is attested in Middle English for \"treasurer\".\n\nIn antiquity, Philo of Byblos authored the first text that could now be called a thesaurus. In Sanskrit, the Amarakosha is a thesaurus in verse form, written in the 4th century. Eventhough Amarakosha mentions 18 prior works, they have all been lost.\n\nThe first modern thesaurus was \"Roget's Thesaurus\", first compiled in 1805 by Peter Mark Roget, and published in 1852. Since its publication it has never been out of print and is still a widely used work across the English-speaking world. Entries in \"Roget's Thesaurus\" are listed conceptually rather than alphabetically.\nRoget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:\n\nIt is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.\nThesauri have been used to perform automatic word-sense disambiguation and text simplification for machine translation systems.\n\n"}
{"id": "303405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303405", "title": "Universal set", "text": "Universal set\n\nIn set theory, a universal set is a set which contains all objects, including itself. In set theory as usually formulated, the conception of a universal set leads to a paradox (Russell's paradox) and is consequently not allowed. However, some non-standard variants of set theory include a universal set.\n\nThere is no standard notation for the universal set of a given set theory. Common symbols include V, U and ξ.\n\nZermelo–Fraenkel set theory and related set theories, which are based on the idea of the cumulative hierarchy, do not allow for the existence of a universal set. It is directly contradicted by the axiom of regularity, and its existence would cause paradoxes which would make the theory inconsistent.\n\nRussell's paradox prevents the existence of a universal set in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory and other set theories that include Zermelo's axiom of comprehension.\nThis axiom states that, for any formula formula_1 and any set , there exists another set \nthat contains exactly those elements of that satisfy formula_3. If a universal set  existed and the axiom of comprehension could be applied to it, then\nthere would also exist another set formula_4, the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. However, as Bertrand Russell observed, this set is paradoxical. If it contains itself, then it should not contain itself, and vice versa. For this reason, it cannot exist.\n\nA second difficulty with the idea of a universal set concerns the power set of the set of all sets. Because this power set is a set of sets, it would necessarily be a subset of the set of all sets, provided that both exist. However, this conflicts with Cantor's theorem that the power set of any set (whether infinite or not) always has strictly higher cardinality than the set itself.\n\nThe difficulties associated with a universal set can be avoided either by using a variant of set theory in which the axiom of comprehension is restricted in some way, or by using a universal object that is not considered to be a set.\n\nThere are set theories known to be consistent (if the usual set theory is consistent) in which the universal set does exist (and formula_5 is true). In these theories, Zermelo's axiom of comprehension does not hold in general, and the axiom of comprehension of naive set theory is restricted in a different way. A set theory containing a universal set is necessarily a non-well-founded set theory.\nThe most widely studied set theory with a universal set is Willard Van Orman Quine's New Foundations. Alonzo Church and also published work on such set theories. Church speculated that his theory might be extended in a manner consistent with Quine's,\n\nAnother example is positive set theory, where the axiom of comprehension is restricted to hold only for the positive formulas (formulas that do not contain negations). Such set theories are motivated by notions of closure in topology.\n\nThe idea of a universal set seems intuitively desirable in the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, particularly because most versions of this theory do allow the use of quantifiers over all sets (see universal quantifier). One way of allowing an object that behaves similarly to a universal set, without creating paradoxes, is to describe and similar large collections as proper classes rather than as sets. One difference between a universal set and a universal class is that the universal class does not contain itself, because proper classes cannot be elements of other classes. Russell's paradox does not apply in these theories because the axiom of comprehension operates on sets, not on classes.\n\nThe category of sets can also be considered to be a universal object that is, again, not itself a set. It has all sets as elements, and also includes arrows for all functions from one set to another. \nAgain, it does not contain itself, because it is not itself a set.\n\n\n"}

The \"X\" comes from the Greek letter \"Chi\", which is the first letter of the Greek word \"Χριστός\", which in English is \"Christ\".\nThe \"-mas\" part is from the Latin-derived Old English word for \"Mass\".\n\nThere is a common misconception that the word \"Xmas\" stems from a secular attempt to remove the religious tradition from Christmas by taking the \"Christ\" out of \"Christmas\", but its use dates back to the 16th century.\n\n\"Xmas\" is deprecated by some modern style guides, including those at the \"New York Times\", \"The Times\", \"The Guardian\", and the BBC. Millicent Fenwick, in the 1948 \"Vogue's Book of Etiquette\", states that \"'Xmas' should never be used\" in greeting cards. \"The Cambridge Guide to Australian English Usage\" states that the spelling should be considered informal and restricted to contexts where concision is valued, such as headlines and greeting cards. \"The Christian Writer's Manual of Style\", while acknowledging the ancient and respectful use of \"Xmas\" in the past, states that the spelling should never be used in formal writing.\n\nEarly use of \"Xmas\" includes Bernard Ward's \"History of St. Edmund's college, Old Hall\" (originally published circa 1755). An earlier version, \"X'temmas\", dates to 1551. Around 1100 the term was written as \"Xp̄es mæsse\" in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". \"Xmas\" is found in a letter from George Woodward in 1753. Lord Byron used the term in 1811, as did Samuel Coleridge (1801) and Lewis Carroll (1864). In the United States, the fifth American edition of William Perry's \"Royal Standard English Dictionary\", published in Boston in 1800, included in its list of \"Explanations of Common Abbreviations, or Contraction of Words\" the entry: \"Xmas. Christmas.\" Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. used the term in a letter dated 1923. Since at least the late 19th century, \"Xmas\" has been in use in various other English-language nations. Quotations with the word can be found in texts first written in Canada, and the word has been used in Australia, and in the Caribbean. \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage\" stated that modern use of the term is largely limited to advertisements, headlines and banners, where its conciseness is valued. The association with commerce \"has done nothing for its reputation\", according to the dictionary.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the former Church of England Bishop of Blackburn, Alan Chesters, recommended to his clergy that they avoid the spelling.\nIn the United States, in 1977 New Hampshire Governor Meldrim Thomson sent out a press release saying that he wanted journalists to keep the \"Christ\" in Christmas, and not call it Xmas—which he called a \"pagan\" spelling of Christmas.\n\nThe abbreviation of Christmas as \"Xmas\" is the source of disagreement among Christians who observe the holiday. \n\nThe December 1957 \"News and Views\" published by the Church League of America, a conservative organization co-founded in 1937 by George Washington Robnett, attacked the use of Xmas in an article titled \"X=The Unknown Quantity\". The claims were picked up later by Gerald L. K. Smith, who in December 1966 claimed that Xmas was a \"blasphemous omission of the name of Christ\" and that \"'X' is referred to as being symbolical of the unknown quantity.\" Smith further argued that Jews introduced Santa Claus to suppress the New Testament accounts of Jesus, and that the United Nations, at the behest of \"world Jewry\", had \"outlawed the name of Christ\". There is, however, a well documented history of use of \"Χ\" (actually a chi) as an abbreviation for \"Christ\" (Χριστός) and possibly also a symbol of the cross. The abbreviation appears on many Orthodox Christian religious icons.\n\nDennis Bratcher, writing for a website for Christians, states \"there are always those who loudly decry the use of the abbreviation 'Xmas' as some kind of blasphemy against Christ and Christianity\". Among them are evangelist Franklin Graham and CNN journalist Roland S. Martin. Graham stated in an interview: \"for us as Christians, this is one of the most holy of the holidays, the birth of our savior Jesus Christ. And for people to take Christ out of Christmas. They're happy to say merry Xmas. Let's just take Jesus out. And really, I think, a war against the name of Jesus Christ.\" Roland Martin likewise relates the use of \"Xmas\" to his growing concerns of increasing commercialization and secularization of one of Christianity's highest holy days. Bratcher posits that those who dislike abbreviating the word are unfamiliar with a long history of Christians using X in place of \"Christ\" for various purposes.\n\nThe word \"Christ\" and its compounds, including \"Christmas\", have been abbreviated in English for at least the past 1,000 years, long before the modern \"Xmas\" was commonly used. \"Christ\" was often written as \"Xρ\" or \"Xt\"; there are references in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" as far back as 1021. This X and P arose as the uppercase forms of the Greek letters χ (Ch) and ρ (R) used in ancient abbreviations for Χριστος (Greek for \"Christ\"). The labarum, an amalgamation of the two Greek letters rendered as ☧, is a symbol often used to represent Christ in Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox Christian Churches.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\") and the \"OED Supplement\" have cited usages of \"X-\" or \"Xp-\" for \"Christ-\" as early as 1485. The terms \"Xtian\" and less commonly \"Xpian\" have also been used for \"Christian\". The \"OED\" further cites usage of \"Xtianity\" for \"Christianity\" from 1634. According to \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage\", most of the evidence for these words comes from \"educated Englishmen who knew their Greek\".\n\nIn ancient Christian art, χ and χρ are abbreviations for Christ's name. In many manuscripts of the \"New Testament\" and icons, Χ is an abbreviation for Χριστος, as is XC (the first and last letters in Greek, using the lunate sigma); compare IC for Jesus in Greek.\n\nOther proper names containing the name \"Christ\" besides those mentioned above are sometimes abbreviated similarly, either as \"X\" or \"Xt\", both of which have been used historically, e.g., \"Xtopher\" or \"Xopher\" for \"Christopher\", or \"Xtina\" or \"Xina\" for the name \"Christina\".\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, \"Xene\" and \"Exene\" were common spellings for the given name Christine. The American singer Christina Aguilera has sometimes gone by the name \"Xtina\". Similarly, Exene Cervenka has been a noted American singer-songwriter since 1977.\n\nThis usage of \"X\" to spell the syllable \"kris\" (rather than the sounds \"ks\") has extended to \"xtal\" for \"crystal\", and on florists' signs to \"xant\" for \"chrysanthemum\", even though these words are not etymologically related to \"Christ\": \"crystal\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"ice\" (and not even using the letter χ), and \"chrysanthemum\" comes from Greek words meaning \"golden flower\", while \"Christ\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"anointed\".\n\nIn the animated television series \"Futurama\", which is set in the 31st century, Xmas is the official name for the day formerly known as Christmas (which, in the episode \"Xmas Story\", is said to have become an \"archaic pronunciation\").\n\nIn the American version of the board game \"Monopoly\", players can draw a card from the Community Chest which reads: \"Xmas fund matures. Collect $100\".\n\n\n"}
