It was inspired by the collaboration during the 1910s between two of the most remarkable pure mathematicians of the twentieth century, Srinivasa Ramanujan from India, and the Cambridge University don G.H. Hardy.\n\nIt was a co-production between the UK-based theatre company Complicite and Theatre Royal, Plymouth, and Ruhrfestspiele, Wiener Festwochen, and the Holland Festival. \"A Disappearing Number\" premiered in Plymouth in March 2007, toured internationally, and played at The Barbican Centre in Autumn 2007 and 2008 and at Lincoln Center in July 2010. It was directed by Simon McBurney with music by Nitin Sawhney. The production is 110 minutes with no intermission.\n\nThe piece was co-devised and written by the cast and company. The cast in order of appearance: Firdous Bamji, Saskia Reeves, David Annen, Paul Bhattacharjee, Shane Shambu, Divya Kasturi and Chetna Pandya.\n\nRamanujan first attracted Hardy's attention by writing him a letter in which he proved that\n\nwhere the notation formula_2 indicates a Ramanujan summation.\n\nHardy realised that this confusing presentation of the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ was an application of the Riemann zeta function formula_3 with formula_4. Ramanujan's work became the foundation of string theory.\n\nThe play includes live \"tabla\" playing, which \"morphs seductively into pure mathematics\", as the \"Financial Times\" review put it, \"especially when … its rhythms shade into chants of number sequences reminiscent of the libretto to Philip Glass's \"Einstein on the Beach\". One can hear the beauty of the sequences without grasping the rules that govern them.\"\n\nThe play has two strands of narrative and presents strong visual and physical theatre. It interweaves the passionate intellectual relationship between Hardy and the more intuitive Ramanujan, with the present-day story of Ruth, an English maths lecturer, and her husband, a globe-trotting Indian-American businessman \"to illuminate the beauty and the patterns — the mystery — of mathematics.\" It also explores the nature and spirituality of infinity, and explores several aspects of the Indian diaspora.\n\nRuth travels to India in Ramanujan's footsteps and eventually dies. Al follows, to get closer to her ghost. Meanwhile, 100 years previously, Ramanujan is travelling in the opposite direction, making the trip to England, where he works with Hardy on maths and contracts tuberculosis. Partition (as a maths concept) is explored, and diverging and converging series in mathematics become a metaphor for the Indian diaspora.\n\n\n\n"}

The notion of almost everywhere is a companion notion to the concept of measure zero. In the subject of probability, which is largely based in measure theory, the notion is referred to as \"almost surely\".\n\nMore specifically, a property holds almost everywhere if the set of elements for which the property does not hold is a set of measure zero (Halmos 1974), or equivalently if the set of elements for which the property holds is conull. In cases where the measure is not complete, it is sufficient that the set is contained within a set of measure zero. When discussing sets of real numbers, the Lebesgue measure is assumed unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe term \"almost everywhere\" is abbreviated \"a.e.\"; in older literature \"p.p.\" is used, to stand for the equivalent French language phrase \"presque partout\".\n\nA set with full measure is one whose complement is of measure zero. In probability theory, the terms \"almost surely\", \"almost certain\" and \"almost always\" refer to events with probability 1, which are exactly the sets of full measure in a probability space.\n\nOccasionally, instead of saying that a property holds almost everywhere, it is said that the property holds for almost all elements (though the term almost all also has other meanings).\n\nIf formula_1 is a measure space, a property formula_2 is said to hold almost everywhere in formula_3 if there exists a set formula_4 with formula_5, and for formula_6, formula_7 has property formula_2. Another common way of expressing the same thing is to say that \"almost every point satisfies formula_2\" or \"for almost every formula_7, formula_11 holds\".\n\nIt is \"not\" required that the set formula_12 has measure 0; it may not belong to formula_13.\n\n\nAs a consequence of the first two properties, it is often possible to reason about \"almost every point\" of a measure space as though it were an ordinary point rather than an abstraction. This is often done implicitly in informal mathematical arguments. However, one must be careful with this mode of reasoning because of the third bullet above: universal quantification over uncountable families of statements is valid for ordinary points but not for \"almost every point\".\n\nOutside of the context of real analysis, the notion of a property true almost everywhere is sometimes defined in terms of an ultrafilter. An ultrafilter on a set \"X\" is a maximal collection \"F\" of subsets of \"X\" such that:\nA property \"P\" of points in \"X\" holds almost everywhere, relative to an ultrafilter \"F\", if the set of points for which \"P\" holds is in \"F\".\n\nFor example, one construction of the hyperreal number system defines a hyperreal number as an equivalence class of sequences that are equal almost everywhere as defined by an ultrafilter.\n\nThe definition of \"almost everywhere\" in terms of ultrafilters is closely related to the definition in terms of measures, because each ultrafilter defines a finitely-additive measure taking only the values 0 and 1, where a set has measure 1 if and only if it is included in the ultrafilter.\n\n"}
{"id": "54171755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54171755", "title": "Analysis of Boolean functions", "text": "Analysis of Boolean functions\n\nIn mathematics and theoretical computer science, analysis of Boolean functions is the study of real-valued functions on formula_1 or formula_2 from a spectral perspective (such functions are sometimes known as pseudo-Boolean functions). The functions studied are often, but not always, Boolean-valued, making them Boolean functions. The area has found many applications in combinatorics, social choice theory, random graphs, and theoretical computer science, especially in hardness of approximation, property testing and PAC learning.\n\nWe will mostly consider functions defined on the domain formula_2. Sometimes it is more convenient to work with the domain formula_1 instead. If formula_5 is defined on formula_2, then the corresponding function defined on formula_1 is\n\nSimilarly, for us a Boolean function is a formula_9-valued function, though often it is more convenient to consider formula_10-valued functions instead.\n\nEvery real-valued function formula_11 has a unique expansion as a multilinear polynomial:\n\nThis is the Hadamard transform of the function formula_5, which is the Fourier transform in the group formula_14. The coefficients formula_15 are known as \"Fourier coefficients\", and the entire sum is known as the \"Fourier expansion\" of formula_5. The functions formula_17 are known as \"Fourier characters\", and they form an orthonormal basis for the space of all functions over formula_2, with respect to the inner product formula_19.\n\nThe Fourier coefficients can be calculated using an inner product:\n\nIn particular, this shows that formula_21 Parseval's identity states that\n\nIf we skip formula_23, then we get the variance of formula_5:\n\nThe \"degree\" of a function formula_11 is the maximum formula_27 such that formula_28 for some set formula_29 of size formula_27. In other words, the degree of formula_5 is its degree as a multilinear polynomial.\n\nIt is convenient to decompose the Fourier expansion into \"levels\": the Fourier coefficient formula_15 is on level formula_33.\n\nThe \"degree formula_27\" part of formula_5 is\n\nUsing this we can define the noise stability and the noise sensitivity, as before.\n\nThe Russo–Margulis formula states that for monotone Boolean functions formula_37,\n\nBoth the influence and the probabilities are taken with respect to formula_39, and on the right-hand side we have the average sensitivity of formula_5. If we think of formula_5 as a property, then the formula states that as formula_42 varies, the derivative of the probability that formula_5 occurs at formula_42 equals the average sensitivity at formula_42.\n\nThe Russo–Margulis formula is key for proving sharp threshold theorems such as Friedgut's.\n\nOne of the deepest results in the area, the invariance principle, connects the distribution of functions on the Boolean cube formula_2 to their distribution on \"Gaussian space\", which is the space formula_47 endowed with the standard formula_48-dimensional Gaussian measure.\n\nMany of the basic concepts of Fourier analysis on the Boolean cube have counterparts in Gaussian space:\n\n\nGaussian space is more symmetric than the Boolean cube (for example, it is rotation invariant), and supports continuous arguments which may be harder to get through in the discrete setting of the Boolean cube. The invariance principle links the two settings, and allows deducing results on the Boolean cube from results on Gaussian space.\n\nIf formula_54 has degree at most 1, then formula_5 is either constant, equal to a coordinate, or equal to the negation of a coordinate. In particular, formula_5 is a \"dictatorship\": a function depending on at most one coordinate.\n\nThe Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem, also known as the \"FKN theorem\", states that if formula_5 \"almost\" has degree 1 then it is \"close\" to a dictatorship. Quantitatively, if formula_54 and formula_59, then formula_5 is formula_61-close to a dictatorship, that is, formula_62 for some Boolean dictatorship formula_63, or equivalently, formula_64 for some Boolean dictatorship formula_63.\n\nSimilarly, a Boolean function of degree at most formula_27 depends on at most formula_67 coordinates, making it a \"junta\" (a function depending on a constant number of coordinates). The Kindler–Safra theorem generalizes the Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem to this setting. It states that if formula_54 satisfies formula_69 then formula_5 is formula_61-close to a Boolean function of degree at most formula_27.\n\nThe Poincaré inequality for the Boolean cube (which follows from formulas appearing above) states that for a function formula_11,\n\nThis implies that formula_75.\n\nThe Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem, also known as the \"KKL theorem\", states that if formula_5 is Boolean then formula_77.\n\nThe bound given by the Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem is tight, and is achieved by the \"Tribes\" function of Ben-Or and Linial:\n\nThe Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem was one of the first results in the area, and was the one introducing hypercontractivity into the context of Boolean functions.\n\nIf formula_54 is an formula_80-junta (a function depending on at most formula_80 coordinates) then formula_82 according to the Poincaré inequality.\n\nFriedgut's theorem is a converse to this result. It states that for any formula_83, the function formula_5 is formula_85-close to a Boolean junta depending on formula_86 coordinates.\n\nCombined with the Russo–Margulis lemma, Friedgut's junta theorem implies that for every formula_42, every monotone function is close to a junta with respect to formula_88 for some formula_89.\n\nThe invariance principle generalizes the Berry–Esseen theorem to non-linear functions.\n\nThe Berry–Esseen theorem states (among else) that if formula_90 and no formula_91 is too large compared to the rest, then the distribution of formula_5 over formula_2 is close to a normal distribution with the same mean and variance.\n\nThe invariance principle (in a special case) informally states that if formula_5 is a multilinear polynomial of bounded degree over formula_95 and all influences of formula_5 are small, then the distribution of formula_5 under the uniform measure over formula_2 is close to its distribution in Gaussian space.\n\nMore formally, let formula_99 be a univariate Lipschitz function, let formula_100, let formula_101, and let\nformula_102. Suppose that formula_103. Then\n\nBy choosing appropriate formula_99, this implies that the distributions of formula_5 under both measures are close in CDF distance, which is given by formula_107.\n\nThe invariance principle was the key ingredient in the original proof of the \"Majority is Stablest\" theorem.\n\nA Boolean function formula_54 is \"linear\" if it satisfies formula_109, where formula_110. It is not hard to show that the Boolean linear functions are exactly the characters formula_17.\n\nIn property testing we want to test whether a given function is linear. It is natural to try the following test: choose formula_112 uniformly at random, and check that formula_109. If formula_5 is linear then it always passes the test. Blum, Luby and Rubinfeld showed that if the test passes with probability formula_115 then formula_5 is formula_61-close to a Fourier character. Their proof was combinatorial.\n\nBellare et al. gave an extremely simple Fourier-analytic proof, that also shows that if the test succeeds with probability formula_118, then formula_5 is correlated with a Fourier character. Their proof relies on the following formula for the success probability of the test:\n\nArrow's impossibility theorem states that for three and more candidates, the only unanimous voting rule for which there is always a Condorcet winner is a dictatorship.\n\nThe usual proof of Arrow's theorem is combinatorial. Kalai gave an alternative proof of this result in the case of three candidates using Fourier analysis. If formula_54 is the rule that assigns a winner among two candidates given their relative orders in the votes, then the probability that there is a Condorcet winner given a uniformly random vote is formula_122, from which the theorem easily follows.\n\nThe FKN theorem implies that if formula_5 is a rule for which there is almost always a Condorcet winner, then formula_5 is close to a dictatorship.\n\nA classical result in the theory of random graphs states that the probability that a formula_125 random graph is connected tends to formula_126 if formula_127. This is an example of a \"sharp threshold\": the width of the \"threshold window\", which is formula_128, is asymptotically smaller than the threshold itself, which is roughly formula_129. In contrast, the probability that a formula_125 graph contains a triangle tends to formula_131 when formula_132. Here both the threshold window and the threshold itself are formula_133, and so this is a \"coarse threshold\".\n\nFriedgut's sharp threshold theorem states, roughly speaking, that a monotone graph property (a graph property is a property which doesn't depend on the names of the vertices) has a sharp threshold unless it is correlated with the appearance of small subgraphs. This theorem has been widely applied to analyze random graphs and percolation.\n\nOn a related note, the KKL theorem implies that the width of threshold window is always at most formula_134.\n\nLet formula_135 denote the majority function on formula_48 coordinates. Sheppard's formula gives the asymptotic noise stability of majority:\n\nThis is related to the probability that if we choose formula_138 uniformly at random and form formula_139 by flipping each bit of formula_140 with probability formula_141, then the majority stays the same:\n\nThere are Boolean functions with larger noise stability. For example, a dictatorship formula_143 has noise stability formula_53.\n\nThe Majority is Stablest theorem states, informally, then the only functions having noise stability larger than majority have influential coordinates. Formally, for every formula_83 there exists formula_146 such that if formula_54 has expectation zero and formula_148, then formula_149.\n\nThe first proof of this theorem used the invariance principle in conjunction with an isoperimetric theorem of Borell in Gaussian space; since then more direct proofs were devised.\n\nMajority is Stablest implies that the Goemans–Williamson approximation algorithm for MAX-CUT is optimal, assuming the unique games conjecture. This implication, due to Khot et al., was the impetus behind proving the theorem.\n"}
{"id": "58379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58379", "title": "Arcadia (play)", "text": "Arcadia (play)\n\nArcadia is a 1993 play by Tom Stoppard concerning the relationship between past and present, order and disorder, certainty and uncertainty. It has been praised by many critics as the finest play from one of the most significant contemporary playwrights in the English language. In 2006, the Royal Institution of Great Britain named it one of the best science-related works ever written.\n\n\"Arcadia\" is set in Sidley Park, an English country house in Derbyshire, and takes place in both 1809/1812 and the present day (1993 in the original production). The activities of two modern scholars and the house's current residents are juxtaposed with those of the people who lived there in the earlier period.\n\nIn 1809, Thomasina Coverly, the daughter of the house, is a precocious teenager with ideas about mathematics, nature and physics well ahead of her time. She studies with her tutor Septimus Hodge, a friend of Lord Byron (an unseen guest in the house). In the present, writer Hannah Jarvis and literature professor Bernard Nightingale converge on the house: she is investigating a hermit who once lived on the grounds; he is researching a mysterious chapter in the life of Byron. As their studies unfold – with the help of Valentine Coverly, a post-graduate student in mathematical biology – the truth about what happened in Thomasina's time is gradually revealed.\n\nThe play's set features a large table, used by the characters in both past and present. Props are not removed when the play switches time period; books, coffee mugs, quill pens, portfolios, and laptop computers appear together, blurring past and present. An ancient but still living tortoise also appears in every scene, symbolising long-suffering endurance and the continuity of existence.\n\nThe play opens on 10 April 1809, in a garden-front room of the house. Septimus Hodge is trying to distract 13-year-old Thomasina from her curiosity about \"carnal embrace\" by challenging her to prove Fermat's Last Theorem; he also wants to focus on reading the poem \"The Couch of Eros\" by Ezra Chater, a guest at the house. Thomasina starts asking why jam mixed in rice pudding can never be unstirred, which leads her on to the topic of determinism and to a beginning theory about chaotic shapes in nature. This is interrupted by Chater himself, who is angry that his wife was caught in the aforementioned \"carnal embrace\" with Septimus; he has come to demand a duel. Septimus tries to defuse the situation by heaping praise on \"The Couch of Eros\". The tactic works, because Chater does not know it was Septimus who savaged an earlier work of his, \"The Maid of Turkey\". Then landscape architect Richard Noakes enters, shortly accompanied by Captain Brice and Lady Croom; the three discuss proposed modifications to the gardens, while Thomasina sketches an imaginary hermit on Noakes's technical drawing of the garden.\n\nThe setting shifts to the present day. Hannah Jarvis is researching the house, the garden, and specifically the hermit, for a study of hermits and the Romantic imagination. Bernard Nightingale enters with Chloe Coverly; she conceals his identity from Hannah, as he had given Hannah's last book a poor review. Chloe's brother, Valentine, is gathering data on the population biology of the grouse in the surrounding grounds, using the house's \"game books\". When Chloe accidentally reveals Bernard's identity, Hannah reacts angrily; but she agrees to share her research material, which enables him to propose the theory that one of the 1809 inhabitants, Ezra Chater, was killed in a duel by Lord Byron. Bernard notes that records of Chater the poet disappeared after 1809, and the only other Chater of record is a botanist.\n\nThe third scene returns to the earlier time frame; Septimus is again tutoring Thomasina, this time in translating Latin. Again their focus diverts, this time to the destruction of the Alexandrian Library, which upsets Thomasina. She mourns the loss of the knowledge stored there, and Septimus responds that all that was lost will eventually turn up again. They are again interrupted by Chater, who succeeds in challenging Septimus to the duel, having learned (from Lord Byron off-stage) that Septimus wrote the damning review.\n\nHannah rediscovers Thomasina's primer containing her ideas on iteration and chaos theory; this recalls Septimus' assertion that what was lost is eventually rediscovered. Valentine reacts with interest to the notes, as his own research centres on similar concepts.\n\nStill in the present, Bernard gives Hannah, Valentine, and Chloe a preview of his lecture theorising that Lord Byron shot and killed Chater in a duel. When Hannah and Valentine challenge his logic, Bernard launches into a diatribe about the irrelevance of science, then departs for his lecture (and a promotional media appearance) in London. Hannah begins to suspect that the hermit of Sidley Park – who was reportedly obsessed with algebraic computations about the heat death of the universe, the theory suggested in Thomasina's diagram – could have been Septimus.\n\nReturning to 1809, we learn that the duel never occurred. Instead, the Chaters left for the West Indies with Captain Brice, Mr. Chater serving as the expedition's botanist and Mrs. Chater as the captain's secret paramour. Lord Byron has also left the country. Septimus has gone rabbit hunting for Thomasina, who favours rabbit pie; he returns to find Lady Croom searching for him. She has found two letters Septimus wrote in case he should die in the duel: one to Thomasina, is about rice pudding, and the other is a love letter addressed to herself. Lady Croom invites Septimus to an amorous rendezvous.\n\nThe final scene takes place in both 1812 and the present, the actions running concurrently. Some present-day characters are in fancy dress for a party, so that both casts appear similarly attired. Chloe reads a newspaper report on the Byron murder theory and then talks about determinism with Valentine, echoing the discussion between Septimus and Thomasina. Chloe, however, believes that sex is the force disrupting the universe's ordered plan. Valentine, using his computer to extrapolate Thomasina's ideas, relates them to the concept of entropy; he wonders whether Thomasina or Septimus was the genius behind the theories. Hannah and Valentine mention that Thomasina died in a fire on the eve of her seventeenth birthday.\n\nMeanwhile, Thomasina asks Septimus to teach her to dance, for her forthcoming birthday party. Lady Croom enters, complaining to Noakes about the noise of his steam engine; Thomasina notes that the machine obeys the laws of entropy (which have not yet been formalized), which describe the universe as winding down. In the present, Bernard arrives and is met by Hannah, who has found a letter detailing the facts of Chater's death – this discovery totally discredits his theory and vindicates Lord Byron's reputation. While Septimus awaits appropriate music for Thomasina's dance lesson, he examines the sketch she made to illustrate the irreversibility of heat; his action mirrors that of Hannah and Valentine, who also pondered the same diagram. Bernard is caught in a compromising position with Chloe, and is asked to depart.\n\nEventually a waltz starts, and Septimus dances with Thomasina, their relationship increasingly complicated by hints of romance. Gus (Valentine and Chloe's younger brother, who has been silent for the entire play) hands another of Thomasina's drawings to a surprised Hannah. It depicts Septimus and the tortoise, confirming her suspicion that the hermit, who had a tortoise called Plautus, was actually Septimus. After Thomasina's tragic death, he apparently became a hermit; accepting her challenge to the laws of the universe as propounded by Newton, he worked for the rest of his life to apply \"honest English algebra\" to the question of the universe's future.\n\n\n\n\"Arcadia\" is, on the surface, somewhere between a tragedy and a comedy. It involves some elements of classical tragedy — \"noble\" characters and the audience's foreknowledge of Thomasina's death — but the predominant element is comedy, in the way that the characters interact with each other and in their witty, epigrammatic dialogue.\n\n\"Arcadia\" explores the nature of evidence and truth in the context of modern ideas about history, mathematics and physics. It shows how clues left by the past are interpreted in the present, by both laypeople and scholars. Stoppard has said that his initial inspiration came from reading James Gleick's 1987 bestseller, \"\", \"which is about this new kind of mathematics. That sounds fairly daunting if one's talking about a play. I thought, here is a marvellous metaphor.\" Besides chaos, the play attends to a wide array of subjects, including thermodynamics, computer algorithms, fractals, population dynamics, determinism (especially in the context of love and death), classics, landscape design, Romanticism vs. Classicism, English literature (particularly poetry), Byron, 18th century periodicals, modern academia, and even South Pacific botany. These are all concrete topics of conversation; their more abstract resonances rise into epistemology, nihilism, and the origins of lust and madness.\n\n\"Arcadia\"'s themes are presented in a series of dichotomies. Most prominent is chaos versus order. The play's characters and action embody this, moving from a settled social order, in which relationships arise, toward the final scene, where the social order – and even the separation of the two eras – dissolve in the party's chaos, relationships collapse, and the characters die or disperse. Yet within that chaos, order can still be found. As Valentine declares: \"In an ocean of ashes, islands of order. Patterns making themselves out of nothing.\" Although the play's world grows increasingly chaotic – with overlapping time periods, increasingly complex ideas, and ever greater variations in social norms and assumptions — connections and order can still be discerned. The characters attempt to find and articulate the order they perceive in their world, even as it is continually overturned.\n\nThe center-stage table that collects props from both time periods throughout the play is a vivid metaphor of the chaos/order dichotomy. As Paul Edwards, professor of English and History of Art at Bath Spa University, explains: \"At the end of the play, the table has accumulated a variety of objects that, if one saw them without having seen the play, would seem completely random and disordered. Entropy is high. But if one has seen the play, one has full information about the objects and the hidden 'order' of their arrangement, brought about by the performance itself. Entropy is low; this can be proved by reflecting that tomorrow night's performance of the play will finish with the table in a virtually identical 'disorder' — which therefore cannot really be disorder at all.\"\n\nA closely related theme in \"Arcadia\" is the opposition of Classicism and Romanticism. This appears most clearly in the running argument between Noakes and Lady Croom about proposed changes to the garden. They all involve moving from the tidy order of Classic style to the rugged naturalism and Gothic mystery of the Romantic. A parallel dichotomy is expressed by Septimus and Thomasina: He instructs her in the Newtonian vision of the universe, while she keeps posing questions and proposing theories that undercut it. Hannah's search for the hermit of Sidley Park also touches on this theme. \"The whole Romantic sham!\" she passionately exclaims to Bernard. \"It's what happened to the Enlightenment, isn't it? A century of intellectual rigour turned in on itself. A mind in chaos suspected of genius ... The decline from thinking to feeling.\"\n\nAnother major theme is entropy and the irreversibility of time. Thomasina examines this scientifically, remarking that while Newtonian equations work both backwards and forwards, things in reality – like her rice pudding – cannot be \"unstirred.\" Heat, too, she notes, flows in only one direction (the second law of thermodynamics). This is embodied by the characters, who burn bridges in relationships, burn candles, and burn letters – and in the end, Thomasina herself (like a short-lived candle) burns to death.\n\nThomasina's insights into thermodynamics and heat transfer, and the idea that the universe is cooling, echo the poem \"Darkness\" by her \"real life\" contemporary, Lord Byron. Written in 1816 — the \"Year Without a Summer\", caused by atmospheric ash from the volcano Mount Tambora erupting in the Dutch East Indies — \"Darkness\" depicts a world grown dark and cold because the sun has been extinguished.\n\nThe play's end brings all these dichotomous themes together, showing that while things may appear to contradict — Romanticism and Classicism, intuition and logic, thought and feeling — they can exist, paradoxically, in the same time and space. Order is found amid the chaos.\n\nJim Hunter writes that \"Arcadia\" is a relatively realistic play, compared to Stoppard's other works, though the realism is \"much enhanced and teased about by the alternation of two eras\". The setting and characters are true-to-life, without being archetypal. It is comprehensible: the plot is both logical and probable, following events in a linear fashion. \"Arcadia\"'s major deviation from realism, of course, is in having two plotlines that are linear and parallel. Thus we see Thomasina deriving her mathematical equations to describe the forms of nature; we later see Val, with his computer, plotting them to produce the image of a leaf.\n\nThe language of \"Arcadia\" switches between the colloquialisms of early 19th century England and those of modern England. Stoppard's language reflects his periods, historical and modern, and he uses speech patterns and lexicons in keeping with his characters.\n\nBut his is a stylised dialogue, conveying the \"look and feel\" of the past as perceived by the modern audience. Still, it has sufficient latitude in register to make plain the relationships between the characters. For example, Septimus, after failing to deflect a question from Thomasina with a joke, bluntly explains to his pupil the nature of \"carnal embrace\" – but this bluntness is far removed from that with which he repudiates Chater's defence of his wife's honour (which he says \"could not be adequately defended with a platoon of musketry\"). With Lady Croom, who sees Mrs. Chater as a \"harlot\", Septimus delicately admits that \"her passion is not as fixed\" as one might wish.\n\nIn the modern sequences, the dialogue is more realistic. But Bernard consciously assumes some stylisation of language: He rehearses his public lecture in heightened, flamboyant rhetoric; and he unleashes a \"performance art\" polemic against Valentine's scientific thought, not from spite but for \"recreation\".\n\nThe play's scientific concepts are set forth primarily in the historical scenes, where Thomasina delivers her precocious (or even anachronistic) references to entropy, the deterministic universe and iterated equations in improvised, colloquial terms. In the modern era, Valentine explains the significance of Thomasina's rediscovered notebook with careful detail, reflecting Stoppard's research into his play's scientific materials.\n\nConsciously echoed phrases, across the time frames, help to unify the play. For example, Chloe asks Valentine if \"the future is all programmed like a computer\", and whether she is the first to think that theory discredited \"because of sex\". Thomasina has been there before: \"If you could stop every atom in its position and direction ... you could write the formula for all the future,\" she tells Septimus, then adds, \"Am I the first person to have thought of this?\" The difference is significant: Chloe's intuitive version allows for the effects of chaos, illustrating Stoppard's theme of the interdependence of science and art, and between professional and amateur thinking.\n\nThe play's title is abbreviated from its initial version: \"Et in Arcadia ego\". \"Arcadia\" refers to the pastoral ideal; the phrase literally translates, \"and in Arcadia I am\". The tradition of placing a tomb in a pastoral idyll can be traced to Virgil's \"Eclogues\", while the phrase first appears in Poussin's 1637 painting. Both the image and the motto are commonly considered a \"memento mori\", with the phrase being spoken by Death: \"I, too, am in Arcadia\". But the enigmatic phrase remains a subject of much academic discussion.\n\nLady Croom, enthusing about paintings of pretty landscapes, translates the phrase as \"Here I am in Arcadia!\" Thomasina drily comments, \"Yes Mama, if you would have it so\". Septimus notices; later, suspecting his pupil will appreciate the motto's true meaning, he offers the translation \"Even in Arcadia, there am I\". He is right – \"Oh, phooey to Death!\" she exclaims. Although these brief exchanges are the only direct references in the play to its title, they presage the two main characters' fates: Thomasina's early death, and Septimus's voluntary exile from life. Stoppard originally wanted to make this connection more explicit by using \"Et in Arcadia Ego\" for the title, but \"box office sense prevailed\".\n\nIn a more obvious sense, the title also invokes the ideal of nature as an ordered paradise, while the estate's landscape steadily evolves into a more irregular form. This provides a recurring image of the different ways in which \"true nature\" can be understood, and a homely parallel to Thomasina's theoretical description of the natural world's structure and entropic decline using mathematics.\n\nIn \"Arcadia\", Stoppard presents his audience with several highly complex but fundamental mathematical and scientific concepts. He also uses these theories and ideas to illuminate relationships among his characters, adding to their poignancy.\n\nOne of the play's main thematic concepts is chaos theory. Paul Edwards, in his essay \"Science in \"Hapgood\" and \"Arcadia\"\", notes that \"chaos mathematics is about the recovery of information from apparently chaotic and random systems where entropy is high. [...] It is 'asymmetric' (unlike the equations of classical physics), yet it finds regularities that prove to be the regularities of nature itself. Strikingly, this mathematics can generate patterns of amazing complexity, but it also has the power to generate seemingly natural or organic shapes that defeat Newtonian geometry. The promise, then, (however questionable it is in reality) is that information, and by extension, nature itself, can overcome the tendency to increase in entropy\".\n\nJohn Fleming, in his book \"Stoppard's Theatre: Finding Order amid Chaos\", makes a similar observation. \"Deterministic chaos\", he writes, \"deals with systems of unpredictable determinism. ... [T]he uncertainty does not result in pure randomness, but rather in complex patterns. Traditionally, scientists expected dynamic systems to settle into stable, predictable behavior.\" But as systems respond to variations in input, they become more random or chaotic. \"Surprisingly, within these random states, windows of order reappear. [...] There is order in chaos — an unpredictable order, but a determined order nonetheless, and not merely random behavior.\"\n\nClosely related scientific and mathematical concepts in \"Arcadia\" are the second law of thermodynamics and entropy. Fleming describes these two principles. \"Entropy is the measure of the randomness or disorder of a system. The law of increase of entropy states that as a whole, the universe is evolving from order to disorder. This relates to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that heat spontaneously flows in only one direction, from hotter to colder. Since these equations, unlike Newton's laws of motion, do not go backward and forward, there is an 'arrow of time' that points toward the eventual 'heat death' of the universe.\"\n\nIn \"Arcadia\", Stoppard uses all these concepts to reveal that \"there is an underlying order to seemingly random events.\" The characters discuss these topics, while their interactions reflect them.\n\nSome ideas in the play recall Goethe's novella \"Elective Affinities\": Stoppard's characters \"Thomasina\" and \"Septimus\" have parallels in Goethe's \"Ottilie\" and \"Eduard\", and the historical section of Stoppard's play is set in 1809, the year of Goethe's novella. Among other parallels, the older work takes the theory of affinity between chemical elements as a metaphor for ineluctable, inevitable \"human chemistry\" in the same way as Stoppard makes use of the force of determinism acting on his characters. A feature of both works is the preoccupation with remodelling country house landscapes; Goethe's young character \"Ottilie\" (the counterpart to Thomasina) dies as an indirect result of this.\n\n\"Arcadia\" first opened at the Royal National Theatre in London on 13 April 1993, in a production directed by Trevor Nunn with Rufus Sewell as Septimus Hodge, Felicity Kendal as Hannah Jarvis, Bill Nighy as Bernard Nightingale, Emma Fielding as Thomasina Coverly, Alan Mitchell as Jellaby, Derek Hutchinson as Ezra Chater, Sidney Livingston as Richard Noakes, Harriet Walter as Lady Croom, Graham Sinclair as Captain Brice, Harriet Harrison as Chloe Coverly, Timothy Matthews as Augustus and Gus Coverly and Samuel West as Valentine Coverly. It won the 1993 Olivier and Evening Standard Awards for Best Play.\n\nThe first New York production opened in March 1995, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. It was again directed by Trevor Nunn, but with an entirely new cast. It starred Billy Crudup as Septimus, Blair Brown as Hannah, Victor Garber as Bernard, Robert Sean Leonard as Valentine and Jennifer Dundas as Thomasina. This production was the Broadway debut of Paul Giamatti, who played Ezra Chater. The other actors were Lisa Banes (Lady Croom), Richard Clarke (Jellaby), John Griffin (Gus/Augustus), Peter Maloney (Noakes), David Manis (Captain Brice, RN) and Haviland Morris (Chloe). This production won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, and was nominated for the 1995 Tony Award for Best Play, losing to Terrence McNally's \"Love! Valour! Compassion!\".\n\nIn December 1996, the first major US regional production was mounted at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C.\n\nOn 27 May 2009, a London production, directed by David Leveaux, opened at the Duke of York's Theatre starring Dan Stevens (Septimus Hodge), Samantha Bond (Hannah Jarvis), Jessie Cave (Thomasina Coverly), Nancy Carroll (Lady Croom), Trevor Cooper (Richard Noakes), Sam Cox (Jellaby), Lucy Griffiths (Chloë Coverly), Tom Hodgkins (Captain Brice), Hugh Mitchell (Augustus/Gus Coverly), Neil Pearson (Bernard Nightingale), George Potts (Ezra Chater) and Ed Stoppard (Valentine Coverly). The production recouped its costs and closed on 12 September 2009.\n\n\"Arcadia\" returned to Broadway, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, on 17 March 2011, again directed by David Leveaux. The cast included Margaret Colin (Lady Croom), Billy Crudup (Septimus in the original Broadway version, now playing Bernard Nightingale), Raúl Esparza (Valentine Coverly), Glenn Fleshler (Captain Brice), Grace Gummer (Chloë Coverly), Edward James Hyland (Jellaby), Byron Jennings (Richard Noakes), Bel Powley (Thomasina Coverly), Tom Riley (Septimus Hodge), Noah Robbins (Gus Coverly/Augustus Coverly), David Turner (Ezra Chater), and Lia Williams (Hannah Jarvis). The production was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play.\n\n\"The Times\", reviewing the first production in 1993, praised it as a \"perfect marriage of ideas and high comedy\". But for some, the ideas overwhelmed the comedy: \"[T]oo clever by about two-and-three-quarters,\" noted \"The Daily Mail\". \"One comes away instructed with more than one can usefully wish to know.\" After an eight-month run at the National, the play's transfer to the West End gave an opportunity for re-appraisal. \"The Daily Telegraph\" critic commented: \"I have never left a play more convinced that I had just witnessed a masterpiece\".\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" described the play as \"Tom Stoppard's richest, most ravishing comedy to date, a play of wit, intellect, language, brio and, new for him, emotion\". But other New York reviews were mixed or unfavourable, complaining of the anachronisms and lack of realism. The production left John Simon of \"New York Magazine\" with the view that \"Stoppard overdoes it…\"Arcadia\" makes better reading than seeing\".\n\nThe 2009 London revival prompted more critics to laud the play as \"Stoppard's finest work\". Michael Billington wrote in \"The Guardian\" that the play \"gets richer with each viewing. ... [T]here is poetry and passion behind the mathematics and metaphysics.\" Johann Hari of \"The Independent\" speculated that \"Arcadia\" would be recognised \"as the greatest play of its time\".\n\nThe 2011 Broadway staging met with a mixed reception. Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" called the production \"a half-terrific revival of Mr. Stoppard's entirely terrific \"Arcadia\"\", noting that \"several central roles are slightly miscast\", and \"some of the performances from the Anglo-American cast are pitched to the point of incoherence.\" Similar concerns were raised by critics from the \"New York\" magazine, \"The Hollywood Reporter\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"New York Daily News\", \"Time Out New York\" and Bloomberg News.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "87141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87141", "title": "Connectedness", "text": "Connectedness\n\nIn mathematics, connectedness is used to refer to various properties meaning, in some sense, \"all one piece\". When a mathematical object has such a property, we say it is connected; otherwise it is disconnected. When a disconnected object can be split naturally into connected pieces, each piece is usually called a \"component\" (or \"connected component\").\n\nA topological space is said to be \"connected\" if it is not the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets. A set is open if it contains no point lying on its boundary; thus, in an informal, intuitive sense, the fact that a space can be partitioned into disjoint open sets suggests that the boundary between the two sets is not part of the space, and thus splits it into two separate pieces.\n\nFields of mathematics are typically concerned with special kinds of objects. Often such an object is said to be \"connected\" if, when it is considered as a topological space, it is a connected space. Thus, manifolds, Lie groups, and graphs are all called \"connected\" if they are connected as topological spaces, and their components are the topological components. Sometimes it is convenient to restate the definition of connectedness in such fields. For example, a graph is said to be \"connected\" if each pair of vertices in the graph is joined by a path. This definition is equivalent to the topological one, as applied to graphs, but it is easier to deal with in the context of graph theory. Graph theory also offers a context-free measure of connectedness, called the clustering coefficient.\n\nOther fields of mathematics are concerned with objects that are rarely considered as topological spaces. Nonetheless, definitions of \"connectedness\" often reflect the topological meaning in some way. For example, in category theory, a category is said to be \"connected\" if each pair of objects in it is joined by a sequence of morphisms. Thus, a category is connected if it is, intuitively, all one piece.\n\nThere may be different notions of \"connectedness\" that are intuitively similar, but different as formally defined concepts. We might wish to call a topological space \"connected\" if each pair of points in it is joined by a path. However this condition turns out to be stronger than standard topological connectedness; in particular, there are connected topological spaces for which this property does not hold. Because of this, different terminology is used; spaces with this property are said to be \"path connected\". While not all connected spaces are path connected, all path connected spaces are connected.\n\nTerms involving \"connected\" are also used for properties that are related to, but clearly different from, connectedness. For example, a path-connected topological space is \"simply connected\" if each loop (path from a point to itself) in it is contractible; that is, intuitively, if there is essentially only one way to get from any point to any other point. Thus, a sphere and a disk are each simply connected, while a torus is not. As another example, a directed graph is \"strongly connected\" if each ordered pair of vertices is joined by a directed path (that is, one that \"follows the arrows\").\n\nOther concepts express the way in which an object is \"not\" connected. For example, a topological space is \"totally disconnected\" if each of its components is a single point.\n\nProperties and parameters based on the idea of connectedness often involve the word \"connectivity\". For example, in graph theory, a connected graph is one from which we must remove at least one vertex to create a disconnected graph. In recognition of this, such graphs are also said to be \"1-connected\". Similarly, a graph is \"2-connected\" if we must remove at least two vertices from it, to create a disconnected graph. A \"3-connected\" graph requires the removal of at least three vertices, and so on. The \"connectivity\" of a graph is the minimum number of vertices that must be removed, to disconnect it. Equivalently, the connectivity of a graph is the greatest integer \"k\" for which the graph is \"k\"-connected.\n\nWhile terminology varies, noun forms of connectedness-related properties often include the term \"connectivity\". Thus, when discussing simply connected topological spaces, it is far more common to speak of \"simple connectivity\" than \"simple connectedness\". On the other hand, in fields without a formally defined notion of \"connectivity\", the word may be used as a synonym for \"connectedness\".\n\nAnother example of connectivity can be found in regular tilings. Here, the connectivity describes the number of neighbors accessible from a single tile:\n"}

The CAP of a model represents the cumulative number of positive outcomes along the \"y\"-axis versus the corresponding cumulative number of a classifying parameter along the \"x\"-axis. The CAP is distinct from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), which plots the true-positive rate against the false-positive rate.\n\nAn example is a model that predicts whether a product is bought (positive outcome) by each individual from a group of people (classifying parameter) based on factors such as their gender, age, income etc. If group members would be contacted at random, the cumulative number of products sold would rise linearly toward a maximum value corresponding to the total number of buyers within the group. This distribution is called the \"random\" CAP. A perfect prediction, on the other hand, determines exactly which group members will buy the product, such that the maximum number of products sold will be reached with a minimum number of calls. This produces a steep line on the CAP curve that stays flat once the maximum is reached (contacting all other group members will not lead to more products sold), which is the \"perfect\" CAP.\n\nA successful model predicts the likelihood of individuals purchasing the product and ranks these probabilities to produce a list of potential customers to be contacted first. The resulting cumulative number of sold products will increase rapidly and eventually flatten out to the given maximum as more group members are contacted. This results in a distribution that lies between the random and the perfect CAP curves.\n\nThe CAP can be used to evaluate a model by comparing the curve to the perfect CAP in which the maximum number of positive outcomes is achieved directly and to the random CAP in which the positive outcomes are distributed equally. A good model will have a CAP between the perfect CAP and the random CAP with a better model tending to the perfect CAP.\n\nThe accuracy ratio (AR) is defined as the ratio of the area between the model CAP and the random CAP and the area between the perfect CAP and the random CAP. For a successful model the AR has values between zero and one, with a higher value for a stronger model.\n\nAnother indication of the model strength is given by the cumulative number of positive outcomes at 50% of the classifying parameter. For a successful model this value should lie between 50% and 100% of the maximum, with a higher percentage for stronger models.\n\nThe CAP and the ROC are both commonly used by banks and regulators to analyze the discriminatory ability of rating systems that evaluate the credit risks \n"}

{"id": "52722478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52722478", "title": "Fractal expressionism", "text": "Fractal expressionism\n\nThe term fractal expressionism was coined by physicist-artist Richard Taylor and co-authors to distinguish fractal art generated directly by artists from fractal art generated using mathematics and/or computers. Fractals are patterns that repeat at increasingly fine scales and are prevalent in natural scenery (examples include clouds, rivers, and mountains). Fractal expressionism implies a direct expression of nature's patterns in an art work.\n\nThe initial studies of fractal expressionism focused on the poured paintings by the American artist Jackson Pollock (1912-1956), whose work has traditionally been associated with the abstract expressionist movement. Pollock’s patterns had previously been referred to as “natural” and “organic”, inviting speculation by author John Briggs in 1992 that Pollock's work featured fractals. In 1997, Taylor built a pendulum device called the Pollockizer which painted fractal patterns bearing a similarity to Pollock’s work. Computer analysis of Pollock's work published by Taylor et al. in a 1999 Nature article found that Pollock's painted patterns have characteristics that match those displayed by nature's fractals (specifically, they demonstrate a statistical self-similarity quantified by a non-integer dimension over a magnification range of 1.5-2 orders of magnitude). This analysis supported clues (see below) that Pollock's patterns are fractal and reflect \"the fingerprint of nature\".\n\nTaylor noted several similarities between Pollock's painting style and the processes used by nature to construct its landscapes. For instance, he cites Pollock's propensity to revisit paintings that he had not adjusted in several weeks as being comparable to cyclic processes in nature, such as the seasons or the tides. Furthermore, Taylor observed several visual similarities between the patterns produced by nature and those produced by Pollock as he painted. He points out that Pollock abandoned the use of a traditional frame for his paintings, preferring instead to roll out his canvas on the floor; this, Taylor asserts, is more compatible with how nature works than traditional painting techniques because the patterns in nature's scenery are not artificially bounded.\n\nThe perceived similarities between the processes and patterns involved in Pollock's paintings and those of nature compelled Taylor to posit that the same \"basic trademark\" of nature's pattern construction also appears in Pollock's work. Since some natural fractals are generated by a process known as \"chaos\", including fractals in human physiology, Taylor believed that Pollock's painting process might also have been chaotic, and could therefore leave behind a fractal pattern. Taylor's hypothesis seems to be reflected in Pollock's statement \"I am nature\", which he made when asked if nature was a source of inspiration for his work. Furthermore, Pollock is also quoted as stating \"No chaos, damn it\", in response to a Time magazine article that referred to his paintings as \"chaotic\". However, chaos theory was not understood until after Pollock's death, so he could not have been referring to the chaotic systems in nature but rather its common usage to mean disorder. In the famous film footage of Hans Namuth, Pollock says his paintings are no accident, and that he was able to control the flow of paint onto the canvas.\n\nTaylor points to two aspects of Pollock's painting process that have the potential to introduce fractal patterns. The first is Pollock's motion as he moved around the canvas, which Taylor hypothesized followed a Levy flight, a type of chaotic motion that is known to leave behind a fractal pattern. More specifically, a number of studies have shown that the motions associated with human balance have fractal characteristics. The second source of chaos could be introduced through Pollock's pouring technique. Falling fluid has the capability of changing from a non-chaotic to a chaotic flow, meaning that Pollock could have introduced a chaotic flow of paint as he dripped it onto the canvas. Although the fractal characteristics of human balance and falling liquid are generated on Pollock's painting time and length scales, physicist Predrag Cvitanovic notes that it would be quite an artistic challenge to control them: such parameters \"are in no sense observable and measurable on the length-scales and time-scales dominated by chaotic dynamics\".\n\nSince Taylor's initial Pollock analysis in 1999, more than ten research groups have used various forms of fractal analysis to successfully quantify Pollock’s work. In addition to analyzing Pollock's work for fractal content, some groups such as that of computer scientist Bruce Gooch, have used computers to generate Pollock-like images by varying their fractal characteristics. Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot (who invented the term fractal) and art theorist Francis O’Connor (the chief Pollock scholar) are well known advocates of fractal expressionism.\n\nFractal expressionism is related to fractal fluency because the latter provides an appealing motivation for why artists such as Pollock might aspire to Fractal Expressionism. Fractal fluency is a neuroscience model that proposes that, through exposure to nature’s fractal scenery, people’s visual systems have adapted to efficiently process fractals with ease. This adaptation occurs at many stages of the visual system, from the way people’s eyes move to which regions of the brain get activated. Fluency puts the viewer in a ‘comfort zone’ so inducing an aesthetic experience. Neuroscience experiments have shown that Pollock’s paintings induce the same positive physiological responses in the observer as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals.\n\nIn light of fractal fluency and the associated aesthetics, other artists might be expected to display fractal expressionism. One year before Taylor’s publication, mathematician Richard Voss quantified Chinese art using fractal analysis. Subsequently, other groups have used computer analysis to identify fractal content in a number of Western and Eastern artists, most recently in Pollock’s colleague Willem De Kooning’s work.\n\nIn addition to the above analyzed works, symbolic representations of fractals can be found in cultures across the continents spanning several centuries, including Roman, Egyptian, Aztec, Incan and Mayan civilizations. They frequently predate patterns named after the mathematicians who subsequently developed their visual characteristics. For example, although von Koch is famous for developing The Koch Curve in 1904, a similar shape featuring repeating triangles was first used to depict waves in friezes by Hellenic artists (300 B.C.E.). In the 13th century, repetition of triangles in Cosmati Mosaics generated a shape later known in mathematics as The Sierpinski Triangle (named after Sierpinski’s 1915 pattern). Triangular repetitions are also found in the 12th century pulpit of The Ravello Cathedral in Italy. The lavish artwork within The Book of Kells (circa 800 C.E.) and the sculpted arabesques in The Jain Dilwara Temple in Mount Abu, India (1031 C.E.) also both reveal stunning examples of exact fractals. The artistic works of Leonardo da Vinci and Katsushika Hokusai serve as more recent examples from Europe and Asia, each reproducing the recurring patterns that they saw in nature. Da Vinci’s sketch of turbulence in water, The Deluge (1571–1518), was composed of small swirls within larger swirls of water. In The Great Wave off Kanagawa (1830–1833), Hokusai portrayed a wave crashing on a shore with small waves on top of a large wave. Other woodcuts from the same period also feature repeating patterns at several size scales: The Ghost of Kohada Koheiji shows fissures in a skull and The Falls At Mt. Kurokami features branching channels in a waterfall.\n\nVoss's 1998 study of Chinese art was the first demonstration of using fractal analysis to distinguish between the works of different artists. Following Taylor's 1999 Pollock publication, Art conservator Jim Coddington proposed that fractal analysis should be explored as a technique to help authenticate Pollock paintings. In 2005, Taylor and colleagues published a fractal analysis of 14 authentic and 37 imitation Pollocks suggesting that, when combined with other techniques, fractal analysis might be useful for authenticating Pollock's work. In the same year, The Pollock-Krasner Foundation requested a fractal analysis to be used for the first time in an authenticity dispute, The analysis identified “significant deviations from Pollock’s characteristics.” Taylor cautioned that the results should be “coupled with other important information such as provenance, connoisseurship and materials analysis.” Two years later, materials scientists showed that pigments on the paintings dated from after Pollock’s death.\nIn 2006, the use of fractals to authenticate Pollocks stirred controversy. This controversy was triggered by physicists Katherine Jones-Smith and Harsh Mathur who claimed that the fractal characteristics identified by Taylor et al. are also present in crude sketches made in Adobe Photoshop, and deliberately fraudulent poured paintings made by other artists Thus, according to Jones-Smith and Mathur, labeling Pollock's paintings as \"fractal\" is meaningless, because the same characteristics are found in other non-fractal images. However, Taylor's rebuttal published in Nature showed that Taylor's group's fractal analysis could distinguish between Pollock paintings and the crude sketches, and identified further limitations in Jones-Smith and Mathur's analysis.\n\nJones-Smith and Mathur raised a valid concern applicable to all forms of fractal expressionism: are art works too small for the painted patterns to repeat over sufficient magnifications to assume the visual characteristics of fractals? In the case of Pollock paintings, the largest range used by Taylor et al. to determine each fractal parameter in a Pollock painting is less than two orders of magnitude in magnification. Nature's fractals repeat over limited magnification ranges (typically just over one order of magnitude), prompting scientists to debate what range is required to reliably establish fractal behavior.<ref name=\"Ave/Man\">[Avnir, David, Ofer Biham, Daniel M. Lidar, and Ofer Malcai. \"Is the Geometry of Nature Fractal?\" Science 279.5347 (1998): 39-40. Print.]</ref> Mandelbrot refused to include a required magnification range in his definition of fractals and instead noted that it is the range necessary to generate the properties associated with fractal repetition. In the case of Pollock's work, this would be the magnification range necessary for the patterns to generate the fractal aesthetics. Neuroscience experiments have shown that this magnification range is less than two orders and that Pollock’s paintings do indeed induce the same physiological responses as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals Mandelbrot concluded \"I do believe that Pollocks are fractal.\"\n\nAt the time of the controversy, Coddington summarized as follows: “Fractal geometry has begun to play an important role in the authentication of the work of Jackson Pollock. We believe such analyses are necessary for pushing the field forward.” The most recent results, In 2015, by computer scientist Lior Shamir showed that, when combined with other pattern parameters, fractal analysis can be used to distinguish between real and imitation Pollocks with 93% accuracy. He found that the fractal parameters were the most powerful contributors to the detection accuracy\n"}

The names galea and batello refer to a boat which the outline of the work was thought to resemble.\n\nAn earlier version of this method was used as early as 825 by Al-Khwarizmi. The galley method is thought to be of Arab origin and is most effective when used on a sand abacus. However, Lam Lay Yong's research pointed out that the galley method of division originated in the 1st century AD in ancient China.\n\nThe galley method writes fewer figures than long division, and results in interesting shapes and pictures as it expands both above and below the initial lines. It was the preferred method of division for seventeen centuries, far longer than long division's four centuries.\n\nSet up the problem by writing the dividend and then a bar. The quotient will be written after the bar. Steps:\nNow multiply each digit of the divisor by the new digit of the quotient and subtract that from the left-hand segment of the dividend. Where the subtrahend and the dividend segment differ, cross out the dividend digit and write if necessary the subtrahend digit and next vertical empty space. Cross out the divisor digit used.\n\nThe above is called the cross-out version and is the most common. An erasure version exists for situations where erasure is acceptable and there is not need to keep track of the intermediate steps. This is the method used with a sand abacus. Finally, there is a printers' method that uses neither erasure or crossouts. Only the top digit in each column of the dividend is active with a zero used to denote an entirely inactive column.\nGalley division was the favorite method of division with arithmeticians through the 18th century and it is thought that it fell out of use due to the lack of cancelled types in printing. It is still taught in the Moorish schools of North Africa and other parts of the Middle East.\n\nLam Lay Yong, mathematics professor of National University of Singapore, traced the origin of the galley method to the \"Sunzi Suanjing\" written about 400AD. The division described by Al-Khwarizmi in 825 was identical to the Sunzi algorithm for\ndivision.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37822732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37822732", "title": "History of network traffic models", "text": "History of network traffic models\n\nDesign of robust and reliable networks and network services relies on an understanding of the traffic characteristics of the network. Throughout history, different models of network traffic have been developed and used for evaluating existing and proposed networks and services.\n\nDemands on computer networks are not entirely predictable. Performance modeling is necessary for deciding the quality of service (QoS) level. Performance models in turn, require accurate traffic models that have the ability to capture the statistical characteristics of the actual traffic on the network. Many traffic models have been developed based on traffic measurement data. If the underlying traffic models do not efficiently capture the characteristics of the actual traffic, the result may be the under-estimation or over-estimation of the performance of the network. This impairs the design of the network. Traffic models are hence, a core component of any performance evaluation of networks and they need to be very accurate.\n\n“Teletraffic theory is the application of mathematics to the measurement, modeling, and control of traffic in telecommunications networks. The aim of traffic modeling is to find stochastic processes to represent the behavior of traffic. Working at the Copenhagen Telephone Company in the 1910s, A. K. Erlang famously characterized telephone traffic at the call level by certain probability distributions for arrivals of new calls and their holding times. Erlang applied the traffic models to estimate the telephone switch capacity needed to achieve a given call blocking probability. The Erlang blocking formulas had tremendous practical interest for public carriers because telephone facilities (switching and transmission) involved considerable investments. Over several decades, Erlang’s work stimulated the use of queuing theory, and applied probability in general, to engineer the public switched telephone network. Teletraffic theory for packet networks has seen considerable progress in recent decades. Significant advances have been made in long-range dependence, wavelet, and multifractal approaches. At the same time, traffic modeling continues to be challenged by evolving network technologies and new multimedia applications. For example, wireless technologies allow greater mobility of users. Mobility must be an additional consideration for modeling traffic in wireless networks. Traffic modeling is an ongoing process without a real end. Traffic models represent our best current understanding of traffic behavior, but our understanding will change and grow over time.”\n\nMeasurements are useful and necessary for verifying the actual network performance. However, measurements do not have the level of abstraction that makes traffic models useful. Traffic models can be used for hypothetical problem solving whereas traffic measurements only reflect current reality. In probabilistic terms, a traffic trace is a realization of a random process, whereas a traffic model is a random process. Thus, traffic models have universality. A traffic trace gives insight about a particular traffic source, but a traffic model gives insight about all traffic sources of that type. Traffic models have three major uses. One important use of traffic models is to properly dimension network resources for a target level of QoS. It was mentioned earlier that Erlang developed models of voice calls to estimate telephone switch capacity to achieve a target call blocking probability. Similarly, models of packet traffic are needed to estimate the bandwidth and buffer resources to provide acceptable packet delays and packet loss probability. Knowledge of the average traffic rate is not sufficient. It is known from queuing theory that queue lengths increase with the variability of traffic. Hence, an understanding of traffic burstiness or variability is needed to determine sufficient buffer sizes at nodes and link capacities. A second important use of traffic models is to verify network performance under specific traffic controls. For example, given a packet scheduling algorithm, it would be possible to evaluate the network performance resulting from different traffic scenarios. For another example, a popular area of research is new improvements to the TCP congestion avoidance algorithm. It is critical that any algorithm is stable and allows multiple hosts to share bandwidth fairly, while sustaining a high throughput. Effective evaluation of the stability, fairness, and throughput of new algorithms would not be possible without realistic source models. A third important use of traffic models is admission control. In particular, connection oriented networks such as ATM depends on admission control to block new connections to maintain QOS guarantees. A simple admission strategy could be based on the peak rate of a new connection; a new connection is admitted if the available bandwidth is greater than the peak rate. However, that strategy would be overly conservative because a variable bit-rate connection may need significantly less bandwidth than its peak rate. A more sophisticated admission strategy is based on effective bandwidths. The source traffic behavior is translated into an effective bandwidth between the peak rate and average rate, which is the specific amount of bandwidth required to meet a given QoS constraint. The effective bandwidth depends on the variability of the source.\n\nTraffic modeling consists of three steps:\nParameter estimation is based on a set of statistics (e.g. mean, variance, density function or auto covariance function, multifractal characteristics) that are measured or calculated from observed data. The set of statistics used in the inference process depends on the impact they may have in the main performance metrics of interest.\n\nIn recent years several types of traffic behavior, that can have significant impact on network performance, were discovered: long-range dependence, self-similarity and, more recently, multifractality.\nThere are two major parameters generated by network traffic models: packet length distributions and packet inter-arrival distributions. Other parameters, such as routes, distribution of destinations, etc., are of less importance. Simulations that use traces generated by network traffic models usually examine a single node in the network, such as a router or switch; factors that depend on specific network topologies or routing information are specific to those topologies and simulations. The problem of packet size distribution is fairly well-understood today. Existing models of packet sizes have proven to be valid and simple. Most packet size models do not consider the problem of order in packet sizes. For example, a TCP datagram in one direction is likely to be followed by a tiny ACK in the other direction about half of one Round-Trip Time (RTT) later. The problem of packet inter-arrival distribution is much more difficult. Understanding of network traffic has evolved significantly over the years, leading to a series of evolutions in network traffic models.\n\nOne of the earliest objections to self-similar traffic models was the difficulty in mathematical analysis. Existing self-similar models could not be used in conventional queuing models. This limitation was rapidly overturned and workable models were constructed. Once basic self-similar models became feasible, the traffic modeling community settled into the “detail” concerns. TCP’s congestion control algorithm complicated the matter of modeling traffic, so solutions needed to be created. Parameter estimation of self-similar models was always difficult, and recent research addresses ways to model network traffic without fully understanding it.\n\nWhen self-similar traffic models were first introduced, there were no efficient, analytically tractable processes to generate the models. Ilkka Norros devised a stochastic process for a storage model with self-similar input and constant bit-rate output. While this initial model was continuous rather than discrete, the model was effective, simple, and attractive.\nAll self-similar traffic models suffer from one significant drawback: estimating the self-similarity parameters from real network traffic requires huge amounts of data and takes extended computation. The most modern method, wavelet multi-resolution analysis, is more efficient, but still very costly. This is undesirable in a traffic model. SWING uses a surprisingly simple model for the network traffic analysis and generation. The model examines characteristics of users, Request-Response Exchanges (RREs), connections, individual packets, and the overall network. No attempt is made to analyze self-similarity characteristics; any self-similarity in the generated traffic comes naturally from the aggregation of many ON/OFF sources.\nThe Pareto distribution process produces independent and identically distributed (IID) inter-arrival times. In general if X is a random variable with a Pareto distribution, then the probability that X is greater than some number x is given by P(X > x) = (x/x_m)-k for all x ≥ x_m where k is a positive parameter and x_m is the minimum possible value of Xi The probability distribution and the density functions are represented as:\nF(t) = 1 – (α/t)β where α,β ≥ 0 & t ≥ α\nf(t) = βαβ t-β-1\nThe parameters β and α are the shape and location parameters, respectively. The Pareto distribution is applied to model self-similar arrival in packet traffic. It is also referred to as double exponential, power law distribution. Other important characteristics of the model are that the Pareto distribution has infinite variance, when β ≥ 2 and achieves infinite mean, when β ≤ 1.\nThe Weibull distributed process is heavy-tailed and can model the fixed rate in ON period and ON/OFF period lengths, when producing self-similar traffic by multiplexing ON/OFF sources. The distribution function in this case is given by:\nF(t) = 1 – e-(t/β)α t > 0\nand the density function of the weibull distribution is given as:\nf(t) = αβ-α tα-1 e -(t/β)α t > 0\nwhere parameters β ≥ 0 and α > 0 are the scale and location parameters respectively.\nThe Weibull distribution is close to a normal distribution. For β ≤ 1 the density function of the distribution is L shaped and for values of β > 1, it is bell shaped. This distribution gives a failure rate increasing with time. For β > 1, the failure rate decreases with time. At, β = 1, the failure rate is constant and the lifetimes are exponentially distributed.\nThe Autoregressive model is one of a group of linear prediction formulas that attempt to predict an output y_n of a system based on previous set of outputs {y_k} where k < n and inputs x_n and {x_k} where k < n. There exist minor changes in the way the predictions are computed based on which, several variations of the model are developed. Basically, when the model depends only on the previous outputs of the system, it is referred to as an auto-regressive model. It is referred to as a Moving Average Model (MAM), if it depends on only the inputs to the system. Finally, Autoregressive-Moving Average models are those that depend both on the inputs and the outputs, for prediction of current output. Autoregressive model of order p, denoted as AR(p), has the following form:\nXt = R1 Xt-1 + R2 Xt-2 + ... + Rp Xt-p + Wt\nwhere Wt is the white noise, Ri are real numbers and Xt are prescribed correlated random numbers. The auto-correlation function of the AR(p) process consists of damped sine waves depending on whether the roots (solutions) of the model are real or imaginary. Discrete Autoregressive Model of order p, denoted as DAR(p), generates a stationary sequence of discrete random variables with a probability distribution and with an auto-correlation structure similar to that of the Autoregressive model of order p.[3]\nRegression models define explicitly the next random variable in the sequence by previous ones within a specified time window and a moving average of a white noise.[5]\nTransform-expand-sample (TES) models are non-linear regression models with modulo-1 arithmetic. They aim to capture both auto-correlation and marginal distribution of empirical data. TES models consist of two major TES processes: TES+ and TES–. TES+ produces a sequence which has positive correlation at lag 1, while TES– produces a negative correlation at lag 1.\n\nEarly traffic models were derived from telecommunications models and focused on simplicity of analysis. They generally operated under the assumption that aggregating traffic from a large number of sources tended to smooth out bursts; that burstiness decreased as the number of traffic sources increased.\nOne of the most widely used and oldest traffic models is the Poisson Model. The memoryless Poisson distribution is the predominant model used for analyzing traffic in traditional telephony networks. The Poisson process is characterized as a renewal process. In a Poisson process the inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed with a rate parameter λ: P{An ≤ t} = 1 – exp(-λt). The Poisson distribution is appropriate if the arrivals are from a large number of independent sources, referred to as Poisson sources. The distribution has a mean and variance equal to the parameter λ.\nThe Poisson distribution can be visualized as a limiting form of the binomial distribution, and is also used widely in queuing models. There are a number of interesting mathematical properties exhibited by Poisson processes. Primarily, superposition of independent Poisson processes results in a new Poisson process whose rate is the sum of the rates of the independent Poisson processes. Further, the independent increment property renders a Poisson process memoryless. Poisson processes are common in traffic applications scenarios that consist of a large number of independent traffic streams. The reason behind the usage stems from Palm's Theorem which states that under suitable conditions, such large number of independent multiplexed streams approach a Poisson process as the number of processes grows, but the individual rates decrease in order to keep the aggregate rate constant. Nevertheless, it is to be noted that traffic aggregation need not always result in a Poisson process. The two primary assumptions that the Poisson model makes are:\n1. The number of sources is infinite\n2. The traffic arrival pattern is random.\nIn the compound Poisson model, the base Poisson model is extended to deliver batches of packets at once. The inter-batch arrival times are exponentially distributed, while the batch size is geometric Mathematically, this model has two parameters, λ, the arrival rate, and ρ in (0,1), the batch parameter. Thus, the mean number of packets in a batch is 1/ ρ, while the mean inter-batch arrival time is 1/ λ. Mean packet arrivals over time period t are tλ/ ρ.\nThe compound Poisson model shares some of the analytical benefits of the pure Poisson model: the model is still memoryless, aggregation of streams is still (compound) Poisson, and the steady-state equation is still reasonably simple to calculate, although varying batch parameters for differing flows would complicate the derivation.\nMarkov models attempt to model the activities of a traffic source on a network, by a finite number of states. The accuracy of the model increases linearly with the number of states used in the model. However, the complexity of the model also increases proportionally with increasing number of states. An important aspect of the Markov model - the Markov Property, states that the next (future) state depends only on the current state. In other words, the probability of the next state, denoted by some random variable Xn+1, depends only on the current state, indicated by Xn, and not on any other state Xi, where i<n. The set of random variables referring to different states {Xn} is referred to as a Discrete Markov Chain.\nAnother attempt at providing a bursty traffic model is found in Jain and Routhier’s Packet Trains model. This model was principally designed to recognize that address locality applies to routing decisions; that is, packets that arrive near each other in time are frequently going to the same destination. In generating a traffic model that allows for easier analysis of locality, the authors created the notion of packet trains, a sequence of packets from the same source, traveling to the same destination (with replies in the opposite direction). Packet trains are optionally sub-divided into tandem trailers. Traffic between a source and a destination usually consists of a series of messages back and forth. Thus, a series of packets go one direction, followed by one or more reply packets, followed by a new series in the initial direction. Traffic quantity is then a superposition of packet trains, which generates substantial bursty behavior. This refines the general conception of the compound Poisson model, which recognized that packets arrived in groups, by analyzing why they arrive in groups, and better characterizing the attributes of the group. Finally, the authors demonstrate that packet arrival times are not Poisson distributed, which led to a model that departs from variations on the Poisson theme. The packet train model is characterized by the following parameters and their associated probability distributions:\nThe train model is designed for analyzing and categorizing real traffic, not for generating synthetic loads for simulation. Thus, little claim has been made about the feasibility of packet trains for generating synthetic traffic. Given accurate parameters and distributions, generation should be straightforward, but derivation of these parameters is not addressed.\n\nNS-2 is a popular network simulator; PackMimeHTTP is a web traffic generator for NS-2, published in 2004. It does take long-range dependencies into account, and uses the Weibull distribution. Thus, it relies on heavy tails to emulate true self-similarity. Over most time scales, the effort is a success; only a long-running simulation would allow a distinction to be drawn. This follows suggestions from where it is suggested that self-similar processes can be represented as a superposition of many sources each individually modeled with a heavy-tailed distribution. It is clear that self-similar traffic models are in the mainstream.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20110824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20110824", "title": "Infinity", "text": "Infinity\n\nInfinity (symbol: ) is a concept describing something without any bound or larger than any natural number. Philosophers have speculated about the nature of the infinite, for example Zeno of Elea, who proposed many paradoxes involving infinity, and Eudoxus of Cnidus, who used the idea of infinitely small quantities in his method of exhaustion. Modern mathematics uses the general concept of infinity in the solution of many practical and theoretical problems, such as in calculus and set theory, and the idea is also used in physics and the other sciences.\n\nIn mathematics, \"infinity\" is often treated as a number (i.e., it counts or measures things: \"an infinite number of terms\") but it is not the same sort of number as either a natural or a real number.\n\nGeorg Cantor formalized many ideas related to infinity and infinite sets during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the theory he developed, there are infinite sets of different sizes (called cardinalities). For example, the set of integers is countably infinite, while the infinite set of real numbers is uncountable.\n\nAncient cultures had various ideas about the nature of infinity. The ancient Indians and Greeks did not define infinity in precise formalism as does modern mathematics, and instead approached infinity as a philosophical concept.\n\nThe earliest recorded idea of infinity comes from Anaximander, a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus. He used the word apeiron which means infinite or limitless. However, the earliest attestable accounts of mathematical infinity come from Zeno of Elea (born ), a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher of southern Italy and member of the Eleatic School founded by Parmenides. Aristotle called him the inventor of the dialectic. He is best known for his paradoxes, described by Bertrand Russell as \"immeasurably subtle and profound\".\n\nIn accordance with the traditional view of Aristotle, the Hellenistic Greeks generally preferred to distinguish the potential infinity from the actual infinity; for example, instead of saying that there are an infinity of primes, Euclid prefers instead to say that there are more prime numbers than contained in any given collection of prime numbers.\n\nHowever, recent readings of the Archimedes Palimpsest have found that Archimedes had an understanding about actual infinite quantities. According to \"Nonlinear Dynamic Systems and Controls\", Archimedes has been found to be \"the first to rigorously address the science of infinity with infinitely large sets using precise mathematical proofs.\"\n\nThe Jain mathematical text Surya Prajnapti (c. 4th–3rd century BCE) classifies all numbers into three sets: enumerable, innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders:\n\nIn this work, two basic types of infinite numbers are distinguished. On both physical and ontological grounds, a distinction was made between (\"countless, innumerable\") and \"ananta\" (\"endless, unlimited\"), between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded infinities.\n\nEuropean mathematicians started using infinite numbers and expressions in a systematic fashion in the 17th century. In 1655 John Wallis first used the notation formula_1 for such a number in his \"De sectionibus conicis\" and exploited it in area calculations by dividing the region into infinitesimal strips of width on the order of formula_2 But in \"Arithmetica infinitorum\" (1655 also) he indicates infinite series, infinite products and infinite continued fractions by writing down a few terms or factors and then appending \"&c.\" For example, \"1, 6, 12, 18, 24, &c.\"\n\nIn 1699 Isaac Newton wrote about equations with an infinite number of terms in his work \"De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas\".\n\nHermann Weyl opened a mathematico-philosophic address given in 1930 with:\n\nThe infinity symbol formula_1 (sometimes called the lemniscate) is a mathematical symbol representing the concept of infinity. The symbol is encoded in Unicode at and in LaTeX as codice_1.\n\nIt was introduced in 1655 by John Wallis, and, since its introduction, has also been used outside mathematics in modern mysticism and literary symbology.\n\nLeibniz, one of the co-inventors of infinitesimal calculus, speculated widely about infinite numbers and their use in mathematics. To Leibniz, both infinitesimals and infinite quantities were ideal entities, not of the same nature as appreciable quantities, but enjoying the same properties in accordance with the Law of Continuity.\n\nIn real analysis, the symbol formula_1, called \"infinity\", is used to denote an unbounded limit. The notation formula_5 means that \"x\" grows without bound, and formula_6 means that  \"x\" decreases without bound. If \"f\"(\"t\") ≥ 0 for every \"t\", then\n\nInfinity is also used to describe infinite series:\n\nInfinity can be used not only to define a limit but as a value in the extended real number system. Points labeled formula_16 and formula_17 can be added to the topological space of the real numbers, producing the two-point compactification of the real numbers. Adding algebraic properties to this gives us the extended real numbers. We can also treat formula_16 and formula_17 as the same, leading to the one-point compactification of the real numbers, which is the real projective line. Projective geometry also refers to a line at infinity in plane geometry, a plane at infinity in three-dimensional space, and a hyperplane at infinity for general dimensions, each consisting of points at infinity.\n\nIn complex analysis the symbol formula_1, called \"infinity\", denotes an unsigned infinite limit. formula_5 means that the magnitude formula_22 of \"x\" grows beyond any assigned value. A point labeled formula_1 can be added to the complex plane as a topological space giving the one-point compactification of the complex plane. When this is done, the resulting space is a one-dimensional complex manifold, or Riemann surface, called the extended complex plane or the Riemann sphere. Arithmetic operations similar to those given above for the extended real numbers can also be defined, though there is no distinction in the signs (therefore one exception is that infinity cannot be added to itself). On the other hand, this kind of infinity enables division by zero, namely formula_24 for any nonzero complex number \"z\". In this context it is often useful to consider meromorphic functions as maps into the Riemann sphere taking the value of formula_1 at the poles. The domain of a complex-valued function may be extended to include the point at infinity as well. One important example of such functions is the group of Möbius transformations.\n\nThe original formulation of infinitesimal calculus by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz used infinitesimal quantities. In the twentieth century, it was shown that this treatment could be put on a rigorous footing through various logical systems, including smooth infinitesimal analysis and nonstandard analysis. In the latter, infinitesimals are invertible, and their inverses are infinite numbers. The infinities in this sense are part of a hyperreal field; there is no equivalence between them as with the Cantorian transfinites. For example, if H is an infinite number, then H + H = 2H and H + 1 are distinct infinite numbers. This approach to non-standard calculus is fully developed in .\n\nA different form of \"infinity\" are the ordinal and cardinal infinities of set theory. Georg Cantor developed a system of transfinite numbers, in which the first transfinite cardinal is aleph-null (ℵ), the cardinality of the set of natural numbers. This modern mathematical conception of the quantitative infinite developed in the late nineteenth century from work by Cantor, Gottlob Frege, Richard Dedekind and others, using the idea of collections, or sets.\n\nDedekind's approach was essentially to adopt the idea of one-to-one correspondence as a standard for comparing the size of sets, and to reject the view of Galileo (which derived from Euclid) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part (however, see Galileo's paradox where he concludes that positive integers which are squares and all positive integers are the same size). An infinite set can simply be defined as one having the same size as at least one of its proper parts; this notion of infinity is called Dedekind infinite. The diagram gives an example: viewing lines as infinite sets of points, the left half of the lower blue line can be mapped in a one-to-one manner (green correspondences) to the higher blue line, and, in turn, to the whole lower blue line (red correspondences); therefore the whole lower blue line and its left half have the same cardinality, i.e. \"size\".\n\nCantor defined two kinds of infinite numbers: ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers. Ordinal numbers may be identified with well-ordered sets, or counting carried on to any stopping point, including points after an infinite number have already been counted. Generalizing finite and the ordinary infinite sequences which are maps from the positive integers leads to mappings from ordinal numbers, and transfinite sequences. Cardinal numbers define the size of sets, meaning how many members they contain, and can be standardized by choosing the first ordinal number of a certain size to represent the cardinal number of that size. The smallest ordinal infinity is that of the positive integers, and any set which has the cardinality of the integers is countably infinite. If a set is too large to be put in one to one correspondence with the positive integers, it is called \"uncountable\". Cantor's views prevailed and modern mathematics accepts actual infinity. Certain extended number systems, such as the hyperreal numbers, incorporate the ordinary (finite) numbers and infinite numbers of different sizes.\n\nOne of Cantor's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum formula_26 is greater than that of the natural numbers formula_27; that is, there are more real numbers R than natural numbers N. Namely, Cantor showed that formula_28 (see Cantor's diagonal argument or Cantor's first uncountability proof).\n\nThe continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinal number between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is, formula_29 (see Beth one). This hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, even assuming the Axiom of Choice.\n\nCardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a real number line is equal to the number of points in any segment of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any finite-dimensional space.\nThe first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the tangent function, which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the interval (−π/2, π/2) and R (see also Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel). The second result was proved by Cantor in 1878, but only became intuitively apparent in 1890, when Giuseppe Peano introduced the space-filling curves, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or hypercube, or finite-dimensional space. These curves can be used to define a one-to-one correspondence between the points on one side of a square and the points in the square.\n\nInfinite-dimensional spaces are widely used in geometry and topology, particularly as classifying spaces, such as Eilenberg−MacLane spaces. Common examples are the infinite-dimensional complex projective space K(Z,2) and the infinite-dimensional real projective space K(Z/2Z,1).\n\nThe structure of a fractal object is reiterated in its magnifications. Fractals can be magnified indefinitely without losing their structure and becoming \"smooth\"; they have infinite perimeters—some with infinite, and others with finite surface areas. One such fractal curve with an infinite perimeter and finite surface area is the Koch snowflake.\n\nLeopold Kronecker was skeptical of the notion of infinity and how his fellow mathematicians were using it in the 1870s and 1880s. This skepticism was developed in the philosophy of mathematics called finitism, an extreme form of mathematical philosophy in the general philosophical and mathematical schools of constructivism and intuitionism.\n\nIn physics, approximations of real numbers are used for continuous measurements and natural numbers are used for discrete measurements (i.e. counting). It is therefore assumed by physicists that no measurable quantity could have an infinite value, for instance by taking an infinite value in an extended real number system, or by requiring the counting of an infinite number of events. It is, for example, presumed impossible for any type of body to have infinite mass or infinite energy. Concepts of infinite things such as an infinite plane wave exist, but there are no experimental means to generate them.\n\nThe practice of refusing infinite values for measurable quantities does not come from \"a priori\" or ideological motivations, but rather from more methodological and pragmatic motivations . One of the needs of any physical and scientific theory is to give usable formulas that correspond to or at least approximate reality. As an example, if any object of infinite gravitational mass were to exist, any usage of the formula to calculate the gravitational force would lead to an infinite result, which would be of no benefit since the result would be always the same regardless of the position and the mass of the other object. The formula would be useful neither to compute the force between two objects of finite mass nor to compute their motions. If an infinite mass object were to exist, any object of finite mass would be attracted with infinite force (and hence acceleration) by the infinite mass object, which is not what we can observe in reality. Sometimes infinite result of a physical quantity may mean that the theory being used to compute the result may be approaching the point where it fails. This may help to indicate the limitations of a theory.\n\nThis point of view does not mean that infinity cannot be used in physics. For convenience's sake, calculations, equations, theories and approximations often use infinite series, unbounded functions, etc., and may involve infinite quantities. Physicists however require that the end result be physically meaningful. In quantum field theory infinities arise which need to be interpreted in such a way as to lead to a physically meaningful result, a process called renormalization.\n\nHowever, there are some theoretical circumstances where the end result is infinity. One example is the singularity in the description of black holes. Some solutions of the equations of the general theory of relativity allow for finite mass distributions of zero size, and thus infinite density. This is an example of what is called a mathematical singularity, or a point where a physical theory breaks down. This does not necessarily mean that physical infinities exist; it may mean simply that the theory is incapable of describing the situation properly. Two other examples occur in inverse-square force laws of the gravitational force equation of Newtonian gravity and Coulomb's law of electrostatics. At r=0 these equations evaluate to infinities.\n\nThe first published proposal that the universe is infinite came from Thomas Digges in 1576. Eight years later, in 1584, the Italian philosopher and astronomer Giordano Bruno proposed an unbounded universe in \"On the Infinite Universe and Worlds\": \"Innumerable suns exist; innumerable earths revolve around these suns in a manner similar to the way the seven planets revolve around our sun. Living beings inhabit these worlds.\"\n\nCosmologists have long sought to discover whether infinity exists in our physical universe: Are there an infinite number of stars? Does the universe have infinite volume? Does space \"go on forever\"? This is an open question of cosmology. The question of being infinite is logically separate from the question of having boundaries. The two-dimensional surface of the Earth, for example, is finite, yet has no edge. By travelling in a straight line with respect to the Earth's curvature one will eventually return to the exact spot one started from. The universe, at least in principle, might have a similar topology. If so, one might eventually return to one's starting point after travelling in a straight line through the universe for long enough.\n\nThe curvature of the universe can be measured through multipole moments in the spectrum of the cosmic background radiation. As to date, analysis of the radiation patterns recorded by the WMAP spacecraft hints that the universe has a flat topology. This would be consistent with an infinite physical universe.\n\nHowever, the universe could be finite, even if its curvature is flat. An easy way to understand this is to consider two-dimensional examples, such as video games where items that leave one edge of the screen reappear on the other. The topology of such games is toroidal and the geometry is flat. Many possible bounded, flat possibilities also exist for three-dimensional space.\n\nThe concept of infinity also extends to the multiverse hypothesis, which, when explained by astrophysicists such as Michio Kaku, posits that there are an infinite number and variety of universes.\n\nIn logic an infinite regress argument is \"a distinctively philosophical kind of argument purporting to show that a thesis is defective because it generates an infinite series when either (form A) no such series exists or (form B) were it to exist, the thesis would lack the role (e.g., of justification) that it is supposed to play.\"\n\nThe IEEE floating-point standard (IEEE 754) specifies the positive and negative infinity values (and also indefinite values). These are defined as the result of arithmetic overflow, division by zero, and other exceptional operations.\n\nSome programming languages, such as Java and J, allow the programmer an explicit access to the positive and negative infinity values as language constants. These can be used as greatest and least elements, as they compare (respectively) greater than or less than all other values. They have uses as sentinel values in algorithms involving sorting, searching, or windowing.\n\nIn languages that do not have greatest and least elements, but do allow overloading of relational operators, it is possible for a programmer to \"create\" the greatest and least elements. In languages that do not provide explicit access to such values from the initial state of the program, but do implement the floating-point data type, the infinity values may still be accessible and usable as the result of certain operations.\n\nPerspective artwork utilizes the concept of vanishing points, roughly corresponding to mathematical points at infinity, located at an infinite distance from the observer. This allows artists to create paintings that realistically render space, distances, and forms. Artist M. C. Escher is specifically known for employing the concept of infinity in his work in this and other ways.\n\nVariations of chess played on an unbounded board are called infinite chess.\n\nCognitive scientist George Lakoff considers the concept of infinity in mathematics and the sciences as a metaphor. This perspective is based on the basic metaphor of infinity (BMI), defined as the ever-increasing sequence <1,2,3...>.\n\nThe symbol is often used romantically to represent eternal love. Several types of jewelry are fashioned into the infinity shape for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a dark brown length of bone, the fibula of a baboon, with a sharp piece of quartz affixed to one end, perhaps for engraving. It was first thought to be a tally stick, as it has a series of what has been interpreted as tally marks carved in three columns running the length of the tool, though it has also been suggested that the scratches might have been to create a better grip on the handle or for some other non-mathematical reason. \n\nThe Ishango bone was found in 1960 by Belgian Jean de Heinzelin de Braucourt while exploring what was then the Belgian Congo. It was discovered in the area of Ishango near the Semliki River. Lake Edward empties into the Semliki which forms part of the headwaters of the Nile River (now on the border between modern-day Uganda and D.R. Congo). The bone was found among the remains of a small community that fished and gathered in this area of Africa. The settlement had been buried in a volcanic eruption.\n\nThe artifact was first estimated to have originated between 9,000 BC and 6,500 BC. \nHowever, the dating of the site where it was discovered was re-evaluated, and it is now believed to be more than 20,000 years old (between 18,000 BC and 20,000 BC).\n\nThe Ishango bone is on permanent exhibition at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Brussels, Belgium.\n\nThe etchings on the bone are in three columns with marks asymmetrically grouped into sets, leading to \"various tantalizing hypotheses\", such as that the implement was used as a counting tool for simple mathematical procedures or even to construct a numeral system. \n\nThe third column has been interpreted as a \"table of prime numbers\", but it is more likely to be a coincidence. Historian of mathematics Peter S. Rudman argues that prime numbers were probably not understood until about 500 BC, and were dependent on the concept of division, which he dates to no earlier than 10,000 BC. \n\nAlexander Marshack speculated that the Ishango bone represents a six-month lunar calendar. This has led Claudia Zaslavsky to suggest that the creator of the tool may have been a woman, tracking the lunar phase in relation to the menstrual cycle. This is countered with the argument that Marshack overinterprets the data and that the evidence does not support lunar calendars.\n\nDuring earlier excavations at the Ishango site in 1959, another bone was also found. It is lighter in color and was scraped, thinned, polished, and broken on one end, revealing it to be hollow. The artifact possibly held a piece of quartz like the more well-known bone or it could have been a tool handle. The 14-cm long bone has 90 notches on six sides, which are categorized as \"major\" or \"minor\" according to their length. Jean de Heinzelin interpreted the major notches as being units or multiples and the minor notches as fractions or subsidiary. He believed the bone to be an \"interchange rule between bases 10 and 12.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Changes in the section of the notches indicate the use of different cutting edges, which the bone's discoverer, Peter Beaumont, views as evidence for their having been made, like other markings found all over the world, during participation in rituals.\n\nThe bone is between 44,200 and 43,000 years old, according to 24 radiocarbon datings. This is far older than the Ishango bone with which it is sometimes confused. Other notched bones are 80,000 years old but it is unclear if the notches are merely decorative or if they \nbear a functional meaning.\n\nAccording to \"The Universal Book of Mathematics\" the Lebombo bone's 29 notches suggest \"it may have been used as a lunar phase counter, in which case African women may have been the first mathematicians, because keeping track of menstrual cycles requires a lunar calendar\". However, the bone is clearly broken at one end, so the 29 notches may or may not be a minimum number. In the cases of other notched bones since found globally, there has been no consistent notch tally, many being in the 1–10 range.\n\n"}

Some of these lists link to hundreds of articles; some link only to a few. The template to the right includes links to alphabetical lists of all mathematical articles. This article brings together the same content organized in a manner better suited for browsing.\n\nThe purpose of this list is \"not\" similar to that of the Mathematics Subject Classification formulated by the American Mathematical Society. Many mathematics journals ask authors of research papers and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The subject codes so listed are used by the two major reviewing databases, \"Mathematical Reviews\" and \"Zentralblatt MATH\". This list has some items that would not fit in such a classification, such as list of exponential topics and list of factorial and binomial topics, which may surprise the reader with the diversity of their coverage.\n\nThis branch is typically taught in secondary education or in the first year of university.\n\nSee also Areas of mathematics and Glossary of areas of mathematics.\n\nAs a rough guide this list is divided into pure and applied sections although in reality these branches are overlapping and intertwined.\n\nAlgebra includes the study of algebraic structures, which are sets and operations defined on these sets satisfying certain axioms. The field of algebra is further divided according to which structure is studied; for instance, group theory concerns an algebraic structure called \"group\".\n\nCalculus studies the computation of limits, derivatives, and integrals of functions of real numbers, and in particular studies instantaneous rates of change. Analysis evolved from calculus.\n\nGeometry is initially the study of spatial figures like circles and cubes, though it has been generalized considerably. Topology developed from geometry; it looks at those properties that do not change even when the figures are deformed by stretching and bending, like dimension.\n\nCombinatorics concerns the study of discrete (and usually finite) objects. Aspects include \"counting\" the objects satisfying certain criteria (\"enumerative combinatorics\"), deciding when the criteria can be met, and constructing and analyzing objects meeting the criteria (as in \"combinatorial designs and matroid theory\"), finding \"largest\", \"smallest\", or \"optimal\" objects (\"extremal combinatorics\" and \"combinatorial optimization\"), and finding algebraic structures these objects may have (\"algebraic combinatorics\").\n\nLogic is the foundation which underlies mathematical logic and the rest of mathematics. It tries to formalize valid reasoning. In particular, it attempts to define what constitutes a proof.\n\nNumber theory studies the natural, or whole, numbers. One of the central concepts in number theory is that of the prime number, and there are many questions about primes that appear simple but whose resolution continues to elude mathematicians.\n\nA differential equation is an equation involving an unknown function and its derivatives.\n\nIn a dynamical system, a fixed rule describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space. The mathematical models used to describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, or the number of fish each spring in a lake are examples of dynamical systems.\n\nMathematical physics is concerned with \"the application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories\".\n\nThe fields of mathematics and computing intersect both in computer science, the study of algorithms and data structures, and in scientific computing, the study of algorithmic methods for solving problems in mathematics, science and engineering.\n\nInformation theory is a branch of applied mathematics and electrical engineering involving the quantification of information. Historically, information theory was developed to find fundamental limits on compressing and reliably communicating data.\n\nSignal processing is the analysis, interpretation, and manipulation of signals. Signals of interest include sound, images, biological signals such as ECG, radar signals, and many others. Processing of such signals includes filtering, storage and reconstruction, separation of information from noise, compression, and feature extraction.\n\nProbability theory is the formalization and study of the mathematics of uncertain events or knowledge. The related field of mathematical statistics develops statistical theory with mathematics. Statistics, the science concerned with collecting and analyzing data, is an autonomous discipline (and not a subdiscipline of applied mathematics).\n\nGame theory is a branch of mathematics that uses models to study interactions with formalized incentive structures (\"games\"). It has applications in a variety of fields, including economics, evolutionary biology, political science, social psychology and military strategy.\n\nOperations research is the study and use of mathematical models, statistics and algorithms to aid in decision-making, typically with the goal of improving or optimizing performance of real-world systems.\n\n\nA mathematical statement amounts to a proposition or assertion of some mathematical fact, formula, or construction. Such statements include axioms and the theorems that may be proved from them, conjectures that may be unproven or even unprovable, and also algorithms for computing the answers to questions that can be expressed mathematically.\n\n\nAmong mathematical objects are numbers, functions, sets, a great variety of things called \"spaces\" of one kind or another, algebraic structures such as rings, groups, or fields, and many other things.\n\n\n\nMathematicians study and research in all the different areas of mathematics. The publication of new discoveries in mathematics continues at an immense rate in hundreds of scientific journals, many of them devoted to mathematics and many devoted to subjects to which mathematics is applied (such as theoretical computer science and theoretical physics).\n\n\n\nIn calculus, the integral of a function is a generalization of area, mass, volume, sum, and total. The following pages list the integrals of many different functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1606990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1606990", "title": "Logical harmony", "text": "Logical harmony\n\nLogical harmony, a name coined by Michael Dummett, is a supposed constraint on the rules of inference that can be used in a given logical system.\n\nThe logician Gerhard Gentzen proposed that the meanings of logical connectives could be given by the rules for introducing them into discourse. For example, if one believes that \"the sky is blue\" and one also believes that \"grass is green\", then one can introduce the connective \"and\" as follows: \"The sky is blue AND grass is green.\" Gentzen's idea was that having rules like this is what gives meaning to one's words, or at least to certain words. The idea has also been associated with Wittgenstein's dictum that in many cases we can say, \"meaning is use\". Most contemporary logicians prefer to think that the introduction rules and the elimination rules for an expression are equally important. In this case, \"and\" is characterized by the following rules:\nAn apparent problem with this was pointed out by Arthur Prior: Why can't we have an expression (call it \"tonk\") whose introduction rule is that of OR (from \"p\" to \"p tonk q\") but whose elimination rule is that of AND (from \"p tonk q\" to \"q\")? This lets us deduce anything at all from any starting point. Prior suggested that this meant that inferential rules could \"not\" determine meaning. He was answered by Nuel Belnap, that even though introduction and elimination rules can constitute meaning, not just any pair of such rules will determine a meaningful expression—they must meet certain constraints, such as not allowing us to deduce any new truths in the old vocabulary. These constraints are what Dummett was referring to.\n\nHarmony, then, refers to certain constraints that a proof theory must let hold between introduction and elimination rules for it to be meaningful, or in other words, for its inference rules to be meaning-constituting.\n\nThe application of harmony to logic may be considered a special case; it makes sense to talk of harmony with respect to not only inferential systems, but also conceptual systems in human cognition, and to type systems in programming languages.\n\nSemantics of this form has not provided a very great challenge to that sketched in Tarski's semantic theory of truth, but many philosophers interested in reconstituting the semantics of logic in a way that respects Ludwig Wittgenstein's \"meaning is use\" have felt that harmony holds the key.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18974136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18974136", "title": "Mathematical beauty", "text": "Mathematical beauty\n\nMathematical beauty describes the notion that some mathematicians may derive aesthetic pleasure from their work, and from mathematics in general. They express this pleasure by describing mathematics (or, at least, some aspect of mathematics) as \"beautiful\". Mathematicians describe mathematics as an art form or, at a minimum, as a creative activity. Comparisons are often made with music and poetry.\n\nBertrand Russell expressed his sense of mathematical beauty in these words:\n\nMathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry.\nPaul Erdős expressed his views on the ineffability of mathematics when he said, \"Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I \"know\" numbers are beautiful. If they aren't beautiful, nothing is\".\n\nMathematicians describe an especially pleasing method of proof as \"elegant\". Depending on context, this may mean:\n\n\nIn the search for an elegant proof, mathematicians often look for different independent ways to prove a result—the first proof that is found may not be the best. The theorem for which the greatest number of different proofs have been discovered is possibly the Pythagorean theorem, with hundreds of proofs having been published. Another theorem that has been proved in many different ways is the theorem of quadratic reciprocity—Carl Friedrich Gauss alone published eight different proofs of this theorem.\n\nConversely, results that are logically correct but involve laborious calculations, over-elaborate methods, very conventional approaches, or that rely on a large number of particularly powerful axioms or previous results are not usually considered to be elegant, and may be called \"ugly\" or \"clumsy\".\n\nSome mathematicians see beauty in mathematical results that establish connections between two areas of mathematics that at first sight appear to be unrelated. These results are often described as \"deep\".\n\nWhile it is difficult to find universal agreement on whether a result is deep, some examples are often cited. One is Euler's identity:\n\nformula_1\n\nThis is a special case of Euler's formula, which the physicist Richard Feynman called \"our jewel\" and \"the most remarkable formula in mathematics\". Modern examples include the modularity theorem, which establishes an important connection between elliptic curves and modular forms (work on which led to the awarding of the Wolf Prize to Andrew Wiles and Robert Langlands), and \"monstrous moonshine\", which connects the Monster group to modular functions via string theory for which Richard Borcherds was awarded the Fields Medal.\n\nOther examples of deep results include unexpected insights into mathematical structures. For example, Gauss's Theorema Egregium is a deep theorem which relates a local phenomenon (curvature) to a global phenomenon (area) in a surprising way. In particular, the area of a triangle on a curved surface is proportional to the excess of the triangle and the proportionality is curvature. Another example is the fundamental theorem of calculus (and its vector versions including Green's theorem and Stokes' theorem).\n\nThe opposite of \"deep\" is \"trivial\". A trivial theorem may be a result that can be derived in an obvious and straightforward way from other known results, or which applies only to a specific set of particular objects such as the empty set. Sometimes, however, a statement of a theorem can be original enough to be considered deep, even though its proof is fairly obvious.\n\nIn his \"A Mathematician's Apology\", Hardy suggests that a beautiful proof or result possesses \"inevitability\", \"unexpectedness\", and \"economy\".\n\nRota, however, disagrees with unexpectedness as a sufficient condition for beauty and proposes a counterexample:\n\nPerhaps ironically, Monastyrsky writes:\n\nThis disagreement illustrates both the subjective nature of mathematical beauty and its connection with mathematical results: in this case, not only the existence of exotic spheres, but also a particular realization of them.\n\nInterest in pure mathematics separate from empirical study has been part of the experience of various civilizations, including that of the ancient Greeks, who \"did mathematics for the beauty of it\". The aesthetic pleasure that mathematical physicists tend to experience in Einstein's theory of general relativity has been attributed (by Paul Dirac, among others) to its \"great mathematical beauty\". The beauty of mathematics is experienced when the physical reality of objects are represented by mathematical models. Group theory, developed in the early 1800s for the sole purpose of solving polynomial equations, became a fruitful way of categorizing elementary particles—the building blocks of matter. Similarly, the study of knots provides important insights into string theory and loop quantum gravity.\n\nSome believe that in order to appreciate mathematics, one must engage in doing mathematics.\nThere are some teachers that encourage student engagement by teaching mathematics in a kinesthetic way (see kinesthetic learning). For example, Math Circle is an afterschool enrichment program where students do mathematics through games and activities; in a general Math Circle lesson, students use pattern finding, observation, and exploration to make their own mathematical discoveries. For example, mathematical beauty arises in a Math Circle activity on symmetry designed for 2nd and 3rd graders. In this activity, students create their own snowflakes by folding a square piece of paper and cutting out designs of their choice along the edges of the folded paper. When the paper is unfolded, a symmetrical design reveals itself. In a day to day elementary school mathematics class, symmetry can be presented as such in an artistic manner where students see aesthetically pleasing results in mathematics.\n\nSome teachers prefer to use mathematical manipulatives to present mathematics in an aesthetically pleasing way. Examples of a manipulative include algebra tiles, cuisenaire rods, and pattern blocks. For example, one can teach the method of completing the square by using algebra tiles. Cuisenaire rods can be used to teach fractions, and pattern blocks can be used to teach geometry. Using mathematical manipulatives helps students gain a conceptual understanding that might not be seen immediately in written mathematical formulas. \n\nAnother example involves origami. Origami, the art of paper folding, has aesthetic qualities and many mathematical connections. One can study the mathematics of paper folding by observing the crease pattern on unfolded origami pieces.\n\nCombinatorics (the study of counting) has artistic representations that some find mathematically beautiful. There are many visual examples that illustrate combinatorial concepts. Here are some topics and objects seen in combinatorics courses with visual representations:\n\nSome mathematicians are of the opinion that the doing of mathematics is closer to discovery than invention, for example:\n\nThese mathematicians believe that the detailed and precise results of mathematics may be reasonably taken to be true without any dependence on the universe in which we live. For example, they would argue that the theory of the natural numbers is fundamentally valid, in a way that does not require any specific context. Some mathematicians have extrapolated this viewpoint that mathematical beauty is truth further, in some cases becoming mysticism.\n\nPythagorean mathematicians believed in the literal reality of numbers. The discovery of the existence of irrational numbers was a shock to them, since they considered the existence of numbers not expressible as the ratio of two natural numbers to be a flaw in nature (the Pythagorean world view did not contemplate the limits of infinite sequences of ratios of natural numbers—the modern notion of a real number). From a modern perspective, their mystical approach to numbers may be viewed as numerology.\n\nIn Plato's philosophy there were two worlds, the physical one in which we live and another abstract world which contained unchanging truth, including mathematics. He believed that the physical world was a mere reflection of the more perfect abstract world.\n\nHungarian mathematician Paul Erdős spoke of an imaginary book, in which God has written down all the most beautiful mathematical proofs. When Erdős wanted to express particular appreciation of a proof, he would exclaim \"This one's from The Book!\"\n\nTwentieth-century French philosopher Alain Badiou claims that ontology is mathematics. Badiou also believes in deep connections between mathematics, poetry and philosophy.\n\nIn some cases, natural philosophers and other scientists who have made extensive use of mathematics have made leaps of inference between beauty and physical truth in ways that turned out to be erroneous. For example, at one stage in his life, Johannes Kepler believed that the proportions of the orbits of the then-known planets in the Solar System have been arranged by God to correspond to a concentric arrangement of the five Platonic solids, each orbit lying on the circumsphere of one polyhedron and the insphere of another. As there are exactly five Platonic solids, Kepler's hypothesis could only accommodate six planetary orbits and was disproved by the subsequent discovery of Uranus.\n\nIn the 1970s, Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake analyzed links between beauty, information processing, and information theory. In the 1990s, Jürgen Schmidhuber formulated a mathematical theory of observer-dependent subjective beauty based on algorithmic information theory: the most beautiful objects among subjectively comparable objects have short algorithmic descriptions (i.e., Kolmogorov complexity) relative to what the observer already knows. Schmidhuber explicitly distinguishes between beautiful and interesting. The latter corresponds to the first derivative of subjectively perceived beauty:\nthe observer continually tries to improve the predictability and compressibility of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and symmetries and fractal self-similarity. Whenever the observer's learning process (possibly a predictive artificial neural network) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer bits than before, the temporary interestingness of the data corresponds to the compression progress, and is proportional to the observer's internal curiosity reward.\n\nExamples of the use of mathematics in music include the stochastic music of Iannis Xenakis, Fibonacci in Tool's Lateralus, counterpoint of Johann Sebastian Bach, polyrhythmic structures (as in Igor Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\"), the Metric modulation of Elliott Carter, permutation theory in serialism beginning with Arnold Schoenberg, and application of Shepard tones in Karlheinz Stockhausen's \"Hymnen\".\n\nExamples of the use of mathematics in the visual arts include applications of chaos theory and fractal geometry to computer-generated art, symmetry studies of Leonardo da Vinci, projective geometries in development of the perspective theory of Renaissance art, grids in Op art, optical geometry in the camera obscura of Giambattista della Porta, and multiple perspective in analytic cubism and futurism.\n\nThe Dutch graphic designer M. C. Escher created mathematically inspired woodcuts, lithographs, and mezzotints. These feature impossible constructions, explorations of infinity, architecture, visual paradoxes and tessellations. British constructionist artist John Ernest created reliefs and paintings inspired by group theory. A number of other British artists of the constructionist and systems schools also draw on mathematics models and structures as a source of inspiration, including Anthony Hill and Peter Lowe. Computer-generated art is based on mathematical algorithms.\n\n\n"}

The form and the medium of the works are not important. The genre may include short stories, novels or plays; comic books; films, videos, or audios. One of the earliest, and much studied, work of this genre is , an 1884 satirical novella by the English schoolmaster Edwin Abbott Abbott. Mathematical fiction may have existed since ancient times, but it was recently rediscovered as a genre of literature; since then there has been a growing body of literature in this genre, and the genre has attracted a growing body of readers. For example, Abbot's Flatland spawned a sequel in the 21st century: a novel titled \"Flatterland\", authored by Ian Stewart and published in 2001.\n\nAlex Kasman, a Professor of Mathematics at College of Charleston, who maintains a database of works that could possibly be included in this genre, has a broader definition for the genre: Any work \"containing mathematics or mathematicians\" has been treated as mathematical fiction. Accordingly, \"Gulliver's Travels\" by Jonathan Swift, \"War and Peace\" by Lev Tolstoy, \"Mrs. Warren's Profession\" by George Bernard Shaw, and several similar literary works appear in Kasman's database because these works contain references to mathematics or mathematicians, even though mathematics and mathematicians are not important in their plots. According to this broader approach, the oldest extant work of mathematical fiction is \"The Birds\", a comedy by the Ancient Greek playwright Aristophanes performed in 414 BCE. Kasman's database has a list of more than one thousand items of diverse categories like literature, comic books and films.\n\nThe top ten results turned up by a search of the website of Mathematical Association of America using the keywords \"mathematical fiction\" contained references to the following works of mathematical fiction.\n\n\n"}

His intention was primarily to document mathematical practice through its historical changes.\n\nThe evolution of mathematical practice was slow, and some contributors to modern mathematics did not follow even the practice of their time. For example, Pierre de Fermat was infamous for withholding his proofs, but nonetheless had a vast reputation for correct assertions of results.\n\nOne motivation to study mathematical practice is that, despite much work in the 20th century, some still feel that the foundations of mathematics remain unclear and ambiguous. One proposed remedy is to shift focus to some degree onto 'what is meant by a proof', and other such questions of method.\n\nIf mathematics has been informally used throughout history, in numerous cultures and continents, then it could be argued that \"mathematical practice\" is the practice, or use, of mathematics in everyday life. One definition of mathematical practice, as described above, is the \"working practices of professional mathematicians.\" However, another definition, more in keeping with the predominant usage of mathematics, is that mathematical practice is the everyday practice, or use, of math. Whether one is estimating the total cost of their groceries, calculating miles per gallon, or figuring out how many minutes on the treadmill that chocolate éclair will require, math as used by most people relies less on proof than on practicality (i. e., does it answer the question?).\n\nMathematical teaching usually requires the use of several important teaching pedagogies or components.

The initiative promotes the use of open-source software and open data in energy system modelling for research and policy advice. The Open Energy Modelling Initiative documents a variety of open-source energy models and addresses practical and conceptual issues regarding their development and application. The initiative runs an email list, an internet forum, and a wiki and hosts occasional academic workshops. A statement of aims is available.\n\nThe application of open-source development to energy modelling dates back to around 2010. This section provides some background for the growing interest in open methods.\n\nJust two active open energy modelling projects were cited in a 2011 paper: OSeMOSYS and TEMOA. Balmorel was also open at that time, having been made public in 2001.\n, the openmod wiki lists 24 such undertakings.\n\nAn innovative 2012 paper presents the case for using \"open, publicly accessible software and data as well as crowdsourcing techniques to develop robust energy analysis tools\". The paper claims that these techniques can produce high-quality results and are particularly relevant for developing countries.\n\nThere is an increasing call for the energy models and datasets used for energy policy analysis and advice to be made public in the interests of transparency and quality. A 2010 paper concerning energy efficiency modeling argues that \"an open peer review process can greatly support model verification and validation, which are essential for model development\". One 2012 study argues that the source code and datasets used in such models should be placed under publicly accessible version control to enable third-parties to run and check specific models. Another 2014 study argues that the public trust needed to underpin a rapid transition in energy systems can only be built through the use of transparent open-source energy models. The UK TIMES project (UKTM) is open source, according to a 2014 presentation, because \"energy modelling must be replicable and verifiable to be considered part of the scientific process\" and because this fits with the \"drive towards clarity and quality assurance in the provision of policy insights\". In 2016, the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project (DDPP) is seeking to improve its modelling methodologies, a key motivation being \"the intertwined goals of transparency, communicability and policy credibility.\" A 2016 paper argues that model-based energy scenario studies, wishing to influence decision-makers in government and industry, must become more comprehensible and more transparent. To these ends, the paper provides a checklist of transparency criteria that should be completed by modelers. The authors note however that they \"consider open source approaches to be an extreme case of transparency that does not automatically facilitate the comprehensibility of studies for policy advice.\" An editorial from 2016 opines that closed energy models providing public policy support \"are inconsistent with the open access movement [and] funded research\". A 2017 paper lists the benefits of open data and models and the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed. The paper makes a number of recommendations for projects wishing to transition to a more open approach. The authors also conclude that, in terms of openness, energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine. Moreover:\n\nA one-page opinion piece in \"Nature News\" from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis. The article also argues that scientific journals have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for scrutiny, currently only \"Energy Economics\" makes this practice mandatory within the energy domain.\n\nIssues surrounding copyright remain at the forefront with regard to open energy data. Most energy datasets are collated and published by official or semi-official sources, for example, national statistics offices, transmission system operators, and electricity market operators. The doctrine of open data requires that these datasets be available under free licenses (such as ) or be in the public domain. But most published energy datasets carry proprietary licenses, limiting their reuse in numerical and statistical models, open or otherwise. Measures to enforce market transparency have not helped because the associated information is normally licensed to preclude downstream usage. Recent transparency measures include the 2013 European energy market transparency regulation 543/2013 and a 2016 amendment to the German Energy Industry Act to establish a nation energy information platform, slated to launch on 1July 2017. Energy databases are protected under general database law, irrespective of the copyright status of the information they hold.\n\nIn December 2017, participants from the Open Energy Modelling Initiative and allied research communities made a written submission to the European Commission on the of public sector information. The document provides a comprehensive account of the data issues faced by researchers engaged in open energy system modeling and energy market analysis and quoted extensively from a German legal opinion.\n\nIn May 2016 the European Union announced that \"all scientific articles in Europe must be freely accessible as of 2020\". This is a step in the right direction, but the new policy makes no mention of open software and its importance to the scientific process. In August 2016, the United States government announced a new federal source code policy which mandates that at least 20% of custom source code developed by or for any agency of the federal government be released as open-source software (OSS). The US Department of Energy (DOE) is participating in the program. The project is hosted on a dedicated website and subject to a three-year pilot. Open-source campaigners are using the initiative to advocate that European governments adopt similar practices. In 2017 the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) issued a position paper calling for free software and open standards to be central to European science funding, including the flagship EU program Horizon2020. The position paper focuses on open data and open data processing and the question of open modeling is not traversed perse.\n\nThe Open Energy Modelling Initiative participants take turns to host regular academic workshops.\n\n\nRelated to openmod\n\n\nOpen energy data\n\n\nSimilar initiatives\n\n\nOther\n\n"}

The most common operators are linear maps, which act on vector spaces. However, when using \"linear operator\" instead of \"linear map\", mathematicians often mean actions on vector spaces of functions, which also preserve other properties, such as continuity. For example, differentiation and indefinite integration are linear operators; operators that are built from them are called differential operators, integral operators or integro-differential operators.\n\nOperator is also used for denoting the symbol of a mathematical operation. This is related with the meaning of \"operator\" in computer programming, see operator (computer programming).\n\nThe most common kind of operator encountered are \"linear operators\". Let \"U\" and \"V\" be vector spaces over a field \"K\". A mapping \"A\": \"U\" → \"V\" is linear if\nfor all x, y in \"U\" and for all \"α, β\" in \"K\". \nThis means that a linear operator preserves vector space operations, in the sense that it does not matter whether you apply the linear operator before or after the operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In more technical words, linear operators are morphisms between vector spaces.\n\nIn finite-dimensional case linear operators can be represented by matrices in the following way. Let formula_2 be a field, and formula_3 and formula_4 be finite-dimensional vector spaces over formula_2. Let us select a basis formula_6 in formula_3 and formula_8 in formula_4. Then let formula_10 be an arbitrary vector in formula_3 (assuming Einstein convention), and formula_12 be a linear operator. Then\nThen formula_14 is the matrix of the operator formula_15 in fixed bases. formula_16 does not depend on the choice of formula_17, and formula_18 iff formula_19. Thus in fixed bases n-by-m matrices are in bijective correspondence to linear operators from formula_3 to formula_4.\n\nThe important concepts directly related to operators between finite-dimensional vector spaces are the ones of rank, determinant, inverse operator, and eigenspace.\n\nLinear operators also play a great role in the infinite-dimensional case. The concepts of rank and determinant cannot be extended to infinite-dimensional matrices. This is why very different techniques are employed when studying linear operators (and operators in general) in the infinite-dimensional case. The study of linear operators in the infinite-dimensional case is known as functional analysis (so called because various classes of functions form interesting examples of infinite-dimensional vector spaces).\n\nThe space of sequences of real numbers, or more generally sequences of vectors in any vector space, themselves form an infinite-dimensional vector space. The most important cases are sequences of real or complex numbers, and these spaces, together with linear subspaces, are known as sequence spaces. Operators on these spaces are known as sequence transformations.\n\nBounded linear operators over Banach space form a Banach algebra in respect to the standard operator norm. The theory of Banach algebras develops a very general concept of spectra that elegantly generalizes the theory of eigenspaces.\n\nLet \"U\" and \"V\" be two vector spaces over the same ordered field (for example, formula_22), and they are equipped with norms. Then a linear operator from \"U\" to \"V\" is called bounded if there exists \"C > 0\" such that\nfor all x in \"U\".\n\nBounded operators form a vector space. On this vector space we can introduce a norm that is compatible with the norms of \"U\" and \"V\":\n\nIn case of operators from \"U\" to itself it can be shown that\n\nAny unital normed algebra with this property is called a Banach algebra. It is possible to generalize spectral theory to such algebras. C*-algebras, which are Banach algebras with some additional structure, play an important role in quantum mechanics.\n\nIn geometry, additional structures on vector spaces are sometimes studied. Operators that map such vector spaces to themselves bijectively are very useful in these studies, they naturally form groups by composition.\n\nFor example, bijective operators preserving the structure of a vector space are precisely the invertible linear operators. They form the general linear group under composition. They \"do not\" form a vector space under the addition of operators, e.g. both \"id\" and \"-id\" are invertible (bijective), but their sum, 0, is not.\n\nOperators preserving the Euclidean metric on such a space form the isometry group, and those that fix the origin form a subgroup known as the orthogonal group. Operators in the orthogonal group that also preserve the orientation of vector tuples form the special orthogonal group, or the group of rotations.\n\nOperators are also involved in probability theory, such as expectation, variance, and covariance.\n\nFrom the point of view of functional analysis, calculus is the study of two linear operators: the differential operator formula_26, and the indefinite integral operator formula_27.\n\nThe Fourier transform is useful in applied mathematics, particularly physics and signal processing. It is another integral operator; it is useful mainly because it converts a function on one (temporal) domain to a function on another (frequency) domain, in a way effectively invertible. No information is lost, as there is an inverse transform operator. In the simple case of periodic functions, this result is based on the theorem that any continuous periodic function can be represented as the sum of a series of sine waves and cosine waves:\nThe tuple \"(a, a, b, a, b, ...)\" is in fact an element of an infinite-dimensional vector space ℓ, and thus Fourier series is a linear operator.\n\nWhen dealing with general function R → C, the transform takes on an integral form:\n\nThe \"Laplace transform\" is another integral operator and is involved in simplifying the process of solving differential equations.\n\nGiven \"f\" = \"f\"(\"s\"), it is defined by:\n\nThree operators are key to vector calculus:\n\nAs an extension of vector calculus operators to physics, engineering and tensor spaces, Grad, Div and Curl operators also are often associated with Tensor calculus as well as vector calculus.\n\n"}

{"id": "26611936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26611936", "title": "Penrose tiling", "text": "Penrose tiling\n\nA Penrose tiling is an example of non-periodic tiling generated by an aperiodic set of prototiles. Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Sir Roger Penrose, who investigated these sets in the 1970s. The aperiodicity of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match the original. A Penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both reflection symmetry and fivefold rotational symmetry, as in the diagram at the right.\n\nPenrose tiling is non-periodic, which means that it lacks any translational symmetry. It is self-similar, so the same patterns occur at larger and larger scales. Thus, the tiling can be obtained through \"inflation\" (or \"deflation\") and every finite patch from the tiling occurs infinitely many times. It is a quasicrystal: implemented as a physical structure a Penrose tiling will produce Bragg diffraction and its diffractogram reveals both the fivefold symmetry and the underlying long range order.\n\nVarious methods to construct Penrose tilings have been discovered, including matching rules, substitutions or subdivision rules, cut and project schemes and coverings.\n\nPenrose tilings are simple examples of aperiodic tilings of the plane. A tiling is a covering of the plane by tiles with no overlaps or gaps; the tiles normally have a finite number of shapes, called \"prototiles\", and a set of prototiles is said to \"admit a tiling\" or \"tile the plane\" if there is a tiling of the plane using only tiles congruent to these prototiles. The most familiar tilings (e.g., by squares or triangles) are periodic: a perfect copy of the tiling can be obtained by translating all of the tiles by a fixed distance in a given direction. Such a translation is called a \"period\" of the tiling; more informally, this means that a finite region of the tiling repeats itself in periodic intervals. If a tiling has no periods it is said to be \"non-periodic\". A set of prototiles is said to be \"aperiodic\" if it tiles the plane but every such tiling is non-periodic; tilings by aperiodic sets of prototiles are called aperiodic tilings.\n\nThe subject of aperiodic tilings received new interest in the 1960s when logician Hao Wang noted connections between decision problems and tilings. In particular, he introduced tilings by square plates with colored edges, now known as \"Wang dominoes\" or \"tiles\", and posed the \"Domino Problem\": to determine whether a given set of Wang dominoes could tile the plane with matching colors on adjacent domino edges. He observed that if this problem were undecidable, then there would have to exist an aperiodic set of Wang dominoes. At the time, this seemed implausible, so Wang conjectured no such set could exist.\nWang's student Robert Berger proved that the Domino Problem was undecidable (so Wang's conjecture was incorrect) in his 1964 thesis, and obtained an aperiodic set of 20426 Wang dominoes. He also described a reduction to 104 such prototiles; the latter did not appear in his published monograph, but in 1968, Donald Knuth detailed a modification of Berger's set requiring only 92 dominoes.\n\nThe color matching required in a tiling by Wang dominoes can easily be achieved by modifying the edges of the tiles like jigsaw puzzle pieces so that they can fit together only as prescribed by the edge colorings. Raphael Robinson, in a 1971 paper which simplified Berger's techniques and undecidability proof, used this technique to obtain an aperiodic set of just six prototiles.\n\nThe first Penrose tiling (tiling P1 below) is an aperiodic set of six prototiles, introduced by Roger Penrose in a 1974 paper, but it is based on pentagons rather than squares. Any attempt to tile the plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps, but Johannes Kepler showed, in his 1619 work \"Harmonices Mundi\", that these gaps can be filled using pentagrams (star polygons), decagons and related shapes. Traces of these ideas can also be found in the work of Albrecht Dürer. Acknowledging inspiration from Kepler, Penrose found matching rules (which can be imposed by decorations of the edges) for these shapes, obtaining an aperiodic set. His tiling can be viewed as a completion of Kepler's finite \"Aa\" pattern.\n\nPenrose subsequently reduced the number of prototiles to two, discovering the kite and dart tiling (tiling P2 below) and the rhombus tiling (tiling P3 below). The rhombus tiling was independently discovered by Robert Ammann in 1976. Penrose and John H. Conway investigated the properties of Penrose tilings, and discovered that a substitution property explained their hierarchical nature; their findings were publicized by Martin Gardner in his January 1977 \"Mathematical Games column\" in \"Scientific American\".\n\nIn 1981, De Bruijn explained a method to construct Penrose tilings from five families of parallel lines as well as a \"cut and project method\", in which Penrose tilings are obtained as two-dimensional projections from a five-dimensional cubic structure. In this approach, the Penrose tiling is viewed as a set of points, its vertices, while the tiles are geometrical shapes obtained by connecting vertices with edges.\n\nThe three types of Penrose tiling, P1–P3, are described individually below. They have many common features: in each case, the tiles are constructed from shapes related to the pentagon (and hence to the golden ratio), but the basic tile shapes need to be supplemented by \"matching rules\" in order to tile aperiodically; these rules may be described using labeled vertices or edges, or patterns on the tile faces – alternatively the edge profile can be modified (e.g. by indentations and protrusions) to obtain an aperiodic set of prototiles.\n\nPenrose's first tiling uses pentagons and three other shapes: a five-pointed \"star\" (a pentagram), a \"boat\" (roughly 3/5 of a star) and a \"diamond\" (a thin rhombus). To ensure that all tilings are non-periodic, there are matching rules that specify how tiles may meet each other, and there are three different types of matching rule for the pentagonal tiles. It is common to indicate the three different types of pentagonal tiles using three different colors, as in the figure above right.\n\nPenrose's second tiling uses quadrilaterals called the \"kite\" and \"dart\", which may be combined to make a rhombus. However, the matching rules prohibit such a combination. Both the kite and dart are composed of two triangles, called \"Robinson triangles\", after 1975 notes by Robinson.\n\n\nThe matching rules can be described in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices. Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.\n\nThese rules often force the placement of certain tiles: for example, the concave vertex of any dart is necessarily filled by two kites. The corresponding figure (center of the top row in the lower image on the left) is called an \"ace\" by Conway; although it looks like an enlarged kite, it does not tile in the same way. Similarly the concave vertex formed when two kites meet along a short edge is necessarily filled by two darts (bottom right). In fact, there are only seven possible ways for the tiles to meet at a vertex; two of these figures – namely, the \"star\" (top left) and the \"sun\" (top right) – have 5-fold dihedral symmetry (by rotations and reflections), while the remainder have a single axis of reflection (vertical in the image). Apart from the ace and the sun, all of these vertex figures force the placement of additional tiles.\n\nThe third tiling uses a pair of rhombuses (often referred to as \"rhombs\" in this context) with equal sides but different angles. Ordinary rhombus-shaped tiles can be used to tile the plane periodically, so restrictions must be made on how tiles can be assembled: no two tiles may form a parallelogram, as this would allow a periodic tiling, but this constraint is not sufficient to force aperiodicity, as figure 1 above shows.\n\nThere are two kinds of tile, both of which can be decomposed into Robinson triangles.\n\nThe matching rules distinguish sides of the tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these matching rules are shown in the image on the right. In one form, tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.\n\nThere are 54 cyclically ordered combinations of such angles that add up to 360 degrees at a vertex, but the rules of the tiling allow only seven of these combinations to appear (although one of these arises in two ways).\n\nThe various combinations of angles and facial curvature allow construction of arbitrarily complex tiles, such as the \"Penrose chickens\".\n\nSeveral properties and common features of the Penrose tilings involve the golden ratio = (1+)/2 (approximately 1.618). This is the ratio of chord lengths to side lengths in a regular pentagon, and satisfies = 1 + 1/.\n\nConsequently, the ratio of the lengths of long sides to short sides in the (isosceles) Robinson triangles is :1. It follows that the ratio of long side lengths to short in both kite and dart tiles is also :1, as are the length ratios of sides to the short diagonal in the thin rhomb t, and of long diagonal to sides in the thick rhomb T. In both the P2 and P3 tilings, the ratio of the area of the larger Robinson triangle to the smaller one is :1, hence so are the ratios of the areas of the kite to the dart, and of the thick rhomb to the thin rhomb. (Both larger and smaller obtuse Robinson triangles can be found in the pentagon on the left: the larger triangles at the top – the halves of the thick rhomb – have linear dimensions scaled up by compared to the small shaded triangle at the base, and so the ratio of areas is :1.)\n\nAny Penrose tiling has local pentagonal symmetry, in the sense that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through the point, a dihedral symmetry group. This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.\n\nThere can be at most one center point of global fivefold symmetry: if there were more than one, then rotating each about the other would yield two closer centers of fivefold symmetry, which leads to a mathematical contradiction. There are only two Penrose tilings (of each type) with global pentagonal symmetry: for the P2 tiling by kites and darts, the center point is either a \"sun\" or \"star\" vertex.\n\nMany of the common features of Penrose tilings follow from a hierarchical pentagonal structure given by \"substitution rules\": this is often referred to as \"inflation\" and \"deflation\", or \"composition\" and \"decomposition\", of tilings or (collections of) tiles. The substitution rules decompose each tile into smaller tiles of the same shape as those used in the tiling (and thus allow larger tiles to be \"composed\" from smaller ones). This shows that the Penrose tiling has a scaling self-similarity, and so can be thought of as a fractal.\n\nPenrose originally discovered the P1 tiling in this way, by decomposing a pentagon into six smaller pentagons (one half of a net of a dodecahedron) and five half-diamonds; he then observed that when he repeated this process the gaps between pentagons could all be filled by stars, diamonds, boats and other pentagons. By iterating this process indefinitely he obtained one of the two P1 tilings with pentagonal symmetry.\n\nThe substitution method for both P2 and P3 tilings can be described using Robinson triangles of different sizes. The Robinson triangles arising in P2 tilings (by bisecting kites and darts) are called A-tiles, while those arising in the P3 tilings (by bisecting rhombs) are called B-tiles. The smaller A-tile, denoted A, is an obtuse Robinson triangle, while the larger A-tile, A, is acute; in contrast, a smaller B-tile, denoted B, is an acute Robinson triangle, while the larger B-tile, B, is obtuse.\n\nConcretely, if A has side lengths (1, 1, ), then A has side lengths (, , 1). B-tiles can be related to such A-tiles in two ways:\n\nIn these decompositions, there appears to be an ambiguity: Robinson triangles may be decomposed in two ways, which are mirror images of each other in the (isosceles) axis of symmetry of the triangle. In a Penrose tiling, this choice is fixed by the matching rules – furthermore, the matching rules \"also\" determine how the smaller triangles in the tiling compose to give larger ones.\nIt follows that the P2 and P3 tilings are \"mutually locally derivable\": a tiling by one set of tiles can be used to generate a tiling by another – for example a tiling by kites and darts may be subdivided into A-tiles, and these can be composed in a canonical way to form B-tiles and hence rhombs. The P2 and P3 tilings are also both mutually locally derivable with the P1 tiling (see figure 2 above).\n\nThe decomposition of B-tiles into A-tiles may be written\n(assuming the larger size convention for the B-tiles), which can be summarized in a \"substitution matrix\" equation:\nCombining this with the decomposition of enlarged A-tiles into B-tiles yields the substitution\nso that the enlarged tile A decomposes into two A tiles and one A tiles. The matching rules force a particular substitution: the two A tiles in a A tile must form a kite – thus a kite decomposes into two kites and a two half-darts, and a dart decomposes into a kite and two half-darts. Enlarged B-tiles decompose into B-tiles in a similar way (via A-tiles).\n\nComposition and decomposition can be iterated, so that, for example\nThe number of kites and darts in the \"n\"th iteration of the construction is determined by the \"n\"th power of the substitution matrix:\nwhere \"F\" is the \"n\"th Fibonacci number. The ratio of numbers of kites to darts in any sufficiently large P2 Penrose tiling pattern therefore approximates to the golden ratio . A similar result holds for the ratio of the number of thick rhombs to thin rhombs in the P3 Penrose tiling.\n\nStarting with a collection of tiles from a given tiling (which might be a single tile, a tiling of the plane, or any other collection), deflation proceeds with a sequence of steps called generations. In one generation of deflation, each tile is replaced with two or more new tiles that are scaled-down versions of tiles used in the original tiling. The substitution rules guarantee that the new tiles will be arranged in accordance with the matching rules. Repeated generations of deflation produce a tiling of the original axiom shape with smaller and smaller tiles. \nThis rule for dividing the tiles is a subdivision rule.\n\nInflation and deflation yield a method for constructing kite and dart (P2) tilings, or rhombus (P3) tilings, known as \"up-down generation\".\n\nThe Penrose tilings, being non-periodic, have no translational symmetry – the pattern cannot be shifted to match itself over the entire plane. However, any bounded region, no matter how large, will be repeated an infinite number of times within the tiling. Therefore, a finite patch cannot differentiate between the uncountably many Penrose tilings, nor even determine which position within the tiling is being shown.\n\nThis shows in particular that the number of distinct Penrose tilings (of any type) is uncountably infinite. Up-down generation yields one method to parameterize the tilings, but other methods use Ammann bars, pentagrids, or cut and project schemes.\n\nIn 1996, German mathematician Petra Gummelt demonstrated that a covering (so called to distinguish it from a non-overlapping tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed. The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) tiling. Similarly, a P3 tiling can be obtained by inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.\n\nThese coverings have been considered as a realistic model for the growth of quasicrystals: the overlapping decagons are 'quasi-unit cells' analogous to the unit cells from which crystals are constructed, and the matching rules maximize the density of certain atomic clusters.\n\nThe three variants of the Penrose tiling are mutually locally derivable. Selecting some subsets from the vertices of a P1 tiling allows to produce other non-periodic tilings. If the corners of one pentagon in P1 are labeled in succession by \"1,3,5,2,4\" an unambiguous tagging in all the pentagons is established, the order being either clockwise or counterclockwise.\nPoints with the same label define a tiling by Robinson triangles while points with the numbers 3 and 4 on them define the vertices of a Tie-and-Navette tiling.\n\nThere are also other related unequivalent tilings, such as the hexagon-boat-star and Mikulla–Roth tilings. For instance, if the matching rules for the rhombus tiling are reduced to a specific restriction on the angles permitted at each vertex, a binary tiling is obtained. Its underlying symmetry is also fivefold but it is not a quasicrystal. It can be obtained either by decorating the rhombs of the original tiling with smaller ones, or by applying substitution rules, but not by de Bruijn's cut-and-project method.\n\nThe aesthetic value of tilings has long been appreciated, and remains a source of interest in them; here the visual appearance (rather than the formal defining properties) of Penrose tilings has attracted attention. The similarity with some decorative patterns used in the Middle East has been noted; the physicists Peter J. Lu and Paul Steinhardt have presented evidence that a Penrose tiling underlies some examples of medieval Islamic geometric patterns, such as the girih (strapwork) tilings at the Darb-e Imam shrine in Isfahan.\n\nDrop City artist Clark Richert used Penrose rhombs in artwork in 1970 - derived by projecting the rhombic triacontahedron shadow onto a plane observing the embedded \"fat\" rhombi and \"skinny\" rhombi which tile together to produce the non-periodic tessellation. Art historian Martin Kemp has observed that Albrecht Dürer sketched similar motifs of a rhombus tiling.\n\nSan Francisco's new $2.2 billion Transbay Transit Center features perforations in its exterior's undulating white metal skin in the Penrose pattern.\n\nThe floor of the atrium of the Bayliss Building at The University of Western Australia is tiled with Penrose tiles.\n\nIn 1979 Miami University used a Penrose tiling executed in terrazzo to decorate the Bachelor Hall courtyard in their Department of Mathematics and Statistics.\n\nThe Andrew Wiles Building, the location of the Mathematics Department at the University of Oxford as of October 2013, includes a section of Penrose tiling as the paving of its entrance.\nThe pedestrian part of the street Keskuskatu in central Helsinki is paved using a form of Penrose tiling. The work was finished in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n"}

(also written QED and in italics: \"QED\") is an initialism of the Latin phrase meaning \"what was to be demonstrated\" or \"what was to be shown.\" Some may also use a less direct translation instead: \"thus it has been demonstrated.\" Traditionally, the phrase is placed in its abbreviated form at the end of a mathematical proof or philosophical argument when the original proposition has been restated exactly, as the conclusion of the demonstration or completion of the proof.\n\nThe phrase, \"quod erat demonstrandum\", is a translation into Latin from the Greek (; abbreviated as \"ΟΕΔ\"). Translating from the Latin into English yields, \"what was to be demonstrated\", however, translating the Greek phrase produces a slightly different meaning. Since the verb also means \"to show\" or \"to prove\", a better translation from the Greek would read, \"The very thing it was required to have shown.\"\n\nThe Greek phrase was used by many early Greek mathematicians, including Euclid and Archimedes.\n\nDuring the European Renaissance, scholars often wrote in Latin, and phrases such as \"Q.E.D.\" were often used to conclude proofs.\nPerhaps the most famous use of \"Q.E.D.\" in a philosophical argument is found in the \"Ethics\" of Baruch Spinoza, published posthumously in 1677. Written in Latin, it is considered by many to be Spinoza's \"magnum opus\". The style and system of the book are, as Spinoza says, \"demonstrated in geometrical order\", with axioms and definitions followed by propositions. For Spinoza, this is a considerable improvement over René Descartes's writing style in the \"Meditations\", which follows the form of a diary.\n\nThere is another Latin phrase with a slightly different meaning, usually shortened similarly, but being less common in use. , originating from the Greek geometers' closing (), meaning \"which had to be done\". Because of the difference in meaning, the two phrases should not be confused.\n\nEuclid used the phrase, Quod Erat Faciendum (Q.E.F.), to close propositions that were not proofs of theorems, but constructions. For example, Euclid's first proposition showing how to construct an equilateral triangle, given one side, is concluded this way.\n\n\"Q.E.D.\" has acquired many translations in various languages, including:\n\nThere is no common formal English equivalent, although the end of a proof may be announced with a simple statement such as \"this completes the proof\", \"as required\", \"hence proved\", \"ergo\", or by using a similar locution. WWWWW or W – an abbreviation of \"Which Was What Was Wanted\" – has been used similarly. Often this is considered to be more tongue-in-cheek than the usual Halmos symbol \"(see below)\" or \"Q.E.D.\"\n\nDue to the paramount importance of proofs in mathematics, mathematicians since the time of Euclid have developed conventions to demarcate the beginning and end of proofs. In printed English language texts, the formal statements of theorems, lemmas, and propositions are set in italics by tradition. The beginning of a proof usually follows immediately thereafter, and is indicated by the word \"proof\" in boldface or italics. On the other hand, several symbolic conventions exist to indicate the end of a proof.\n\nWhile some authors still use the classical abbreviation, Q.E.D., this practice is increasingly viewed as archaic or even pretentious. Paul Halmos pioneered the use of a solid black square at the end of a proof as a Q.E.D symbol, a practice which has become standard, although not universal. Halmos adopted this use of a symbol from magazine typography customs in which simple geometric shapes had been used to indicate the end of an article. This symbol was later called the \"tombstone\" or \"Halmos symbol\" or even a \"halmos\" by mathematicians. Often the Halmos symbol is drawn on chalkboard to signal the end of a proof during a lecture, although this practice is not so common as its use in printed text.\n\nThe tombstone symbol appears in TeX as the character formula_1 (filled square, \\blacksquare) and sometimes, as a formula_2 (hollow square, \\square). In the AMS Theorem Environment for LaTeX, the hollow square is the default end-of-proof symbol. Unicode explicitly provides the \"End of proof\" character, U+220E (∎). Some authors use other Unicode symbols to note the end of a proof, including, ▮ (U+25AE, a black vertical rectangle), and ‣ (U+2023, a triangular bullet). Other authors have adopted two forward slashes (//) or four forward slashes (////). In other cases, authors have elected to segregate proofs typographically by displaying them as indented blocks.\n\nIn Joseph Heller's book \"Catch-22\", the Chaplain, having been told to examine a forged letter allegedly signed by him (which he knew he didn't sign), verified that his \"name\" was in fact there. His investigator replied, \"Then you wrote it. Q.E.D.\" The chaplain said he didn't write it and that it wasn't his handwriting, to which the investigator replied, \"Then you signed your name in somebody else's handwriting again.\"\n\nIn the 1978 science-fiction radio comedy, and later in the television and novel adaptations of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", \"Q.E.D.\" is referred to in the Guide's entry for the babel fish, when it is claimed that the babel fish – which serves the \"mind-bogglingly\" useful purpose of being able to translate any spoken language when inserted into a person's ear – is used as evidence for existence and non-existence of God. The exchange from the novel is as follows: \"'I refuse to prove I exist,' says God, 'for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.' 'But,' says Man, 'The babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.' 'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.\"\n\nIn Neal Stephenson's 1999 novel \"Cryptonomicon\", Q.E.D. is used as a punchline to several humorous anecdotes in which characters go to great lengths to prove something non-mathematical.\n\nSinger-songwriter Thomas Dolby's 1988 song \"Airhead\" includes the lyric, \"Quod erat demonstrandum, baby,\" referring to the self-evident vacuousness of the eponymous subject; and in response, a female voice squeals, delightedly, \"Oooh... you speak French!\" \n\n\n"}

At its peak it consisted of about 60 mathematicians spread throughout the academic world that were experimenting with quaternions and other hypercomplex number systems. The guiding light was Alexander Macfarlane who served as its Secretary initially, and became President in 1909. The Association published a \"Bibliography\" in 1904 and a \"Bulletin\" (annual report) from 1900 to 1913.\n\nThe \"Bulletin\" became a review journal for topics in vector analysis and abstract algebra such as the theory of equipollence. The mathematical work reviewed pertained largely to matrices and linear algebra as the methods were in rapid development at the time.\nIn 1895, Professor P. Molenbroek of The Hague, Holland, and Shinkichi Kimura studying at Yale put out a call for scholars to form the society in widely circulated journals: Nature, Science, and the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society. Giuseppe Peano also announced the society formation in his \"Rivista di Matematica\". \n\nThe call to form an Association was encouraged by Macfarlane in 1896:\n\nIn 1897 the British Association met in Toronto where vector products were discussed:\n\nA system of national secretaries was announced in the AMS Bulletin in 1899: Alexander MacAulay for Australasia, Victor Schlegel for Germany, Joly for Great Britain and Ireland, Giuseppe Peano for Italy, Kimura for Japan, Aleksandr Kotelnikov for Russia, F. Kraft for Switzerland, and Arthur Stafford Hathaway for the USA. For France the national secretary was Paul Genty, an engineer with the division of Ponts et Chaussees, and a quaternion collaborator with Charles-Ange Laisant, author of \"Methode des Quaterniones\" (1881).\n\nVictor Schlegel reported on the new institution in the Monatshefte für Mathematik.\n\nWhen the Society was organized in 1899, Peter Guthrie Tait was chosen as president, but he declined for reasons of poor health.\n\nThe first President was Robert Stawell Ball and Alexander Macfarlane served as Secretary and Treasurer. In 1905 Charles Jasper Joly took over as President and L. van Elfrinkhof as Treasurer while Macfarlane continued as Secretary. In 1909 Macfarlane became President, James Byrnie Shaw became Secretary, and van Elfrinkhof continued as Treasurer. The next year Macfarlane and Shaw continued in their posts while Macfarlane also absorbed the office of Treasurer. When Macfarlane died in 1913 after nearly completing the issue of the Bulletin, Shaw completed it and wound up the Association.\n\nThe rules state that the President had the power of veto.\n\nThe \"Bulletin of the Association Promoting the Study of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics\" was issued nine times under the editorship of Alexander Macfarlane. Every issue listed the officers of the Association, governing council, rules, members, and a financial statement from the treasurer. Today HathiTrust provides access to these publications that are mainly of historical interest:\n\nPublished in 1904 at Dublin, cradle of quaternions, the 86 page \"Bibliography of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics\" cited some one thousand references. The publication set a professional standard; for instance the \"Manual of Quaternions\" (1905) of Joly has no bibliography beyond citation of Macfarlane.\nFurthermore, in 1967 when M.J. Crowe published \"A History of Vector Analysis\", he wrote in the preface (page ix) :\n\nEvery year more papers and books appeared that were of interest to Association members so it was necessary to update the \"Bibliography\" with supplements in the \"Bulletin\". The categories used to group the items in the supplements give a sense of the changing focus of the Association:\n\nIn 1913 Macfarlane died, and as related by Dirk Struik, the Society \"became a victim of the first World War\".\n\nJames Byrnie Shaw, the surviving officer, wrote 50 book notices for American mathematical publications.\nThe final article review in the \"Bulletin\" was The Wilson and Lewis Algebra of Four-Dimensional Space written by J. B. Shaw. He summarizes,\nThe article reviewed was \"The space-time manifold of relativity, the non-euclidean geometry of mechanics, and electromagnetics\".\nHowever, when the textbook \"The Theory of Relativity\" by Ludwik Silberstein in 1914 was made available as an English understanding of Minkowski space, the algebra of biquaternions was applied, but without references to the British background or Macfarlane or other quaternionists of the Society. The language of quaternions had become international, providing content to set theory and expanded mathematical notation, and expressing mathematical physics.\n\n"}
