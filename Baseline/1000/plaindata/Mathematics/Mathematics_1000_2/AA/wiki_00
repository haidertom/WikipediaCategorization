{"id": "11219603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11219603", "title": "Bracket (mathematics)", "text": "Bracket (mathematics)\n\nIn mathematics, various typographical forms of brackets are frequently used in mathematical notation such as parentheses ( ), square brackets [ ], braces { }, and angle brackets ⟨ ⟩. Generally such bracketing denotes some form of grouping: in evaluating an expression containing a bracketed sub-expression, the operators in the sub-expression take precedence over those surrounding it. Additionally, there are several uses and meanings for the various brackets.\n\nHistorically, other notations, such as the vinculum, were similarly used for grouping; in present-day use, these notations all have specific meanings. The earliest use of brackets to indicate aggregation (i.e. grouping) was suggested in 1608 by Christopher Clavius and in 1629 by Albert Girard.\n\nA variety of different symbols are used to represent angle brackets. In e-mail and other ASCII text it is common to use the less-than (codice_1) and greater-than (codice_2) signs to represent angle brackets, because ASCII does not include angle brackets. Unicode has three pairs of dedicated characters:\n\nIn LaTeX the markup is codice_3 and codice_4: formula_1.\n\nIn elementary algebra parentheses, ( ), are used to specify the order of operations. Terms inside the bracket are evaluated first; hence 2×(3 + 4) is 14 and 10 ÷ 5(1 + 0) is 2 and 8 ÷ 4(2 + 0) is 1 and (2×3) + 4 is 10. This notation is extended to cover more general algebra involving variables: for example formula_2. Square brackets are also often used in place of a second set of parentheses when they are nested, to provide a visual distinction.\n\nAlso in mathematical expressions in general, parentheses are used to indicate grouping (that is, which parts belong together) when necessary to avoid ambiguities, or for the sake of clarity. For example, in the formula (εη) = εη, used in the definition of composition of two natural transformations, the parentheses around εη serve to indicate that the indexing by \"X\" is applied to the composition εη, and not just its last component η.\n\nThe arguments to a function are frequently surrounded by brackets: formula_3. It is common to omit the parentheses around the argument when there is little chance of ambiguity, thus: formula_4.\n\nIn the cartesian coordinate system brackets are used to specify the coordinates of a point: (2,3) denotes the point with \"x\"-coordinate 2 and \"y\"-coordinate 3. \n\nThe inner product of two vectors is commonly written as formula_5, but the notation (\"a\", \"b\") is also used.\n\nBoth parentheses, ( ), and square brackets, [ ], can also be used to denote an interval. The notation formula_6 is used to indicate an interval from a to c that is inclusive of formula_7 but exclusive of formula_8. That is, formula_9 would be the set of all real numbers between 5 and 12, including 5 but not 12. The numbers may come as close as they like to 12, including 11.999 and so forth (with any finite number of 9s), but 12.0 is not included. In some European countries, the notation formula_10 is also used for this.\n\nThe endpoint adjoining the square bracket is known as \"closed\", while the endpoint adjoining the parenthesis is known as \"open\". If both types of brackets are the same, the entire interval may be referred to as \"closed\" or \"open\" as appropriate. Whenever infinity or negative infinity is used as an endpoint in the case of intervals on the real number line, it is always considered \"open\" and adjoined to a parenthesis. The endpoint can be closed when considering intervals on the extended real number line.\n\nBraces { } are used to identify the elements of a set: {\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"} denotes a set of three elements. \n\nAngle brackets are used in group theory to write group presentations, and to denote the subgroup generated by a collection of elements.\n\nAn explicitly given matrix is commonly written between large round or square brackets:\n\nThe notation\nstands for the \"n\"-th derivative of function \"f\", applied to argument \"x\". So, for example, if formula_13, then formula_14. This is to be contrasted with formula_15, the \"n\"-fold application of \"f\" to argument \"x\".\n\nThe notation (\"x\") is used to denote the \"falling factorial\", an \"n\"-th degree polynomial defined by\n\nConfusingly, the same notation may be encountered as representing the \"rising factorial\", also called \"Pochhammer symbol\". Another notation for the same is \"x\". It can be defined by\n\nIn quantum mechanics, angle brackets are also used as part of Dirac's formalism, bra–ket notation, to note vectors from the dual spaces of the bra formula_18 and the ket formula_19. \n\nIn statistical mechanics, angle brackets denote ensemble or time average.\n\nSquare brackets are used to denote the variable in polynomial rings. For example, formula_20 is the polynomial ring with the formula_21 variable and real number coefficients.\n\nIn group theory and ring theory, square brackets are used to denote the commutator. In group theory, the commutator <nowiki>[</nowiki>\"g\",\"h\"<nowiki>]</nowiki> is commonly defined as \"g\"\"h\"\"gh\". In ring theory, the commutator <nowiki>[</nowiki>\"a\",\"b\"<nowiki>]</nowiki> is defined as \"ab\" − \"ba\". Furthermore, in theory, braces are used to denote the anticommutator where {\"a\",\"b\"} is defined as \"ab\" + \"ba\". \n\nThe Lie bracket of a Lie algebra is a binary operation denoted by formula_22. By using the commutator as a Lie bracket, every associative algebra can be turned into a Lie algebra. There are many different forms of Lie bracket, in particular the Lie derivative and the Jacobi–Lie bracket.\n\nSquare brackets, as in , are sometimes used to denote the floor function, which rounds a real number down to the next integer. However the floor and ceiling functions are usually typeset with left and right square brackets where only the lower (for floor function) or upper (for ceiling function) horizontal bars are displayed, as in or .\n\nBraces, as in , may denote the fractional part of a real number.\n\n"}
{"id": "4542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4542", "title": "Bra–ket notation", "text": "Bra–ket notation\n\nIn quantum mechanics, bra–ket notation is a standard notation for describing quantum states. It can also be used to denote abstract vectors and linear functionals in mathematics. The notation uses angle brackets (the ⟨ and ⟩ symbols) and a vertical bar (the | symbol), to denote the scalar product of vectors or the action of a linear functional on a vector in a complex vector space. The scalar product or action is written as\n\nThe right part is called the ket ; it is a vector, typically represented as a column vector and written \n\nThe left part is called the bra, ; it is the Hermitian conjugate of the ket with the same label, typically represented as a row vector and is written\n\nA combination of bras, kets, and operators is interpreted using matrix multiplication. A bra and a ket with the same label are Hermitian conjugates of each other.\n\nBra-ket notation was introduced in 1939 by Paul Dirac and is also known as the Dirac notation. \n\nThe bra-ket notation has a precursor in Hermann Grassmann's use of the notation formula_4for his inner products nearly 100 years earlier.\n\nBra–ket notation is a notation for linear algebra, particularly focused on vectors, inner products, linear operators, Hermitian conjugation, and the dual space, for both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional complex vector spaces. It is specifically designed to ease the types of calculations that frequently come up in quantum mechanics.\n\nIts use in quantum mechanics is quite widespread. Many phenomena that are explained using quantum mechanics are usually explained using bra–ket notation.\n\nIn simple cases, a ket can be described as a column vector, a bra with the same label is its conjugate transpose (which is a row vector), and writing bras, kets, and linear operators next to each other implies matrix multiplication. However, kets may also exist in uncountably-infinite-dimensional vector spaces, such that they cannot be literally written as a column vector. Also, writing a column vector as a list of numbers requires picking a basis, whereas one can write \" without committing to any particular basis. This is helpful because quantum mechanics calculations involve frequently switching between different bases (e.g. position basis, momentum basis, energy eigenbasis, etc.), so it is better to have the basis vectors (if any) written out explicitly. In some situations involving two important basis vectors they will be referred to simply as \" and \"\".\n\nThe standard mathematical notation for the inner product, preferred as well by some physicists, expresses exactly the same thing as the bra–ket notation,\n\nBras and kets can also be configured in other ways, such as the outer product\n\nwhich can also be represented as a matrix multiplication (i.e., a column vector times a row vector equals a matrix).\n\nIf the ket is an element of a vector space, the bra is technically an element of its dual space—see Riesz representation theorem.\n\nIn mathematics, the term \"vector\" is used to refer generally to any element of any vector space. In physics, however, the term \"vector\" is much more specific: \"Vector\" refers almost exclusively to quantities like displacement or velocity, which have three components that relate directly to the three dimensions of the real world. Such vectors are typically denoted with over arrows () or boldface ().\n\nIn quantum mechanics, a quantum state is typically represented as an element of an abstract complex vector space—for example the infinite-dimensional vector space of all possible wavefunctions (functions mapping each point of 3D space to a complex number). Since the term \"vector\" is already used for something else (see previous paragraph), it is very common to refer to these elements of abstract complex vector spaces as \"kets\", and to write them using ket notation.\n\nKet notation, invented by Dirac, uses vertical bars and angular brackets: . When this notation is used, these quantities are called \"kets\", and is read as \"ket-A\". These kets can be manipulated using the usual rules of linear algebra, for example:\n\nNote how any symbols, letters, numbers, or even words—whatever serves as a convenient label—can be used as the label inside a ket. For example, the last line above involves infinitely many different kets, one for each real number . In other words, the symbol \" has a specific and universal mathematical meaning, while just the \" by itself does not. For example, might or might not be equal to . Nevertheless, for convenience, there is usually some logical scheme behind the labels inside kets, such as the common practice of labeling energy eigenkets in quantum mechanics through a listing of their quantum numbers.\n\nAn inner product is a generalization of the dot product. The inner product of two vectors is a scalar. In neutral notation (notation dedicated to the inner product \"only\"), this might be written , where and are elements of the abstract vector space, i.e. both are \"kets\".\n\nBra–ket notation uses a specific notation for inner products:\n\nBra–ket notation splits this inner product (also called a \"bracket\") into two pieces, the \"bra\" and the \"ket\":\n\nwhere is called a bra, read as \"bra-A\", and is a ket as above.\n\nThe purpose of \"splitting\" the inner product into a bra and a ket is that \"both\" the bra and the ket are meaningful \"on their own\", and can be used in other contexts besides within an inner product. There are two main ways to think about the meanings of separate bras and kets. Accordingly, the interpretation of the expression has a second interpretation, namely that of the action of a linear functional per below.\n\nFor a finite-dimensional vector space, using a fixed orthonormal basis, the inner product can be written as a matrix multiplication of a row vector with a column vector:\nBased on this, the bras and kets can be defined as:\nand then it is understood that a bra next to a ket implies matrix multiplication.\n\nThe conjugate transpose (also called \"Hermitian conjugate\") of a bra is the corresponding ket and vice versa:\nbecause if one starts with the bra\nthen performs a complex conjugation, and then a matrix transpose, one ends up with the ket\n\nA more abstract definition, which is equivalent but more easily generalized to infinite-dimensional spaces, is to say that bras are linear functionals on the space of kets, i.e. linear transformations that input a ket and output a complex number. The bra linear functionals are defined to be consistent with the inner product. Thus, if is the linear functional corresponding to under the Riesz representation theorem, then\n\ni.e. it produces \"the same\" complex number as the inner product does. The terminology for the right hand side is though \"not\" inner product, which always involves two \"kets\". Confusing this is harmless, since the same number is produced in the end.\n\nIn mathematics terminology, the vector space of bras is the dual space to the vector space of kets, and corresponding bras and kets are related by the Riesz representation theorem.\n\nBra–ket notation can be used even if the vector space is not a Hilbert space.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, it is common practice to write down kets which have infinite norm, i.e. non-normalizable wavefunctions. Examples include states whose wavefunctions are Dirac delta functions or infinite plane waves. These do not, technically, belong to the Hilbert space itself. However, the definition of \"Hilbert space\" can be broadened to accommodate these states (see the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction or rigged Hilbert spaces). The bra–ket notation continues to work in an analogous way in this broader context.\n\nBanach spaces are a different generalization of Hilbert spaces. In a Banach space , the vectors may be notated by kets and the continuous linear functionals by bras. Over any vector space without topology, we may also notate the vectors by kets and the linear functionals by bras. In these more general contexts, the bracket does not have the meaning of an inner product, because the Riesz representation theorem does not apply.\n\nThe mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is based in large part on linear algebra:\n\nSince virtually every calculation in quantum mechanics involves vectors and linear operators, it can involve, and often does involve, bra–ket notation. A few examples follow:\n\nThe Hilbert space of a spin-0 point particle is spanned by a \"position basis\" , where the label extends over the set of all points in position space. This label is the eigenvalue of the position operator acting on such a basis state, formula_16. Since there are an uncountably infinite number of vector components in the basis, this is an uncountably infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The dimensions of the Hilbert space (usually infinite) and position space (usually 1, 2 or 3) are not to be conflated.\n\nStarting from any ket in this Hilbert space, one may \"define\" a complex scalar function of , known as a wavefunction,\n\nOn the left-hand side, is a function mapping any point in space to a complex number; on the right-hand side, is a ket consisting of a superposition of kets with relative coefficients specified by that function.\n\nIt is then customary to define linear operators acting on wavefunctions in terms of linear operators acting on kets, by\n\nFor instance, the momentum operator has the following form,\n\nOne occasionally encounters an expression such as\nthough this is something of an abuse of notation. The differential operator must be understood to be an abstract operator, acting on kets, that has the effect of differentiating wavefunctions once the expression is projected into the position basis,\neven though, in the momentum basis, the operator amounts to a mere multiplication operator (by ).\n\nIn quantum mechanics the expression is typically interpreted as the probability amplitude for the state to collapse into the state . Mathematically, this means the coefficient for the projection of onto . It is also described as the projection of state onto state .\n\nA stationary spin- particle has a two-dimensional Hilbert space. One orthonormal basis is:\nwhere is the state with a definite value of the spin operator equal to + and is the state with a definite value of the spin operator equal to −.\n\nSince these are a basis, \"any\" quantum state of the particle can be expressed as a linear combination (i.e., quantum superposition) of these two states:\nwhere and are complex numbers.\n\nA \"different\" basis for the same Hilbert space is:\ndefined in terms of rather than .\n\nAgain, \"any\" state of the particle can be expressed as a linear combination of these two:\n\nIn vector form, you might write\ndepending on which basis you are using. In other words, the \"coordinates\" of a vector depend on the basis used.\n\nThere is a mathematical relationship between , , and ; see change of basis.\n\nThere are a few conventions and abuses of notation that are generally accepted by the physics community, but which might confuse the non-initiated.\n\nIt is common to use the same symbol for \"labels\" and \"constants\" in the same equation. For example, , where the symbol is used simultaneously as the \"name of the operator\" , its \"eigenvector\" and the associated \"eigenvalue\" .\n\nSomething similar occurs in component notation of vectors. While (uppercase) is traditionally associated with wavefunctions, (lowercase) may be used to denote a \"label\", a \"wave function\" or \"complex constant\" in the same context, usually differentiated only by a subscript.\n\nThe main abuses are including operations inside the vector labels. This is done for a fast notation of scaling vectors. E.g. if the vector is scaled by , it might be denoted by , which makes no sense since is a label, not a function or a number, so you can't perform operations on it.\n\nThis is especially common when denoting vectors as tensor products, where part of the labels are moved outside the designed slot, e.g. . Here part of the labeling that should state that all three vectors are different was moved outside the kets, as subscripts 1 and 2. And a further abuse occurs, since is meant to refer to the norm of the first vector—which is a \"label\" denoting a \"value\".\n\nA linear operator is a map that inputs a ket and outputs a ket. (In order to be called \"linear\", it is required to have certain properties.) In other words, if is a linear operator and is a ket, then is another ket.\n\nIn an -dimensional Hilbert space, can be written as an column vector, and then is an matrix with complex entries. The ket can be computed by normal matrix multiplication.\n\nLinear operators are ubiquitous in the theory of quantum mechanics. For example, observable physical quantities are represented by self-adjoint operators, such as energy or momentum, whereas transformative processes are represented by unitary linear operators such as rotation or the progression of time.\n\nOperators can also be viewed as acting on bras \"from the right hand side\". Specifically, if is a linear operator and is a bra, then is another bra defined by the rule\n\nIn an -dimensional Hilbert space, can be written as a row vector, and (as in the previous section) is an matrix. Then the bra can be computed by normal matrix multiplication.\n\nIf the same state vector appears on both bra and ket side,\nthen this expression gives the expectation value, or mean or average value, of the observable represented by operator for the physical system in the state .\n\nA convenient way to define linear operators on a Hilbert space is given by the outer product: if is a bra and is a ket, the outer product\ndenotes the rank-one operator with the rule \n\nFor a finite-dimensional vector space, the outer product can be understood as simple matrix multiplication:\nThe outer product is an matrix, as expected for a linear operator.\n\nOne of the uses of the outer product is to construct projection operators. Given a ket of norm 1, the orthogonal projection onto the subspace spanned by is\n\nJust as kets and bras can be transformed into each other (making into ), the element from the dual space corresponding to is , where denotes the Hermitian conjugate (or adjoint) of the operator . In other words,\n\nIf is expressed as an matrix, then is its conjugate transpose.\n\nSelf-adjoint operators, where , play an important role in quantum mechanics; for example, an observable is always described by a self-adjoint operator. If is a self-adjoint operator, then is always a real number (not complex). This implies that expectation values of observables are real.\n\nBra–ket notation was designed to facilitate the formal manipulation of linear-algebraic expressions. Some of the properties that allow this manipulation are listed herein. In what follows, and denote arbitrary complex numbers, denotes the complex conjugate of , and denote arbitrary linear operators, and these properties are to hold for any choice of bras and kets.\n\n\n\nGiven any expression involving complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators (but not addition), written in bra–ket notation, the parenthetical groupings do not matter (i.e., the associative property holds). For example:\nand so forth. The expressions on the right (with no parentheses whatsoever) are allowed to be written unambiguously \"because\" of the equalities on the left. Note that the associative property does \"not\" hold for expressions that include nonlinear operators, such as the antilinear time reversal operator in physics.\n\nBra–ket notation makes it particularly easy to compute the Hermitian conjugate (also called \"dagger\", and denoted ) of expressions. The formal rules are:\n\nThese rules are sufficient to formally write the Hermitian conjugate of any such expression; some examples are as follows:\n\n\nTwo Hilbert spaces and may form a third space by a tensor product. In quantum mechanics, this is used for describing composite systems. If a system is composed of two subsystems described in and respectively, then the Hilbert space of the entire system is the tensor product of the two spaces. (The exception to this is if the subsystems are actually identical particles. In that case, the situation is a little more complicated.)\n\nIf is a ket in and is a ket in , the direct product of the two kets is a ket in . This is written in various notations:\n\nSee quantum entanglement and the EPR paradox for applications of this product.\n\nConsider a complete orthonormal system (\"basis\"),\nfor a Hilbert space , with respect to the norm from an inner product . \n\nFrom basic functional analysis, it is known that any ket can also be written as\nwith the inner product on the Hilbert space.\n\nFrom the commutativity of kets with (complex) scalars, it follows that\nmust be the \"identity operator\", which sends each vector to itself. \n\nThis, then, can be inserted in any expression without affecting its value; for example\nwhere, in the last identity, the Einstein summation convention has been used.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, it often occurs that little or no information about the inner product of two arbitrary (state) kets is present, while it is still possible to say something about the expansion coefficients and of those vectors with respect to a specific (orthonormalized) basis. In this case, it is particularly useful to insert the unit operator into the bracket one time or more.\n\nFor more information, see Resolution of the identity, \n\nSince , plane waves follow, .\n\nTypically, when all matrix elements of an operator such as \nare available,\nthis resolution serves to reconstitute the full operator,\n\nThe object physicists are considering when using bra–ket notation is a Hilbert space (a complete inner product space).\n\nLet be a Hilbert space and a vector in .

The isomorphism is defined by , where for every we define\nwhere , , and are just different notations for expressing an inner product between two elements in a Hilbert space (or for the first three, in any inner product space). Notational confusion arises when identifying and with and respectively. This is because of literal symbolic substitutions. Let and let . This gives\n\nOne ignores the parentheses and removes the double bars. Some properties of this notation are convenient since we are dealing with linear operators and composition acts like a ring multiplication.\n\nMoreover, mathematicians usually write the dual entity not at the first place, as the physicists do, but at the second one, and they usually use not an asterisk but an overline (which the physicists reserve for averages and the Dirac spinor adjoint) to denote complex conjugate numbers; i.e., for scalar products mathematicians usually write\nwhereas physicists would write for the same quantity\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "515096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=515096", "title": "Canonical form", "text": "Canonical form\n\nIn mathematics and computer science, a canonical, normal, or standard form of a mathematical object is a standard way of presenting that object as a mathematical expression. The distinction between \"canonical\" and \"normal\" forms varies by subfield. In most fields, a canonical form specifies a \"unique\" representation for every object, while a normal form simply specifies its form, without the requirement of uniqueness.\n\nThe canonical form of a positive integer in decimal representation is a finite sequence of digits that does not begin with zero.\n\nMore generally, for a class of objects on which an equivalence relation is defined, a canonical form consists in the choice of a specific object in each class. For example, Jordan normal form is a canonical form for matrix similarity, and the row echelon form is a canonical form, when one considers as equivalent a matrix and its left product by an invertible matrix.\n\nIn computer science, and more specifically in computer algebra, when representing mathematical objects in a computer, there are usually many different ways to represent the same object. In this context, a canonical form is a representation such that every object has a unique representation. Thus, the equality of two objects can easily be tested by testing the equality of their canonical forms. However canonical forms frequently depend on arbitrary choices (like ordering the variables), and this introduces difficulties for testing the equality of two objects resulting on independent computations. Therefore, in computer algebra, \"normal form\" is a weaker notion: A normal form is a representation such that zero is uniquely represented. This allows testing for equality by putting the difference of two objects in normal form.\n\nCanonical form can also mean a differential form that is defined in a natural (canonical) way.\n\nIn computer science, data that has more than one possible representation can often be canonicalized into a completely unique representation called its canonical form. Putting something into canonical form is canonicalization.\n\nSuppose we have some set \"S\" of objects, with an equivalence relation \"R\". A canonical form is given by designating some objects of \"S\" to be \"in canonical form\", such that every object under consideration is equivalent to exactly one object in canonical form. In other words, the canonical forms in \"S\" represent the equivalence classes, once and only once. To test whether two objects are equivalent, it then suffices to test their canonical forms for equality.\nA canonical form thus provides a classification theorem and more, in that it not just classifies every class, but gives a distinguished (canonical) representative.\n\nFormally, a canonicalization with respect to an equivalence relation \"R\" on a set \"S\" is a mapping \"c\":\"S\"→\"S\" such that for all \"s\", \"s\", \"s\" ∈ \"S\":\nProperty 3 is redundant, it follows by applying 2 to 1.\n\nIn practical terms, one wants to be able to recognize the canonical forms. There is also a practical, algorithmic question to consider: how to pass from a given object \"s\" in \"S\" to its canonical form \"s\"*? Canonical forms are generally used to make operating with equivalence classes more effective. For example, in modular arithmetic, the canonical form for a residue class is usually taken as the least non-negative integer in it. Operations on classes are carried out by combining these representatives and then reducing the result to its least non-negative residue.\nThe uniqueness requirement is sometimes relaxed, allowing the forms to be unique up to some finer equivalence relation, like allowing reordering of terms (if there is no natural ordering on terms).\n\nA canonical form may simply be a convention, or a deep theorem.\n\nFor example, polynomials are conventionally written with the terms in descending powers: it is more usual to write \"x\" + \"x\" + 30 than \"x\" + 30 + \"x\", although the two forms define the same polynomial. By contrast, the existence of Jordan canonical form for a matrix is a deep theorem.\n\nNote: in this section, \"up to\" some equivalence relation E means that the canonical form is not unique in general, but that if one object has two different canonical forms, they are E-equivalent.\n\n\n\nIn analytic geometry:\n\nBy contrast, there are alternative forms for writing equations. For example, the equation of a line may be written as a linear equation in point-slope and slope-intercept form.\n\nConvex polyhedra can be put into canonical form such that:\n\nStandard form is used by many mathematicians and scientists to write extremely large numbers in a more concise and understandable way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn graph theory, a branch of mathematics, graph canonization is the problem finding a canonical form of a given graph \"G\". A canonical form is a labeled graph Canon(\"G\") that is isomorphic to \"G\", such that every graph that is isomorphic to \"G\" has the same canonical form as \"G\". Thus, from a solution to the graph canonization problem, one could also solve the problem of graph isomorphism: to test whether two graphs \"G\" and \"H\" are isomorphic, compute their canonical forms Canon(\"G\") and Canon(\"H\"), and test whether these two canonical forms are identical.\n\nCanonical differential forms include the canonical one-form and canonical symplectic form, important in the study of Hamiltonian mechanics and symplectic manifolds.\n\nIn computing, the reduction of data to any kind of canonical form is commonly called \"data normalization\".\n\nFor instance, database normalization is the process of organizing the fields and tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency. \n\nIn the field of software security, a common vulnerability is unchecked malicious input. The mitigation for this problem is proper input validation. Before input validation may be performed, the input must be normalized, i.e., eliminating encoding (for instance HTML encoding) and reducing the input data to a single common character set.\n\nOther forms of data, typically associated with signal processing (including audio and imaging) or machine learning, can be normalized in order to provide a limited range of values.\n\n\n"}

However, most textbooks refer to a subsequent similar work by Michel Chasles dating 1830. Several other scholars contemporaries of M. Chasles obtained the same or similar results around that time, including G. Giorgini, Cauchy, Poinsot, Poisson and Rodrigues. An account of the 1763 proof by Giulio Mozzi and some of its history can be found here.\n\nMozzi considers a rigid body undergoing first a rotation about an axis passing through the center of mass and then a translation of displacement D in an arbitrary direction. Any rigid motion can be accomplished in this way due to a theorem by Euler on the existence of an axis of rotation. \nThe displacement D of the center of mass can be decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the axis. The perpendicular (and parallel) component acts on all points of the rigid body but Mozzi shows that for some points the previous rotation acted exactly with an opposite displacement, so those points are translated parallel to the axis of rotation. These points lie on the Mozzi axis through which the rigid motion can be accomplished through a screw motion.\n\nAnother elementary proof of Mozzi–Chasles' theorem was given by E. T. Whittaker in 1904. Suppose \"A\" is to be transformed into \"B\". Whittaker suggests that line \"AK\" be selected parallel to the axis of the given rotation, with \"K\" the foot of a perpendicular from \"B\". The appropriate screw displacement is about an axis parallel to \"AK\" such that \"K\" is moved to \"B\". The method corresponds to Euclidean plane isometry where a composition of rotation and translation can be replaced by rotation about an appropriate center. In Whittaker's terms, \"A rotation about any axis is equivalent to a rotation through the same angle about any axis parallel to it, together with a simple translation in a direction perpendicular to the axis.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "5021705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5021705", "title": "Conway polyhedron notation", "text": "Conway polyhedron notation\n\nIn geometry, Conway polyhedron notation, invented by John Horton Conway and promoted by George W. Hart, is used to describe polyhedra based on a seed polyhedron modified by various prefix operations.\n\nConway and Hart extended the idea of using operators, like truncation as defined by Kepler, to build related polyhedra of the same symmetry. For example, \"tC\" represents a truncated cube, and \"taC\", parsed as , is a truncated cuboctahedron. The simplest operator dual swaps vertex and face elements; e.g., a dual cube is an octahedron: \"dC\"=\"O\". Applied in a series, these operators allow many higher order polyhedra to be generated. Conway defined the operators \"abdegjkmost\", while Hart added \"r\" and \"p\". Conway's basic operations are sufficient to generate the Archimedean and Catalan solids from the Platonic solids. Some basic operations can be made as composites of others. Later implementations named further operators, sometimes referred to as \"extended\" operators.\n\nIn general, it is difficult to predict the resulting appearance of the composite of two or more operations from a given seed polyhedron. For instance, ambo applied twice is the expand operation: \"aa\" = \"e\", while a truncation after ambo produces bevel: \"ta\" = \"b\". Many basic questions about Conway operators remain open, for instance, how many operators of a given \"size\" exist.\n\nIn Conway's notation, operations on polyhedra are applied like functions, from right to left. For example, a cuboctahedron is an \"ambo cube\", i.e. , and a truncated cuboctahedron is . Repeated application of an operator can be denoted with an exponent: \"j\" = \"o\". In general, Conway operators are not commutative. The resulting polyhedron has a fixed topology (vertices, edges, faces), while exact geometry is not specified: it can be thought of as one of many embeddings of a polyhedral graph on the sphere. Often the polyhedron is put into canonical form.\n\nIndividual operators can be visualized in terms of \"chambers\", as below. Each white chamber is a rotated version of the others. For achiral operators, the red chambers are a reflection of the white chambers. Achiral and chiral operators are also called local symmetry-preserving operations (LSP) and local operations that preserve orientation-preserving symmetries (LOPSP), respectively, although the exact definition is a little more restrictive.\n\nThe relationship between the number of vertices, edges, and faces of the seed and the polyhedron created by the operations listed in this article can be expressed as a matrix formula_1. When \"x\" is the operator, formula_2 are the vertices, edges, and faces of the seed (respectively), and formula_3 are the vertices, edges, and faces of the result, then \n\nThe matrix for the composition of two operators is just the product of the matrixes for the two operators. Distinct operators may have the same matrix, for example, \"p\" and \"l\". The edge count of the result is an integer multiple \"d\" of that of the seed: this is called the inflation rate, or the edge factor.\n\nThe simplest operators, the identity operator \"S\" and the dual operator \"d\", have simple matrix forms:\nTwo dual operators cancel out; \"dd\" = \"S\", and the square of formula_7 is the identity matrix. When applied to other operators, the dual operator corresponds to horizontal and vertical reflections of the matrix. Operators can be grouped into groups of four (or fewer if some forms are the same) by identifying the operators \"x\", \"xd\" (operator of dual), \"dx\" (dual of operator), and \"dxd\" (conjugate of operator). In this article, only the matrix for \"x\" is given, since the others are simple reflections.\n\nHart introduced the reflection operator \"r\", that gives the mirror image of the polyhedron. This is not strictly a LOPSP, since it does not preserve orientation (it reverses it). \"r\" has no effect on achiral seeds, and \"rr\" returns the original seed. An overline can be used to indicate the other chiral form of an operator, like = \"rsr\". \"r\" does not affect the matrix.\n\nAn operation is irreducible if it cannot be expressed as a composition of operators aside from \"d\" and \"r\". The majority of Conway's original operators are irreducible: the exceptions are \"e\", \"b\", \"o\", and \"m\".\n\nSome open questions about Conway operators include:\n\nStrictly, seed (\"S\"), needle (\"n\"), and zip (\"z\") were not included by Conway, but they are related to original Conway operations by duality so are included here.\n\nFrom here on, operations are visualized on cube seeds, drawn on the surface of that cube. Blue faces cross edges of the seed, and pink faces lie over vertices of the seed. There is some flexibility in the exact placement of vertices, especially with chiral operators. \n\nAny polyhedron can serve as a seed, as long as the operations can be executed on it. Common seeds have been assigned a letter.\nThe Platonic solids are represented by the first letter of their name (Tetrahedron, Octahedron, Cube, Icosahedron, Dodecahedron); the prisms (P) for \"n\"-gonal forms; antiprisms (A); cupolae (U); anticupolae (V); and pyramids (Y). Any Johnson solid can be referenced as J, for \"n\"=1..92.\n\nAll of the five regular polyhedra can be generated from prismatic generators with zero to two operators:\n\nThe regular Euclidean tilings can also be used as seeds:\n\nThese are operations created after Conway's original set. Note that many more operations exist than have been named; just because an operation is not here does not mean it does not exist (or is not an LSP or LOPSP). To simplify, only irreducible operators are \nincluded in this list: others can be created by composing operators together.\n\nA number of operators can be grouped together by some criteria, or have their behavior modified by an index. These are written as an operator with a subscript: \"x\".\n\nAugmentation operations retain original edges. They may be applied to any independent subset of faces, or may be converted into a \"join\"-form by removing the original edges. Conway notation supports an optional index to these operators: 0 for the join-form, or 3 or higher for how many sides affected faces have. For example, \"k\"\"Y\"=O: taking a square-based pyramid and gluing another pyramid to the square base gives an octahedron.\nThe truncate operator \"t\" also has an index form \"t\", indicating that only vertices of a certain degree are truncated. It is equivalent to \"dkd\".\n\nSome of the extended operators can be created in special cases with \"k\" and \"t\" operators. For example, a chamfered cube, \"cC\", can be constructed as \"t\"\"daC\", as a rhombic dodecahedron, \"daC\" or \"jC\", with its degree-4 vertices truncated. A lofted cube, \"lC\" is the same as \"t\"\"kC\". A quinto-dodecahedron, \"qD\" can be constructed as \"t\"\"daaD\" or \"t\"\"deD\" or \"t\"\"oD\", a deltoidal hexecontahedron, \"deD\" or \"oD\", with its degree-5 vertices truncated.\n\nMeta adds vertices at the center and along the edges, while bevel adds faces at the center, seed vertices, and along the edges. The index is how many vertices or faces are added along the edges. Meta (in its non-indexed form) is also called cantitruncation or omnitruncation. Note that 0 here does not mean the same as for augmentation operations: it means zero vertices (or faces) are added along the edges.\nMedial is like meta, except it does not add edges from the center to each seed vertex. The index 1 form is identical to Conway's ortho and expand operators: expand is also called cantellation and expansion. Note that \"o\" and \"e\" have their own indexed forms, described below. Also note that some implementations start indexing at 0 instead of 1.\nThe Goldberg-Coxeter (GC) Conway operators are two infinite families of operators that are an extension of the Goldberg-Coxeter construction. The GC construction can be thought of as taking a triangular section of a triangular lattice, or a square section of a square lattice, and laying that over each face of the polyhedron. This construction can be extended to any face by identifying the chambers of the triangle or square (the \"master polygon\"). Operators in the triangular family can be used to produce the Goldberg polyhedra and geodesic polyhedra: see List of geodesic polyhedra and Goldberg polyhedra for formulas.\n\nThe two families are the triangular GC family, \"c\" and \"u\", and the quadrilateral GC family, \"e\" and \"o\". Both the GC families are indexed by two integers formula_8 and formula_9. They possess many nice qualities:\n\nThe operators are divided into three classes (examples are written in terms of \"c\" but apply to all 4 operators):\n\nOf the original Conway operations, the only ones that do not fall into the GC family are \"g\" and \"s\" (gyro and snub). Meta and bevel (\"m\" and \"b\") can be expressed in terms of one operator from the triangular family and one from the quadrilateral family.\n\nBy basic number theory, for any values of \"a\" and \"b\", formula_10.\n\nSee also List of geodesic polyhedra and Goldberg polyhedra.\n\nConway's original set of operators can create all of the Archimedean solids and Catalan solids, using the Platonic solids as seeds. (Note that the \"r\" operator is not necessary to create both chiral forms.)\n\nThe truncated icosahedron, \"tI = zD\", can be used as a seed to create some more visually-pleasing polyhedra, although these are neither vertex nor face-transitive.\n\nEach of the convex uniform tilings can be created by applying Conway operators to the regular tilings Q, H, and Δ.\n\nConway operators can also be applied to toroidal polyhedra and polyhedra with multiple holes.\n\n\n"}

This is an example of an inverse problem. In almost all cases, there is insufficient information in the input signal to uniquely determine a plausible original image, making it an ill-posed problem.

It was sub-divided into other units – some for medical prescriptions – the \"hin\" (1/10), \"dja\" (1/64) and \"ro\" (1/320). The \"dja\" was recently evaluated by Tanja Pommerening in 2002 to 1/64 of a hekat (75 cc) in the MK, and 1/64 of an oipe (1/16 of a hekat, or 300 cc) in the NK, meaning that the \"dja\" was denoted by Horus-Eye imagery. It has been suggested by Pommerening that the NK change came about related to the oipe replacing the hekat as the Pharaonic volume control unit in official lists.\n\nHana Vymazalova evaluated the hekat unit in 2002 within the Akhmim Wooden Tablet by showing that five answers were returned to (64/64) when multiplied by the divisors 3, 7, 10, 11 and 13. The RMP also divided a hekat unity (64/64) by prime and composite numbers \"n\" when 1/64 < \"n\" < 64. The binary quotient used Eye of Horus numbers. The remainder scaled Egyptian fractions to 1/320 units named ro. Quotients and unscaled remainders were obtained for the dja, ro and other units when the divisor \"n\" was greater than 64. For example, one the 1/320 ro unit was written by Ahmes by solving 320/n ro. Gillings cites 29 examples of two-part statements converted to one-part statements in RMP 82. Ahmes recorded the \"n\" = 3 case by showing (64/64)/3 = 21/64 + 1/192 (a modern statement) as written as(16 + 4 + 1)/64 + 5/3 × 1/320 = 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1 2/3ro (two-part ancient statement). Two-part statements were also converted by Ahmes to an unscaled hin unit by writing 3 1/3 hin.\n\nThe hekat measurement unit, and its double entry accounting system, was found beyond the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus. Another text was the Ebers Papyrus, the best known medical text. The hekat unit was defined, in terms of its volume size, in the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus by MMP #10, by approximating \"π\" to around 3.16. The approximation of \"π\" was achieved by squaring a circle, increasingly (i.e. for the denominator in terms of setats: 9, 18, 36, 72, and 81, Gillings, page 141) until the vulgar fraction 256/81 was reached, the only relationship that was used in the Egyptian Middle Kingdom. The MMP scribe found the surface area of a basket equal to: (8d/9) = 64d/81, within a cylinder relationship to the hekat. MMP 10 data meant that \"d\" = 2 defined \"π\" for use in hekat volumes as 256/81. The 256/81 approximation was also used by Ahmes and other scribes. The ancient Egyptian weights and measures discussion further shows that the hekat was 1/30 of a royal cubit, an analysis that needs to double checked, against the \"d\" = 2 suggestion, which means that \"r\" = 1, a suggestion that does make sense. One royal cubit of the Ancient Egyptian weights and measures = 523.5 millimeters. ((523.5 mm)) / 30 = 4.78221176 liters.\n\n"}

Roughly speaking, a definition is impredicative if it invokes (mentions or quantifies over) the set being defined, or (more commonly) another set that contains the thing being defined. There is no generally accepted precise definition of what it means to be predicative or impredicative. Authors have given different but related definitions.\n\nThe opposite of impredicativity is predicativity, which essentially entails building stratified (or ramified) theories where quantification over lower levels results in variables of some new type, distinguished from the lower types that the variable ranges over. A prototypical example is intuitionistic type theory, which retains ramification so as to discard impredicativity.\n\nRussell's paradox is a famous example of an impredicative construction—namely the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. The paradox is that such a set cannot exist: If it would exist, the question could be asked whether it contains itself or not — if it does then by definition it should not, and if it does not then by definition it should.\n\nThe greatest lower bound of a set , , also has an impredicative definition: if and only if for all elements of , is less than or equal to , and any less than or equal to all elements of is less than or equal to . This definition quantifies over the set (potentially infinite, depending on the order in question) whose members are the lower bounds of , one of which being the glb itself. Hence predicativism would reject this definition.\n\nThe terms \"predicative\" and \"impredicative\" were introduced by , though the meaning has changed a little since then. \n\nSolomon Feferman provides a historical review of predicativity, connecting it to current outstanding research problems.\n\nThe vicious circle principle was suggested by Henri Poincaré (1905-6, 1908) and Bertrand Russell in the wake of the paradoxes as a requirement on legitimate set specifications. Sets that do not meet the requirement are called \"impredicative\".\n\nThe first modern paradox appeared with Cesare Burali-Forti's 1897 \"A question on transfinite numbers\" and would become known as the Burali-Forti paradox. Cantor had apparently discovered the same paradox in his (Cantor's) \"naive\" set theory and this become known as Cantor's paradox. Russell's awareness of the problem originated in June 1901 with his reading of Frege's treatise of mathematical logic, his 1879 \"Begriffsschrift\"; the offending sentence in Frege is the following:\nIn other words, given the function is the variable and is the invariant part. So why not substitute the value for itself? Russell promptly wrote Frege a letter pointing out that:\nFrege promptly wrote back to Russell acknowledging the problem:\nWhile the problem had adverse personal consequences for both men (both had works at the printers that had to be emended), van Heijenoort observes that \"The paradox shook the logicians' world, and the rumbles are still felt today. ... Russell's paradox, which uses the bare notions of set and element, falls squarely in the field of logic. The paradox was first published by Russell in \"The principles of mathematics\" (1903) and is discussed there in great detail ...\". Russell, after six years of false starts, would eventually answer the matter with his 1908 theory of types by \"propounding his \"axiom of reducibility\". It says that any function is coextensive with what he calls a \"predicative\" function: a function in which the types of apparent variables run no higher than the types of the arguments\". But this \"axiom\" was met with resistance from all quarters.\n\nThe rejection of impredicatively defined mathematical objects (while accepting the natural numbers as classically understood) leads to the position in the philosophy of mathematics known as predicativism, advocated by Henri Poincaré and Hermann Weyl in his \"Das Kontinuum\". Poincaré and Weyl argued that impredicative definitions are problematic only when one or more underlying sets are infinite.\n\nErnst Zermelo in his 1908 \"A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering\" presents an entire section \"b. \"Objection concerning nonpredicative definition\"\" where he argued against \"Poincaré (1906, p. 307) [who states that] a definition is 'predicative' and logically admissible only if it \"excludes\" all objects that are dependent upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it\". He gives two examples of impredicative definitions – (i) the notion of Dedekind chains and (ii) \"in analysis wherever the maximum or minimum of a previously defined \"completed\" set of numbers is used for further inferences. This happens, for example, in the well-known Cauchy proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, and up to now it has not occurred to anyone to regard this as something illogical\". He ends his section with the following observation: \"A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed, in every definition \"definiens\" and \"definiendum\" are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible\".\n\nZermelo's example of minimum and maximum of a previously defined \"completed\" set of numbers reappears in Kleene 1952:42-42 where Kleene uses the example of Least upper bound in his discussion of impredicative definitions; Kleene does not resolve this problem. In the next paragraphs he discusses Weyl's attempt in his 1918 \"Das Kontinuum\" (\"The Continuum\") to eliminate impredicative definitions and his failure to retain the \"theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (cf. also Weyl 1919)\".\n\nRamsey argued that \"impredicative\" definitions can be harmless: for instance, the definition of \"tallest person in the room\" is impredicative, since it depends on a set of things of which it is an element, namely the set of all persons in the room. Concerning mathematics, an example of an impredicative definition is the smallest number in a set, which is formally defined as: if and only if for all elements of , is less than or equal to , and is in .\n\nBurgess (2005) discusses predicative and impredicative theories at some length, in the context of Frege's logic, Peano arithmetic, second order arithmetic, and axiomatic set theory.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1126638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1126638", "title": "Invariant (mathematics)", "text": "Invariant (mathematics)\n\nIn mathematics, an invariant is a property, held by a class of mathematical objects, which remains unchanged when transformations of a certain type are applied to the objects. The particular class of objects and type of transformations are usually indicated by the context in which the term is used. For example, the area of a triangle is an invariant with respect to isometries of the Euclidean plane. The phrases \"invariant under\" and \"invariant to\" a transformation are both used. More generally, an invariant with respect to an equivalence relation is a property that is constant on each equivalence class. \n\nInvariants are used in diverse areas of mathematics such as geometry, topology, algebra and discrete mathematics. Some important classes of transformations are defined by an invariant they leave unchanged, for example conformal maps are defined as transformations of the plane that preserve angles. The discovery of invariants is an important step in the process of classifying mathematical objects.\n\nA simple example of invariance is expressed in our ability to count. For a finite set of objects of any kind, there is a number to which we always arrive, regardless of the order in which we count the objects in the set. The quantity—a cardinal number—is associated with the set, and is invariant under the process of counting.\n\nAn identity is an equation that remains true for all values of its variables. There are also inequalities that remain true when the values of their variables change.\n\nThe distance between two points on a number line is not changed by adding the same quantity to both numbers. On the other hand, multiplication does not have this same property as addition, so distance is not invariant under multiplication.\n\nAngles and ratios of distances are invariant under scalings, rotations, translations and reflections. These transformations produce similar shapes, which is the basis of trigonometry. In contrast, angles and ratios are not invariant under non-uniform scaling (such as stretching). The sum of a triangle's interior angles (180°) is invariant under all the above operations. As another example, all circles are similar: they can be transformed into each other and the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is invariant (denoted by the Greek letter pi).\n\nSome more complicated examples:\n\nThe MU puzzle is a good example of a logical problem where determining an invariant is of use for an impossibility proof. \nThe puzzle asks one to start with the word MI and transform it into the word MU using in each step one of the following transformation rules:\n\n\nAn example derivation (superscripts indicating the applied rules) is\n\nIs it possible to convert MI into MU using these four transformation rules only?\n\nOne could spend many hours applying these transformation rules to strings. However, it might be quicker to find a property that is invariant to all rules (i.e. that isn't changed by any of them), and demonstrates that getting to MU is impossible. Logically looking at the puzzle, the only way to get rid of any I's is to have three consecutive I's in the string. This makes the following invariant interesting to consider: \n\nThis is an invariant to the problem if for each of the transformation rules the following holds: if the invariant held before applying the rule, it will also hold after applying it. If we look at the net effect of applying the rules on the number of I's and U's we can see this actually is the case for all rules:\n\nThe table above shows clearly that the invariant holds for each of the possible transformation rules, which basically means that whichever rule we pick, at whatever state, if the number of I's was not a multiple of three before applying the rule, it won't be afterwards either.\n\nGiven that there is a single I in the starting string MI, and one is not a multiple of three, it's impossible to go from MI to MU as zero is a multiple of three.\n\nA subset \"S\" of the domain \"U\" of a mapping \"T\": \"U\" → \"U\" is an invariant set under the mapping when formula_2 Note that the elements of \"S\" are not fixed, but rather the set \"S\" is fixed in the power set of \"U\". (Some authors use the terminology \"setwise invariant\" vs. \"pointwise invariant\" to distinguish between these cases.)\nFor example, a circle is an invariant subset of the plane under a rotation about the circle’s center. Further, a conical surface is invariant as a set under a homothety of space.\n\nAn invariant set of an operation \"T\" is also said to be stable under \"T\". For example, the normal subgroups that are so important in group theory are those subgroups that are stable under the inner automorphisms of the ambient group.\nOther examples occur in linear algebra. Suppose a linear transformation \"T\" has an eigenvector v. Then the line through 0 and v is an invariant set under \"T\". The eigenvectors span an invariant subspace which is stable under \"T\".\n\nWhen \"T\" is a screw displacement, the screw axis is an invariant line, though if the pitch is non-zero, \"T\" has no fixed points.\n\nThe notion of invariance is formalized in three different ways in mathematics: via group actions, presentations, and deformation.\n\nFirstly, if one has a group \"G\" acting on a mathematical object (or set of objects) \"X,\" then one may ask which points \"x\" are unchanged, \"invariant\" under the group action, or under an element \"g\" of the group.\n\nVery frequently one will have a group acting on a set \"X\" and ask which objects in an \"associated\" set \"F\"(\"X\") are invariant. For example, rotation in the plane about a point leaves the point about which it rotates invariant, while translation in the plane does not leave any points invariant, but does leave all lines parallel to the direction of translation invariant as lines. Formally, define the set of lines in the plane \"P\" as \"L\"(\"P\"); then a rigid motion of the plane takes lines to lines – the group of rigid motions acts on the set of lines – and one may ask which lines are unchanged by an action.\n\nMore importantly, one may define a \"function\" on a set, such as \"radius of a circle in the plane\" and then ask if this function is invariant under a group action, such as rigid motions.\n\nDual to the notion of invariants are \"coinvariants,\" also known as \"orbits,\" which formalizes the notion of congruence: objects which can be taken to each other by a group action. For example, under the group of rigid motions of the plane, the perimeter of a triangle is an invariant, while the set of triangles congruent to a given triangle is a coinvariant.\n\nThese are connected as follows: invariants are constant on coinvariants (for example, congruent triangles have the same perimeter), while two objects which agree in the value of one invariant may or may not be congruent (two triangles with the same perimeter need not be congruent). In classification problems, one seeks to find a complete set of invariants, such that if two objects have the same values for this set of invariants, they are congruent.\n\nFor example, triangles such that all three sides are equal are congruent under rigid motions, via SSS congruence, and thus the lengths of all three sides form a complete set of invariants for triangles. The three angle measures of a triangle are also invariant under rigid motions, but do not form a complete set as incongruent triangles can share the same angle measures. However, if one allows scaling in addition to rigid motions, then the AAA similarity criterion shows that this is a complete set of invariants.\n\nSecondly, a function may be defined in terms of some presentation or decomposition of a mathematical object; for instance, the Euler characteristic of a cell complex is defined as the alternating sum of the number of cells in each dimension. One may forget the cell complex structure and look only at the underlying topological space (the manifold) – as different cell complexes give the same underlying manifold, one may ask if the function is \"independent\" of choice of \"presentation,\" in which case it is an \"intrinsically\" defined invariant. This is the case for the Euler characteristic, and a general method for defining and computing invariants is to define them for a given presentation and then show that they are independent of the choice of presentation. Note that there is no notion of a group action in this sense.\n\nThe most common examples are:\n\nThirdly, if one is studying an object which varies in a family, as is common in algebraic geometry and differential geometry, one may ask if the property is unchanged under perturbation – if an object is constant on families or invariant under change of metric, for instance.\n\nIn computer science, one can encounter invariants that can be relied upon to be true during the execution of a program, or during some portion of it. It is a logical assertion that is always held to be true during a certain phase of execution. For example, a loop invariant is a condition that is true at the beginning and end of every execution of a loop.\n\nInvariants are especially useful when reasoning about whether a computer program is correct. The theory of optimizing compilers, the methodology of design by contract, and formal methods for determining program correctness, all rely heavily on invariants.\n\nProgrammers often use assertions in their code to make invariants explicit. Some object oriented programming languages have a special syntax for specifying class invariants.\n\nAbstract interpretation tools can compute simple invariants of given imperative computer programs. The kind of properties that can be found depend on the abstract domains used. Typical example properties are single integer variable ranges like codice_1, relations between several variables like codice_2, and modulus information like codice_3. Academic research prototypes also consider simple properties of pointer structures.\n\nMore sophisticated invariants generally have to be provided manually.\nIn particular, when verifying an imperative program using the Hoare calculus, a loop invariant has to be provided manually for each loop in the program, which is one of the reasons this is generally impractical for most programs.\n\nIn the context of the above MU puzzle example, there is currently no general automated tool that can detect that a derivation, \"MI →...→ MU\", is impossible only from rules 1-4. However, once the abstraction from the string to the number of its \"I\"s has been made by hand, leading e.g. to the following C program, an abstract interpretation tool will be able to detect that codice_4 can't be 0 and hence the \"while\"-loop will never terminate.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39291986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39291986", "title": "Linear seismic inversion", "text": "Linear seismic inversion\n\nInverse modeling is a mathematical technique where the objective is to determine the physical properties of the subsurface of an earth region that has produced a given seismogram. Cooke and Schneider (1983) defined it as calculation of the earth’s structure and physical parameters from some set of observed seismic data. The underlying assumption in this method is that the collected seismic data are from an earth structure that matches the cross-section computed from the inversion algorithm. Some common earth properties that are inverted for include acoustic velocity, formation and fluid densities, acoustic impedance, Poisson's ratio, formation compressibility, shear rigidity, porosity, and fluid saturation.\n\nThe method has long been useful for geophysicists and can be categorized into two broad types: Deterministic and stochastic inversion. Deterministic inversion methods are based on comparison of the output from an earth model with the observed field data and continuously updating the earth model parameters to minimize a function, which is usually some form of difference between model output and field observation. As such, this method of inversion to which linear inversion falls under is posed as an minimization problem and the accepted earth model is the set of model parameters that minimizes the objective function in producing a numerical seismogram which best compares with collected field seismic data.\n\nOn the other hand, stochastic inversion methods are used to generate constrained models as used in reservoir flow simulation, using geostatistical tools like kriging. As opposed to deterministic inversion methods which produce a single set of model parameters, stochastic methods generate a suite of alternate earth model parameters which all obey the model constraint. However, the two methods are related as the results of deterministic models is the average of all the possible non-unique solutions of stochastic methods. Since seismic linear inversion is a deterministic inversion method, the stochastic method will not be discussed beyond this point.\n\nThe deterministic nature of linear inversion requires a functional relationship which models, in terms of the earth model parameters, the seismic variable to be inverted. This functional relationship is some mathematical model derived from the fundamental laws of physics and is more often called a forward model. The aim of the technique is to minimize a function which is dependent on the difference between the convolution of the forward model with a source wavelet and the field collected seismic trace. As in the field of optimization, this function to be minimized is called the objective function and in convectional inverse modeling, is simply the difference between the convolved forward model and the seismic trace. As earlier mentioned, different types of variables can be inverted for but for clarity, these variables will be referred to as the impedance series of the earth model. In the following subsections we will describe in more detail, in the context of linear inversion as a minimization problem, the different components that are necessary to invert seismic data.\n\nThe centerpiece of seismic linear inversion is the forward model which models the generation of the experimental data collected. According to Wiggins (1972), it provides a functional (computational) relationship between the model parameters and calculated values for the observed traces. Depending on the seismic data collected, this model may vary from the classical wave equations for predicting particle displacement or fluid pressure for sound wave propagation through rock or fluids, to some variants of these classical equations. For example, the forward model in Tarantola (1984) is the wave equation for pressure variation in a liquid media during seismic wave propagation while by assuming constant velocity layers with plane interfaces, Kanasewich and Chiu (1985) used the brachistotrone model of John Bernoulli for travel time of a ray along a path. In Cooke and Schneider (1983), the model is a synthetic trace generation algorithm expressed as in Eqn. 3, where R(t) is generated in the Z-domain by recursive formula. In whatever form the forward model appears, it is important that it not only predicts the collected field data, but also models how the data is generated. Thus, the forward model by Cooke and Schneider (1983) can only be used to invert CMP data since the model invariably assumes no spreading loss by mimicking the response of a laterally homogeneous earth to a plane-wave source\n\nwhere \"s\"(\"t\") = synthetic trace, \"w\"(\"t\") = source wavelet, and \"R\"(\"t\") = reflectivity function.\n\nAn important numerical process in inverse modeling is to minimize the objective function, which is a function defined in terms of the difference between the collected field seismic data and the numerically computed seismic data. Classical objective functions include the sum of squared deviations between experimental and numerical data, as in the least squares methods, the sum of the magnitude of the difference between field and numerical data, or some variant of these definitions. Irrespective of the definition used, numerical solution of the inverse problem is obtained as earth model that minimize the objective function.\n\nIn addition to the objective function, other constraints like known model parameters and known layer interfaces in some regions of the earth are also incorporated in the inverse modeling procedure. These constraints, according to Francis 2006, help to reduce non-uniqueness of the inversion solution by providing a priori information that is not contained in the inverted data while Cooke and Schneider (1983) reports their useful in controlling noise and when working in a geophysically well-known area.\n\nThe objective of mathematical analysis of inverse modeling is to cast the generalized linear inverse problem into a simple matrix algebra by considering all the components described in previous sections. viz; forward model, objective function etc. Generally, the numerically generated seismic data are non-linear functions of the earth model parameters. To remove the non-linearity and create a platform for application of linear algebra concepts, the forward model is linearized by expansion using a Taylor series as carried out below. For more details see Wiggins (1972), Cooke and Schneider (1983).\n\nConsider a set of formula_1 seismic field observations formula_2, for formula_3 and a set of formula_4 earth model parameters formula_5 to be inverted for, for formula_6. The field observations can be represented in either formula_7 or formula_8, where formula_9 and formula_7 are vectorial representations of model parameters and the field observations as a function of earth parameters. Similarly, for formula_11 representing guesses of model parameters, formula_12 is the vector of numerical computed seismic data using the forward model of Sec. 1.3. Taylor's series expansion of formula_7 about formula_14 is given below.\n\nformula_15 is called the difference vector in Cooke and Schneider (1983). It has a size of formula_16 and its components are the difference between the observed trace and the numerically computed seismic data. formula_17 is the corrector vector of size formula_18, while formula_19 is called the sensitivity matrix. It has a size of formula_20 and its comments are such that each column is the partial derivative of a component of the forward function with respect to one of the unknown earth model parameters. Similarly, each row is the partial derivative of a component of the numerically computed seismic trace with respect to all unknown model parameters.\n\nformula_12 is computed from the forward model, while formula_7 is the experimental data. Thus,formula_15 is a known quality. On the other hand, formula_17 is unknown and is obtained by solution of Eqn. 10. This equation is theoretically solvable only when formula_19 is invertible, that is, if it is a square matrix so that the number of observations formula_1 is equal to the number formula_4 of unknown earth parameters. If this is the case, the unknown corrector vector formula_17, is solved for as shown below, using any of the classical direct or iterative solvers for solution of a set of linear equations.\n\nIn most seismic inversion applications, there are more observations than the number of earth parameters to be inverted for, i.e. formula_29, leading to a system of equations that is mathematically over-determined. As a result, Eqn. 10 is not theoretically solvable and an exact solution is not obtainable. An estimate of the corrector vector is obtained using the least squares procedure to find the corrector vector formula_30 that minimizes formula_31, which is the sum of the squares of the error, formula_32.\n\nThe errorformula_32 is given by\n\nIn the least squares procedure, the corrector vector that minimizes formula_34 is obtained as below.\n\nThus,\n\nFrom the above discussions, the objective function is defined as either the formula_35 or formula_36 norm of formula_30 given by\nformula_38 or formula_39 or of formula_15 given by formula_41 or formula_42.\n\nThe generalized procedure for inverting any experimental seismic data for formula_43 or formula_44, using the mathematical theory for inverse modeling, as described above, is shown in Fig. 1 and described as follows.\n\nAn initial guess of the model impedance is provided to initiate the inversion process. The forward model uses this initial guess to compute a synthetic seismic data which is subtracted from the observed seismic data to calculate the difference vector.\n\n\nIrrespective of the variable to be inverted for, the earth’s impedance is a continuous function of depth (or time in seismic data) and for numerical linear inversion technique to be applicable for this continuous physical model, the continuous properties have to be discretized and/or sampled at discrete intervals along the depth of the earth model. Thus, the total depth over which model properties are to be determined is a necessary starting point for the discretization. Commonly, as shown in Fig. 3, this properties are sampled at close discrete intervals over this depth to ensure high resolution of impedance variation along the earth’s depth. The impedance values inverted from the algorithm represents the average value in the discrete interval.\n\nConsidering that inverse modeling problem is only theoretically solvable when the number of discrete intervals for sampling the properties is equal to the number of observation in the trace to be inverted, a high-resolution sampling will lead to a large matrix which will be very expensive to invert. Furthermore, the matrix may be singular for dependent equations, the inversion can be unstable in the presence of noise and the system may be under-constrained if parameters other than the primary variables inverted for, are desired. In relation to parameters desired, other than impedance, Cooke and Schneider (1983) gives them to include source wavelet and scale factor.\n\nFinally, by treating constraints as known impedance values in some layers or discrete intervals, the number of unknown impedance values to be solved for are reduced, leading to greater accuracy in the results of the inversion algorithm.\n\nWe start with an example to invert for earth parameter values from temperature depth distribution in a given earth region. Although this example does not directly relate to seismic inversion since no traveling acoustic waves are involved, it nonetheless introduces practical application of the inversion technique in a manner easy to comprehend, before moving on to seismic applications. In this example, the temperature of the earth is measured at discrete locations in a well bore by placing temperature sensors in the target depths. By assuming a forward model of linear distribution of temperature with depth, two parameters are inverted for from the temperature depth measurements.\n\nThe forward model is given by\nwhere formula_54. Thus, the dimension of formula_14 is 2 i.e. the number of parameters inverted for is 2.\n\nThe objective of this inversion algorithm is to find formula_9, which is the value of formula_57 that minimizes the difference between the observed temperature distribution and those obtained using the forward model of Eqn. 15. Considering the dimension of the forward model or the number of temperature observations to be formula_4, the components of the forward model is written as\n\nWe present results from Marescot (2010) for the case of formula_59 for which the observed temperature values at depths were formula_60 at formula_61 and formula_62 at formula_63. These experimental data were inverted to obtain earth parameter values of formula_64 and formula_65. For a more general case with large number of temperature observations, Fig. 4 shows the final linear forward model obtained from using the inverted values of formula_66 and formula_67. The figure shows a good match between experimental and numerical data.\n\nThis examples inverts for earth layer velocity from recorded seismic wave travel times. Fig. 5 shows the initial velocity guesses and the travel times recorded from the field, while Fig. 6a shows the inverted heterogeneous velocity model, which is the solution of the inversion algorithm obtained after 30 iterations. As seen in Fig. 6b, there is good comparison between the final travel times obtained from the forward model using the inverted velocity and the field record travel times. Using these solutions, the ray path was reconstructed and is shown to be highly tortuous through the earth model as shown in Fig. 7.\n\nThis example, taken from Cooke and Schneider (1983), shows inversion of a CMP seismic trace for earth model impedance (product of density and velocity) profile. The seismic trace inverted is shown in Fig. 8 while Fig. 9a shows the inverted impedance profile with the input initial impedance used for the inversion algorithm. Also recorded alongside the seismic trace is an impedance log of the earth region as shown in Fig. 9b. The figures show good comparison between the recorded impedance log and the numerical inverted impedance from the seismic trace.\n\n"}

The first major step in macroscopic modeling of traffic was taken by Lighthill and Whitham in 1955, when they indexed the comparability of ‘traffic flow on long crowded roads’ with ‘flood movements in long rivers’. A year later, Richards (1956) complemented the idea with the introduction of ‘shock-waves on the highway’, completing the so-called LWR model. \nMacroscopic modeling may be primarily classified according to the type of traffic as homogeneous and heterogeneous, and further with respect to the order of the mathematical model.\n\n"}

The same result was also discovered by Jacques Justin and, even earlier, by S. Murata.\n\nOne consequence of Maekawa's theorem is that the total number of folds at each vertex must be an even number. This implies (via a form of planar graph duality between Eulerian graphs and bipartite graphs) that, for any flat-foldable crease pattern, it is always possible to color the regions between the creases with two colors, such that each crease separates regions of differing colors. The same result can also be seen by considering which side of the sheet of paper is uppermost in each region of the folded shape.\n\nMaekawa's theorem does not completely characterize the flat-foldable vertices, because it only takes into account the numbers of folds of each type, and not their angles.\nKawasaki's theorem gives a complementary condition on the angles between the folds at a vertex (regardless of which folds are mountain folds and which are valley folds) that is also necessary for a vertex to be flat-foldable.\n"}

Mathematical fiction may have existed since ancient times, but it was recently rediscovered as a genre of literature; since then there has been a growing body of literature in this genre, and the genre has attracted a growing body of readers.

{"id": "22468661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22468661", "title": "Mathematics and art", "text": "Mathematics and art\n\nMathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\n\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his \"Canon\", prescribing proportions based on the ratio 1: for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise \"De Divina Proportione\" (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as \"De Prospectiva Pingendi\", and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work \"Melencolia I\". In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.\n\nMathematics has directly influenced art with conceptual tools such as linear perspective, the analysis of symmetry, and mathematical objects such as polyhedra and the Möbius strip. Magnus Wenninger creates colourful stellated polyhedra, originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as recursion and logical paradox can be seen in paintings by Rene Magritte and in engravings by M. C. Escher. Computer art often makes use of fractals including the Mandelbrot set, and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as cellular automata. Controversially, the artist David Hockney has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the camera lucida to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that Vermeer used the camera obscura in his distinctively observed paintings.\n\nOther relationships include the algorithmic analysis of artworks by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, the finding that traditional batiks from different regions of Java have distinct fractal dimensions, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially Filippo Brunelleschi's theory of perspective, which eventually led to Girard Desargues's projective geometry. A persistent view, based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's geometry is sacred, as seen in artworks such as William Blake's \"The Ancient of Days\".\n\nPolykleitos the elder (c.450–420 BC) was a Greek sculptor from the school of Argos, and a contemporary of Phidias. His works and statues consisted mainly of bronze and were of athletes. According to the philosopher and mathematician Xenocrates, Polykleitos is ranked as one of the most important sculptors of Classical antiquity for his work on the \"Doryphorus\" and the statue of Hera in the Heraion of Argos. While his sculptures may not be as famous as those of Phidias, they are much admired. In the \"Canon\" of Polykleitos, a treatise he wrote designed to document the \"perfect\" anatomical proportions of the male nude, Polykleitos gives us a mathematical approach towards sculpturing the human body.\n\nPolykleitos uses the distal phalanx of the little finger as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body. Polykleitos multiplies the length of the distal phalanx by the square root of two () to get the distance of the second phalanges and multiplies the length again by to get the length of the third phalanges. Next, he takes the finger length and multiplies that by to get the length of the palm from the base of the finger to the ulna. This geometric series of measurements progresses until Polykleitos has formed the arm, chest, body, and so on.\n\nThe influence of the \"Canon\" of Polykleitos is immense in Classical Greek, Roman, and Renaissance sculpture, many sculptors following Polykleitos's prescription. While none of Polykleitos's original works survive, Roman copies demonstrate his ideal of physical perfection and mathematical precision. Some scholars argue that Pythagorean thought influenced the \"Canon\" of Polykleitos. The \"Canon\" applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and \"symmetria\" (Greek for \"harmonious proportions\") and turns it into a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous geometric progressions.\n\nIn classical times, rather than making distant figures smaller with linear perspective, painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used reverse perspective for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his \"Book of Optics\" in 1021, but never applied it to art. The Renaissance saw a rebirth of Classical Greek and Roman culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand nature and the arts. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed to figure out how to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.\n\nThe rudiments of perspective arrived with Giotto (1266/7 – 1337), who attempted to draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi and his friend Leon Battista Alberti demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using similar triangles as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects. Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but Masaccio's painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.\nThe Italian painter Paolo Uccello (1397–1475) was fascinated by perspective, as shown in his paintings of \"The Battle of San Romano\" (c. 1435–1460): broken lances lie conveniently along perspective lines.\n\nThe painter Piero della Francesca (c.1415–1492) exemplified this new shift in Italian Renaissance thinking. He was an expert mathematician and geometer, writing books on solid geometry and perspective, including \"De Prospectiva Pingendi (On Perspective for Painting)\", \"Trattato d'Abaco (Abacus Treatise)\", and \"De corporibus regularibus (On Regular Solids)\". The historian Vasari in his \"Lives of the Painters\" calls Piero the \"greatest geometer of his time, or perhaps of any time.\" Piero's interest in perspective can be seen in his paintings including the Polyptych of Perugia, the \"San Agostino altarpiece\" and \"The Flagellation of Christ\". His work on geometry influenced later mathematicians and artists including Luca Pacioli in his \"De Divina Proportione\" and Leonardo da Vinci. Piero studied classical mathematics and the works of Archimedes. He was taught commercial arithmetic in \"abacus schools\"; his writings are formatted like abacus school textbooks, perhaps including Leonardo Pisano (Fibonacci)'s 1202 \"Liber Abaci\". Linear perspective was just being introduced into the artistic world. Alberti explained in his 1435 \"De pictura\": \"light rays travel in straight lines from points in the observed scene to the eye, forming a kind of pyramid with the eye as vertex.\" A painting constructed with linear perspective is a cross-section of that pyramid.\n\nIn \"De Prospectiva Pingendi\", Piero transforms his empirical observations of the way aspects of a figure change with point of view into mathematical proofs. His treatise starts in the vein of Euclid: he defines the point as \"the tiniest thing that is possible for the eye to comprehend\". He uses deductive logic to lead the reader to the perspective representation of a three-dimensional body.\n\nThe artist David Hockney argued in his book \"\" that artists started using a camera lucida from the 1420s, resulting in a sudden change in precision and realism, and that this practice was continued by major artists including Ingres, Van Eyck, and Caravaggio. Critics disagree on whether Hockney was correct. Similarly, the architect Philip Steadman argued controversially that Vermeer had used a different device, the camera obscura, to help him create his distinctively observed paintings.\n\nIn 1509, Luca Pacioli (c. 1447–1517) published \"De divina proportione\" on mathematical and artistic proportion, including in the human face. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) illustrated the text with woodcuts of regular solids while he studied under Pacioli in the 1490s. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids. These, such as the rhombicuboctahedron, were among the first to be drawn to demonstrate perspective by being overlaid on top of each other. The work discusses perspective in the works of Piero della Francesca, Melozzo da Forlì, and Marco Palmezzano. Da Vinci studied Pacioli's \"Summa\", from which he copied tables of proportions. In \"Mona Lisa\" and \"The Last Supper\", Da Vinci's work incorporated linear perspective with a vanishing point to provide apparent depth. \"The Last Supper\" is constructed in a tight ratio of 12:6:4:3, as is Raphael's \"The School of Athens\", which includes Pythagoras with a tablet of ideal ratios, sacred to the Pythagoreans. In \"Vitruvian Man\", Leonardo expressed the ideas of the Roman architect Vitruvius, innovatively showing the male figure twice, and centring him in both a circle and a square.\n\nAs early as the 15th century, curvilinear perspective found its way into paintings by artists interested in image distortions. Jan van Eyck's 1434 \"Arnolfini Portrait\" contains a convex mirror with reflections of the people in the scene, while Parmigianino's \"Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror\", c. 1523–1524, shows the artist's largely undistorted face at the centre, with a strongly curved background and artist's hand around the edge.\n\nThree-dimensional space can be represented convincingly in art, as in technical drawing, by means other than perspective. Oblique projections, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from the first or second centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the Ukiyo-e paintings of Torii Kiyonaga (1752–1815).\n\nThe golden ratio (roughly equal to 1.618) was known to Euclid. The golden ratio has persistently been claimed in modern times to have been used in art and architecture by the ancients in Egypt, Greece and elsewhere, without reliable evidence. The claim may derive from confusion with \"golden mean\", which to the Ancient Greeks meant \"avoidance of excess in either direction\", not a ratio. Pyramidologists since the nineteenth century have argued on dubious mathematical grounds for the golden ratio in pyramid design. The Parthenon, a 5th-century BC temple in Athens, has been claimed to use the golden ratio in its façade and floor plan, but these claims too are disproved by measurement. The Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia has similarly been claimed to use the golden ratio in its design, but the ratio does not appear in the original parts of the mosque. The historian of architecture Frederik Macody Lund argued in 1919 that the Cathedral of Chartres (12th century), Notre-Dame of Laon (1157–1205) and Notre Dame de Paris (1160) are designed according to the golden ratio, drawing regulator lines to make his case. Other scholars argue that until Pacioli's work in 1509, the golden ratio was unknown to artists and architects. For example, the height and width of the front of Notre-Dame of Laon have the ratio 8/5 or 1.6, not 1.618. Such Fibonacci ratios quickly become hard to distinguish from the golden ratio. After Pacioli, the golden ratio is more definitely discernible in artworks including Leonardo's \"Mona Lisa\".\n\nAnother ratio, the only other morphic number, was named the plastic number in 1928 by the Dutch architect Hans van der Laan (originally named \"le nombre radiant\" in French). Its value is the solution of the cubic equation\n\nan irrational number which is approximately 1.325. According to the architect Richard Padovan, this has characteristic ratios and , which govern the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan used these ratios when designing the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church in the Netherlands.\n\nPlanar symmetries have for millennia been exploited in artworks such as carpets, lattices, textiles and tilings.\n\nMany traditional rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave kilims, are divided into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver. In kilims from Anatolia, the motifs used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a wallpaper group such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of frieze group pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.\nThe mathematician and architectural theorist Nikos Salingaros suggests that the \"powerful presence\" (aesthetic effect) of a \"great carpet\" such as the best Konya two-medallion carpets of the 17th century is created by mathematical techniques related to the theories of the architect Christopher Alexander. These techniques include making opposites couple; opposing colour values; differentiating areas geometrically, whether by using complementary shapes or balancing the directionality of sharp angles; providing small-scale complexity (from the knot level upwards) and both small- and large-scale symmetry; repeating elements at a hierarchy of different scales (with a ratio of about 2.7 from each level to the next). Salingaros argues that \"all successful carpets satisfy at least nine of the above ten rules\", and suggests that it might be possible to create a metric from these rules.\n\nElaborate lattices are found in Indian Jali work, carved in marble to adorn tombs and palaces. Chinese lattices, always with some symmetry, exist in 14 of the 17 wallpaper groups; they often have mirror, double mirror, or rotational symmetry. Some have a central medallion, and some have a border in a frieze group. Many Chinese lattices have been analysed mathematically by Daniel S. Dye; he identifies Sichuan as the centre of the craft.\n\nSymmetries are prominent in textile arts including quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery and weaving, where they may be purely decorative or may be marks of status. Rotational symmetry is found in circular structures such as domes; these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns inside and out, as at the 1619 Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan. Items of embroidery and lace work such as tablecloths and table mats, made using bobbins or by tatting, can have a wide variety of reflectional and rotational symmetries which are being explored mathematically.\n\nIslamic art exploits symmetries in many of its artforms, notably in girih tilings. These are formed using a set of five tile shapes, namely a regular decagon, an elongated hexagon, a bow tie, a rhombus, and a regular pentagon. All the sides of these tiles have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 radians), offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries. The tiles are decorated with strapwork lines (girih), generally more visible than the tile boundaries. In 2007, the physicists Peter Lu and Paul Steinhardt argued that girih resembled quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Elaborate geometric zellige tilework is a distinctive element in Moroccan architecture. Muqarnas vaults are three-dimensional but were designed in two dimensions with drawings of geometrical cells.\n\nThe Platonic solids and other polyhedra are a recurring theme in Western art. They are found, for instance, in a marble mosaic featuring the small stellated dodecahedron, attributed to Paolo Uccello, in the floor of the San Marco Basilica in Venice; in Leonardo da Vinci's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for Luca Pacioli's 1509 book \"The Divine Proportion\"; as a glass rhombicuboctahedron in Jacopo de Barbari's portrait of Pacioli, painted in 1495; in the truncated polyhedron (and various other mathematical objects) in Albrecht Dürer's engraving Melencolia I; and in Salvador Dalí's painting \"The Last Supper\" in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant dodecahedron.\n\nAlbrecht Dürer (1471–1528) was a German Renaissance printmaker who made important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, \"Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement)\", meant to teach the subjects of linear perspective, geometry in architecture, Platonic solids, and regular polygons. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of Luca Pacioli and Piero della Francesca during his trips to Italy. While the examples of perspective in \"Underweysung der Messung\" are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of polyhedral nets, polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing. Dürer published another influential book on human proportions called \"Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion)\" in 1528.\n\nDürer's well-known engraving \"Melencolia I\" depicts a frustrated thinker sitting by a truncated triangular trapezohedron and a magic square. These two objects, and the engraving as a whole, have been the subject of more modern interpretation than the contents of almost any other print, including a two-volume book by Peter-Klaus Schuster, and an influential discussion in Erwin Panofsky's monograph of Dürer.\nSalvador Dalí's \"Corpus Hypercubus\" depicts an unfolded three-dimensional net for a hypercube, a four-dimensional regular polyhedron.\n\nTraditional Indonesian wax-resist batik designs on cloth combine representational motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the wax resist, and random variation introduced by cracking of the wax. Batik designs have a fractal dimension between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of Cirebon has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of Yogyakarta and Surakarta (Solo) in Central Java have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of Lasem on the north coast of Java and of Tasikmalaya in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.\n\nThe drip painting works of the modern artist Jackson Pollock are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 \"Number 14\" has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, \"Blue Poles\", took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.\n\nThe astronomer Galileo Galilei in his \"Il Saggiatore\" wrote that \"[The universe] is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures.\" Artists who strive and seek to study nature must first, in Galileo's view, fully understand mathematics. Mathematicians, conversely, have sought to interpret and analyse art through the lens of geometry and rationality. The mathematician Felipe Cucker suggests that mathematics, and especially geometry, is a source of rules for \"rule-driven artistic creation\", though not the only one. Some of the many strands of the resulting complex relationship are described below.\n\nThe mathematician Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art, stating that \"the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality\", and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research. King cites the mathematician G. H. Hardy's 1940 essay \"A Mathematician's Apology\". In it, Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of classical times as first rate, namely Euclid's proof there are infinitely many prime numbers, and the proof that the square root of 2 is irrational. King evaluates this last against Hardy's criteria for mathematical elegance: \"\"seriousness, depth, generality, unexpectedness, inevitability\", and \"economy\"\" (King's italics), and describes the proof as \"aesthetically pleasing\". The Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation: \"Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I \"know\" numbers are beautiful.\"\n\nMathematics can be discerned in many of the arts, such as music, dance, painting, architecture, and sculpture. Each of these is richly associated with mathematics. Among the connections to the visual arts, mathematics can provide tools for artists, such as the rules of linear perspective as described by Brook Taylor and Johann Lambert, or the methods of descriptive geometry, now applied in software modelling of solids, dating back to Albrecht Dürer and Gaspard Monge. Artists from Luca Pacioli in the Middle Ages and Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer in the Renaissance have made use of and developed mathematical ideas in the pursuit of their artistic work. The use of perspective began, despite some embryonic usages in the architecture of Ancient Greece, with Italian painters such as Giotto in the 13th century; rules such as the vanishing point were first formulated by Brunelleschi in about 1413, his theory influencing Leonardo and Dürer. Isaac Newton's work on the optical spectrum influenced Goethe's \"Theory of Colours\" and in turn artists such as Philipp Otto Runge, J. M. W. Turner, the Pre-Raphaelites and Wassily Kandinsky. Artists may also choose to analyse the symmetry of a scene. Tools may be applied by mathematicians who are exploring art, or artists inspired by mathematics, such as M. C. Escher (inspired by H. S. M. Coxeter) and the architect Frank Gehry, who more tenuously argued that computer aided design enabled him to express himself in a wholly new way.\n\nThe artist Richard Wright argues that mathematical objects that can be constructed can be seen either \"as processes to simulate phenomena\" or as works of \"computer art\". He considers the nature of mathematical thought, observing that fractals were known to mathematicians for a century before they were recognised as such. Wright concludes by stating that it is appropriate to subject mathematical objects to any methods used to \"come to terms with cultural artifacts like art, the tension between objectivity and subjectivity, their metaphorical meanings and the character of representational systems.\" He gives as instances an image from the Mandelbrot set, an image generated by a cellular automaton algorithm, and a computer-rendered image, and discusses, with reference to the Turing test, whether algorithmic products can be art. Sasho Kalajdzievski's \"Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics\" takes a similar approach, looking at suitably visual mathematics topics such as tilings, fractals and hyperbolic geometry.\n\nSome of the first works of computer art were created by Desmond Paul Henry's \"Drawing Machine 1\", an analogue machine based on a bombsight computer and exhibited in 1962. The machine was capable of creating complex, abstract, asymmetrical, curvilinear, but repetitive line drawings. More recently, Hamid Naderi Yeganeh has created shapes suggestive of real world objects such as fish and birds, using formulae that are successively varied to draw families of curves or angled lines. Artists such as Mikael Hvidtfeldt Christensen create works of generative or algorithmic art by writing scripts for a software system such as \"Structure Synth\": the artist effectively directs the system to apply a desired combination of mathematical operations to a chosen set of data.\n\nThe mathematician and theoretical physicist Henri Poincaré's \"Science and Hypothesis\" was widely read by the Cubists, including Pablo Picasso and Jean Metzinger. Poincaré viewed Euclidean geometry as just one of many possible geometric configurations, rather than as an absolute objective truth. The possible existence of a fourth dimension inspired artists to question classical : non-Euclidean geometry became a valid alternative. The concept that painting could be expressed mathematically, in colour and form, contributed to Cubism, the art movement that led to abstract art. Metzinger, in 1910, wrote that: \"[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice Princet has deduced a whole geometry\". Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs:\n\nMaurice Princet joined us often ... it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked \"n\"-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the new views on space that had been opened up by Schlegel and some others. He succeeded at that.\n\nThe impulse to make teaching or research models of mathematical forms naturally creates objects that have symmetries and surprising or pleasing shapes. Some of these have inspired artists such as the Dadaists Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp and Max Ernst, and following Man Ray, Hiroshi Sugimoto.\nMan Ray photographed some of the mathematical models in the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, including \"Objet mathematique\" (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented Enneper surfaces with constant negative curvature, derived from the pseudo-sphere. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was \"abstract\", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [Enneper surface] formula \"meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature.\" He used his photographs of the mathematical models as figures in his series he did on Shakespeare's plays, such as his 1934 painting \"Antony and Cleopatra\". The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in \"ForbesLife\", argues that Man Ray photographed \"the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of Kiki de Montparnasse\", and \"ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire\". Twentieth century sculptors such as Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo took inspiration from mathematical models. Moore wrote of his 1938 \"Stringed Mother and Child\": \"Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the Science Museum ... I was fascinated by the mathematical models I saw there ... It wasn't the scientific study of these models but the ability to look through the strings as with a bird cage and to see one form within another which excited me.\"\n\nThe artists Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian founded the De Stijl movement, which they wanted to \"establish a visual vocabulary elementary geometrical forms comprehensible by all and adaptable to any discipline\". Many of their artworks visibly consist of ruled squares and triangles, sometimes also with circles. De Stijl artists worked in painting, furniture, interior design and architecture. After the breakup of De Stijl, Van Doesburg founded the Avant-garde Art Concret movement, describing his 1929–1930 \"Arithmetic Composition\", a series of four black squares on the diagonal of a squared background, as \"a structure that can be controlled, a \"definite\" surface without chance elements or individual caprice\", yet \"not lacking in spirit, not lacking the universal and not ... empty as there is \"everything\" which fits the internal rhythm\". The art critic Gladys Fabre observes that two progressions are at work in the painting, namely the growing black squares and the alternating backgrounds.\n\nThe mathematics of tessellation, polyhedra, shaping of space, and self-reference provided the graphic artist M. C. Escher (1898—1972) with a lifetime's worth of materials for his woodcuts. In the \"Alhambra Sketch\", Escher showed that art can be created with polygons or regular shapes such as triangles, squares, and hexagons. Escher used irregular polygons when tiling the plane and often used reflections, glide reflections, and translations to obtain further patterns. Many of his works contain impossible constructions, made using geometrical objects which set up a contradiction between perspective projection and three dimensions, but are pleasant to the human sight. Escher's \"Ascending and Descending\" is based on the \"impossible staircase\" created by the medical scientist Lionel Penrose and his son the mathematician Roger Penrose.\n\nSome of Escher's many tessellation drawings were inspired by conversations with the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter on hyperbolic geometry. Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The Platonic solids—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in \"Order and Chaos\" and \"Four Regular Solids\". These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.\n\nThe visual intricacy of mathematical structures such as tessellations and polyhedra have inspired a variety of mathematical artworks. Stewart Coffin makes polyhedral puzzles in rare and beautiful woods; George W. Hart works on the theory of polyhedra and sculpts objects inspired by them; Magnus Wenninger makes \"especially beautiful\" models of complex stellated polyhedra.\n\nThe distorted perspectives of anamorphosis have been explored in art since the sixteenth century, when Hans Holbein the Younger incorporated a severely distorted skull in his 1533 painting \"The Ambassadors\". Many artists since then, including Escher, have make use of anamorphic tricks.\n\nThe mathematics of topology has inspired several artists in modern times. The sculptor John Robinson (1935–2007) created works such as \"Gordian Knot\" and \"Bands of Friendship\", displaying knot theory in polished bronze. Other works by Robinson explore the topology of toruses. \"Genesis\" is based on Borromean rings – a set of three circles, no two of which link but in which the whole structure cannot be taken apart without breaking. The sculptor Helaman Ferguson creates complex surfaces and other topological objects. His works are visual representations of mathematical objects; \"The Eightfold Way\" is based on the projective special linear group PSL(2,7), a finite group of 168 elements. The sculptor Bathsheba Grossman similarly bases her work on mathematical structures.\n\nA liberal arts inquiry project examines connections between mathematics and art through the Möbius strip, flexagons, origami and panorama photography.\n\nMathematical objects including the Lorenz manifold and the hyperbolic plane have been crafted using fiber arts including crochet. The American weaver Ada Dietz wrote a 1949 monograph \"Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles\", defining weaving patterns based on the expansion of multivariate polynomials. The mathematician J. C. P. Miller used the Rule 90 cellular automaton to design tapestries depicting both trees and abstract patterns of triangles. The \"mathekniticians\" Pat Ashforth and Steve Plummer use knitted versions of mathematical objects such as hexaflexagons in their teaching, though their Menger sponge proved too troublesome to knit and was made of plastic canvas instead. Their \"mathghans\" (Afghans for Schools) project introduced knitting into the British mathematics and technology curriculum.\n\nModelling is far from the only possible way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's \"Stefaneschi Triptych\", 1320, illustrates recursion in the form of \"mise en abyme\"; the central panel of the triptych contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering. Giorgio Chirico's metaphysical paintings such as his 1917 \"Great Metaphysical Interior\" explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.\n\nArt can exemplify logical paradoxes, as in some paintings by the surrealist René Magritte, which can be read as semiotic jokes about confusion between levels. In \"La condition humaine\" (1933), Magritte depicts an easel (on the real canvas), seamlessly supporting a view through a window which is framed by \"real\" curtains in the painting. Similarly, Escher's \"Print Gallery\" (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which recursively contains the picture, and so \"ad infinitum\". Magritte made use of spheres and cuboids to distort reality in a different way, painting them alongside an assortment of houses in his 1931 \"Mental Arithmetic\" as if they were children's building blocks, but house-sized. \"The Guardian\" observed that the \"eerie toytown image\" prophesied Modernism's usurpation of \"cosy traditional forms\", but also plays with the human tendency to seek patterns in nature.\n\nSalvador Dalí's last painting, \"The Swallow's Tail\" (1983), was part of a series inspired by René Thom's catastrophe theory. The Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Palazuelo (1916–2007) focused on the investigation of form. He developed a style that he described as the geometry of life and the geometry of all nature. Consisting of simple geometric shapes with detailed patterning and coloring, in works such as \"Angular I\" and \"Automnes\", Palazuelo expressed himself in geometric transformations.\n\nThe artist Adrian Gray practises stone balancing, exploiting friction and the centre of gravity to create striking and seemingly impossible compositions.\n\nArtists, however, do not necessarily take geometry literally. As Douglas Hofstadter writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought, \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\", by way of (among other things) the mathematics of art: \"The difference between an Escher drawing and non-Euclidean geometry is that in the latter, comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a comprehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not reconcilable with one's conception of the world, no matter how long one stares at the pictures.\" Hofstadter discusses the seemingly paradoxical lithograph \"Print Gallery\" by M. C. Escher; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town, there being a \"strange loop, or tangled hierarchy\" to the levels of reality in the image. The artist himself, Hofstadter observes, is not seen; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical. The image's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and Hendrik Lenstra, who propose that it could contain a Droste effect copy of itself, rotated and shrunk; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter.\n\nAlgorithmic analysis of images of artworks, for example using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.\nJackson Pollock's drip painting style has a definite fractal dimension; among the artists who may have influenced Pollock's controlled chaos, Max Ernst painted Lissajous figures directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a canvas.\n\nThe computer scientist Neil Dodgson investigated whether Bridget Riley's stripe paintings could be characterised mathematically, concluding that while separation distance could \"provide some characterisation\" and global entropy worked on some paintings, autocorrelation failed as Riley's patterns were irregular. Local entropy worked best, and correlated well with the description given by the art critic Robert Kudielka.\n\nThe American mathematician George Birkhoff's 1933 \"Aesthetic Measure\" proposes a quantitative metric of the aesthetic quality of an artwork. It does not attempt to measure the connotations of a work, such as what a painting might mean, but is limited to the \"elements of order\" of a polygonal figure. Birkhoff first combines (as a sum) five such elements: whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry; whether there is optical equilibrium; how many rotational symmetries it has; how wallpaper-like the figure is; and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together. This metric, \"O\", takes a value between −3 and 7. The second metric, \"C\", counts elements of the figure, which for a polygon is the number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides. Birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object's beauty as \"O/C\". This can be interpreted as a balance between the pleasure looking at the object gives, and the amount of effort needed to take it in. Birkhoff's proposal has been criticized in various ways, not least for trying to put beauty in a formula, but he never claimed to have done that.\n\nArt has sometimes stimulated the development of mathematics, as when Brunelleschi's theory of perspective in architecture and painting started a cycle of research that led to the work of Brook Taylor and Johann Heinrich Lambert on the mathematical foundations of perspective drawing, and ultimately to the mathematics of projective geometry of Girard Desargues and Jean-Victor Poncelet.\n\nThe Japanese paper-folding art of origami has been reworked mathematically by Tomoko Fusé using modules, congruent pieces of paper such as squares, and making them into polyhedra or tilings. Paper-folding was used in 1893 by T. Sundara Rao in his \"Geometric Exercises in Paper Folding\" to demonstrate geometrical proofs. The mathematics of paper folding has been explored in Maekawa's theorem, Kawasaki's theorem, and the Huzita–Hatori axioms.\n\nOptical illusions such as the Fraser spiral strikingly demonstrate limitations in human visual perception, creating what the art historian Ernst Gombrich called a \"baffling trick.\" The black and white ropes that appear to form spirals are in fact concentric circles. The mid-twentieth century Op art or optical art style of painting and graphics exploited such effects to create the impression of movement and flashing or vibrating patterns seen in the work of artists such as Bridget Riley, Spyros Horemis, and Victor Vasarely.\n\nA strand of art from Ancient Greece onwards sees God as the geometer of the world, and the world's geometry therefore as sacred. The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. Plutarch attributed the belief to Plato, writing that \"Plato said God geometrizes continually\" (\"Convivialium disputationum\", liber 8,2). This image has influenced Western thought ever since. The Platonic concept derived in its turn from a Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, where the notes were spaced in perfect proportions, corresponding to the lengths of the lyre's strings; indeed, the Pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by Number. In the same way, in Platonic thought, the regular or Platonic solids dictate the proportions found in nature, and in art. A Mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in the Old Testament: \"When he established the heavens I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the deep\" (Proverbs 8:27), showing God drawing out the universe with a pair of compasses. In 1596, the mathematical astronomer Johannes Kepler modelled the universe as a set of nested Platonic solids, determining the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets. William Blake's \"Ancient of Days\" and his painting of the physicist Isaac Newton, naked and drawing with a compass, attempt to depict the contrast between the mathematically perfect spiritual world and the imperfect physical world, as in a different way does Salvador Dalí's 1954 \"Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)\", which depicts the cross as a hypercube, representing the divine perspective with four dimensions rather than the usual three. In Dali's \"The Sacrament of the Last Supper\" (1955) Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant dodecahedron.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5643937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5643937", "title": "Music and mathematics", "text": "Music and mathematics\n\nMusic theory has no axiomatic foundation in modern mathematics, yet the basis of musical sound can be described mathematically (in acoustics) and exhibits \"a remarkable array of number properties\". Elements of music such as its form, rhythm and metre, the pitches of its notes and the tempo of its pulse can be related to the measurement of time and frequency, offering ready analogies in geometry. \n\nThe attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of set theory, abstract algebra and number theory. Some composers have incorporated the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers into their work.\n\nThough ancient Chinese, Indians, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound, the Pythagoreans (in particular Philolaus and Archytas) of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of musical scales in terms of numerical ratios, particularly the ratios of small integers. Their central doctrine was that \"all nature consists of harmony arising out of numbers\".\n\nFrom the time of Plato, harmony was considered a fundamental branch of physics, now known as musical acoustics. Early Indian and Chinese theorists show similar approaches: all sought to show that the mathematical laws of harmonics and rhythms were fundamental not only to our understanding of the world but to human well-being. Confucius, like Pythagoras, regarded the small numbers 1,2,3,4 as the source of all perfection.\n\nWithout the boundaries of rhythmic structure – a fundamental equal and regular arrangement of pulse repetition, accent, phrase and duration – music would not be possible. Modern musical use of terms like meter and measure also reflects the historical importance of music, along with astronomy, in the development of counting, arithmetic and the exact measurement of time and periodicity that is fundamental to physics.\n\nThe elements of musical form often build strict proportions or hypermetric structures (powers of the numbers 2 and 3).\n\nMusical form is the plan by which a short piece of music is extended. The term \"plan\" is also used in architecture, to which musical form is often compared. Like the architect, the composer must take into account the function for which the work is intended and the means available, practicing economy and making use of repetition and order. The common types of form known as binary and ternary (\"twofold\" and \"threefold\") once again demonstrate the importance of small integral values to the intelligibility and appeal of music.\n\nA musical scale is a discrete set of pitches used in making or describing music. The most important scale in the Western tradition is the diatonic scale but many others have been used and proposed in various historical eras and parts of the world. Each pitch corresponds to a particular frequency, expressed in hertz (Hz), sometimes referred to as cycles per second (c.p.s.). A scale has an interval of repetition, normally the octave. The octave of any pitch refers to a frequency exactly twice that of the given pitch.\n\nSucceeding superoctaves are pitches found at frequencies four, eight, sixteen times, and so on, of the fundamental frequency. Pitches at frequencies of half, a quarter, an eighth and so on of the fundamental are called suboctaves. There is no case in musical harmony where, if a given pitch be considered accordant, that its octaves are considered otherwise. Therefore, any note and its octaves will generally be found similarly named in musical systems (e.g. all will be called doh or A or Sa, as the case may be).\n\nWhen expressed as a frequency bandwidth an octave A–A spans from 110 Hz to 220 Hz (span=110 Hz). The next octave will span from 220 Hz to 440 Hz (span=220 Hz). The third octave spans from 440 Hz to 880 Hz (span=440 Hz) and so on. Each successive octave spans twice the frequency range of the previous octave.\n\nBecause we are often interested in the relations or ratios between the pitches (known as intervals) rather than the precise pitches themselves in describing a scale, it is usual to refer to all the scale pitches in terms of their ratio from a particular pitch, which is given the value of one (often written 1/1), generally a note which functions as the tonic of the scale. For interval size comparison, cents are often used.\n\nThere are two main families of tuning systems: equal temperament and just tuning. Equal temperament scales are built by dividing an octave into intervals which are equal on a logarithmic scale, which results in perfectly evenly divided scales, but with ratios of frequencies which are irrational numbers. Just scales are built by multiplying frequencies by rational numbers, which results in simple ratios between frequencies, but with scale divisions that are uneven.\n\nOne major difference between equal temperament tunings and just tunings is differences in acoustical beat when two notes are sounded together, which affects the subjective experience of consonance and dissonance. Both of these systems, and the vast majority of music in general, have scales that repeat on the interval of every octave, which is defined as frequency ratio of 2:1. In other words, every time the frequency is doubled, the given scale repeats.\n\nBelow are Ogg Vorbis files demonstrating the difference between just intonation and equal temperament. You may need to play the samples several times before you can pick the difference.\n\n5-limit tuning, the most common form of just intonation, is a system of tuning using tones that are regular number harmonics of a single fundamental frequency. This was one of the scales Johannes Kepler presented in his Harmonices Mundi (1619) in connection with planetary motion. The same scale was given in transposed form by Scottish mathematician and musical theorist, Alexander Malcolm, in 1721 in his 'Treatise of Musick: Speculative, Practical and Historical', and by theorist Jose Wuerschmidt in the 20th century. A form of it is used in the music of northern India.\n\nAmerican composer Terry Riley also made use of the inverted form of it in his \"Harp of New Albion\". Just intonation gives superior results when there is little or no chord progression: voices and other instruments gravitate to just intonation whenever possible. However, it gives two different whole tone intervals (9:8 and 10:9) because a fixed tuned instrument, such as a piano, cannot change key. To calculate the frequency of a note in a scale given in terms of ratios, the frequency ratio is multiplied by the tonic frequency. For instance, with a tonic of A4 (A natural above middle C), the frequency is 440 Hz, and a justly tuned fifth above it (E5) is simply 440×(3:2) = 660 Hz.\n\nPythagorean tuning is tuning based only on the perfect consonances, the (perfect) octave, perfect fifth, and perfect fourth. Thus the major third is considered not a third but a ditone, literally \"two tones\", and is (9:8) = 81:64, rather than the independent and harmonic just 5:4 = 80:64 directly below. A whole tone is a secondary interval, being derived from two perfect fifths, (3:2) = 9:8.\n\nThe just major third, 5:4 and minor third, 6:5, are a syntonic comma, 81:80, apart from their Pythagorean equivalents 81:64 and 32:27 respectively. According to Carl , \"the dependent third conforms to the Pythagorean, the independent third to the harmonic tuning of intervals.\"\n\nWestern common practice music usually cannot be played in just intonation but requires a systematically tempered scale. The tempering can involve either the irregularities of well temperament or be constructed as a regular temperament, either some form of equal temperament or some other regular meantone, but in all cases will involve the fundamental features of meantone temperament. For example, the root of chord ii, if tuned to a fifth above the dominant, would be a major whole tone (9:8) above the tonic. If tuned a just minor third (6:5) below a just subdominant degree of 4:3, however, the interval from the tonic would equal a minor whole tone (10:9). Meantone temperament reduces the difference between 9:8 and 10:9. Their ratio, (9:8)/(10:9) = 81:80, is treated as a unison. The interval 81:80, called the syntonic comma or comma of Didymus, is the key comma of meantone temperament.\n\nIn equal temperament, the octave is divided into equal parts on the logarithmic scale. While it is possible to construct equal temperament scale with any number of notes (for example, the 24-tone Arab tone system), the most common number is 12, which makes up the equal-temperament chromatic scale. In western music, a division into twelve intervals is commonly assumed unless it is specified otherwise.\n\nFor the chromatic scale, the octave is divided into twelve equal parts, each semitone (half-step) is an interval of the twelfth root of two so that twelve of these equal half steps add up to exactly an octave. With fretted instruments it is very useful to use equal temperament so that the frets align evenly across the strings. In the European music tradition, equal temperament was used for lute and guitar music far earlier than for other instruments, such as musical keyboards. Because of this historical force, twelve-tone equal temperament is now the dominant intonation system in the Western, and much of the non-Western, world.\n\nEqually tempered scales have been used and instruments built using various other numbers of equal intervals. The 19 equal temperament, first proposed and used by Guillaume Costeley in the 16th century, uses 19 equally spaced tones, offering better major thirds and far better minor thirds than normal 12-semitone equal temperament at the cost of a flatter fifth. The overall effect is one of greater consonance. Twenty-four equal temperament, with twenty-four equally spaced tones, is widespread in the pedagogy and notation of Arabic music. However, in theory and practice, the intonation of Arabic music conforms to rational ratios, as opposed to the irrational ratios of equally tempered systems.\n\nWhile any analog to the equally tempered quarter tone is entirely absent from Arabic intonation systems, analogs to a three-quarter tone, or neutral second, frequently occur. These neutral seconds, however, vary slightly in their ratios dependent on maqam, as well as geography. Indeed, Arabic music historian Habib Hassan Touma has written that \"the breadth of deviation of this musical step is a crucial ingredient in the peculiar flavor of Arabian music. To temper the scale by dividing the octave into twenty-four quarter-tones of equal size would be to surrender one of the most characteristic elements of this musical culture.\"\n\nMusical set theory uses the language of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as transposition and inversion, one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called isometries because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set.\n\nExpanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an abelian group with 12 elements. It is possible to describe just intonation in terms of a free abelian group.\n\nTransformational theory is a branch of music theory developed by David Lewin. The theory allows for great generality because it emphasizes transformations between musical objects, rather than the musical objects themselves.\n\nTheorists have also proposed musical applications of more sophisticated algebraic concepts. The theory of regular temperaments has been extensively developed with a wide range of sophisticated mathematics, for example by associating each regular temperament with a rational point on a Grassmannian.\n\nThe chromatic scale has a free and transitive action of the cyclic group formula_1, with the action being defined via transposition of notes. So the chromatic scale can be thought of as a torsor for the group formula_1.\n\nReal and complex analysis have also been made use of, for instance by applying the theory of the Riemann zeta function to the study of equal divisions of the octave.\n\n\n"}

Originally published by \"Van Nostrand\" in 1960, it was reprinted in the Springer-Verlag Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics series in 1974.\n\nWhile the title states that it is naive, which is usually taken to mean without axioms, the book does introduce all the axioms of ZFC set theory (except the Axiom of Foundation), and gives correct and rigorous definitions for basic objects. Where it differs from a \"true\" axiomatic set theory book is its character: there are no discussions of axiomatic minutiae, and there is next to nothing about advanced topics like large cardinals. Instead, it tries to be intelligible to someone who has never thought about set theory before.\n\nHalmos later stated that it was the fastest book he wrote, taking about six months, and that the book \"wrote itself\".\n\nAs noted above, the book omits the Axiom of Foundation. Halmos repeatedly dances around the issue of whether or not a set can contain itself.\nBut Halmos does let us prove that there are certain sets that cannot contain themselves.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The ranges of values of the parameters may form the axes of a plot, and particular outcomes of the model may be plotted against these axes to illustrate how different regions of the parameter space produce different types of behaviour in the model.\n\nOften the parameters are inputs of a function, in which case the technical term for the parameter space is domain of a function.\n\nParameter spaces are particularly useful for describing families of probability distributions that depend on parameters. More generally in science, the term parameter space is used to describe experimental variables.

In other words, we are urged to believe that Plato's theory of ideals is an abstraction, divorced from the so-called external world, of modern European philosophy, despite the fact Plato taught that ideals are ultimately real, and different from non-ideal things—indeed, he argued for a distinction between the ideal and non-ideal realm.\n\nThese commentators speak thus: for example, a particular tree, with a branch or two missing, possibly alive, possibly dead, and with the initials of two lovers carved into its bark, is distinct from the abstract form of Tree-ness. A Tree is the ideal that each of us holds that allows us to identify the imperfect reflections of trees all around us.\n\nPlato gives the divided line as an outline of this theory. At the top of the line, the Form of the Good\nis found, directing everything underneath.\n\nSome contemporary linguistic philosophers construe \"Platonism\" to mean the proposition that universals exist independently of particulars (a universal is anything that can be predicated of a particular).\n\nPlatonism is an ancient school of philosophy, founded by Plato; at the beginning, this school had a physical existence at a site just outside the walls of Athens called the Academy, as well as the intellectual unity of a shared approach to philosophizing.\n\nPlatonism is usually divided into three periods:\n\n\nPlato's students used the hypomnemata as the foundation to his philosophical approach to knowledge. The hypomnemata constituted a material memory of things read, heard, or thought, thus offering these as an accumulated treasure for rereading and later meditation. For the Neoplatonist they also formed a raw material for the writing of more systematic treatises in which were given arguments and means by which to struggle against some defect (such as anger, envy, gossip, flattery) or to overcome some difficult circumstance (such as a mourning, an exile, downfall, disgrace).\n\nPlatonism is considered to be, in mathematics departments the world over, the predominant philosophy of mathematics, especially regarding the foundations of mathematics.\n\nOne statement of this philosophy is the thesis that mathematics is not created but discovered.\nA lucid statement of this is found in an essay written by the British mathematician G. H. Hardy in defense of pure mathematics. \n\nThe absence in this thesis of clear distinction between mathematical and non-mathematical \"creation\" leaves open the inference that it applies to allegedly creative endeavors in art, music, and literature.\n\nIt is unknown if Plato's ideas of idealism have some earlier origin, but Plato held Pythagoras in high regard, and Pythagoras as well as his followers in the movement known as Pythagoreanism claimed the world was literally built up from numbers, an abstract, absolute form.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25056", "title": "Polish notation", "text": "Polish notation\n\nPolish notation (PN), also known as normal Polish notation (NPN), Łukasiewicz notation, Warsaw notation, Polish prefix notation or simply prefix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators \"precede\" their operands, in contrast to (the more common) infix notation (in which operators are placed \"between\" operands), as well as to reverse Polish notation (RPN, in which operators \"follow\" their operands). It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. The description \"Polish\" refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz, who invented Polish notation in 1924.\n\nThe term \"Polish notation\" is sometimes taken (as the opposite of \"infix notation\") to also include reverse Polish notation.\n\nWhen Polish notation is used as a syntax for mathematical expressions by programming language interpreters, it is readily parsed into abstract syntax trees and can, in fact, define a one-to-one representation for the same. Because of this, Lisp (see below) and related programming languages define their entire syntax in terms of prefix notation (and others use postfix notation).\n\nA quotation from a paper by Jan Łukasiewicz, \"Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on \"Generalizing Deduction\"\", page 180, states how the notation was invented:\nI came upon the idea of a parenthesis-free notation in 1924. I used that notation for the first time in my article Łukasiewicz(1), p. 610, footnote.\n\nThe reference cited by Łukasiewicz is apparently a lithographed report in Polish. The referring paper by Łukasiewicz \"Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on \"Generalizing Deduction\"\" was reviewed by Henry A. Pogorzelski in the \"Journal of Symbolic Logic\" in 1965. Heinrich Behmann, editor in 1924 of the article of Moses Schönfinkel already had the idea of eliminating parentheses in logic formulas.\n\nAlonzo Church mentions this notation in his classic book on mathematical logic as worthy of remark in notational systems even contrasted to Alfred Whitehead and Bertrand Russell's logical notational exposition and work in Principia Mathematica.\n\nIn Łukasiewicz's 1951 book, \"Aristotle's Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic\", he mentions that the principle of his notation was to write the functors before the arguments to avoid brackets and that he had employed his notation in his logical papers since 1929. He then goes on to cite, as an example, a 1930 paper he wrote with Alfred Tarski on the sentential calculus.\n\nWhile no longer used much in logic, Polish notation has since found a place in computer science.\n\nThe expression for adding the numbers 1 and 2 is written in Polish notation as (pre-fix), rather than as (in-fix). In more complex expressions, the operators still precede their operands, but the operands may themselves be expressions including again operators and their operands. For instance, the expression that would be written in conventional infix notation as\ncan be written in Polish notation as\nAssuming a given arity of all involved operators (here the \"−\" denotes the binary operation of subtraction, not the unary function of sign-change), any well formed prefix representation thereof is unambiguous, and brackets within the prefix expression are unnecessary. As such, the above expression can be further simplified to\n\nThe processing of the product is deferred until its two operands are available (i.e., 5 minus 6, and 7). As with \"any\" notation, the innermost expressions are evaluated first, but in Polish notation this \"innermost-ness\" can be conveyed by the sequence of operators and operands rather than by bracketing.\n\nIn the conventional infix notation parentheses are required to override the standard precedence rules, since, referring to the above example, moving them\nor removing them\nchanges the meaning and the result of the expression. This version is written in Polish notation as\n\nWhen dealing with non-commutative operations, like division or subtraction, it is necessary to coordinate the sequential arrangement of the operands with the definition of how the operator takes its arguments, i.e., from left to right. For example, , with 10 left to 5, has the meaning of 10 ÷ 5 (read as \"divide 10 by 5\"), or , with 7 left to 6, has the meaning of 7 - 6 (read as \"subtract from 7 the operand 6\").\n\nPrefix/postfix notation is especially popular for its innate ability to express the intended order of operations without the need for parentheses and other precedence rules, as are usually employed with infix notation. Instead, the notation uniquely indicates which operator to evaluate first. The operators are assumed to have a fixed arity each, and all necessary operands are assumed to be explicitly given. A valid prefix expression always starts with an operator and ends with an operand. Evaluation can either proceed from left to right, or in the opposite direction. Starting at the left, the input string, consisting of tokens denoting operators or operands, is pushed token for token on a stack, until the top entries of the stack contain the number of operands that fits to the top most operator (immediately beneath). This group of tokens at the stacktop (the last stacked operator and the according number of operands) is replaced by the result of executing the operator on these/this operand(s). Then the processing of the input continues in this manner. The rightmost operand in a valid prefix expression thus empties the stack, except for the result of evaluating the whole expression. When starting at the right, the pushing of tokens is performed similarly, just the evaluation is triggered by an operator, finding the appropriate number of operands that fits its arity already at the stacktop. Now the leftmost token of a valid prefix expression must be an operator, fitting to the number of operands in the stack, which again yields the result. As can be seen from the description, a push-down store with no capability of arbitrary stack inspection suffices to implement this parsing.\n\nThe above sketched stack manipulation works –with mirrored input– also for expressions in reverse Polish notation.\n\nThe table below shows the core of Jan Łukasiewicz's notation for sentential logic. Some letters in the Polish notation table stand for particular words in Polish, as shown:\n\nNote that the quantifiers ranged over propositional values in Łukasiewicz's work on many-valued logics.\n\nBocheński introduced a system of Polish notation that names all 16 binary connectives of classical propositional logic. For classical propositional logic, it is a compatible extension of the notation of Łukasiewicz. But the notations are incompatible in the sense that Bocheński uses L and M (for nonimplication and converse nonimplication) in propositional logic and Łukasiewicz uses L and M in modal logic.\n\nPrefix notation has seen wide application in Lisp s-expressions, where the brackets are required since the operators in the language are themselves data (first-class functions). Lisp functions may also be variadic. The Tcl programming language, much like Lisp also uses Polish notation through the mathop library. The Ambi programming language uses Polish notation for arithmetic operations and program construction.\n\nPostfix notation is used in many stack-oriented programming languages like PostScript and Forth. CoffeeScript syntax also allows functions to be called using prefix notation, while still supporting the unary postfix syntax common in other languages.\n\nThe number of return values of an expression equals the difference between the number of operands in an expression and the total arity of the operators minus the total number of return values of the operators.\n\nPolish notation, usually in postfix form, is the chosen notation of certain calculators, notably from Hewlett-Packard. At a lower level, postfix operators are used by some stack machines such as the Burroughs large systems.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "437052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=437052", "title": "Positional notation", "text": "Positional notation\n\nPositional notation or place-value notation is a method of representing or encoding numbers. Positional notation is distinguished from other notations (such as Roman numerals) for its use of the same symbol for the different orders of magnitude (for example, the \"ones place\", \"tens place\", \"hundreds place\"). This greatly simplified arithmetic, leading to the rapid spread of the notation across the world.\n\nWith the use of a radix point (decimal point in base-10), the notation can be extended to include fractions and the numeric expansions of real numbers.\n\nThe Babylonian numeral system, base-60, was the first positional system developed, and its influence is present today in the way time and angles are counted in tallies related to 60, like 60 minutes in an hour, 360 degrees in a circle. The Hindu–Arabic numeral system, base-10, is the most commonly used system in the world today for most calculations. The binary numeral system, base-2, is straightforwardly implemented in digital electronic circuitry and used by almost all computer systems and electronics for calculations and representations.\n\nToday, the base-10 (decimal) system, which is likely motivated by counting with the ten fingers, is ubiquitous. Other bases have been used in the past, and some continue to be used today. For example, the Babylonian numeral system, credited as the first positional numeral system, was base-60, but it lacked a real 0 value. Zero was indicated by a space between sexagesimal numerals. By 300 BC, a punctuation symbol (two slanted wedges) was co-opted as a placeholder in the same system. In a tablet unearthed at Kish (dating from about 700 BC), the scribe Bêl-bân-aplu wrote his zeros with three hooks, rather than two slanted wedges. The Babylonian placeholder was not a true zero because it was not used alone. Nor was it used at the end of a number. Thus numbers like 2 and 120 (2×60), 3 and 180 (3×60), 4 and 240 (4×60), looked the same because the larger numbers lacked a final sexagesimal placeholder. Only context could differentiate them.\n\nThe polymath Archimedes (ca. 287–212 BC) invented a decimal positional system in his Sand Reckoner which was based on 10 and later led the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss to lament what heights science would have already reached in his days if Archimedes had fully realized the potential of his ingenious discovery.\n\nBefore positional notation became standard, simple additive systems (sign-value notation) such as Roman numerals were used, and accountants in ancient Rome and during the Middle Ages used the abacus or stone counters to do arithmetic.\nCounting rods and most abacuses have been used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system. With counting rods or abacus to perform arithmetic operations, the writing of the starting, intermediate and final values of a calculation could easily be done with a simple additive system in each position or column. This approach required no memorization of tables (as does positional notation) and could produce practical results quickly. For four centuries (from the 13th to the 16th) there was strong disagreement between those who believed in adopting the positional system in writing numbers and those who wanted to stay with the additive-system-plus-abacus. Although electronic calculators have largely replaced the abacus, the latter continues to be used in Japan and other Asian countries.\n\nAfter the French Revolution (1789-1799), the new French government promoted the extension of the decimal system.\nSome of those pro-decimal efforts—such as decimal time and the decimal calendar—were unsuccessful.\nOther French pro-decimal efforts—currency decimalisation and the metrication of weights and measures—spread widely out of France to almost the whole world.\n\nJ. Lennart Berggren notes that positional decimal fractions were used for the first time by Arab mathematician Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi as early as the 10th century. The Jewish mathematician Immanuel Bonfils used decimal fractions around 1350, anticipating Simon Stevin, but did not develop any notation to represent them. The Persian mathematician Jamshīd al-Kāshī claimed to have discovered decimal fractions himself in the 15th century.Al Khwarizmi introduced fractions to Islamic countries in the early 9th century; his fraction presentation was an exact copy of traditional Chinese mathematical fractions from Sunzi Suanjing. This form of fraction with numerator on top and denominator at bottom without a horizontal bar was also used by 10th century Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi and 15th century Jamshīd al-Kāshī's work \"Arithmetic Key\".\n\nA forerunner of modern European decimal notation was introduced by Simon Stevin in the 16th century.\n\nA key argument against the positional system was its susceptibility to easy fraud by simply putting a number at the beginning or end of a quantity, thereby changing (e.g.) 100 into 5100, or 100 into 1000. Modern cheques require a natural language spelling of an amount, as well as the decimal amount itself, to prevent such fraud. For the same reason the Chinese also use natural language numerals, for example 100 is written as 壹佰, which can never be forged into 壹仟(1000) or 伍仟壹佰(5100).\n\nMany of the advantages claimed for the metric system could be realized by any consistent positional notation.\nDozenal advocates say dozenal has several advantages over decimal, although the switching cost appears to be high.\n\nIn mathematical numeral systems the base or radix is usually the number of unique digits, including zero, that a positional numeral system uses to represent numbers. For example, for the decimal system the radix is 10, because it uses the 10 digits from 0 through 9. When a number \"hits\" 9, the next number will not be another different symbol, but a \"1\" followed by a \"0\". In binary, the radix is 2, since after it hits \"1\", instead of \"2\" or another written symbol, it jumps straight to \"10\", followed by \"11\" and \"100\".\n\nThe highest symbol of a positional numeral system usually has the value one less than the value of the base of that numeral system. The standard positional numeral systems differ from one another only in the base they use.\n\nThe base is an integer that is greater than 1 (or less than negative 1), since a radix of zero would not have any digits, and a radix of 1 would only have the zero digit. Negative bases are rarely used. In a system with a negative radix, numbers may have many different possible representations.\n\nIn base-10 (decimal) positional notation, there are 10 decimal digits and the number\nIn base-16 (hexadecimal), there are 16 hexadecimal digits (0–9 and A–F) and the number\n\nIn general, in base-\"b\", there are \"b\" digits and the number\n\nWhen describing base in mathematical notation, the letter \"b\" is generally used as a symbol for this concept, so, for a binary system, \"b\" equals 2. Another common way of expressing the base is writing it as a decimal subscript after the number that is being represented (this notation is used in this article). 1111011 implies that the number 1111011 is a base-2 number, equal to 123 (a decimal notation representation), 173 (octal) and 7B (hexadecimal). In books and articles, when using initially the written abbreviations of number bases, the base is not subsequently printed: it is assumed that binary 1111011 is the same as 1111011.\n\nThe base \"b\" may also be indicated by the phrase \"base-\"b\"\". So binary numbers are \"base-2\"; octal numbers are \"base-8\"; decimal numbers are \"base-10\"; and so on.\n\nTo a given radix \"b\" the set of digits {0, 1, ..., \"b\"−2, \"b\"−1} is called the standard set of digits. Thus, binary numbers have digits {0, 1}; decimal numbers have digits and so on. Therefore, the following are notational errors: 52, 2, 1A. (In all cases, one or more digits is not in the set of allowed digits for the given base.)\n\nPositional numeral systems work using exponentiation of the base. A digit's value is the digit multiplied by the value of its place. Place values are the number of the base raised to the \"n\"th power, where \"n\" is the number of other digits between a given digit and the radix point. If a given digit is on the left hand side of the radix point (i.e. its value is an integer) then \"n\" is positive or zero; if the digit is on the right hand side of the radix point (i.e., its value is fractional) then \"n\" is negative.\n\nAs an example of usage, the number 465 in its respective base \"b\" (which must be at least base 7 because the highest digit in it is 6) is equal to:\n\nIf the number 465 was in base-10, then it would equal:\n\nIf however, the number were in base 7, then it would equal:\n\n10 = \"b\" for any base \"b\", since 10 = 1×\"b\" + 0×\"b\". For example, 10 = 2; 10 = 3; 10 = 16. Note that the last \"16\" is indicated to be in base 10. The base makes no difference for one-digit numerals.\n\nThis concept can be demonstrated using a diagram. One object represents one unit. When the number of objects is equal to or greater than the base \"b\", then a group of objects is created with \"b\" objects. When the number of these groups exceeds \"b\", then a group of these groups of objects is created with \"b\" groups of \"b\" objects; and so on. Thus the same number in different bases will have different values:\n\nThe notation can be further augmented by allowing a leading minus sign. This allows the representation of negative numbers. For a given base, every representation corresponds to exactly one real number and every real number has at least one representation. The representations of rational numbers are those representations that are finite, use the bar notation, or end with an infinitely repeating cycle of digits.\n\nA \"digit\" is what is used as a position in place-value notation, and a \"numeral\" is one or more digits. Today's most common digits are the decimal digits \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", and \"9\". The distinction between a digit and a numeral is most pronounced in the context of a number base.\n\nA non-zero \"numeral\" with more than one digit position will mean a different number in a different number base, but in general, the \"digits\" will mean the same. The base-8 numeral 23 contains two digits, \"2\" and \"3\", and with a base number (subscripted) \"8\", means 19. In our notation here, the subscript \"\" of the numeral 23 is part of the numeral, but this may not always be the case. Imagine the numeral \"23\" as having an ambiguous base number. Then \"23\" could likely be any base, base-4 through base-60. In base-4 \"23\" means 11, and in base-60 it means the number 123. The numeral \"23\" then, in this case, corresponds to the set of numbers {11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, ..., 121, 123} while its digits \"2\" and \"3\" always retain their original meaning: the \"2\" means \"two of\", and the \"3\" three.\n\nIn certain applications when a numeral with a fixed number of positions needs to represent a greater number, a higher number-base with more digits per position can be used. A three-digit, decimal numeral can represent only up to 999. But if the number-base is increased to 11, say, by adding the digit \"A\", then the same three positions, maximized to \"AAA\", can represent a number as great as 1330. We could increase the number base again and assign \"B\" to 11, and so on (but there is also a possible encryption between number and digit in the number-digit-numeral hierarchy). A three-digit numeral \"ZZZ\" in base-60 could mean . If we use the entire collection of our alphanumerics we could ultimately serve a base-\"62\" numeral system, but we remove two digits, uppercase \"I\" and uppercase \"O\", to reduce confusion with digits \"1\" and \"0\".\nWe are left with a base-60, or sexagesimal numeral system utilizing 60 of the 62 standard alphanumerics. (But see \"Sexagesimal system\" below.) In general, the number of possible values that can be represented by a formula_8 digit number in base formula_9 is formula_10.\n\nThe common numeral systems in computer science are binary (radix 2), octal (radix 8), and hexadecimal (radix 16). In binary only digits \"0\" and \"1\" are in the numerals. In the octal numerals, are the eight digits 0–7. Hex is 0–9 A–F, where the ten numerics retain their usual meaning, and the alphabetics correspond to values 10–15, for a total of sixteen digits. The numeral \"10\" is binary numeral \"2\", octal numeral \"8\", or hexadecimal numeral \"16\".\n\nThe notation can be extended into the negative exponents of the base \"b\". Thereby the so-called radix point, mostly ».«, is used as separator of the positions with non-negative from those with negative exponent.\n\nNumbers that are not integers use places beyond the radix point. For every position behind this point (and thus after the units digit), the exponent \"n\" of the power \"b\" decreases by 1 and the power approaches 0. For example, the number 2.35 is equal to:\n\nIf the base and all the digits in the set of digits are non-negative, negative numbers cannot be expressed. To overcome this, a minus sign, here »-«, is added to the numeral system. In the usual notation it is prepended to the string of digits representing the otherwise non-negative number.\n\nThe conversion to a base formula_12 of an integer represented in base formula_13 can be done by a succession of Euclidean divisions by formula_14 the right-most digit in base formula_12 is the remainder of the division of by formula_16 the second right-most digit is the remainder of the division of the quotient by formula_17 and so on. More precisely, the th digit from the right is the remainder of the division by formula_12 of the th quotient.\n\nFor example: converting A10B to decimal (41227):\n\nWhen converting to a larger base (such as from binary to decimal), the remainder represents formula_12 as a single digit, using digits from formula_13. For example: converting 0b11111001 (binary) to 249 (decimal):\n\nThe numbers which have a finite representation form the semiring\nMore explicitly, if formula_22 is a factorization of formula_23 into the primes formula_24 with exponents then with the non-empty set of denominators formula_25\nwe have\nwhere formula_27 is the group generated by the formula_28 and formula_29 is the so-called localization of formula_30 with respect to \n\nThe denominator of an element of formula_31 contains if reduced to lowest terms only prime factors out of formula_32.\nThis ring of all terminating fractions to base formula_23 is dense in the field of rational numbers formula_34. Its completion for the usual (Archimedean) metric is the same as for formula_34, namely the real numbers formula_36. So, if formula_37 then formula_38 has not to be confused with formula_39, the discrete valuation ring for the prime formula_40, which is equal to formula_41 with formula_42.\n\nIf formula_23 divides formula_44, we have formula_45\n\nThe representation of non-integers can be extended to allow an infinite string of digits beyond the point. For example, 1.12112111211112 ... base-3 represents the sum of the infinite series:\n\nSince a complete infinite string of digits cannot be explicitly written, the trailing ellipsis (...) designates the omitted digits, which may or may not follow a pattern of some kind. One common pattern is when a finite sequence of digits repeats infinitely. This is designated by drawing a vinculum across the repeating block:\n\nFor base-10 it is called a recurring decimal or repeating decimal.\n\nAn irrational number has an infinite non-repeating representation in all integer bases. Whether a rational number has a finite representation or requires an infinite repeating representation depends on the base. For example, one third can be represented by:\n\nFor integers \"p\" and \"q\" with \"gcd\"(\"p\", \"q\") = 1, the fraction \"p\"/\"q\" has a finite representation in base \"b\" if and only if each prime factor of \"q\" is also a prime factor of \"b\".\n\nFor a given base, any number that can be represented by a finite number of digits (without using the bar notation) will have multiple representations, including one or two infinite representations:\n\nIn the decimal (base-10) Hindu–Arabic numeral system, each position starting from the right is a higher power of 10. The first position represents 10 (1), the second position 10 (10), the third position 10 ( or 100), the fourth position 10 ( or 1000), and so on.\n\nFractional values are indicated by a separator, which can vary in different locations. Usually this separator is a period or full stop, or a comma. Digits to the right of it are multiplied by 10 raised to a negative power or exponent. The first position to the right of the separator indicates 10 (0.1), the second position 10 (0.01), and so on for each successive position.\n\nAs an example, the number 2674 in a base-10 numeral system is:\n\nor\n\nThe sexagesimal or base-60 system was used for the integral and fractional portions of Babylonian numerals and other mesopotamian systems, by Hellenistic astronomers using Greek numerals for the fractional portion only, and is still used for modern time and angles, but only for minutes and seconds. However, not all of these uses were positional.\n\nModern time separates each position by a colon or point. For example, the time might be 10:25:59 (10 hours 25 minutes 59 seconds). Angles use similar notation. For example, an angle might be 10°25'59\" (10 degrees 25 minutes 59 seconds). In both cases, only minutes and seconds use sexagesimal notation—angular degrees can be larger than 59 (one rotation around a circle is 360°, two rotations are 720°, etc.), and both time and angles use decimal fractions of a second. This contrasts with the numbers used by Hellenistic and Renaissance astronomers, who used thirds, fourths, etc. for finer increments. Where we might write 10°25'59.392\", they would have written 10°25′59″23‴31⁗12′′′′′ or 10°2559233112.\n\nUsing a digit set of digits with upper and lowercase letters allows short notation for sexagesimal numbers, e.g. 10:25:59 becomes 'ARz' (by omitting I and O, but not i and o), which is useful for use in URLs, etc., but it is not very intelligible to humans.\n\nIn the 1930s, Otto Neugebauer introduced a modern notational system for Babylonian and Hellenistic numbers that substitutes modern decimal notation from 0 to 59 in each position, while using a semicolon (;) to separate the integral and fractional portions of the number and using a comma (,) to separate the positions within each portion. For example, the mean synodic month used by both Babylonian and Hellenistic astronomers and still used in the Hebrew calendar is 29;31,50,8,20 days, and the angle used in the example above would be written 10;25,59,23,31,12 degrees.\n\nIn computing, the binary (base-2), octal (base-8) and hexadecimal (base-16) bases are most commonly used. Computers, at the most basic level, deal only with sequences of conventional zeroes and ones, thus it is easier in this sense to deal with powers of two. The hexadecimal system is used as \"shorthand\" for binary—every 4 binary digits (bits) relate to one and only one hexadecimal digit. In hexadecimal, the six digits after 9 are denoted by A, B, C, D, E, and F (and sometimes a, b, c, d, e, and f).\n\nThe octal numbering system is also used as another way to represent binary numbers. In this case the base is 8 and therefore only digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are used. When converting from binary to octal every 3 bits relate to one and only one octal digit.\n\nHexadecimal, decimal, octal, and a wide variety of other bases have been used for binary-to-text encoding, implementations of arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and other applications.\n\n\"For a list of bases and their applications, see list of numeral systems.\"\n\nBase-12 systems (duodecimal or dozenal) have been popular because multiplication and division are easier than in base-10, with addition and subtraction being just as easy. Twelve is a useful base because it has many factors. It is the smallest common multiple of one, two, three, four and six. There is still a special word for \"dozen\" in English, and by analogy with the word for 10, \"hundred\", commerce developed a word for 12, \"gross\". The standard 12-hour clock and common use of 12 in English units emphasize the utility of the base. In addition, prior to its conversion to decimal, the old British currency Pound Sterling (GBP) \"partially\" used base-12; there were 12 pence (d) in a shilling (s), 20 shillings in a pound (£), and therefore 240 pence in a pound. Hence the term LSD or, more properly, £sd.\n\nThe Maya civilization and other civilizations of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica used base-20 (vigesimal), as did several North American tribes (two being in southern California). Evidence of base-20 counting systems is also found in the languages of central and western Africa.\n\nRemnants of a Gaulish base-20 system also exist in French, as seen today in the names of the numbers from 60 through 99. For example, sixty-five is \"soixante-cinq\" (literally, \"sixty [and] five\"), while seventy-five is \"soixante-quinze\" (literally, \"sixty [and] fifteen\"). Furthermore, for any number between 80 and 99, the \"tens-column\" number is expressed as a multiple of twenty. For example, eighty-two is \"quatre-vingt-deux\" (literally, four twenty[s] [and] two), while ninety-two is \"quatre-vingt-douze\" (literally, four twenty[s] [and] twelve). In Old French, forty was expressed as two twenties and sixty was three twenties, so that fifty-three was expressed as two twenties [and] thirteen, and so on.\n\nIn English the same base-20 counting appears in the use of \"scores\". Although mostly historical it is occasionally used colloquially. Verse 10 of Pslam 90 in the King James Version of the Bible starts: \"The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow\". The Gettysburg Address starts: \"Four score and seven years ago\".\n\nThe Irish language also used base-20 in the past, twenty being \"fichid\", forty \"dhá fhichid\", sixty \"trí fhichid\" and eighty \"ceithre fhichid\". A remnant of this system may be seen in the modern word for 40, \"daoichead\".\n\nThe Welsh language continues to use a base-20 counting system, particularly for the age of people, dates and in common phrases. 15 is also important, with 16–19 being \"one on 15\", \"two on 15\" etc. 18 is normally \"two nines\". A decimal system is commonly used.\n\nDanish numerals display a similar base-20 structure.\n\nThe Maori language of New Zealand also has evidence of an underlying base-20 system as seen in the terms \"Te Hokowhitu a Tu\" referring to a war party (literally \"the seven 20s of Tu\") and \"Tama-hokotahi\", referring to a great warrior (\"the one man equal to 20\").\n\nThe binary system was used in the Egyptian Old Kingdom, 3000 BC to 2050 BC. It was cursive by rounding off rational numbers smaller than 1 to , with a 1/64 term thrown away (the system was called the Eye of Horus).\n\nA number of Australian Aboriginal languages employ binary or binary-like counting systems. For example, in Kala Lagaw Ya, the numbers one through six are \"urapon\", \"ukasar\", \"ukasar-urapon\", \"ukasar-ukasar\", \"ukasar-ukasar-urapon\", \"ukasar-ukasar-ukasar\".\n\nNorth and Central American natives used base-4 (quaternary) to represent the four cardinal directions. Mesoamericans tended to add a second base-5 system to create a modified base-20 system.\n\nA base-5 system (quinary) has been used in many cultures for counting. Plainly it is based on the number of digits on a human hand. It may also be regarded as a sub-base of other bases, such as base-10, base-20, and base-60.\n\nA base-8 system (octal) was devised by the Yuki tribe of Northern California, who used the spaces between the fingers to count, corresponding to the digits one through eight. There is also linguistic evidence which suggests that the Bronze Age Proto-Indo Europeans (from whom most European and Indic languages descend) might have replaced a base-8 system (or a system which could only count up to 8) with a base-10 system. The evidence is that the word for 9, \"newm\", is suggested by some to derive from the word for \"new\", \"newo-\", suggesting that the number 9 had been recently invented and called the \"new number\".\n\nMany ancient counting systems use five as a primary base, almost surely coming from the number of fingers on a person's hand. Often these systems are supplemented with a secondary base, sometimes ten, sometimes twenty. In some African languages the word for five is the same as \"hand\" or \"fist\" (Dyola language of Guinea-Bissau, Banda language of Central Africa). Counting continues by adding 1, 2, 3, or 4 to combinations of 5, until the secondary base is reached. In the case of twenty, this word often means \"man complete\". This system is referred to as \"quinquavigesimal\". It is found in many languages of the Sudan region.\n\nThe Telefol language, spoken in Papua New Guinea, is notable for possessing a base-27 numeral system.\n\nInteresting properties exist when the base is not fixed or positive and when the digit symbol sets denote negative values. There are many more variations. These systems are of practical and theoretic value to computer scientists.\n\nBalanced ternary uses a base of 3 but the digit set is instead of {0,1,2}. The \"\" has an equivalent value of −1. The negation of a number is easily formed by switching the on the 1s. This system can be used to solve the balance problem, which requires finding a minimal set of known counter-weights to determine an unknown weight. Weights of 1, 3, 9, ... 3 known units can be used to determine any unknown weight up to 1 + 3 + ... + 3 units. A weight can be used on either side of the balance or not at all. Weights used on the balance pan with the unknown weight are designated with , with 1 if used on the empty pan, and with 0 if not used. If an unknown weight \"W\" is balanced with 3 (3) on its pan and 1 and 27 (3 and 3) on the other, then its weight in decimal is 25 or 101 in balanced base-3. \n\nThe factorial number system uses a varying radix, giving factorials as place values; they are related to Chinese remainder theorem and residue number system enumerations. This system effectively enumerates permutations. A derivative of this uses the Towers of Hanoi puzzle configuration as a counting system. The configuration of the towers can be put into 1-to-1 correspondence with the decimal count of the step at which the configuration occurs and vice versa.\n\nEach position does not need to be positional itself. Babylonian sexagesimal numerals were positional, but in each position were groups of two kinds of wedges representing ones and tens (a narrow vertical wedge ( | ) and an open left pointing wedge (<))—up to 14 symbols per position (5 tens (««<) and 9 ones ( ||||||||| ) grouped into one or two near squares containing up to three tiers of symbols, or a place holder (\\\\) for the lack of a position). Hellenistic astronomers used one or two alphabetic Greek numerals for each position (one chosen from 5 letters representing 10–50 and/or one chosen from 9 letters representing 1–9, or a zero symbol).\n\nExamples:\n\nRelated topics:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23275", "title": "Pythagoras", "text": "Pythagoras\n\nPythagoras of Samos () was an Ionian Greek philosopher and the eponymous founder of the Pythagoreanism movement. His political and religious teachings were well known in Magna Graecia and influenced the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and, through them, Western philosophy. Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend, but he appears to have been the son of Mnesarchus, a seal engraver on the island of Samos. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that, around 530 BC, he travelled to Croton, where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a communal, ascetic lifestyle. This lifestyle entailed a number of dietary prohibitions, traditionally said to have included vegetarianism, although modern scholars doubt that he ever advocated for complete vegetarianism.\n\nThe teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is \"metempsychosis\", or the \"transmigration of souls\", which holds that every soul is immortal and, upon death, enters into a new body. He may have also devised the doctrine of \"musica universalis\", which holds that the planets move according to mathematical equations and thus resonate to produce an inaudible symphony of music. Scholars debate whether Pythagoras developed the numerological and musical teachings attributed to him, or if those teachings were developed by his later followers, particularly Philolaus of Croton. Following Croton's decisive victory over Sybaris in around 510 BC, Pythagoras's followers came into conflict with supporters of democracy and Pythagorean meeting houses were burned. Pythagoras may have been killed during this persecution, or escaped to Metapontum, where he eventually died.\n\nIn antiquity, Pythagoras was credited with many mathematical and scientific discoveries, including the Pythagorean theorem, Pythagorean tuning, the five regular solids, the Theory of Proportions, the sphericity of the Earth, and the identity of the morning and evening stars as the planet Venus. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher (\"lover of wisdom\") and that he was the first to divide the globe into five climatic zones. Classical historians debate whether Pythagoras made these discoveries, and many of the accomplishments credited to him likely originated earlier or were made by his colleagues or successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important, but it is debated to what extent, if at all, he actually contributed to mathematics or natural philosophy.\n\nPythagoras influenced Plato, whose dialogues, especially his \"Timaeus\", exhibit Pythagorean teachings. Pythagorean ideas on mathematical perfection also impacted ancient Greek art. His teachings underwent a major revival in the first century BC among Middle Platonists, coinciding with the rise of Neopythagoreanism. Pythagoras continued to be regarded as a great philosopher throughout the Middle Ages and his philosophy had a major impact on scientists such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton. Pythagorean symbolism was used throughout early modern European esotericism and his teachings as portrayed in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" influenced the modern vegetarian movement.\n\nNo authentic writings of Pythagoras have survived, and almost nothing is known for certain about his life. The earliest sources on Pythagoras's life are brief, ambiguous, and often satirical. The earliest source on Pythagoras's teachings is a satirical poem probably written after his death by Xenophanes of Colophon, who had been one of his contemporaries. In the poem, Xenophanes describes Pythagoras interceding on behalf of a dog that is being beaten, professing to recognize in its cries the voice of a departed friend. Alcmaeon of Croton, a doctor who lived in Croton at around the same time Pythagoras lived there, incorporates many Pythagorean teachings into his writings and alludes to having possibly known Pythagoras personally. The poet Heraclitus of Ephesus, who was born across a few miles of sea away from Samos and may have lived within Pythagoras's lifetime, mocked Pythagoras as a clever charlatan, remarking that \"Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practiced inquiry more than any other man, and selecting from these writings he manufactured a wisdom for himself—much learning, artful knavery.\"\n\nThe Greek poets Ion of Chios () and Empedocles of Acragas () both express admiration for Pythagoras in their poems. The first concise description of Pythagoras comes from the historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus (), who describes him as \"not the most insignificant\" of Greek sages and states that Pythagoras taught his followers how to attain immortality. The writings attributed to the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus of Croton, who lived in the late fifth century BC, are the earliest texts to describe the numerological and musical theories that were later ascribed to Pythagoras. The Athenian rhetorician Isocrates (436–338 BC) was the first to describe Pythagoras as having visited Egypt. Aristotle wrote a treatise \"On the Pythagoreans\", which is no longer extant. Some of it may be preserved in the \"Protrepticus\". Aristotle's disciples Dicaearchus, Aristoxenus, and Heraclides Ponticus also wrote on the same subject.\n\nMost of the major sources on Pythagoras's life are from the Roman period, by which point, according to the German classicist Walter Burkert, \"the history of Pythagoreanism was already... the laborious reconstruction of something lost and gone.\" Three lives of Pythagoras have survived from late antiquity, all of which are filled primarily with myths and legends. The earliest and most respectable of these is the one from Diogenes Laërtius's \"Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers\". The two later lives were written by the Neoplatonist philosophers Porphyry and Iamblichus and were partially intended as polemics against the rise of Christianity. The later sources are much lengthier than the earlier ones, and even more fantastic in their descriptions of Pythagoras's achievements. Porphyry and Iamblichus used material from the lost writings of Aristotle's disciples and material taken from these sources is generally considered to be the most reliable.\n\nHerodotus, Isocrates, and other early writers agree that Pythagoras was the son of Mnesarchus and that he was born on the Greek island of Samos in the eastern Aegean. His father is said to have been a gem-engraver or a wealthy merchant, but his ancestry is disputed and unclear. Pythagoras's name led him to be associated with Pythian Apollo; Aristippus of Cyrene explained his name by saying, \"He spoke (, ) the truth no less than did the (, )\". A late source gives Pythagoras's mother's name as Pythaïs. Iamblichus tells the story that the Pythia prophesied to her while she was pregnant with him that she would give birth to a man supremely beautiful, wise, and beneficial to humankind. As to the date of his birth, Aristoxenus stated that Pythagoras left Samos in the reign of Polycrates, at the age of 40, which would give a date of birth around 570 BC.\n\nDuring Pythagoras's formative years, Samos was a thriving cultural hub known for its feats of advanced architectural engineering, including the building of the Tunnel of Eupalinos, and for its riotous festival culture. It was a major center of trade in the Aegean where traders brought goods from the Near East. According to Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier, these traders almost certainly brought with them Near Eastern ideas and traditions. Pythagoras's early life also coincided with the flowering of early Ionian natural philosophy. He was a contemporary of the philosophers Anaximander, Anaximenes, and the historian Hecataeus, all of whom lived in Miletus, across the sea from Samos.\n\nPythagoras is traditionally thought to have received most of his education in the Near East. Modern scholarship has shown that the culture of Archaic Greece was heavily influenced by those of Near Eastern cultures. Like many other important Greek thinkers, Pythagoras was said to have studied in Egypt. By the time of Isocrates in the fourth century BC, Pythagoras's alleged studies in Egypt were already taken as fact. The writer Antiphon, who may have lived during the Hellenistic Era, claimed in his lost work \"On Men of Outstanding Merit\", used as a source by Porphyry, that Pythagoras learned to speak Egyptian from the Pharaoh Amasis II himself, that he studied with the Egyptian priests at Diospolis (Thebes), and that he was the only foreigner ever to be granted the privilege of taking part in their worship. The Middle Platonist biographer Plutarch () writes in his treatise \"On Isis and Osiris\" that, during his visit to Egypt, Pythagoras received instruction from the Egyptian priest Oenuphis of Heliopolis (meanwhile Solon received lectures from a Sonchis of Sais). According to the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (), \"Pythagoras was a disciple of Soches, an Egyptian archprophet, as well as Plato of Sechnuphis of Heliopolis.\" Some ancient writers claimed, that Pythagoras learned geometry and the doctrine of metempsychosis from the Egyptians.\n\nOther ancient writers, however, claimed that Pythagoras had learned these teachings from the Magi in Persia or even from Zoroaster himself. Diogenes Laërtius asserts that Pythagoras later visited Crete, where he went to the Cave of Ida with Epimenides. The Phoenicians are reputed to have taught Pythagoras arithmetic and the Chaldeans to have taught him astronomy. By the third century BC, Pythagoras was already reported to have studied under the Jews as well. Contradicting all these reports, the novelist Antonius Diogenes, writing in the second century BC, reports that Pythagoras discovered all his doctrines himself by interpreting dreams. The third-century AD Sophist Philostratus claims that, in addition to the Egyptians, Pythagoras also studied under Hindu sages in India. Iamblichus expands this list even further by claiming that Pythagoras also studied with the Celts and Iberians.\n\nAncient sources also record Pythagoras having studied under a variety of native Greek thinkers. Some identify as a possible tutor. Hermodamas represented the indigenous Samian rhapsodic tradition and his father Creophylos was said to have been the host of rival of the poet Homer. Others credit Bias of Priene, Thales, or Anaximander (a pupil of Thales). Other traditions claim the mythic bard Orpheus as Pythagoras's teacher, thus representing the Orphic Mysteries. The Neoplatonists wrote of a \"sacred discourse\" Pythagoras had written on the gods in the Doric Greek dialect, which they believed had been dictated to Pythagoras by the Orphic priest Aglaophamus upon his initiation to the orphic Mysteries at Leibethra. Iamblichus credited Orpheus with having been the model for Pythagoras's manner of speech, his spiritual attitude, and his manner of worship. Iamblichus describes Pythagoreanism as a synthesis of everything Pythagoras had learned from Orpheus, from the Egyptian priests, from the Eleusinian Mysteries, and from other religious and philosophical traditions. Riedweg states that, although these stories are fanciful, Pythagoras's teachings were definitely influenced by Orphism to a noteworthy extent.\n\nOf the various Greek sages claimed to have taught Pythagoras, Pherecydes of Syros is mentioned most often. Similar miracle stories were told about both Pythagoras and Pherecydes, including one in which the hero predicts a shipwreck, one in which he predicts the conquest of a city, and one in which he drinks from a well and predicts a shipwreck. Apollonius Paradoxographus, a paradoxographer who may have lived in the second century BC, identified Pythagoras's thaumaturgic ideas as a result of Pherecydes's influence. Another story, which may be traced to the Neopythagorean philosopher Nicomachus, tells that, when Pherecydes was old and dying on the island of Delos, Pythagoras returned to care for him and pay his respects. Duris, the historian and tyrant of Samos, is reported to have patriotically boasted of an epitaph supposedly penned by Pherecydes which declared that Pythagoras's wisdom exceeded his own. On the grounds of all these references connecting Pythagoras with Pherecydes, Riedweg concludes that there may well be some historical foundation to the tradition that Pherecydes was Pythagoras's teacher. Pythagoras and Pherecydes also appear to have shared similar views on the soul and the teaching of metempsychosis.\n\nBefore 520 BC, on one of his visits to Egypt or Greece, Pythagoras might have met Thales of Miletus, who would have been around fifty-four years older than him. Thales was a philosopher, scientist, mathematician, and engineer, also known for a special case of the inscribed angle theorem. Pythagoras's birthplace, the island of Samos, is situated in the Northeast Aegean Sea not far from Miletus. Diogenes Laërtius cites a statement from Aristoxenus (fourth century BC) stating that Pythagoras learned most of his moral doctrines from the Delphic priestess Themistoclea. Porphyry agrees with this assertion, but calls the priestess Aristoclea (\"Aristokleia\"). Ancient authorities furthermore note the similarities between the religious and ascetic peculiarities of Pythagoras with the Orphic or Cretan mysteries, or the Delphic oracle.\n\nPorphyry repeats an account from Antiphon, who reported that, while he was still on Samos, Pythagoras founded a school known as the \"semicircle\". Here, Samians debated matters of public concern. Supposedly, the school became so renowned that the brightest minds in all of Greece came to Samos to hear Pythagoras teach. Pythagoras himself dwelled in a secret cave, where he studied in private and occasionally held discourses with a few of his close friends. Christoph Riedweg, a German scholar of early Pythagoreanism, states that it is entirely possible Pythagoras may have taught on Samos, but cautions that Antiphon's account, which makes reference to a specific building that was still in use during his own time, appears to be motivated by Samian patriotic interest.\n\nAround 530 BC, when Pythagoras was around forty years old, he left Samos. His later admirers claimed that he left because he disagreed with the tyranny of Polycrates in Samos, Riedweg notes that this explanation closely aligns with Nicomachus's emphasis on Pythagoras's purported love of freedom, but that Pythagoras's enemies portrayed him as having a proclivity towards tyranny. Other accounts claim that Pythagoras left Samos because he was so overburdened with public duties in Samos, because of the high estimation in which he was held by his fellow-citizens. He arrived in the Greek colony of Croton (today's Crotone, in Calabria) in what was then Magna Graecia. All sources agree that Pythagoras was charismatic and quickly acquired great political influence in his new environment. He served as an advisor to the elites in Croton and gave them frequent advice. Later biographers tell fantastical stories of the effects of his eloquent speeches in leading the people of Croton to abandon their luxurious and corrupt way of life and devote themselves to the purer system which he came to introduce.\n\nDiogenes Laërtius states that Pythagoras \"did not indulge in the pleasures of love\" and that he cautioned others to only have sex \"whenever you are willing to be weaker than yourself\". According to Porphyry, Pythagoras married Theano, a lady of Crete and the daughter of Pythenax and had several children with her. Porphyry writes that Pythagoras had two sons named Telauges and Arignote, and a daughter named Myia, who \"took precedence among the maidens in Croton and, when a wife, among married women.\" Iamblichus mentions none of these children and instead only mentions a son named Mnesarchus after his grandfather. This son was raised by Pythagoras's appointed successor Aristaeus and eventually took over the school when Aristaeus was too old to continue running it.\n\nThe wrestler Milo of Croton was said to have been a close associate of Pythagoras and was credited with having saved the philosopher's life when a roof was about to collapse. This association may been the result of confusion with a different man named Pythagoras, who was an athletics trainer. Diogenes Laërtius records Milo's wife's name as Myia. Iamblichus mentions Theano as the wife of Brontinus of Croton. Diogenes Laërtius states that the same Theano was Pythagoras's pupil and that Pythagoras's wife Theano was her daughter. Diogenes Laërtius also records that works supposedly written by Theano were still extant during his own lifetime and quotes several opinions attributed to her. These writings are now known to be pseudepigraphical.\n\nPythagoras's emphasis on dedication and asceticism are credited with aiding in Croton's decisive victory over the neighboring colony of Sybaris in 510 BC. After the victory, some prominent citizens of Croton proposed a democratic constitution, which the Pythagoreans rejected. The supporters of democracy, headed by Cylon and Ninon, the former of whom is said to have been irritated by his exclusion from Pythagoras's brotherhood, roused the populace against them. Followers of Cylon and Ninon attacked the Pythagoreans during one of their meetings, either in the house of Milo or in some other meeting-place. Accounts of the attack are often contradictory and many probably confused it with later anti-Pythagorean rebellions. The building was apparently set on fire, and many of the assembled members perished; only the younger and more active members managed to escape.\n\nSources disagree regarding whether Pythagoras was present when the attack occurred and, if he was, whether or not he managed to escape. In some accounts, Pythagoras was not at the meeting when the Pythagoreans were attacked because he was on Delos tending to the dying Pherecydes. According to another account from Dicaearchus, Pythagoras was at the meeting and managed to escape, leading a small group of followers to the nearby city of Locris, where they pleaded for sanctuary, but were denied. They reached the city of Metapontum, where they took shelter in the temple of the Muses and died there of starvation after forty days without food. Another tale recorded by Porphyry claims that, as Pythagoras's enemies were burning the house, his devoted students laid down on the ground to make a path for him to escape by walking over their bodies across the flames like a bridge. Pythagoras managed to escape, but was so despondent at the deaths of his beloved students that he committed suicide. A different legend reported by both Diogenes Laërtius and Iamblichus states that Pythagoras almost managed to escape, but that he came to a bean field and refused to run through it, since doing so would violate his teachings, so he stopped instead and was killed. This story seems to have originated from the writer Neanthes, who told it about later Pythagoreans, not about Pythagoras himself.\n\nAlthough the exact details of Pythagoras's teachings are uncertain, it is possible to reconstruct a general outline of his main ideas. Aristotle writes at length about the teachings of the Pythagoreans, but without mentioning Pythagoras directly. One of Pythagoras's main doctrines appears to have been \"metempsychosis\", the belief that all souls are immortal and that, after death, a soul is transferred into a new body. This teaching is referenced by Xenophanes, Ion of Chios, and Herodotus. Nothing whatsoever, however, is known about the nature or mechanism by which Pythagoras believed metempsychosis to occur.\n\nEmpedocles alludes in one of his poems that Pythagoras may have claimed to possess the ability to recall his former incarnations. Diogenes Laërtius reports an account from Heraclides Ponticus that Pythagoras told people that he had lived four previous lives that he could remember in detail. The first of these lives was as Aethalides the son of Hermes, who granted him the ability to remember all his past incarnations. Next, he was incarnated as Euphorbus, a minor hero from the Trojan War briefly mentioned in the \"Iliad\". He then became the philosopher Hermotimus, who recognized the shield of Euphorbus in the temple of Apollo. His final incarnation was as Pyrrhus, a fisherman from Delos. One of his past lives, as reported by Dicaearchus, was as a beautiful courtesan.\n\nAnother belief attributed to Pythagoras was that of the \"harmony of the spheres\", which maintained that the planets and stars move according to mathematical equations, which correspond to musical notes and thus produce an inaudible symphony. According to Porphyry, Pythagoras taught that the seven Muses were actually the seven planets singing together. In his philosophical dialogue \"Protrepticus\", Aristotle has his literary double say:\n\nPythagoras was said to have practiced divination and prophecy. In the visits to various places in Greece—Delos, Sparta, Phlius, Crete, etc.—which are ascribed to him, he usually appears either in his religious or priestly guise, or else as a lawgiver.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, the Pythagoreans used mathematics for solely mystical reasons, devoid of practical application. They believed that all things were made of numbers. The number one (the monad) represented the origin of all things and the number two (the dyad) represented matter. The number three was an \"ideal number\" because it had a beginning, middle, and end and was the smallest number of points that could be used to define a plane triangle, which they revered as a symbol of the god Apollo. The number four signified the four seasons and the four elements. The number seven was also sacred because it was the number of planets and the number of strings on a lyre, and because Apollo's birthday was celebrated on the seventh day of each month. They believed that odd numbers were masculine, that even numbers were feminine, and that the number five represented marriage, because it was the sum of two and three.\n\nTen was regarded as the \"perfect number\" and the Pythagoreans honored it by never gathering in groups larger than ten. Pythagoras was credited with devising the tetractys, the triangular figure of four rows which add up to the perfect number, ten. The Pythagoreans regarded the tetractys as a symbol of utmost mystical importance. Iamblichus, in his \"Life of Pythagoras\", states that the tetractys was \"so admirable, and so divinised by those who understood [it],\" that Pythagoras's students would swear oaths by it. Andrew Gregory concludes that the tradition linking Pythagoras to the tetractys is probably genuine.\n\nModern scholars debate whether these numerological teachings were developed by Pythagoras himself or by the later Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus of Croton. In his landmark study \"Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism\", Walter Burkert argues that Pythagoras was a charismatic political and religious teacher, but that the number philosophy attributed to him was really an innovation by Philolaus. According to Burkert, Pythagoras never dealt with numbers at all, let alone made any noteworthy contribution to mathematics. Burkert argues that the only mathematics the Pythagoreans ever actually engaged in was simple, proofless arithmetic, but that these arithmetic discoveries did contribute significantly to the beginnings of mathematics.\n\nBoth Plato and Isocrates state that, above all else, Pythagoras was known as the founder of a new way of life. The organization Pythagoras founded at Croton was called a \"school\", but, in many ways, resembled a monastery. The adherents were bound by a vow to Pythagoras and each other, for the purpose of pursuing the religious and ascetic observances, and of studying his religious and philosophical theories. The members of the sect shared all their possessions in common and were devoted to each other to the exclusion of outsiders. Ancient sources record that the Pythagoreans ate meals in common after the manner of the Spartans. One Pythagorean maxim was \"koinà tà phílōn\" (\"All things in common among friends\"). Both Iamblichus and Porphyry provide detailed accounts of the organization of the school, although the primary interest of both writers is not historical accuracy, but rather to present Pythagoras as a divine figure, sent by the gods to benefit humankind. Iamblichus, in particular, presents the \"Pythagorean Way of Life\" as a pagan alternative to the Christian monastic communities of his own time.\n\nTwo groups existed within early Pythagoreanism: the \"mathematikoi\" (\"learners\") and the \"akousmatikoi\" (\"listeners\"). The \"akousmatikoi\" are traditionally identified by scholars as \"old believers\" in mysticism, numerology, and religious teachings; whereas the \"mathematikoi\" are traditionally identified as a more intellectual, modernist faction who were more rationalist and scientific. Gregory cautions that there was probably not a sharp distinction between them and that many Pythagoreans probably believed the two approaches were compatible. The study of mathematics and music may have been connected to the worship of Apollo. The Pythagoreans believed that music was a purification for the soul, just as medicine was a purification for the body. One anecdote of Pythagoras reports that when he encountered some drunken youths trying to break into the home of a virtuous woman, he sang a solemn tune with long spondees and the boys' \"raging willfulness\" was quelled. The Pythagoreans also placed particular emphasis on the importance of physical exercise; therapeutic dancing, daily morning walks along scenic routes, and athletics were major components of the Pythagorean lifestyle. Moments of contemplation at the beginning and end of each day were also advised.\n\nPythagorean teachings were known as \"symbols\" (\"symbolon\") and members took a vow of silence that they would not reveal these symbols to non-members. Those who did not obey the laws of the community were expelled and the remaining members would erect tombstones for them as though they had died. A number of \"oral sayings\" (\"akoúsmata\") attributed to Pythagoras have survived, dealing with how members of the Pythagorean community should perform sacrifices, how they should honor the gods, how they should \"move from here\", and how they should be buried. Many of these sayings emphasize the importance of ritual purity and avoiding defilement. For instance, a saying which Leonid Zhmud concludes can probably be genuinely traced back to Pythagoras himself forbids his followers from wearing woolen garments. Other extant oral sayings forbid Pythagoreans from breaking bread, poking fires with swords, or picking up crumbs and teach that a person should always put the right sandal on before the left. The exact meanings of these sayings, however, are frequently obscure. Iamblichus preserves Aristotle's descriptions of the original, ritualistic intentions behind a few of these sayings, but these apparently later fell out of fashion, because Porphyry provides markedly different ethical-philosophical interpretations of them:\n\nNew initiates were allegedly not permitted to meet Pythagoras until after they had completed a five-year initiation period, during which they were required to remain silent. Sources indicate that Pythagoras himself was unusually progressive in his attitudes towards women and female members of Pythagoras's school appear to have played an active role in its operations. Iamblichus provides a list of 235 famous Pythagoreans, seventeen of whom are women. In later times, many prominent female philosophers contributed to the development of Neopythagoreanism.\n\nPythagoreanism also entailed a number of dietary prohibitions. It is more or less agreed that Pythagoras issued a prohibition against the consumption of beans and the meat of non-sacrificial animals such as fish and poultry. Both of these assumptions, however, have been contradicted. Pythagorean dietary restrictions may have been motivated by belief in the doctrine of metempsychosis. Some ancient writers present Pythagoras as enforcing a strictly vegetarian diet. Eudoxus of Cnidus, a student of Archytas, writes, \"Pythagoras was distinguished by such purity and so avoided killing and killers that he not only abstained from animal foods, but even kept his distance from cooks and hunters.\" Other authorities contradict this statement. According to Aristoxenus, Pythagoras allowed the use of all kinds of animal food except the flesh of oxen used for ploughing, and rams. According to Heraclides Ponticus, Pythagoras ate the meat from sacrifices and established a diet for athletes dependent on meat.\n\nWithin his own lifetime, Pythagoras was already the subject of elaborate hagiographic legends. Aristotle described Pythagoras as a wonder-worker and somewhat of a supernatural figure. In a fragment, Aristotle writes that Pythagoras had a golden thigh, which he publicly exhibited at the Olympic Games and showed to Abaris the Hyperborean as proof of his identity as the \"Hyperborean Apollo\". Supposedly, the priest of Apollo gave Pythagoras a magic arrow, which he used to fly over long distances and perform ritual purifications. He was supposedly once seen at both Metapontum and Croton at the same time. When Pythagoras crossed the river Kosas (the modern-day Basento), \"several witnesses\" reported that they heard it greet him by name. In Roman times, a legend claimed that Pythagoras was the son of Apollo. According to Muslim tradition, Pythagoras was said to have been initiated by Hermes (Egyptian Thoth).\n\nPythagoras was said to have dressed all in white. He is also said to have borne a golden wreath atop his head and to have worn trousers after the fashion of the Thracians. Diogenes Laërtius presents Pythagoras as having exercised remarkable self-control; he was always cheerful, but \"abstained wholly from laughter, and from all such indulgences as jests and idle stories\". Pythagoras was said to have had extraordinary success in dealing with animals. A fragment from Aristotle records that, when a deadly snake bit Pythagoras, he bit it back and killed it. Both Porphyry and Iamblichus report that Pythagoras once persuaded a bull not to eat beans and that he once convinced a notoriously destructive bear to swear that it would never harm a living thing again, and that the bear kept its word.\n\nRiedweg suggests that Pythagoras may have personally encouraged these legends, but Gregory states that there is no direct evidence of this. Anti-Pythagorean legends were also circulated. Diogenes Laërtes retells a story told by Hermippus of Samos, which states that Pythagoras had once gone into an underground room, telling everyone that he was descending to the underworld. He stayed in this room for months, while his mother secretly recorded everything that happened during his absence. After he returned from this room, Pythagoras recounted everything that had happened while he was gone, convincing everyone that he had really been in the underworld and leading them to trust him with their wives.\n\nAlthough Pythagoras is most famous today for his alleged mathematical discoveries, classical historians dispute whether he himself ever actually made any significant contributions to the field. Many mathematical and scientific discoveries were attributed to Pythagoras, including his famous theorem, as well as discoveries in the fields of music, astronomy, and medicine. Since at least the first century BC, Pythagoras has commonly been given credit for discovering the Pythagorean theorem, a theorem in geometry that states that \"in a right-angled triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal [to the sum of] the squares of the two other sides\"—that is, formula_1. According to a popular legend, after he discovered this theorem, Pythagoras sacrificed an ox, or possibly even a whole \"hecatomb\", to the gods. Cicero rejected this story as spurious because of the much more widely held belief that Pythagoras forbade blood sacrifices. Porphyry attempted to explain the story by asserting that the ox was actually made of dough.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem was known and used by the Babylonians and Indians centuries before Pythagoras, but it is possible that he may have been the first one to introduce it to the Greeks. Some historians of mathematics have even suggested that he—or his students—may have constructed the first proof. Burkert rejects this suggestion as implausible, noting that Pythagoras was never credited with having proved any theorem in antiquity. Furthermore, the manner in which the Babylonians employed Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) cuneiform sources. Pythagoras's biographers state that he also was the first to identify the five regular solids and that he was the first to discover the Theory of Proportions.\n\nAccording to legend, Pythagoras discovered that musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations when he passed blacksmiths at work one day and heard the sound of their hammers clanging against the anvils. Thinking that the sounds of the hammers were beautiful and harmonious, except for one, he rushed into the blacksmith shop and began testing the hammers. He then realized that the tune played when the hammer struck was directly proportional to the size of the hammer and therefore concluded that music was mathematical. However, this legend is demonstrably false, as these ratios are only relevant to string length (such as the string of a monochord), and not to hammer weight.\n\nIn ancient times, Pythagoras and his contemporary Parmenides of Elea were both credited with having been the first to teach that the Earth was spherical, the first to divide the globe into five climactic zones, and the first to identify the morning star and the evening star as the same celestial object. Of the two philosophers, Parmenides has a much stronger claim to having been the first and the attribution of these discoveries to Pythagoras seems to have possibly originated from a pseudepigraphal poem. Empedocles, who lived in Magna Graecia shortly after Pythagoras and Parmenides, knew that the earth was spherical. By the end of the fifth century BC, this fact was universally accepted among Greek intellectuals.\n\nSizeable Pythagorean communities existed in Magna Graecia, Phlius, and Thebes during the early fourth century BC. Around the same time, the Pythagorean philosopher Archytas was highly influential on the politics of the city of Tarentum in Magna Graecia. According to later tradition, Archytas was elected as \"strategos\" (\"general\") seven times, even though others were prohibited from serving more than a year. Archytas was also a renowned mathematician and musician. He was a close friend of Plato and he is quoted in Plato's \"Republic\". Aristotle states that the philosophy of Plato was heavily dependent on the teachings of the Pythagoreans. Cicero repeats this statement, remarking that \"Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia\" (\"They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean\"). According to Charles H. Kahn, Plato's middle dialogues, including \"Meno\", \"Phaedo\", and \"The Republic\", have a strong \"Pythagorean coloring\", and his last few dialogues (particularly \"Philebus\" and \"Timaeus\") are extremely Pythagorean in character.\n\nAccording to R. M. Hare, Plato's \"Republic\" may be partially based on the \"tightly organised community of like-minded thinkers\" established by Pythagoras at Croton. Additionally, Plato may have borrowed from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and abstract thought are a secure basis for philosophy, science, and morality. Plato and Pythagoras shared a \"mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world\" and it is probable that both were influenced by Orphism. The historian of philosophy Frederick Copleston states that Plato probably borrowed his tripartite theory of the soul from the Pythagoreans. Bertrand Russell, in his \"A History of Western Philosophy\", contends that the influence of Pythagoras on Plato and others was so great that he should be considered the most influential philosopher of all time. He concludes that \"I do not know of any other man who has been as influential as he was in the school of thought.\"\n\nA revival of Pythagorean teachings occurred in the first century BC when Middle Platonist philosophers such as Eudorus and Philo of Alexandria hailed the rise of a \"new\" Pythagoreanism in Alexandria. At around the same time, Neopythagoreanism became prominent. The first-century AD philosopher Apollonius of Tyana sought to emulate Pythagoras and live by Pythagorean teachings. The later first-century Neopythagorean philosopher Moderatus of Gades expanded on Pythagorean number philosophy and probably understood the soul as a \"kind of mathematical harmony.\" The Neopythagorean mathematician and musicologist Nicomachus likewise expanded on Pythagorean numerology and music theory. Numenius of Apamea interpreted Plato's teachings in light of Pythagorean doctrines.\n\nGreek sculpture sought to represent the permanent reality behind superficial appearances. Early Archaic sculpture represents life in simple forms, and may have been influenced by the earliest Greek natural philosophies. The Greeks generally believed that nature expressed itself in ideal forms and was represented by a type (), which was mathematically calculated. When dimensions changed, architects sought to relay permanence through mathematics. Maurice Bowra believes that these ideas influenced the theory of Pythagoras and his students, who believed that \"all things are numbers\".\n\nDuring the sixth century BC, the number philosophy of the Pythagoreans triggered a revolution in Greek sculpture. Greek sculptors and architects attempted to find the mathematical relation (canon) behind aesthetic perfection. Possibly drawing on the ideas of Pythagoras, the sculptor Polykleitos writes in his \"Canon\" that beauty consists in the proportion, not of the elements (materials), but of the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole. In the Greek architectural orders, every element was calculated and constructed by mathematical relations. Rhys Carpenter states that the ratio 2:1 was \"the generative ratio of the Doric order, and in Hellenistic times an ordinary Doric colonnade, beats out a rhythm of notes.\"\n\nThe oldest known building designed according to Pythagorean teachings is the Porta Maggiore Basilica, a subterranean basilica which was built during the reign of the Roman emperor Nero as a secret place of worship for Pythagoreans. The basilica was built underground because of the Pythagorean emphasis on secrecy and also because of the legend that Pythagoras had sequestered himself in a cave on Samos. The basilica's apse is in the east and its atrium in the west out of respect for the rising sun. It has a narrow entrance leading to a small pool where the initiates could purify themselves. The building is also designed according to Pythagorean numerology, with each table in the sanctuary providing seats for seven people. Three aisles lead to a single altar, symbolizing the three parts of the soul approaching the unity of Apollo. The apse depicts a scene of the poetess Sappho leaping off the Leucadian cliffs, clutching her lyre to her breast, while Apollo stands beneath her, extending his right hand in a gesture of protection, symbolizing Pythagorean teachings about the immortality of the soul. The interior of the sanctuary is almost entirely white because the color white was regarded by Pythagoreans as sacred.\n\nThe emperor Hadrian's Pantheon in Rome was also built based on Pythagorean numerology. The temple's circular plan, central axis, hemispherical dome, and alignment with the four cardinal directions symbolize Pythagorean views on the order of the universe. The single oculus at the top of the dome symbolizes the monad and the sun-god Apollo. The twenty-eight ribs extending from the oculus symbolize the moon, because twenty-eight was the same number of months on the Pythagorean lunar calendar. The five coffered rings beneath the ribs represent the marriage of the sun and moon.\n\nMany early Christians had a deep respect for Pythagoras. Eusebius ( 260 – 340 AD), bishop of Caesarea, praises Pythagoras in his \"Against Hierokles\" for his rule of silence, his frugality, his \"extraordinary\" morality, and his wise teachings. In another work, Eusebius compares Pythagoras to Moses. In one of his letter, the Church Father Jerome ( 347 – 420 AD) praises Pythagoras for his wisdom and, in another letter, he credits Pythagoras for his belief in the immortality of the soul, which he suggests Christians inherited from him. Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430 AD) rejected Pythagoras's teaching of metempsychosis without explicitly naming him, but otherwise expressed admiration for him. In \"On the Trinity\", Augustine lauds the fact that Pythagoras was humble enough to call himself a \"philosophos\" or \"lover of wisdom\" rather than a \"sage\". In another passage, Augustine defends Pythagoras's reputation, arguing that Pythagoras certainly never taught the doctrine of metempsychosis.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Pythagoras was revered as the founder of mathematics and music, two of the Seven Liberal Arts. He appears in numerous medieval depictions, in illuminated manuscripts and in the relief sculptures on the portal of the Cathedral of Chartres. The \"Timaeus\" was the only dialogue of Plato to survive in Latin translation in western Europe, which led William of Conches (c. 1080-1160) to declare that Plato was Pythagorean. In the 1430s, the Camaldolese friar Ambrose Traversari translated Diogenes Laërtius's \"Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers\" from Greek into Latin and, in the 1460s, the philosopher Marsilio Ficino translated Porphyry and Iamblichus's \"Lives of Pythagoras\" into Latin as well, thereby allowing them to be read and studied by western scholars. In 1494, the Greek Neopythagorean scholar Constantine Lascaris published \"The Golden Verses of Pythagoras\", translated into Latin, with a printed edition of his \"Grammatica\", thereby bringing them to a widespread audience. In 1499, he published the first Renaissance biography of Pythagoras in his work \"Vitae illustrium philosophorum siculorum et calabrorum\", issued in Messina.\n\nIn his preface to his book \"On the Revolution of the Heavenly Spheres\" (1543), Nicolaus Copernicus cites various Pythagoreans as the most important influences on the development of his heliocentric model of the universe, deliberately omitting mention of Aristarchus of Samos, a non-Pythagorean astronomer who had developed a fully heliocentric model in the fourth century BC, in effort to portray his model as fundamentally Pythagorean. Johannes Kepler considered himself to be a Pythagorean. He believed in the Pythagorean doctrine of \"musica universalis\" and it was his search for the mathematical equations behind this doctrine that led to his discovery of the laws of planetary motion. Kepler titled his book on the subject \"Harmonices Mundi\" (\"Harmonics of the World\"), after the Pythagorean teaching that had inspired him. Near the conclusion of the book, Kepler describes himself falling asleep to the sound of the heavenly music, \"warmed by having drunk a generous draught... from the cup of Pythagoras.\"\n\nIsaac Newton firmly believed in the Pythagorean teaching of the mathematical harmony and order of the universe. Though Newton was notorious for rarely giving others credit for their discoveries, he attributed the discovery of the Law of Universal Gravitation to Pythagoras. Albert Einstein believed that a scientist may also be \"a Platonist or a Pythagorean insofar as he considers the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research.\" The English philosopher Alfred North Whitehead argued that \"In a sense, Plato and Pythagoras stand nearer to modern physical science than does Aristotle. The two former were mathematicians, whereas Aristotle was the son of a doctor\". By this measure, Whitehead declared that Einstein and other modern scientists like him are \"following the pure Pythagorean tradition.\"\n\nA fictionalized portrayal of Pythagoras appears in Book XV of Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", in which he delivers a speech imploring his followers to adhere to a strictly vegetarian diet. It was through Arthur Golding's 1567 English translation of Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" that Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern period. John Donne's \"Progress of the Soul\" discusses the implications of the doctrines expounded in the speech and Michel de Montaigne quoted the speech no less than three times in his treatise \"Of Cruelty\" to voice his moral objections against the mistreatment of animals. William Shakespeare references the speech in his play \"The Merchant of Venice\". John Dryden included a translation of the scene with Pythagoras in his 1700 work \"Fables, Ancient and Modern\" and John Gay's 1726 fable \"Pythagoras and the Countryman\" reiterates its major themes, linking carnivorism with tyranny. Lord Chesterfield records that his conversion to vegetarianism had been motivated by reading Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\". Until the word \"vegetarianism\" was coined in the 1840s, vegetarians were referred to in English as \"Pythagoreans\". Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote an ode entitled \"To the Pythagorean Diet\" and Leo Tolstoy adopted the Pythagorean diet himself.\n\nEarly modern European esotericism drew heavily on the teachings of Pythagoras. The German humanist scholar Johannes Reuchlin (1455–1522) synthesized Pythagoreanism with Christian theology and Jewish Kabbalah, arguing that Kabbalah and Pythagoreanism were both inspired by Mosaic tradition and that Pythagoras was therefore a kabbalist. In his dialogue \"De verbo mirifico\" (1494), Reuchlin compared the Pythagorean tetractys to the ineffable divine name YHWH, ascribing each of the four letters of the tetragrammaton a symbolic meaning according to Pythagorean mystical teachings.\n\nHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa's popular and influential three-volume treatise \"De Occulta Philosophia\" cites Pythagoras as a \"religious magi\" and indicates that Pythagoras's mystical numerology operates on a supercelestial level. The freemasons deliberately modeled their society on the community founded by Pythagoras at Croton. Rosicrucianism used Pythagorean symbolism, as did Robert Fludd (1574–1637), who believed his own musical writings to have been inspired by Pythagoras. John Dee was heavily influenced by Pythagorean ideology, particularly the teaching that all things are made of numbers. Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Illuminati, was a strong admirer of Pythagoras and, in his book \"Pythagoras\" (1787), he advocated that society should be reformed to be more like Pythagoras's commune at Croton. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart incorporated Masonic and Pythagorean symbolism into his opera \"The Magic Flute\". Sylvain Maréchal, in his six-volume 1799 biography \"The Voyages of Pythagoras\", declared that all revolutionaries in all time periods are the \"heirs of Pythagoras\".\n\nDante Alighieri was fascinated by Pythagorean numerology and based his descriptions of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven on Pythagorean numbers. Dante wrote that Pythagoras saw Unity as Good and Plurality as Evil and, in \"Paradiso\" XV, 56–57, he declares: \"five and six, if understood, ray forth from unity.\" The number eleven and its multiples are found throughout the \"Divine Comedy\", each book of which has thirty-three cantos, except for the \"Inferno\", which has thirty-four, the first of which serves as a general introduction. Dante describes the ninth and tenth bolgias in the Eighth Circle of Hell as being twenty-two miles and eleven miles respectively, which correspond to the fraction , which was the Pythagorean approximation of pi. Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven are all described as circular and Dante compares the wonder of God's majesty to the mathematical puzzle of squaring the circle. The number three also features prominently: the \"Divine Comedy\" has three parts and Beatrice is associated with the number nine, which is equal to three times three.\n\nThe Transcendentalists read the ancient \"Lives of Pythagoras\" as guides on how to live a model life. Henry David Thoreau was impacted by Thomas Taylor's translations of Iamblichus's \"Life of Pythagoras\" and Stobaeus's \"Pythagoric Sayings\" and his views on nature may have been influenced by the Pythagorean idea of images corresponding to archetypes. The Pythagorean teaching of \"musica universalis\" is a recurring theme throughout Thoreau's \"magnum opus\", \"Walden\".\n\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\nOnly a few relevant source texts deal with Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans; most are available in different translations.

This term is still used nowadays in the context of differential equations, where \"solving an equation by quadrature\" means expressing its solution in terms of integrals.\n\nQuadrature problems served as one of the main sources of problems in the development of calculus, and introduce important topics in mathematical analysis.\n\nMathematicians of ancient Greece, according to the Pythagorean doctrine, understood determination of area of a figure as the process of geometrically constructing a square having the same area (\"squaring\"), thus the name \"quadrature\" for this process. The Greek geometers were not always successful (see quadrature of the circle), but they did carry out quadratures of some figures whose sides were not simply line segments, such as the lunes of Hippocrates and the quadrature of the parabola. By Greek tradition, these constructions had to be performed using only a compass and straightedge.\n\nFor a quadrature of a rectangle with the sides \"a\" and \"b\" it is necessary to construct a square with the side formula_1 (the geometric mean of \"a\" and \"b\"). For this purpose it is possible to use the following: if one draws the circle with diameter made from joining line segments of lengths \"a\" and \"b\", then the height (\"BH\" in the diagram) of the line segment drawn perpendicular to the diameter, from the point of their connection to the point where it crosses the circle, equals the geometric mean of \"a\" and \"b\". A similar geometrical construction solves the problems of quadrature of a parallelogram and of a triangle.\nProblems of quadrature for curvilinear figures are much more difficult. The quadrature of the circle with compass and straightedge was proved in the 19th century to be impossible. Nevertheless, for some figures (for example a lune of Hippocrates) a quadrature can be performed. The quadratures of the surface of a sphere and a parabola segment discovered by Archimedes became the highest achievement of analysis in antiquity.\nFor the proof of these results, Archimedes used the method of exhaustion of Eudoxus.\n\nIn medieval Europe, quadrature meant the calculation of area by any method. Most often the method of indivisibles was used; it was less rigorous than the geometric constructions of the Greeks, but it was simpler and more powerful. With its help, Galileo Galilei and Gilles de Roberval found the area of a cycloid arch, Grégoire de Saint-Vincent investigated the area under a hyperbola (\"Opus Geometricum\", 1647), and Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa, de Saint-Vincent's pupil and commentator, noted the relation of this area to logarithms.\n\nJohn Wallis algebrised this method; he wrote in his \"Arithmetica Infinitorum\" (1656) some series which are equivalent to what is now called the definite integral, and he calculated their values. Isaac Barrow and James Gregory made further progress: quadratures for some algebraic curves and spirals. Christiaan Huygens successfully performed a quadrature of the surface area of some solids of revolution.\n\nThe quadrature of the hyperbola by Saint-Vincent and de Sarasa provided a new function, the natural logarithm, of critical importance. With the invention of integral calculus came a universal method for area calculation. In response, the term \"quadrature\" has become traditional, and instead the modern phrase \"finding the area\" is more commonly used for what is technically the \"computation of a univariate definite integral\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25308", "title": "Quasispecies model", "text": "Quasispecies model\n\nThe quasispecies model is a description of the process of the Darwinian evolution of certain self-replicating entities within the framework of physical chemistry. A quasispecies is a large group or \"cloud\" of related genotypes that exist in an environment of high mutation rate (at stationary state), where a large fraction of offspring are expected to contain one or more mutations relative to the parent. This is in contrast to a species, which from an evolutionary perspective is a more-or-less stable single genotype, most of the offspring of which will be genetically accurate copies.\n\nIt is useful mainly in providing a qualitative understanding of the evolutionary processes of self-replicating macromolecules such as RNA or DNA or simple asexual organisms such as bacteria or viruses (see also viral quasispecies), and is helpful in explaining something of the early stages of the origin of life. Quantitative predictions based on this model are difficult because the parameters that serve as its input are impossible to obtain from actual biological systems. The quasispecies model was put forward by Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster based on initial work done by Eigen.\n\nWhen evolutionary biologists describe competition between species, they generally assume that each species is a single genotype whose descendants are mostly accurate copies. (Such genotypes are said to have a high reproductive \"fidelity\".) Evolutionarily, we are interested in the behavior and fitness of that one species or genotype over time.\n\nSome organisms or genotypes, however, may exist in circumstances of low fidelity, where most descendants contain one or more mutations. A group of such genotypes is constantly changing, so discussions of which single genotype is the most fit become meaningless. Importantly, if many closely related genotypes are only one mutation away from each other, then genotypes in the group can mutate back and forth into each other. For example, with one mutation per generation, a child of the sequence AGGT could be AGTT, and a grandchild could be AGGT again. Thus we can envision a \"cloud\" of related genotypes that is rapidly mutating, with sequences going back and forth among different points in the cloud. Though the proper definition is mathematical, that cloud, roughly speaking, is a quasispecies.\n\nQuasispecies behavior exists for large numbers of individuals existing at a certain (high) range of mutation rates.\n\nIn a species, though reproduction may be mostly accurate, periodic mutations will give rise to one or more competing genotypes. If a mutation results in greater replication and survival, the mutant genotype may out-compete the parent genotype and come to dominate the species. Thus, the individual genotypes (or species) may be seen as the units on which selection acts and biologists will often speak of a single genotype's fitness.\n\nIn a quasispecies, however, mutations are ubiquitous and so the fitness of an individual genotype becomes meaningless: if one particular mutation generates a boost in reproductive success, it can't amount to much because that genotype's offspring are unlikely to be accurate copies with the same properties. Instead, what matters is the \"connectedness\" of the cloud. For example, the sequence AGGT has 12 (3+3+3+3) possible single point mutants AGGA, AGGG, and so on. If 10 of those mutants are viable genotypes that may reproduce (and some of whose offspring or grandchildren may mutate back into AGGT again), we would consider that sequence a well-connected node in the cloud. If instead only two of those mutants are viable, the rest being lethal mutations, then that sequence is poorly connected and most of its descendants will not reproduce. The analog of fitness for a quasispecies is the tendency of nearby relatives within the cloud to be well-connected, meaning that more of the mutant descendants will be viable and give rise to further descendants within the cloud.\n\nWhen the fitness of a single genotype becomes meaningless because of the high rate of mutations, the cloud as a whole or quasispecies becomes the natural unit of selection.\n\nQuasispecies represents the evolution of high-mutation-rate viruses such as HIV and sometimes single genes or molecules within the genomes of other organisms. Quasispecies models have also been proposed by Jose Fontanari and Emmanuel David Tannenbaum to model the evolution of sexual reproduction. Quasispecies was also shown in compositional replicators (based on the Gard model for abiogenesis) and was also suggested to be applicable to describe cell's replication, which amongst other things requires the maintenance and evolution of the internal composition of the parent and bud.\n\nThe model rests on four assumptions:\n\nIn the quasispecies model, mutations occur through errors made in the process of copying already existing sequences. Further, selection arises because different types of sequences tend to replicate at different rates, which leads to the suppression of sequences that replicate more slowly in favor of sequences that replicate faster. However, the quasispecies model does not predict the ultimate extinction of all but the fastest replicating sequence. Although the sequences that replicate more slowly cannot sustain their abundance level by themselves, they are constantly replenished as sequences that replicate faster mutate into them. At equilibrium, removal of slowly replicating sequences due to decay or outflow is balanced by replenishing, so that even relatively slowly replicating sequences can remain present in finite abundance.\n\nDue to the ongoing production of mutant sequences, selection does not act on single sequences, but on mutational \"clouds\" of closely related sequences, referred to as \"quasispecies\". In other words, the evolutionary success of a particular sequence depends not only on its own replication rate, but also on the replication rates of the mutant sequences it produces, and on the replication rates of the sequences of which it is a mutant. As a consequence, the sequence that replicates fastest may even disappear completely in selection-mutation equilibrium, in favor of more slowly replicating sequences that are part of a quasispecies with a higher average growth rate. Mutational clouds as predicted by the quasispecies model have been observed in RNA viruses and in \"in vitro\" RNA replication.\n\nThe mutation rate and the general fitness of the molecular sequences and their neighbors is crucial to the formation of a quasispecies. If the mutation rate is zero, there is no exchange by mutation, and each sequence is its own species. If the mutation rate is too high, exceeding what is known as the error threshold, the quasispecies will break down and be dispersed over the entire range of available sequences.\n\nA simple mathematical model for a quasispecies is as follows: let there be formula_1 possible sequences and let there be formula_2 organisms with sequence \"i\". Let's say that each of these organisms asexually gives rise to formula_3 offspring. Some are duplicates of their parent, having sequence \"i\", but some are mutant and have some other sequence. Let the mutation rate formula_4 correspond to the probability that a \"j\" type parent will produce an \"i\" type organism. Then the expected fraction of offspring generated by \"j\" type organisms that would be \"i\" type organisms is formula_5,\n\nwhere formula_6.\n\nThen the total number of \"i\"-type organisms after the first round of reproduction, given as formula_7, is\n\nSometimes a death rate term formula_9 is included so that:\n\nwhere formula_11 is equal to 1 when i=j and is zero otherwise. Note that the \"n-th\" generation can be found by just taking the \"n-th\" power of W substituting it in place of W in the above formula.\n\nThis is just a system of linear equations. The usual way to solve such a system is to first diagonalize the W matrix. Its diagonal entries will be eigenvalues corresponding to certain linear combinations of certain subsets of sequences which will be eigenvectors of the W matrix. These subsets of sequences are the quasispecies. Assuming that the matrix W is a primitive matrix (irreducible and aperiodic), then after very many generations only the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue will prevail, and it is this quasispecies that will eventually dominate. The components of this eigenvector give the relative abundance of each sequence at equilibrium.\n\nW being primitive means that for some integer formula_12, that the formula_13 power of W is > 0, i.e. all the entries are positive. If W is primitive then each type can, through a sequence of mutations (i.e. powers of W) mutate into all the other types after some number of generations. W is not primitive if it is periodic, where the population can perpetually cycle through different disjoint sets of compositions, or if it is reducible, where the dominant species (or quasispecies) that develops can depend on the initial population, as is the case in the simple example given below.\n\nThe quasispecies formulae may be expressed as a set of linear differential equations. If we consider the difference between the new state formula_7 and the old state formula_2 to be the state change over one moment of time, then we can state that the time derivative of formula_2 is given by this difference, formula_17 we can write:\n\nThe quasispecies equations are usually expressed in terms of concentrations formula_19 where\n\nThe above equations for the quasispecies then become for the discrete version:\n\nor, for the continuum version:\n\nThe quasispecies concept can be illustrated by a simple system consisting of 4 sequences. Sequences [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], and [1,1] are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Let's say the [0,0] sequence never mutates and always produces a single offspring. Let's say the other 3 sequences all produce, on average, formula_24 replicas of themselves, and formula_25 of each of the other two types, where formula_26. The W matrix is then:\n\nThe diagonalized matrix is:\n\nAnd the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues are:\n\nOnly the eigenvalue formula_29 is more than unity. For the n-th generation, the corresponding eigenvalue will be formula_30 and so will increase without bound as time goes by. This eigenvalue corresponds to the eigenvector [0,1,1,1], which represents the quasispecies consisting of sequences 2, 3, and 4, which will be present in equal numbers after a very long time. Since all population numbers must be positive, the first two quasispecies are not legitimate. The third quasispecies consists of only the non-mutating sequence 1. It's seen that even though sequence 1 is the most fit in the sense that it reproduces more of itself than any other sequence, the quasispecies consisting of the other three sequences will eventually dominate (assuming that the initial population was not homogeneous of the sequence 1 type).\n\n"}
{"id": "11919629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11919629", "title": "Rod calculus", "text": "Rod calculus\n\nRod calculus or rod calculation is the mechanical method of algorithmic computation with counting rods in China from the Warring States to Ming dynasty before the counting rods were replaced by the more convenient and faster abacus. Rod calculus played a key role in the development of Chinese mathematics to its height in Song Dynasty and Yuan Dynasty, culminating in the invention\nof polynomial equations of up to four unknowns in the work of Zhu Shijie.\n\nThe basic equipment for carrying out rod calculus is a bundle of counting rods and a counting board. The counting rods are usually made of bamboo sticks, about 12 cm- 15 cm in length, 2mm to 4 mm diameter, sometimes from animal bones, or ivory and jade (for well-heeled merchants). A counting board could be a table top, a wooden board with or without grid, on the floor or on sand.\n\nIn 1971 Chinese archaeologists unearthed a bundle of well-preserved animal bone counting rods stored in a silk pouch from a tomb in Qian Yang county in Shanxi province, dated back to the first half of Han dynasty (206 BC – 8AD). In 1975 a bundle of bamboo counting rods was unearthed.\n\nThe use of counting rods for rod calculus flourished in the Warring States, although no archaeological artefacts were found earlier than the Western Han Dynasty (the first half of Han dynasty; however, archaeologists did unearth software artefacts of rod calculus dated back to the Warring States); since the rod calculus software must have gone along with rod calculus hardware, there is no doubt that rod calculus was already flourishing during the Warring States more than 2,200 years ago.\n\nThe key software required for rod calculus was a simple 45 phrase positional decimal multiplication table used in China since antiquity, called the nine-nine table, which were learned by heart by pupils, merchants, government officials and mathematicians alike.\n\nRod numerals is the only numeric system that uses different placement combination of a single symbol to convey any number or fraction in the Decimal System. For numbers in the units place, every vertical rod represent 1. Two vertical rods represent 2, and so on, until 5 vertical rods, which represents 5. For number between 6 and 9, a biquinary system is used, in which a horizontal bar on top of the vertical bars represent 5. The first row are the number 1 to 9 in rod numerals, and the second row is the same numbers in horizontal form.\n\nFor numbers larger than 9, a decimal system is used. Rods placed one place to the left of the units place represent 10 times that number. For the hundreds place, another set of rods is placed to the left which represents 100 times of that number, and so on. As shown in the adjacent image, the number 231 is represented in rod numerals in the top row, with one rod in the units place representing 1, three rods in the tens place representing 30, and two rods in the hundreds place representing 200, with a sum of 231.\n\nWhen doing calculation, usually there was no grid on the surface. If rod numerals two, three, and one is placed consecutively in the vertical form, there's a possibility of it being mistaken for 51 or 24, as shown in the second and third row of the adjacent image. To avoid confusion, number in consecutive places are placed in alternating vertical and horizontal form, with the units place in vertical form, as shown in the bottom row on the right.\nIn Rod numerals, zeroes are represented by a space, which serves both as a number and a place holder value. Unlike in Arabic numerals, there is no specific symbol to represent zero. In the adjacent image, the number zero is merely represented with a space.\n\nSong mathematicians used red to represent positive numbers and black for negative numbers. However, another way is to add a slash to the last place to show that the number is negative.\n\nThe Mathematical Treatise of Sunzi used decimal fraction metrology. The unit of length was 1 \"chi\",\n\n1 \"chi\"=10\"cun\",1\"cun\"=10\"fen\",1\"fen\"=10\"li\",1\"li\"=10\"hao\",1\"hou\"=10\"hu\".\n\n1 \"chi\"2\"cun\"3\"fen\"4\"li\"5\"hao\"6\"shi\"7\"hu\" is laid out on counting board as\n\nwhere is the unit measurement \"chi\".\n\nSouthern Song dynasty mathematicial Qin Jiushao extended the use of decimal fraction beyond metrology. In his book Shu shu Jiuzhang\n\nhe formally expressed 1.1446154 day as\n\nHe marked the unit with a word “日”(day) underneath it。\n\nRod calculus works on the principle of addition. Unlike Arabic numerals, digits represented by counting rods have additive properties. The process of addition involves mechanically moving the rods without the need of memorising an addition table. This is the biggest difference with Arabic numerals, as one cannot mechanically put 1 and 2 together to form 3, or 2 and 3 together to form 5.\n\nThe adjacent image presents the steps in adding 3748 to 289:\n\nThe rods in the augend change throughout the addition, while the rods in the addend at the bottom \"disappear\".\n\nIn situation in which no borrowing is needed, one only needs to take the number of rods in the subtrahend from the minuend. The result of the calculation is the difference. The adjacent image shows the steps in subtracting 23 from 54.\n\nIn situations in which borrowing is needed such as 4231-789, one need use a more complicated procedure. The steps for this example are shown on the left.\n\n\"Sunzi Suanjing\" described in detail the algorithm of multiplication. On the left are the steps to calculate 38×76:\n\nThe animation on the left shows the steps for calculating .\n\nThe Sunzi algorithm for division was transmitted in toto by al Khwarizmi to Islamic country from Indian sources in 825AD. Al Khwarizmi's book was translated into Latin in the 13th century, The Sunzi division algorithm later evolved into Galley division in Europe. The division algorithm in Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi's 925AD book \"Kitab al-Fusul fi al-Hisab al-Hindi\" and in 11th century Kushyar ibn Labban's Principles of Hindu Reckoning were identical to Sunzu's division algorithm.\n\nIf there is a remainder in a place value decimal rod calculus division, both the remainder and the divisor must be left in place with one on top of another. In Liu Hui's notes to Jiuzhang suanshu (2nd century BCE), the number on top is called \"shi\" (实), while the one at bottom is called \"fa\" (法). In \"Sunzi Suanjing\", the number on top is called \"zi\" (子) or \"fenzi\" (lit., son of fraction), and the one on the bottom is called \"mu\" (母) or \"fenmu\" (lit., mother of fraction). Fenzi and Fenmu are also the modern Chinese name for numerator and denominator, respectively. As shown on the right, 1 is the numerator remainder, 7 is the denominator divisor, formed a fraction . The quotient of the division is 44 + .\nLiu Hui's used a lot of calculations with fraction in Haidao Suanjing.\n\nThis form of fraction with numerator on top and denominator at bottom without a horizontal bar in between, was transmitted to Arabic country in an 825AD book by al Khwarizmi via India, and in use by 10th century Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi and 15th century Jamshīd al-Kāshī's work \"Arithematic Key\".\n\n\n\n3 × 5\n\nThe algorithm for finding the highest common factor of two numbers and reduction of\nfraction was laid out in Jiuzhang suanshu.\nThe highest common factor is found by successive division with remainders until\nthe last two remainders are identical.\nThe animation on the right illustrates the algorithm for finding the highest common factor of and reduction of a fraction.\n\nIn this case the hcf is 25.\n\nDivide the numerator and denominator by 25. The reduced fraction is .\n\nCalendarist and mathematician He Chengtian () used fraction interpolation method, called \"harmonisation of the divisor of the day\" to obtain a better approximate value than the old one by iteratively adding the numerators and denominators a \"weaker\" fraction with a \"stronger fraction\".

{"id": "5308894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5308894", "title": "Space (mathematics)", "text": "Space (mathematics)\n\nIn mathematics, a space is a set (sometimes called a universe) with some added structure.\n\nWhile modern mathematics uses many types of spaces, such as Euclidean spaces, linear spaces, topological spaces, Hilbert spaces, or probability spaces, it does not define the notion of \"space\" itself.\n\nA space consists of selected mathematical objects that are treated as points, and selected relationships between these points. \nThe nature of the points can vary widely: for example, the points can be elements of a set, functions on another space, or subspaces of another space. It is the relationships that define the nature of the space. More precisely, isomorphic spaces are considered identical, where an isomorphism between two spaces is a one-to-one correspondence between their points that preserves the relationships. For example, the relationships between the points of a three-dimensional Euclidean space are uniquely determined by Euclid's axioms, and all three-dimensional Euclidean spaces are considered identical.\n\nTopological notions such as continuity have natural definitions in every Euclidean space. \nHowever, topology does not distinguish straight lines from curved lines, and the relation between Euclidean and topological spaces is thus \"forgetful\". Relations of this kind are sketched in Figure 1, and treated in more detail in the Section \"Types of spaces\". \n\nIt is not always clear whether a given mathematical object should be considered as a geometric \"space\", or an algebraic \"structure\". A general definition of \"structure\", proposed by Bourbaki, embraces all common types of spaces, provides a general definition of isomorphism, and justifies the transfer of properties between isomorphic structures.\n\nIn ancient Greek mathematics, \"space\" was a geometric abstraction of the three-dimensional reality observed in everyday life. About 300 BC, Euclid gave axioms for the properties of space. Euclid built all of mathematics on these geometric foundations, going so far as to define numbers by comparing the lengths of line segments to the length of a chosen reference segment.\n\nThe method of coordinates (analytic geometry) was adopted by René Descartes in 1637. At that time, geometric theorems were treated as absolute objective truths knowable through intuition and reason, similar to objects of natural science; and axioms were treated as obvious implications of definitions.\n\nTwo equivalence relations between geometric figures were used: congruence and similarity. Translations, rotations and reflections transform a figure into congruent figures; homotheties — into similar figures. For example, all circles are mutually similar, but ellipses are not similar to circles. A third equivalence relation, introduced by Gaspard Monge in 1795, occurs in projective geometry: not only ellipses, but also parabolas and hyperbolas, turn into circles under appropriate projective transformations; they all are projectively equivalent figures.\n\nThe relation between the two geometries, Euclidean and projective, shows that mathematical objects are not given to us \"with their structure\". Rather, each mathematical theory describes its objects by \"some\" of their properties, precisely those that are put as axioms at the foundations of the theory.\n\nDistances and angles cannot appear in theorems of projective geometry, since these notions are neither mentioned in the axioms of projective geometry nor defined from the notions mentioned there. The question \"what is the sum of the three angles of a triangle\" is meaningful in Euclidean geometry but meaningless in projective geometry.\n\nA different situation appeared in the 19th century: in some geometries the sum of the three angles of a triangle is well-defined but different from the classical value (180 degrees). Non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry, introduced by Nikolai Lobachevsky in 1829 and János Bolyai in 1832 (and Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1816, unpublished) stated that the sum depends on the triangle and is always less than 180 degrees. Eugenio Beltrami in 1868 and Felix Klein in 1871 obtained Euclidean \"models\" of the non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry, and thereby completely justified this theory as a logical possibility.\n\nThis discovery forced the abandonment of the pretensions to the absolute truth of Euclidean geometry. It showed that axioms are not \"obvious\", nor \"implications of definitions\". Rather, they are hypotheses. To what extent do they correspond to an experimental reality? This important physical problem no longer has anything to do with mathematics. Even if a \"geometry\" does not correspond to an experimental reality, its theorems remain no less \"mathematical truths\".\n\nA Euclidean model of a non-Euclidean geometry is a choice of some objects existing in Euclidean space and some relations between these objects that satisfy all axioms (and therefore, all theorems) of the non-Euclidean geometry. These Euclidean objects and relations \"play\" the non-Euclidean geometry like contemporary actors playing an ancient performance. Actors can imitate a situation that never occurred in reality. Relations between the actors on the stage imitate relations between the characters in the play. Likewise, the chosen relations between the chosen objects of the Euclidean model imitate the non-Euclidean relations. It shows that relations between objects are essential in mathematics, while the nature of the objects is not.\n\nThe word \"geometry\" (from Ancient Greek: geo- \"earth\", -metron \"measurement\") initially meant a practical way of processing lengths, regions and volumes in the space in which we live, but was then extended widely (as well as the notion of space in question here).\n\nAccording to Bourbaki, the period between 1795 (\"Géométrie descriptive\" of Monge) and 1872 (the \"Erlangen programme\" of Klein) can be called the golden age of geometry. The original space investigated by Euclid is now called three-dimensional Euclidean space. Its axiomatization, started by Euclid 23 centuries ago, was reformed with Hilbert's axioms, Tarski's axioms and Birkhoff's axioms. These axiom systems describe the space via primitive notions (such as \"point\", \"between\", \"congruent\") constrained by a number of axioms.\n\nAnalytic geometry made great progress and succeeded in replacing theorems of classical geometry with computations via invariants of transformation groups. Since that time, new theorems of classical geometry have been of more interest to amateurs than to professional mathematicians. However, the heritage of classical geometry was not lost. According to Bourbaki, \"passed over in its role as an autonomous and living science, classical geometry is thus transfigured into a universal language of contemporary mathematics\".\n\nSimultaneously, numbers began to displace geometry as the foundation of mathematics. For instance, in Richard Dedekind's 1872 essay \"Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen\" (\"Continuity and irrational numbers\"), he asserts that points on a line ought to have the properties of Dedekind cuts, and that therefore a line was the same thing as the set of real numbers. Dedekind is careful to note that this is an assumption that is incapable of being proven. In modern treatments, Dedekind's assertion is often taken to be the definition of a line, thereby reducing geometry to arithmetic. Three-dimensional Euclidean space is defined to be an affine space whose associated vector space of differences of its elements is equipped with an inner product. A definition \"from scratch\", as in Euclid, is now not often used, since it does not reveal the relation of this space to other spaces. Also, a three-dimensional projective space is now defined as the space of all one-dimensional subspaces (that is, straight lines through the origin) of a four-dimensional vector space. This shift in foundations requires a new set of axioms, and if these axioms are adopted, the classical axioms of geometry become theorems.\n\nA space now consists of selected mathematical objects (for instance, functions on another space, or subspaces of another space, or just elements of a set) treated as points, and selected relationships between these points. Therefore, spaces are just mathematical structures of convenience. One may expect that the structures called \"spaces\" are perceived more geometrically than other mathematical objects, but this is not always true.\n\nAccording to the famous inaugural lecture given by Bernhard Riemann in 1854, every mathematical object parametrized by \"n\" real numbers may be treated as a point of the \"n\"-dimensional space of all such objects. Contemporary mathematicians follow this idea routinely and find it extremely suggestive to use the terminology of classical geometry nearly everywhere.\n\nFunctions are important mathematical objects. Usually they form infinite-dimensional function spaces, as noted already by Riemann and elaborated in the 20th century by functional analysis.\n\nWhile each type of spaces has its own definition, the general idea of \"space\" evades formalization. Some structures are called spaces, other are not, without a formal criterion. Moreover, there is no consensus on the general idea of \"structure\".\nAccording to Pudlák, \"Mathematics [...] cannot be explained completely by a single concept such as the mathematical structure. Nevertheless, Bourbaki's structuralist approach is the best that we have.\"\nWe will return to Bourbaki's structuralist approach in the last section \"Spaces and structures\", while we now outline a possible classification of spaces (and structures) in the spirit of Bourbaki.\n\nWe classify spaces on three levels. Given that each mathematical theory describes its objects by some of their properties, the first question to ask is: which properties? This leads to the first (upper) classification level. On the second level, one takes into account answers to especially important questions (among the questions that make sense according to the first level). On the third level of classification, one takes into account answers to all possible questions.\n\nFor example, the \"upper-level classification\" distinguishes between Euclidean and projective spaces, since the distance between two points is defined in Euclidean spaces but undefined in projective spaces. \nAnother example. The question \"what is the sum of the three angles of a triangle\" makes sense in a Euclidean space but not in a projective space. In a non-Euclidean space the question makes sense but is answered differently, which is not an upper-level distinction.\n\nAlso, the distinction between a Euclidean plane and a Euclidean 3-dimensional space is not an upper-level distinction; the question \"what is the dimension\" makes sense in both cases.\n\nThe \"second-level classification\" distinguishes, for example, between Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces; between finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional spaces; between compact and non-compact spaces, etc.\nIn Bourbaki's terms, the second-level classification is the classification by \"species\". Unlike biological taxonomy, a space may belong to several species.\n\nThe \"third-level classification\" distinguishes, for example, between spaces of different dimension, but does not distinguish between a plane of a three-dimensional Euclidean space, treated as a two-dimensional Euclidean space, and the set of all pairs of real numbers, also treated as a two-dimensional Euclidean space. Likewise it does not distinguish between different Euclidean models of the same non-Euclidean space.\nMore formally, the third level classifies spaces up to isomorphism. An isomorphism between two spaces is defined as a one-to-one correspondence between the points of the first space and the points of the second space, that preserves all relations stipulated according to the first level. Mutually isomorphic spaces are thought of as copies of a single space. If one of them belongs to a given species then they all do.\n\nThe notion of isomorphism sheds light on the upper-level classification. Given a one-to-one correspondence between two spaces of the same upper-level class, one may ask whether it is an isomorphism or not. This question makes no sense for two spaces of different classes.\n\nAn isomorphism to itself is called an automorphism. Automorphisms of a Euclidean space are shifts, rotations, reflections and compositions of these. Euclidean space is homogeneous in the sense that every point can be transformed into every other point by some automorphism.\n\nEuclidean axioms leave no freedom; they determine uniquely all geometric properties of the space. More exactly: all three-dimensional Euclidean spaces are mutually isomorphic. In this sense we have \"the\" three-dimensional Euclidean space. In Bourbaki's terms, the corresponding theory is \"univalent\". In contrast, topological spaces are generally non-isomorphic; their theory is \"multivalent\". A similar idea occurs in mathematical logic: a theory is called categorical if all its models of the same cardinality are mutually isomorphic. According to Bourbaki, the study of multivalent theories is the most striking feature which distinguishes modern mathematics from classical mathematics.\n\nTopological notions (continuity, convergence, open sets, closed sets etc.) are defined naturally in every Euclidean space. In other words, every Euclidean space is also a topological space. Every isomorphism between two Euclidean spaces is also an isomorphism between the corresponding topological spaces (called \"homeomorphism\"), but the converse is wrong: a homeomorphism may distort distances. In Bourbaki's terms, \"topological space\" is an \"underlying\" structure of the \"Euclidean space\" structure. Similar ideas occur in category theory: the category of Euclidean spaces is a concrete category over the category of topological spaces; the forgetful (or \"stripping\") functor maps the former category to the latter category.\n\nA three-dimensional Euclidean space is a special case of a Euclidean space. In Bourbaki's terms, the species of three-dimensional Euclidean space is \"richer\" than the species of Euclidean space. Likewise, the species of compact topological space is richer than the species of topological space.\n\nSuch relations between species of spaces may be expressed diagrammatically as shown in Fig. 3. An arrow from A to B means that every is also a or may be treated as a or provides a etc. Treating A and B as classes of spaces one may interpret the arrow as a transition from A to B. (In Bourbaki's terms, \"procedure of deduction\" of a from a Not quite a function unless the classes A,B are sets; this nuance does not invalidate the following.) The two arrows on Fig. 3 are not invertible, but for different reasons. \n\nThe transition from \"Euclidean\" to \"topological\" is forgetful. Topology distinguishes continuous from discontinuous, but does not distinguish rectilinear from curvilinear. Intuition tells us that the Euclidean structure cannot be restored from the topology. A proof uses an automorphism of the topological space (that is, self-homeomorphism) that is not an automorphism of the Euclidean space (that is, not a composition of shifts, rotations and reflections). Such transformation turns the given Euclidean structure into a (isomorphic but) different Euclidean structure; both Euclidean structures correspond to a single topological structure.\n\nIn contrast, the transition from \"3-dim Euclidean\" to \"Euclidean\" is not forgetful; a Euclidean space need not be 3-dimensional, but if it happens to be 3-dimensional, it is full-fledged, no structure is lost. In other words, the latter transition is injective (one-to-one), while the former transition is not injective (many-to-one). We denote injective transitions by an arrow with a barbed tail, \"↣\" rather than \"→\".\n\nBoth transitions are not surjective, that is, not every B-space results from some A-space. First, a 3-dim Euclidean space is a special (not general) case of a Euclidean space. Second, a topology of a Euclidean space is a special case of topology (for instance, it must be non-compact, and connected, etc). We denote surjective transitions by a two-headed arrow, \"↠\" rather than \"→\". See for example Fig. 4; there, the arrow from \"real linear topological\" to \"real linear\" is two-headed, since every real linear space admits some (at least one) topology compatible with its linear structure.\n\nSuch topology is non-unique in general, but unique when the real linear space is finite-dimensional. For these spaces the transition is both injective and surjective, that is, bijective; see the arrow from \"finite-dim real linear topological\" to \"finite-dim real linear\" on Fig. 4. The inverse transition exists (and could be shown by a second, backward arrow). The two species of structures are thus equivalent. In practice, one makes no distinction between equivalent species of structures. Equivalent structures may be treated as a single structure, as shown by a large box on Fig. 4.\n\nThe transitions denoted by the arrows obey isomorphisms. That is, two isomorphic lead to two isomorphic .\n\nThe diagram on Fig. 4 is commutative. That is, all directed paths in the diagram with the same start and endpoints lead to the same result. Other diagrams below are also commutative, except for dashed arrows on Fig. 9. The arrow from \"topological\" to \"measurable\" is dashed for the reason explained there: \"In order to turn a topological space into a measurable space one endows it with a σ-algebra. The σ-algebra of Borel sets is the most popular, but not the only choice.\" A solid arrow denotes a prevalent, so-called \"canonical\" transition that suggests itself naturally and is widely used, often implicitly, by default. For example, speaking about a continuous function on a Euclidean space, one need not specify its topology explicitly. In fact, alternative topologies exist and are used sometimes, for example, the fine topology; but these are always specified explicitly, since they are much less notable that the prevalent topology. A dashed arrow indicates that several transitions are in use and no one is quite prevalent.\n\nTwo basic spaces are linear spaces (also called vector spaces) and topological spaces.\n\nLinear spaces are of algebraic nature; there are real linear spaces (over the field of real numbers),\ncomplex linear spaces (over the field of complex numbers), and more generally, linear spaces over any field. Every complex linear space is also a real linear space (the latter \"underlies\" the former), since each real number is also a complex number.\nMore generally, a vector space over a field also has the structure of a vector space over a subfield of that field.\nLinear operations, given in a linear space by definition, lead to such notions as straight lines (and planes, and other linear subspaces); parallel lines; ellipses (and ellipsoids). However, it is impossible to define \northogonal (perpendicular) lines, or to single out circles among ellipses, because in a linear space \nthere is no structure like a scalar product that could be used for measuring angles. The dimension of a linear space is defined as the maximal number of linearly independent vectors or, equivalently, as the minimal number of vectors that span the space; it may be finite or infinite. Two linear spaces over the same field are isomorphic if and only if they are of the same dimension. A complex linear space is also a real linear space.\n\nTopological spaces are of analytic nature. Open sets, given in a topological space by definition, lead to such notions as continuous functions, paths, maps; convergent sequences, limits; interior, boundary, exterior. However, uniform continuity, bounded sets, Cauchy sequences, differentiable functions (paths, maps) remain undefined. Isomorphisms between topological spaces are traditionally called homeomorphisms; these are one-to-one correspondences continuous in both directions. The open interval (0,1) is homeomorphic to the whole real line (-∞,∞) but not homeomorphic to the closed interval [0,1], nor to a circle. The surface of a cube is homeomorphic to a sphere (the surface of a ball) but not homeomorphic to a torus. Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are not homeomorphic, which seems evident, but is not easy to prove. The dimension of a topological space is difficult to define; inductive dimension (based on the observation that the dimension of the boundary of a geometric figure is usually one less than the dimension of the figure itself) and Lebesgue covering dimension can be used. In the case of a Euclidean space, both topological dimensions are equal to \"n\".\n\nEvery subset of a topological space is itself a topological space (in contrast, only \"linear\" subsets of a linear space are linear spaces). Arbitrary topological spaces, investigated by general topology (called also point-set topology) are too diverse for a complete classification up to homeomorphism. Compact topological spaces are an important class of topological spaces (\"species\" of this \"type\"). Every continuous function is bounded on such space. The closed interval [0,1] and the extended real line [-∞,∞] are compact; the open interval (0,1) and the line (-∞,∞) are not. Geometric topology investigates manifolds (another \"species\" of this \"type\"); these are topological spaces locally homeomorphic to Euclidean spaces (and satisfying a few extra conditions). Low-dimensional manifolds are completely classified up to homeomorphism.\n\nBoth the linear and topological structures underly the linear topological space (in other words, topological vector space) structure. A linear topological space is both a real or complex linear space and a topological space, such that the linear operations are continuous. So a linear space that is also topological is not in general a linear topological space. \n\nEvery finite-dimensional real or complex linear space is a linear topological space in the sense that it carries one and only one topology that makes it a linear topological space. The two structures, \"finite-dimensional real or complex linear space\" and \"finite-dimensional linear topological space\", are thus equivalent, that is, mutually underlying. Accordingly, every invertible linear transformation of a finite-dimensional linear topological space is a homeomorphism. The three notions of dimension (one algebraic and two topological) agree for finite-dimensional real linear spaces. In infinite-dimensional spaces, however, different topologies can conform to a given linear structure, and invertible linear transformations are generally not homeomorphisms.\n\nIt is convenient to introduce affine and projective spaces by means of linear spaces, as follows. A linear subspace of a linear space, being itself a linear space, is not homogeneous; it contains a special point, the origin. Shifting it by a vector external to it, one obtains a affine subspace. It is homogeneous. An affine space need not be included into a linear space, but is isomorphic to an affine subspace of a linear space. All affine spaces are mutually isomorphic. In the words of John Baez, \"an affine space is a vector space that's forgotten its origin\". In particular, every linear space is also an affine space.\n\nGiven an affine subspace \"A\" in a linear space \"L\", a straight line in \"A\" may be defined as the intersection of \"A\" with a linear subspace of \"L\" that intersects \"A\": in other words, with a plane through the origin that is not parallel to \"A\". More generally, a affine subspace of \"A\" is the intersection of \"A\" with a linear subspace of \"L\" that intersects \"A\".\n\nEvery point of the affine subspace \"A\" is the intersection of \"A\" with a linear subspace of \"L\". However, some subspaces of \"L\" are parallel to \"A\"; in some sense, they intersect \"A\" at infinity. The set of all linear subspaces of a linear space is, by definition, a projective space. And the affine subspace \"A\" is embedded into the projective space as a proper subset. However, the projective space itself is homogeneous. A straight line in the projective space corresponds to a linear subspace of the (n+1)-dimensional linear space. More generally, a projective subspace of the projective space corresponds to a linear subspace of the (n+1)-dimensional linear space, and is isomorphic to the projective space.\n\nDefined this way, affine and projective spaces are of algebraic nature; they can be real, complex, and more generally, over any field.\n\nEvery real or complex affine or projective space is also a topological space. An affine space is a non-compact manifold; a projective space is a compact manifold. In a real projective space a straight line is homeomorphic to a circle, therefore compact, in contrast to a straight line in a linear of affine space.\n\nDistances between points are defined in a metric space. Isomorphisms between metric spaces are called isometries. Every metric space is also a topological space. A topological space is called metrizable, if it underlies a metric space. All manifolds are metrizable.\n\nIn a metric space, we can define \nbounded sets and Cauchy sequences. A metric space is called complete if all Cauchy sequences converge. Every incomplete space is isometrically embedded, as a dense subset, into a complete space (the completion). Every compact metric space is complete; the real line is non-compact but complete; the open interval (0,1) is incomplete. \n\nEvery Euclidean space is also a complete metric space. Moreover, all geometric notions immanent to a Euclidean space can be characterized in terms of its metric. For example, the straight segment connecting two given points \"A\" and \"C\" consists of all points \"B\" such that the distance between \"A\" and \"C\" is equal to the sum of two distances, between \"A\" and \"B\" and between \"B\" and \"C\".\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension (related to the number of small balls that cover the given set) applies to metric spaces, and can be non-integer (especially for fractals). For a Euclidean space, the Hausdorff dimension is equal to \"n\".\n\nUniform spaces do not introduce distances, but still allow one to use uniform continuity, Cauchy sequences (or filters or nets), completeness and completion. Every uniform space is also a topological space. Every \"linear\" topological space (metrizable or not) is also a uniform space, and is complete in finite dimension but generally incomplete in infinite dimension. More generally, every commutative topological group is also a uniform space. A non-commutative topological group, however, carries two uniform structures, one left-invariant, the other right-invariant.\n\nVectors in a Euclidean space form a linear space, but each vector formula_1 has also a length, in other words, norm, formula_2. A real or complex linear space endowed with a norm is a normed space. Every normed space is both a linear topological space and a metric space. A Banach space is a complete normed space. Many spaces of sequences or functions are infinite-dimensional Banach spaces.\n\nThe set of all vectors of norm less than one is called the unit ball of a normed space. It is a convex, centrally symmetric set, generally not an ellipsoid; for example, it may be a polygon (in the plane) or. more generally, a polytope (in arbitrary finite dimension). The parallelogram law (called also parallelogram identity) \ngenerally fails in normed spaces, but holds for vectors in Euclidean spaces, which follows from the fact that the squared Euclidean norm of a vector is its inner product with itself, formula_4.\n\nAn inner product space is a real or complex linear space, endowed with a bilinear or respectively sesquilinear form, satisfying some conditions and called an inner product. Every inner product space is also a normed space. A normed space underlies an inner product space if and only if it satisfies the parallelogram law, or equivalently, if its unit ball is an ellipsoid. Angles between vectors are defined in inner product spaces. A Hilbert space is defined as a complete inner product space. (Some authors insist that it must be complex, others admit also real Hilbert spaces.) Many spaces of sequences or functions are infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Hilbert spaces are very important for quantum theory.\n\nAll real inner product spaces are mutually isomorphic. One may say that the Euclidean space is the real inner product space that forgot its origin.\n\nSmooth manifolds are not called \"spaces\", but could be. Every smooth manifold is a topological manifold, and can be embedded into a finite-dimensional linear space. Smooth surfaces in a finite-dimensional linear space are smooth manifolds: for example, the surface of an ellipsoid is a smooth manifold, a polytope is not. Real or complex finite-dimensional linear, affine and projective spaces are also smooth manifolds.\n\nAt each one of its points, a smooth path in a smooth manifold has a tangent vector that belongs to the manifold's tangent space at this point. Tangent spaces to an smooth manifold are linear spaces. The differential of a smooth function on a smooth manifold provides a linear functional on the tangent space at each point. \n\nA Riemannian manifold, or Riemann space, is a smooth manifold whose tangent spaces are endowed with inner products satisfying some conditions. Euclidean spaces are also Riemann spaces. Smooth surfaces in Euclidean spaces are Riemann spaces. A hyperbolic space is also a Riemann space. A curve in a Riemann space has a length, and the length of the shortest curve between two points defines a distance, such that the Riemann space is a metric space. The angle between two curves intersecting at a point is the angle between their tangent lines.\n\nWaiving positivity of inner products on tangent spaces, one obtains pseudo-Riemann spaces, including the Lorentzian spaces that are very important for general relativity.\n\nWaiving distances and angles while retaining volumes (of geometric bodies) one reaches measure theory. Besides the volume, a measure generalizes the notions of area, length, mass (or charge) distribution, and also probability distribution, according to Andrey Kolmogorov's approach to probability theory.\n\nA \"geometric body\" of classical mathematics is much more regular than just a set of points. The boundary of the body is of zero volume. Thus, the volume of the body is the volume of its interior, and the interior can be exhausted by an infinite sequence of cubes. In contrast, the boundary of an arbitrary set of points can be of non-zero volume (an example: the set of all rational points inside a given cube). Measure theory succeeded in extending the notion of volume to a vast class of sets, the so-called measurable sets. Indeed, non-measurable sets almost never occur in applications.\n\nMeasurable sets, given in a measurable space by definition, lead to measurable functions and maps. In order to turn a topological space into a measurable space one endows it with a The of Borel sets is the most popular, but not the only choice. (Baire sets, universally measurable sets, etc, are also used sometimes.) \nThe topology is not uniquely determined by the Borel for example, the norm topology and the weak topology on a separable Hilbert space lead to the same Borel .\nNot every is the Borel of some topology.\nActually, a can be generated by a given collection of sets (or functions) irrespective of any topology. Every subset of a measurable space is itself a measurable space.\n\nStandard measurable spaces (also called standard Borel spaces) are especially useful due to some similarity to compact spaces (see EoM). Every bijective measurable mapping between standard measurable spaces is an isomorphism; that is, the inverse mapping is also measurable. And a mapping between such spaces is measurable if and only if its graph is measurable in the product space. Similarly, every bijective continuous mapping between compact metric spaces is a homeomorphism; that is, the inverse mapping is also continuous. And a mapping between such spaces is continuous if and only if its graph is closed in the product space.\n\nEvery Borel set in a Euclidean space (and more generally, in a complete separable metric space), endowed with the Borel is a standard measurable space. All uncountable standard measurable spaces are mutually isomorphic.\n\nA measure space is a measurable space endowed with a measure. A Euclidean space with the Lebesgue measure is a measure space. Integration theory defines integrability and integrals of measurable functions on a measure space.\n\nSets of measure 0, called null sets, are negligible. Accordingly, a \"mod 0 isomorphism\" is defined as isomorphism between subsets of full measure (that is, with negligible complement).\n\nA probability space is a measure space such that the measure of the whole space is equal to 1. The product of any family (finite or not) of probability spaces is a probability space. In contrast, for measure spaces in general, only the product of finitely many spaces is defined. Accordingly, there are many infinite-dimensional probability measures (especially, Gaussian measures), but no infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measures.\n\nStandard probability spaces are especially useful. On a standard probability space a conditional expectation may be treated as the integral over the conditional measure (regular conditional probabilities, see also disintegration of measure). Given two standard probability spaces, every homomorphism of their measure algebras is induced by some measure preserving map. Every probability measure on a standard measurable space leads to a standard probability space. The product of a sequence (finite or not) of standard probability spaces is a standard probability space. All non-atomic standard probability spaces are mutually isomorphic mod 0; one of them is the interval (0,1) with the Lebesgue measure.\n\nThese spaces are less geometric. In particular, the idea of dimension, applicable (in one form or another) to all other spaces, does not apply to measurable, measure and probability spaces.\n\nThe theoretical study of calculus, known as mathematical analysis, led in the early 20th century to the consideration of linear spaces of real-valued or complex-valued functions. The earliest examples of these were function spaces, each one adapted to its own class of problems. These examples shared many common features, and these features were soon abstracted into Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, and more general topological vector spaces. These were a powerful toolkit for the solution of a wide range of mathematical problems.\n\nThe most detailed information was carried by a class of spaces called Banach algebras. These are Banach spaces together with a continuous multiplication operation. An important early example was the Banach algebra of essentially bounded measurable functions on a measure space \"X\". This set of functions is a Banach space under pointwise addition and scalar multiplication. With the operation of pointwise multiplication, it becomes a special type of Banach space, one now called a commutative von Neumann algebra. Pointwise multiplication determines a representation of this algebra on the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on \"X\". An early observation of John von Neumann was that this correspondence also worked in reverse: Given some mild technical hypotheses, a commutative von Neumann algebra together with a representation on a Hilbert space determines a measure space, and these two constructions (of a von Neumann algebra plus a representation and of a measure space) are mutually inverse.\n\nVon Neumann then proposed that non-commutative von Neumann algebras should have geometric meaning, just as commutative von Neumann algebras do. Together with Francis Murray, he produced a classification of von Neumann algebras. The direct integral construction shows how to break any von Neumann algebra into a collection of simpler algebras called \"factors\". Von Neumann and Murray classified factors into three types. Type I was nearly identical to the commutative case. Types II and III exhibited new phenomena. A type II von Neumann algebra determined a geometry with the peculiar feature that the dimension could be any non-negative real number, not just an integer. Type III algebras were those that were neither types I nor II, and after several decades of effort, these were proven to be closely related to type II factors.\n\nA slightly different approach to the geometry of function spaces developed at the same time as von Neumann and Murray's work on the classification of factors. This approach is the theory of Here, the motivating example is the formula_5, where \"X\" is a locally compact Hausdorff topological space. By definition, this is the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on \"X\" that vanish at infinity (which loosely means that the farther you go from a chosen point, the closer the function gets to zero) with the operations of pointwise addition and multiplication. The Gelfand–Naimark theorem implied that there is a correspondence between commutative and geometric objects: Every commutative is of the form formula_5 for some locally compact Hausdorff space \"X\". Consequently it is possible to study locally compact Hausdorff spaces purely in terms of commutative Non-commutative geometry takes this as inspiration for the study of non-commutative If there were such a thing as a \"non-commutative space \"X\",\" then its formula_5 would be a non-commutative ; if in addition the Gelfand–Naimark theorem applied to these non-existent objects, then spaces (commutative or not) would be the same as so, for lack of a direct approach to the definition of a non-commutative space, a non-commutative space is \"defined\" to be a non-commutative Many standard geometric tools can be restated in terms of and this gives geometrically-inspired techniques for studying non-commutative .\n\nBoth of these examples are now cases of a field called non-commutative geometry. The specific examples of von Neumann algebras and are known as non-commutative measure theory and non-commutative topology, respectively. Non-commutative geometry is not merely a pursuit of generality for its own sake and is not just a curiosity. Non-commutative spaces arise naturally, even inevitably, from some constructions. For example, consider the non-periodic Penrose tilings of the plane by kites and darts. It is a theorem that, in such a tiling, every finite patch of kites and darts appears infinitely often. As a consequence, there is no way to distinguish two Penrose tilings by looking at a finite portion. This makes it impossible to assign the set of all tilings a topology in the traditional sense. Despite this, the Penrose tilings determine a non-commutative and consequently they can be studied by the techniques of non-commutative geometry. Another example, and one of great interest within differential geometry, comes from foliations of manifolds. These are ways of splitting the manifold up into smaller-dimensional submanifolds called \"leaves\", each of which is locally parallel to others nearby. The set of all leaves can be made into a topological space. However, the example of an irrational rotation shows that this topological space can be inacessible to the techniques of classical measure theory. However, there is a non-commutative von Neumann algebra associated to the leaf space of a foliation, and once again, this gives an otherwise unintelligible space a good geometric structure.\n\nAlgebraic geometry studies the geometric properties of polynomial equations. Polynomials are a type of function defined from the basic arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. Because of this, they are closely tied to algebra. Algebraic geometry offers a way to apply geometric techniques to questions of pure algebra, and vice versa.\n\nPrior to the 1940s, algebraic geometry worked exclusively over the complex numbers, and the most fundamental variety was projective space. The geometry of projective space is closely related to the theory of perspective, and its algebra is described by homogeneous polynomials. All other varieties were defined as subsets of projective space. Projective varieties were subsets defined by a set of homogeneous polynomials. At each point of the projective variety, all the polynomials in the set were required to equal zero. The complement of the zero set of a linear polynomial is an affine space, and an affine variety was the intersection of a projective variety with an affine space.\n\nAndré Weil saw that geometric reasoning could sometimes be applied in number-theoretic situations where the spaces in question might be discrete or even finite. In pursuit of this idea, Weil rewrote the foundations of algebraic geometry, both freeing algebraic geometry from its reliance on complex numbers and introducing \"abstract algebraic varieties\" which were not embedded in projective space. These are now simply called \"varieties\".\n\nThe type of space that underlies most modern algebraic geometry is even more general than Weil's abstract algebraic varieties. It was introduced by Alexander Grothendieck and is called a scheme. One of the motivations for scheme theory is that polynomials are unusually structured among functions, and algebraic varieties are consequently rigid. This presents problems when attempting to study degenerate situations. For example, almost any pair of points on a circle determines a unique line called the secant line, and as the two points move around the circle, the secant line varies continuously. However, when the two points collide, the secant line degenerates to a tangent line. The tangent line is unique, but the geometry of this configuration—a single point on a circle—is not expressive enough to determine a unique line. Studying situations like this requires a theory capable of assigning extra data to degenerate situations.\n\nOne of the building blocks of a scheme is a topological space. Topological spaces have continuous functions, but continuous functions are too general to reflect the underlying algebraic structure of interest. The other ingredient in a scheme, therefore, is a sheaf on the topological space, called the \"structure sheaf\". On each open subset of the topological space, the sheaf specifies a collection of functions, called \"regular functions\". The topological space and the structure sheaf together are required to satisfy conditions that mean the functions come from algebraic operations.\n\nLike manifolds, schemes are defined as spaces that are locally modeled on a familiar space. In the case of manifolds, the familiar space is Euclidean space. For a scheme, the local models are called affine schemes. Affine schemes provide a direct link between algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. The fundamental objects of study in commutative algebra are commutative rings. If formula_8 is a commutative ring, then there is a corresponding affine scheme formula_9 which translates the algebraic structure of formula_8 into geometry. Conversely, every affine scheme determines a commutative ring, namely, the ring of global sections of its structure sheaf. These two operations are mutually inverse, so affine schemes provide a new language with which to study questions in commutative algebra. By definition, every point in a scheme has an open neighborhood which is an affine scheme.\n\nThere are many schemes that are not affine. In particular, projective spaces satisfy a condition called properness which is analogous to compactness. Affine schemes cannot be proper (except in trivial situations like when the scheme has only a single point), and hence no projective space is an affine scheme (except for zero-dimensional projective spaces). Projective schemes, meaning those that arise as closed subschemes of a projective space, are the single most important family of schemes.\n\nSeveral generalizations of schemes have been introduced. Michael Artin defined an algebraic space as the quotient of a scheme by the equivalence relations that define étale morphisms. Algebraic spaces retain many of the useful properties of schemes while simultaneously being more flexible. For instance, the Keel–Mori theorem can be used to show that many moduli spaces are algebraic spaces.\n\nMore general than an algebraic space is a Deligne–Mumford stack. DM stacks are similar to schemes, but they permit singularities that cannot be described solely in terms of polynomials. They play the same role for schemes that orbifolds do for manifolds. For example, the quotient of the affine plane by a finite group of rotations around the origin yields a Deligne–Mumford stack that is not a scheme or an algebraic space. Away from the origin, the quotient by the group action identifies finite sets of equally spaced points on a circle. But at the origin, the circle consists of only a single point, the origin itself, and the group action fixes this point. In the quotient DM stack, however, this point comes with the extra data of being a quotient. This kind of refined structure is useful in the theory of moduli spaces, and in fact, it was originally introduced to describe moduli of algebraic curves.\n\nA further generalization are the algebraic stacks, also called Artin stacks. DM stacks are limited to quotients by finite group actions. While this suffices for many problems in moduli theory, it is too restrictive for others, and Artin stacks permit more general quotients.\n\nIn Grothendieck's work on the Weil conjectures, he introduced a new type of topology now called a Grothendieck topology. A topological space (in the ordinary sense) axiomatizes the notion of \"nearness,\" making two points be nearby if and only if they lie in many of the same open sets. By contrast, a Grothendieck topology axiomatizes the notion of \"covering\". A covering of a space is a collection of subspaces that jointly contain all the information of the ambient space. Since sheaves are defined in terms of coverings, a Grothendieck topology can also be seen as an axiomatization of the theory of sheaves.\n\nGrothendieck's work on his topologies led him to the theory of topoi. In his memoir \"Récoltes et Semailles\", he called them his \"most vast conception\". A sheaf (either on a topological space or with respect to a Grothendieck topology) is used to express local data. The category of all sheaves carries all possible ways of expressing local data. Since topological spaces are constructed from points, which are themselves a kind of local data, the category of sheaves can therefore be used as a replacement for the original space. Grothendieck consequently defined a topos to be a category of sheaves and studied topoi as objects of interest in their own right. These are now called Grothendieck topoi.\n\nEvery topological space determines a topos, and vice versa. There are topological spaces where taking the associated topos loses information, but these are generally considered pathological. (A necessary and sufficient condition is that the topological space be a sober space.) Conversely, there are topoi whose associated topological spaces do not capture the original topos. But, far from being pathological, these topoi can be of great mathematical interest. For instance, Grothendieck's theory of étale cohomology (which eventually led to the proof of the Weil conjectures) can be phrased as cohomology in the étale topos of a scheme, and this topos does not come from a topological space.\n\nTopological spaces in fact lead to very special topoi called locales. The set of open subsets of a topological space determines a lattice. The axioms for a topological space cause these lattices to be complete Heyting algebras. The theory of locales takes this as its starting point. A locale is defined to be a complete Heyting algebra, and the elementary properties of topological spaces are re-expressed and reproved in these terms. The concept of a locale turns out to be more general than a topological space, in that every sober topological space determines a unique locale, but many interesting locales do not come from topological spaces. Because locales need not have points, the study of locales is somewhat jokingly called pointless topology.\n\nTopoi also display deep connections to mathematical logic. Every Grothendieck topos has a special sheaf called a subobject classifier. This subobject classifier functions like the set of all possible truth values. In the topos of sets, the subobject classifier is the set formula_11, corresponding to \"False\" and \"True\". But in other topoi, the subobject classifier can be much more complicated. Lawvere and Tierney recognized that axiomatizing the subobject classifier yielded a more general kind of topos, now known as an elementary topos, and that elementary topoi were models of intuitionistic logic. In addition to providing a powerful way to apply tools from logic to geometry, this made possible the use of geometric methods in logic.\n\nAccording to Kevin Carlson,\n\nNevertheless, a general definition of \"structure\" was proposed by Bourbaki; it embraces all types of spaces mentioned above, (nearly?) all types of mathematical structures used till now, and more. It provides a general definition of isomorphism, and justifies transfer of properties between isomorphic structures. However, it was never used actively in mathematical practice (not even in the mathematical treatises written by Bourbaki himself). Here are the last phrases from a review by Robert Reed of a book by Leo Corry:\n\nFor more information on mathematical structures see Wikipedia: mathematical structure, equivalent definitions of mathematical structures, and transport of structure.\n\nThe distinction between geometric \"spaces\" and algebraic \"structures\" is sometimes clear, sometimes elusive. Clearly, groups are algebraic, while Euclidean spaces are geometric. Modules over rings are as algebraic as groups. In particular, when the ring appears to be a field, the module appears to be a linear space; is it algebraic or geometric? In particular, when it is finite-dimensional, over real numbers, and endowed with inner product, it becomes Euclidean space; now geometric. The (algebraic?) field of real numbers is the same as the (geometric?) real line. Its algebraic closure, the (algebraic?) field of complex numbers, is the same as the (geometric?) complex plane. It is first of all \"a place we do analysis\" (rather than algebra or geometry).\n\nEvery space treated in Section \"Types of spaces\" above, except for \"Non-commutative geometry\", \"Schemes\" and \"Topoi\" subsections, is a set (the \"principal base set\" of the structure, according to Bourbaki) endowed with some additional structure; elements of the base set are usually called \"points\" of this space. In contrast, elements of (the base set of) an algebraic structure usually are not called \"points\".\n\nHowever, sometimes one uses more than one principal base set. For example, two-dimensional projective geometry may be formalized via two base sets, the set of points and the set of lines. Moreover, a striking feature of projective planes is the symmetry of the roles played by points and lines. A less geometric example: a graph may be formalized via two base sets, the set of vertices (called also nodes or points) and the set of edges (called also arcs or lines). Generally, finitely many principal base sets and finitely many auxiliary base sets are stipulated by Bourbaki.\n\nMany mathematical structures of geometric flavor treated in the \"Non-commutative geometry\", \"Schemes\" and \"Topoi\" subsections above do not stipulate a base set of points. For example, \"pointless topology\" (in other words, point-free topology, or locale theory) starts with a single base set whose elements imitate open sets in a topological space (but are not sets of points); see also mereotopology and point-free geometry.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30872676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30872676", "title": "Tally stick", "text": "Tally stick\n\nA tally stick (or simply tally) was an ancient memory aid device used to record and document numbers, quantities, or even messages. Tally sticks first appear as animal bones carved with notches during the Upper Paleolithic; a notable example is the Ishango Bone. Historical reference is made by Pliny the Elder (AD 23–79) about the best wood to use for tallies, and by Marco Polo (1254–1324) who mentions the use of the tally in China. Tallies have been used for numerous purposes such as messaging and scheduling, and especially in financial and legal transactions, \n\nPrincipally, there are two different kinds of tally sticks: the single tally and the split tally. A common form of the same kind of primitive counting device is seen in various kinds of prayer beads.\n\nA number of anthropological artefacts have been conjectured to be tally sticks:\n\n\nThe single tally stick was an elongated piece of bone, ivory, wood, or stone which is marked with a system of notches (see: Tally marks). The single tally stick serves predominantly mnemonic purposes. Related to the single tally concept are messenger sticks (e.g., Inuit tribes), the knotted cords, \"khipus\" or \"quipus\", as used by the Inca. Herodotus (c. 485–425 BC) reported the use of a knotted cord by Darius I of Persia (c. 521–486 BC).\n\nThe split tally was a technique which became common in medieval Europe, which was constantly short of money (coins) and predominantly illiterate, in order to record bilateral exchange and debts. A stick (squared hazelwood sticks were most common) was marked with a system of notches and then split lengthwise. This way the two halves both record the same notches and each party to the transaction received one half of the marked stick as proof. Later this technique was refined in various ways and became virtually tamper proof. One of the refinements was to make the two halves of the stick of different lengths. The longer part was called \"stock\" and was given to the party which had advanced money (or other items) to the receiver. The shorter portion of the stick was called \"foil\" and was given to the party which had received the funds or goods. Using this technique each of the parties had an identifiable record of the transaction. The natural irregularities in the surfaces of the tallies where they were split would mean that only the original two halves would fit back together perfectly, and so would verify that they were matching halves of the same transaction. If one party tried to unilaterally change the value of his half of the tally stick by adding more notches, the absence of those notches would be apparent on the other party's tally stick. The split tally was accepted as legal proof in medieval courts and the Napoleonic Code (1804) still makes reference to the tally stick in Article 1333. Along the Danube and in Switzerland the tally was still used in the 20th century in rural economies.\n\nThe most prominent and best recorded use of the split tally stick or \"nick-stick\" being used as a form of currency was when Henry I introduced the tally stick system in medieval England in around 1100. He would accept the tally stick only for taxes, and it was a tool of the Exchequer for the collection of taxes by local sheriffs (tax farmers \"farming the shire\") for seven centuries. The split tally of the Exchequer was in continuous use until 1826. In 1834 tally sticks representing six centuries worth of financial records were ordered to be burned in a stove in the Houses of Parliament. The resulting fire set the chimney ablaze and then spread until most of the building was destroyed. This event was described by Charles Dickens in an 1855 article on administrative reform.\n\nThe system of tally marks of the Exchequer is described in \"The Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer\" (see external links below) as follows:\n\nThe cuts were made the full width of the stick so that, after splitting, the portion kept by the issuer (the \"stock\") exactly matched the piece (the \"foil\") given as a receipt. Each stick had to have the details of the transaction written on it, in ink, to make it a valid record.\n\nRoyal tallies (debt of the Crown) also played a role in the formation of the Bank of England at the end of the 17th century. In 1697, the bank issued £1 million worth of stock in exchange for £800,000 worth of tallies at par and £200,000 in bank notes. This new stock was said to be \"engrafted\". The government promised not only to pay the Bank interest on the tallies subscribed but to redeem them over a period of years. The \"engrafted\" stock was then cancelled simultaneously with the redemption.\n\nTally sticks feature in the design of the entrance gates to The National Archives at Kew.\n\n\n\n\n"}
