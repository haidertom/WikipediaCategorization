{"id": "168387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168387", "title": "Business intelligence", "text": "Business intelligence\n\nBusiness intelligence (BI) comprises the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for the data analysis of business information. BI technologies provide historical, current and predictive views of business operations. Common functions of business intelligence technologies include reporting, online analytical processing, analytics, data mining, process mining, complex event processing, business performance management, benchmarking, text mining, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics. BI technologies can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help identify, develop and otherwise create new strategic business opportunities. They aim to allow for the easy interpretation of these big data. Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy based on insights can provide businesses with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability.\n\nBusiness intelligence can be used by enterprises to support a wide range of business decisions ranging from operational to strategic. Basic operating decisions include product positioning or pricing. Strategic business decisions involve priorities, goals and directions at the broadest level. In all cases, BI is most effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a company operates (external data) with data from company sources internal to the business such as financial and operations data (internal data). When combined, external and internal data can provide a complete picture which, in effect, creates an \"intelligence\" that cannot be derived from any singular set of data. Amongst myriad uses, business intelligence tools empower organizations to gain insight into new markets, to assess demand and suitability of products and services for different market segments and to gauge the impact of marketing efforts.\n\nOften BI applications use data gathered from a data warehouse (DW) or from a data mart, and the concepts of BI and DW combine as \"BI/DW\"\nor as \"BIDW\". A data warehouse contains a copy of analytical data that facilitate decision support.\n\nThe earliest known use of the term \"business intelligence\" is in Richard Millar Devens' \"Cyclopædia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes\" (1865). Devens used the term to describe how the banker Sir Henry Furnese gained profit by receiving and acting upon information about his environment, prior to his competitors:\nThe ability to collect and react accordingly based on the information retrieved, Devens says, is central to business intelligence.\n\nWhen Hans Peter Luhn, a researcher at IBM, used the term \"business intelligence\" in an article published in 1958, he employed the \"Webster's Dictionary\" definition of intelligence: \"the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way as to guide action towards a desired goal.\" Business intelligence as it is understood today is said to have evolved from the decision support systems (DSS) that began in the 1960s and developed throughout the mid-1980s. DSS originated in the computer-aided models created to assist with decision making and planning.\n\nIn 1989, Howard Dresner (later a Gartner analyst) proposed \"business intelligence\" as an umbrella term to describe \"concepts and methods to improve business decision making by using fact-based support systems.\" It was not until the late 1990s that this usage was widespread.\n\nCritics see BI merely as an evolution of business reporting together with the advent of increasingly powerful and easy-to-use data analysis tools. In this respect it has also been criticized as a marketing buzzword in the context of the \"big data\" surge.\n\nAccording to Forrester Research, business intelligence is \"a set of methodologies, processes, architectures, and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information used to enable more effective strategic, tactical, and operational insights and decision-making.\" Under this definition, business intelligence encompasses information management (data integration, data quality, data warehousing, master-data management, text- and content-analytics, et al.). Therefore, Forrester refers to \"data preparation\" and \"data usage\" as two separate but closely linked segments of the business-intelligence architectural stack.\n\nSome elements of business intelligence are:\n\n\nForrester distinguishes this from the \"business-intelligence market\", which is \"just the top layers of the BI architectural stack, such as reporting, analytics, and dashboards.\"\n\nThough the term business intelligence is sometimes a synonym for competitive intelligence (because they both support decision making), BI uses technologies, processes, and applications to analyze mostly internal, structured data and business processes while competitive intelligence gathers, analyzes and disseminates information with a topical focus on company competitors. If understood broadly, business intelligence can include the subset of competitive intelligence.\n\nBusiness intelligence and business analytics are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are alternate definitions. Thomas Davenport, professor of information technology and management at Babson College argues that business intelligence should be divided into querying, reporting, Online analytical processing (OLAP), an \"alerts\" tool, and business analytics. In this definition, business analytics is the subset of BI focusing on statistics, prediction, and optimization, rather than the reporting functionality.\n\nThe Business Intelligence landscape reflects the complex system which data goes through in order to get processed into information. One of the first steps of starting a BI program, is to understand all components of this landscape. The particularities of this system tend to differ based on the industry and organization, but at a macro level, all BI landscapes have the same format. It’s usually composed of five pillars and five foundation blocks:\n\nThe five pillars:\n\n\nThe five foundation blocks:\n\n\nBusiness operations can generate a very large amount of information in the form of e-mails, memos, notes from call-centers, news, user groups, chats, reports, web-pages, presentations, image-files, video-files, and marketing material. According to Merrill Lynch, more than 85% of all business information exists in these forms; a company might only use such a document a single time. Because of the way it is produced and stored, this information is either unstructured or semi-structured.\n\nThe management of semi-structured data is an unsolved problem in the information technology industry. According to projections from Gartner (2003), white collar workers spend 30–40% of their time searching, finding, and assessing unstructured data. BI uses both structured and unstructured data. The former is easy to search, and the latter contains a large quantity of the information needed for analysis and decision making. Because of the difficulty of properly searching, finding and assessing unstructured or semi-structured data, organizations may not draw upon these vast reservoirs of information, which could influence a particular decision, task or project. This can ultimately lead to poorly informed decision making.\n\nTherefore, when designing a business intelligence/DW-solution, the specific problems associated with semi-structured and unstructured data must be accommodated for as well as those for the structured data.\n\nUnstructured and semi-structured data have different meanings depending on their context. In the context of relational database systems, unstructured data cannot be stored in predictably ordered columns and rows. One type of unstructured data is typically stored in a BLOB (binary large object), a catch-all data type available in most relational database management systems. Unstructured data may also refer to irregularly or randomly repeated (nonrepetitive) column patterns that vary from row to row within each file or document.\n\nMany of these data types, however, like e-mails, word processing text files, PPTs, image-files, and video-files conform to a standard that offers the possibility of metadata. Metadata can include information such as author and time of creation, and this can be stored in a relational database.\nTherefore, it may be more accurate to talk about this as semi-structured documents or data, but no specific consensus seems to have been reached.\n\nUnstructured data can also simply be the knowledge that business users have about future business trends. Business forecasting naturally aligns with the BI system because business users think of their business in aggregate terms. Capturing the business knowledge that may only exist in the minds of business users provides some of the most important data points for a complete BI solution.\n\nThere are several challenges to developing BI with semi-structured data. According to Inmon & Nesavich, some of those are:\n\n\nTo solve problems with searchability and assessment of data, it is necessary to know something about the content. This can be done by adding context through the use of metadata. Many systems already capture some metadata (e.g. filename, author, size, etc.), but more useful would be metadata about the actual content – e.g. summaries, topics, people or companies mentioned. Two technologies designed for generating metadata about content are automatic categorization and information extraction.\n\nBusiness intelligence can be applied to the following business purposes:\n\n\nIn a 2013 report, Gartner categorized business intelligence vendors as either an independent \"pure-play\" vendor or a consolidated \"megavendor\". In 2012 business intelligence services received $13.1 billion in revenue.\n\nA 2009 paper predicted these developments in the business intelligence market:\n\n\nA 2009 \"Information Management\" special report predicted the top BI trends: \"green computing, social networking services, data visualization, mobile BI, predictive analytics, composite applications, cloud computing and multitouch\". Research undertaken in 2014 indicated that employees are more likely to have access to, and more likely to engage with, cloud-based BI tools than traditional tools.\n\nOther business intelligence trends include the following:\n\nOther lines of research include the combined study of business intelligence and uncertain data. In this context, the data used is not assumed to be precise, accurate and complete. Instead, data is considered uncertain and therefore this uncertainty is propagated to the results produced by BI.\n\nAccording to a study by the Aberdeen Group, there has been increasing interest in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business intelligence over the past years, with twice as many organizations using this deployment approach as one year ago – 15% in 2009 compared to 7% in 2008.\n\nAn article by InfoWorld's Chris Kanaracus points out similar growth data from research firm IDC, which predicts the SaaS BI market will grow 22 percent each year through 2013 thanks to increased product sophistication, strained IT budgets, and other factors.\n\nAn analysis of top 100 Business Intelligence and Analytics scores and ranks the firms based on several open variables\n\n"}
{"id": "157004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=157004", "title": "Business logic", "text": "Business logic\n\nIn computer software, business logic or domain logic is the part of the program that encodes the real-world business rules that determine how data can be created, stored, and changed. It is contrasted with the remainder of the software that might be concerned with lower-level details of managing a database or displaying the user interface, system infrastructure, or generally connecting various parts of the program.\n\nBusiness logic:\n\nBusiness rules:\n\nBusiness logic comprises:\n\nBusiness logic should be distinguished from business rules. Business logic is the portion of an enterprise system which determines how data is transformed or calculated, and how it is routed to people or software (workflow). Business rules are formal expressions of business policy. Anything that is a process or procedure is business logic, and anything that is neither a process nor a procedure is a business rule. Welcoming a new visitor is a process (workflow) consisting of steps to be taken, whereas saying every new visitor must be welcomed is a business rule. Further, business logic is procedural whereas business rules are declarative.\n\nFor example, an e-commerce website might allow visitors to add items to a shopping cart, specify a shipping address, and supply payment information. The business logic of the website might include a workflow such as:\n\nThere will be also business rules of the website:\n\nThe web site software also contains other code which is not considered part of business logic nor business rules:\n\nBusiness logic could be anywhere in a program. For example, given a certain format for an address, a database table could be created which has columns that correspond exactly to the fields specified in the business logic, and type checks added to make sure that no invalid data is added.\n\nBusiness logic often changes. For example, the set of allowable address formats might change when an online retailer starts shipping products to a new country. Thus it is often seen as desirable to make the code that implements the business logic relatively isolated, or loosely coupled. This makes it more likely that changes to business logic will require a small set of code changes, in only one part of the code. Distant but strongly coupled code also creates more of a risk that the programmer will only make some of the necessary changes and miss part of the system, leading to incorrect operation.\n\nA multitier architecture formalizes this decoupling by creating a business logic layer which is separate from other tiers or layers, such as the data access layer or service layer. Each layer \"knows\" only a minimal amount about the code in the other layers - just enough to accomplish necessary tasks. For example, in a model–view–controller paradigm, the controller and view layers, might be made as small as possible, with all the business logic concentrated in the model. In the e-commerce example, the controller determines the sequence of web pages in the checkout sequence, and is also responsible for validating that email, address, and payment information satisfy the business rules (rather than leaving any of that up to the database itself or lower-level database access code).\n\nAlternative paradigms are possible. For example, with relatively simple business entities, a generic view and controller could access database objects which themselves contain all the relevant business logic about what formats they accept and what changes are possible (known as the database model).\n\nSome tiered schemes use either a distinct application layer or a service layer, or consider the business logic layer to be the same as one of those.\n\nBusiness logic can be extracted from procedural code using a business rule management system (BRMS).\n\nThe business rules approach of software development uses BRMSs and enforces a very strong separation of business logic from other code. User interface management systems are another technology used to enforce a strong separation between business logic and other code. The magic pushbutton is considered an \"anti-pattern\": a technique that in this case creates undesirable constraints which make it difficult to code business logic in an easy-to-maintain way.\n\nA domain model is an abstract representation of the data storage types required by business rules.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "577440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=577440", "title": "Busy work", "text": "Busy work\n\nBusy work (also referred to as make-work and busywork) can refer to activity that is undertaken to pass time and stay busy but in and of itself has no actual value. Busy work also occurs in business, military and other settings, in situations where people may be required to be present but may lack the opportunities, skills or need to do something more productive. People may engage in busy work to maintain an appearance of activity, in order to avoid criticism of being inactive or idle. The Merriam Webster dictionary defines busywork as \"work that usually appears productive or of intrinsic value but actually only keeps one occupied.\" \n\nIn the context of education, busy work allows students to work independently, to test their own knowledge and skills, and to practice using new skills learned in the educational setting. It can consist of various types of schoolwork assigned by a teacher to keep students occupied with activities involving learning and cognition while the teacher focuses upon another group of students. The functionality of busy work is associated with levels of interest students have with the content of the work, levels of enjoyment students have in performing the work, how purposeful the work is, and how accomplishment of the work is perceived by students. The perceived results of the work by students is significant: when students feel that they've succeeded in accomplishing a functional task, it's congruent with learning and the attainment of new skills.\n\nBusy work can also be used to keep the students occupied with educational tasks during idle times, such as instances when time in school remains but the day's curriculum has already concluded. This application of busy work to consume idle time was common in primary education, but the need for work to have educational content, rather than existing just to consume time, is now preferred.\n\nBusy work has historical precedent in primary education. Conditioning students to believe that busy work carries the same value as progressive work can lead to students maintaining this belief later in life, carrying it through to the workplace.\n\nIn business and work settings, people may engage in busy work simply to appear like they're being busy and productive, with the primary goal of actually simply maintaining an \"appearance\" of activity in efforts to protect their employment status (to avoid termination or sanctions). Workers believe that it is more important to maintain a constant appearance of working urgently so that they and others believe that what is being done is important. Constant urgency in workers can lead to disproportionate distribution of actual work, as workers may put off important work by attempting to complete previously-designated less important work. Maintaining very high levels of constant busyness may actually be detrimental to the operations of a business or organization in which new tasks are not undertaken in a timely manner because workers are always very busy. That can also lead to workers taking shortcuts to accomplish tasks more quickly, which can negatively affect the quality of work results. Busy work also can be counterproductive in work settings because it may not be aligned with the overall objectives and priorities of an organization's plans for attaining and maintaining success in its ventures. The assumption that activity in the workplace is more important than productivity in the workplace can lead to employees thinking that quantity of work is better than quality of work, which is not productive to the overall functioning of a business.\n\nBusy work is used in armed forces to keep servicemembers from becoming bored, inactive and idle. Tasks of this sort include drill, memorizing regulations, getting haircuts, spit and polishing footwear and other cleaning chores such as scrubbing the deck.\n\n\n\n"}

They suggest that CoI can be formed from champions of innovation and their social network and that CoI are safe places for the creation and support of innovatory ideas. COI are groups made up of motivated individuals working together towards a common goal, not because of orders from their superiors, but because they are convinced of their common cause.\n\nSawhney and Prandelli (2000) proposed the model of Communities of Creation as a new governance mechanism for managing knowledge found in different companies for the purpose of innovation. Intellectual property rights are considered to be owned by the entire community although the community is governed by a central firm which acts as the sponsor and defines the ground rules for participation. This model lies between the closed hierarchical model and the open market-based model.\n\nThese are Communities that take total financial, administrative and operational control over the development of their communities. Democratically elected and answerable to the whole community. It is simply an extension of the community saving societies that have existed for centuries. The prime objective is sustainable environmental and social development controlled by the skills and finance available. It provides employment, improves the future prospects for all participants and their children, and injects a sense of pride and achievement. Using locally available materials linked to new environmentally friendly cost effective construction materials will produce affordable housing, schools and roads.\n\nTraditionally, the company is the most efficient mean of managing knowledge belonging to different people. The primary motivation is job security, career advancement and recognition. Lee and Cole (2003) argue for a community structure for knowledge creation that crosses firms’ boundaries. To substantiate their argument they put forth the case of how “thousands of talented volunteers, dispersed across organizational and geographical boundaries, collaborate via the Internet to produce a knowledge-intensive, innovative product of high quality,” the Linux kernel (Lee and Cole 2003, p. 633). The Linux community has proved to be a very efficient mean of managing knowledge belonging to different people. The primary motivation is value system, recognition and potential career advancement or hop. Lee and Cole (2003) argue that research on knowledge management has to date focused on hierarchy and therefore has not adequately addressed the mobilization of distributed knowledge, knowledge that is dispersed among many people. They note that, as illustrated by the Linux case, “the advent of the Internet and Web-based technologies has enabled specialized communities to convene, interact, and share resources extensively via electronic interfaces,” even across firms’ boundaries (Lee and Cole 2003, p. 633). People are able to contribute effectively outside their working hours. coordination of the work (including feedback) is possible even when people are working from different locations. The catchment area is therefore much larger and the critical mass of software engineers required to develop and maintain the Linux project was therefore achievable.\n\nSuccessful COIs increase innovations within an organization. They therefore have the potential to contribute to organizational ambidexterity, which refers to the organization’s dual capabilities of managing current business and being flexible and adaptable to meet future changes and demands.\n\nGoogle search on “Communities of Innovation” generated 66100 findings on 24 June 2012.\n\n\nContrast with:\n\n"}

Decisions have to be taken regarding the size, location, layout, manpower etc.\n\nIf the proposed endeavour gives promise of success and the promoter is willing to undertake the risk of forming the business, step must be taken to assemble various factors of production, such as land, labour, capital and managerial personnel. Assembly of resources involves making contracts for the purchase of these resources.promoters organise the resources to convert the idea into a reality by forming a company.\n\nThe promoter may enter into contracts with third parties in anticipation of the registration of a company; but after registration, the company must approve or confirm these contracts.\n\n"}

The modelling focused on a Petri net–based technique for business process modelling to which the Baan application units were to be linked. DEM also contains a supply-chain diagram tool for the logistic network of the company and of an enterprise function modelling diagram\".\n\nTo align a specific company with dynamic enterprise modeling, the organizational structure is blueprinted top-down from high-level business processes to low-level processes. This blueprint is used as a roadmap of the organization, that is compatible with the structural roadmap of the software package. Having both roadmaps, the software package and the organizational structure are alienable. The blueprint of an organizational structure in dynamic enterprise modeling is called a reference model. A reference model is the total view of visions, functions, organizational structures and processes, which together can be defined as a representative way of doing business in a certain organizational typology.\n\nThe DEM reference model consists of a set of underlying models that depict the organizational architecture in a top-down direction. The underlying models are:\n\n\nTogether these models are capable of depicting the total organizational structure and aspects that are necessary during the implementation of the dynamic enterprise modeling. The models can have differentiations, which are based on the typology of the organization (i.e.: engineer-to-order organizations require different model structures than assemble-to-order organizations. To elaborate on the way that the reference model is used to implement software and to keep track of the scope of implementation methods, the business control model and the business process model will be explained in detail.\n\nThe business control model exists of the business functions of the organization and their internal and external links. Basic features in the model are:\n\n\nNext to interaction between two business functions, interaction can also exist between objects that are not in the scope of the reference model. These objects can be external business functions and agents.\n\nAgents on the other hand are entities similar to business functions with the exception that they are external of the business (i.e.: customers and suppliers).\nSubroutines of processes can be modeled in the Business Control Model to take care of possible exceptions that can occur during the execution of a process (i.e.: delay handling in the delivery of goods).\n\nIn addition to business functions that consist of the main processes of the organization, management functions exist.\n\nHaving this reference, the main processes of the organization can be captured in the Business Control Model. The main functions of the organization are grouped in the business functions, which consist of the processes that are part of the specific business function. Interactions between the business functions are then depicted using the request-feedback loops.\n\nA business control model is constructed according to a set path.\n\nAfter creating the main business functions within the business control model, the several business functions are detailed out.\n\nAfter high-level detail definitions, the business functions are decomposed to lower-level detail definitions to make the business control model alienable to the lower models within the reference model, for this practice, mainly the Business Process Model. In the Business Process Model the processes are elaborated until the lowest level of detail. Given this level of detail, the Baan software functionality is then projected on the processes, depicted in the Business Process Model.\n\nThe modeling of processes in DEM, modeling the business process model is done using \"Petri net building blocks\". DEM uses 4 construction elements:\n\n\nThese 4 construction elements enables the modeling of DEM models. The modeling is due to a set collection of modeling constraints, guiding the modeling process in order to have similarly created models by different modelers. Control activities exist in different structures in order to set different possible routes for process flows. The used structures for control activities are:\n\nOR means one of the two starting job tokens can be used or both, XOR means only one of the tokens can be used to create the output job token.\n\nThe example below demonstrates the modeling of the concept of marriage and divorce using Petri net building blocks. \n\nUsing an embedded method brings the power that the method is designed to implement the software product that the method comes with. This suggests a less complicated usage of the method and more support possibilities.\nThe negative aspect of an embedded method obviously is that it can only be used for specific product software. Engineers and consultants, operating with several software products, could have more use of a general method, to have just one way of working.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2390801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2390801", "title": "Enrolled agent", "text": "Enrolled agent\n\nEnrolled agent (or EA) is a tax advisor who is a federally authorized tax practitioner empowered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Enrolled agents represent taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax issues including audits, collections and appeals.\n\nEnrolled agent status is the highest credential awarded by the IRS. The EA credential is recognized across all 50 U.S. states. Attorneys and certified public accountants (CPAs) are licensed on a state by state basis, and are also empowered by the Department of the Treasury to represent taxpayers before the IRS. According to the National Association of Enrolled Agents, there are approximately 53,000 practicing EAs in the United States.\n\nThe position of enrolled agent was created as a reaction to fraudulent war loss claims in the wake of the American Civil War with roots tracing back to the General Deficiency Act of July 7, 1884, or General Deficiency Appropriation Bill (H.R. 2735), also known as the \"Horse Act of 1884\", which was signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur on July 7, 1884. After the Civil War, many citizens faced difficulties in settling claims with the government for property confiscated for use in the war effort. As a result, Congress endowed enrolled agents with the power of advocacy to prepare claims against the government. From 1884 through the early 20th century, this statute remained largely unchanged.\n\nWhen the Revenue Act of 1913 was passed, signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on October 3, 1913, the scope of the enrolled agent was expanded to include claims for monetary relief for citizens whose taxes had become inequitable. As income, estate, gift and other sources of tax collections became more complex, the role of the enrolled agent increased to include the preparation of the many tax forms that were required. As a result of this complexity, audits became more prevalent and the enrolled agent role evolved into taxpayer representation, promulgating a series of statutes which were combined into a single Treasury Department Circular in February 19, 1921, known as Circular 230, to address \"the laws and regulations governing the recognition of agents, attorneys, and other persons representing claimants before the Treasury Department and offices thereof.\"\n\nTo become an enrolled agent, an applicant must obtain a PTIN and achieve passing scores on all three parts of the Special Enrollment Examination, which covers many aspects of the Internal Revenue Code, or must have worked at the IRS for five consecutive years in a position which regularly engaged in applying and interpreting the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations relating to income, estate, gift, employment, or excise taxes. A background check, including a review of the applicant’s personal and business tax compliance, is conducted after an applicant files Form 23, \"Application for Enrollment to Practice Before the Internal Revenue Service\", within one year of completing all three parts of the examination.\n\nTo qualify for renewal as an enrolled agent, an individual must complete 72 hours of continuing professional education (CPE) every three years, including two hours of ethics or professional conduct in each of the three years. To prevent overloading of CPEs in any year of an enrollment cycle, the IRS requires a minimum of 16 hours of CPE every year. \n\nIndividuals must renew their PTIN between October 16 and December 31 of each year.\n\nIndividuals must file Form 8554, \"Application for Renewal of Enrollment to Practice Before the Internal Revenue Service\", within the applicable renewal period.\n\nRenewal periods are based on the last digit of an enrolled agent's Social Security number (SSN) or tax identification number:\nIndividuals admitted to practice at any time during an enrollment cycle, \"the three successive enrollment years preceding the effective date of renewal,\" must complete two hours of continuing professional education for each month of enrollment, including two hours of ethics or professional conduct in each year. If an individual receives initial enrollment between November 1 and April 1 of their applicable renewal period, they will not be required to renew until the expiration of the first full three-year enrollment cycle following their initial enrollment.\n\nAn individual who has not filed a timely application for renewal, who has not made a timely response to the notice of noncompliance, or who has not satisfied the requirements of eligibility for renewal, will be placed on a roster of inactive enrolled individuals. During this time, the individual will be ineligible to practice before the Internal Revenue Service and may not state or imply that they are eligible to represent taxpayers, use the term enrolled agent, or use the EA designation.\n\nThe right to practice before the Internal Revenue Service is regulated by Federal statute, and persons authorized to practice are known as \"Federally Authorized Tax Practitioners\", or \"FATPs\". The FATP status is granted to attorneys, certified public accountants, and enrolled agents, each having unlimited representation rights before the Internal Revenue Service. These practitioners may represent their clients on any matters including audits, collection actions, payment issues, tax refund matters, and appeals. FATP status is also granted with limited representation rights to enrolled actuaries, enrolled retirement plan agents, and registered tax return preparers.\n\nEnrolled agents, like other FATPs, are subject to a set of procedures and regulations described in Treasury Department Circular No. 230,\" Regulations Governing the Practice of Attorneys, Certified Public Accountants, Enrolled Agents, Enrolled Actuaries, and Appraisers before the Internal Revenue Service\".\n\nWhen practicing before the Internal Revenue Service, enrolled agents may not use the term \"certified\" in describing their professional designation. An enrolled agent admitted to practice before the Internal Revenue Service may not state or imply that an employer/employee relationship exists between the enrolled agent and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nEnrolled agent status does not authorize the enrollee to practice before the United States Tax Court or in any other court.\n\nPractice in U.S. Tax Court is limited to members of the Bar of the Court. The Internal Revenue Code states, \"No qualified person shall be denied admission to practice before the Tax Court because of his failure to be a member of any profession or calling.\" Non-attorneys must pass a Tax Court exam for admission to the Bar of the Court. Attorneys are admitted to the Bar of the Tax Court without having to take the Tax Court examination. Practice in other federal courts is generally limited to persons licensed as attorneys.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33162688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33162688", "title": "Ethics in business communication", "text": "Ethics in business communication\n\nEthical issues of business communication is the process by which individuals exchange information between other individuals or groups of people. Throughout the process, effective communicators try as clearly and accurately to convey their thoughts, intentions and, objectives to their receiver. Communication is successful only when both the sender and the receiver understand the same information. In today's business environments, effective communication skills are necessary due to the highly informational and technological era.\n\nRegardless of context, communication involves choice, reflects values, and has consequences. For better communication, understanding the obvious and the subtle issues relating to communication is necessary. Any company that aims to be socially and ethically responsible must make a priority of ethical communication both inside the company and in its interactions with the public. In theory, many consumers prefer to do business with companies they believe are ethical which gives those ethical businesses an advantage in the market.\n\nSome of the vital characteristics of ethical communication are discussed below.\n\nWhile communicating with the audience, expressing the desired message to them in a significant manner is of primary importance. For instance, the employees in a company can be asked to increase their efficiency in a demanding manner whereas managers and executives will feel offended if the same tone is used on them. There are different ways to explain the exact things to them in a much smoother manner.\nMaintaining the same wavelength with the audience is very important for a communicator to ensure the audiences feel at home. Experienced communicators immediately build a relationship based on trust with the audience as soon as they start speaking. Great orators such as Winston Churchill and Mahatma Gandhi always were able to maintain a relationship with their audience because they were masters at striking the same wavelength of the audience.\n\nIn the modern era, information is vital for all decisions. Hence, it is essential for any organization to be cautious when communicating with tvitalic. The related information should be absolute, and all crucial information must be conveyed appropriately. Purposely withholding crucial information might result in the public conceiving a bad image.\nIn order to ensure that this concept is successfully practiced and understood in an organization, a well-organized value system must be established throughout the organization by the top management. If an organization functions on the base of value systems common to both the top management and the employees, mutual respect between them will be present. A sound and healthy value system can make way for ethical communication.\n\nAny information that is to be passed on must be true and accurate. Communicating without checking the truth of the information can be highly dangerous for the organization. Identification of the source and testing the information is necessary before communicating it.\n\nThe work of an organizational communication professional consists in developing communication plans that seek to restore trust, not only in the organization but the leaders and in all the people who work for it, in verbally promoting ethical behaviors and generating spaces of communication that help support institutional values.\n\nIn this way, both managers and employees will be \"on the same page,\" employees will feel heard and respected and will treat customers in the same way. Also, this will generate more loyalty on the part of the client and, therefore, more business. In addition, a business that communicates internally with ethics will most likely project that image in the business community, will seek to maintain good relations with the government and its most successful businesses. Without the distractions and negative effects that can have the legal implications of running a business \" ethically debatable,\" the organization will be able to concentrate its efforts on its employees, its products, and its clients.\n"}
{"id": "541795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=541795", "title": "Foreign direct investment", "text": "Foreign direct investment\n\nA foreign direct investment (FDI) is an investment in the form of a controlling ownership in a business in one country by an entity based in another country. It is thus distinguished from a foreign portfolio investment by a notion of direct control.\n\nThe origin of the investment does not impact the definition, as an FDI: the investment may be made either \"inorganically\" by buying a company in the target country or \"organically\" by expanding the operations of an existing business in that country.\n\nBroadly, foreign direct investment includes \"mergers and acquisitions, building new facilities, reinvesting profits earned from overseas operations, and intra company loans\". In a narrow sense, foreign direct investment refers just to building new facility, and a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor. FDI is the sum of equity capital, long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments. FDI usually involves participation in management, joint-venture, transfer of technology and expertise. \"Stock\" of FDI is the \"net\" (i.e., outward FDI minus inward FDI) cumulative FDI for any given period. Direct investment excludes investment through purchase of shares.\n\nFDI, a subset of international factor movements, is characterized by controlling ownership of a business enterprise in one country by an entity based in another country. Foreign direct investment is distinguished from foreign portfolio investment, a passive investment in the securities of another country such as public stocks and bonds, by the element of \"control\". According to the \"Financial Times\", \"Standard definitions of control use the internationally agreed 10 percent threshold of voting shares, but this is a grey area as often a smaller block of shares will give control in widely held companies. Moreover, control of technology, management, even crucial inputs can confer de facto control.\"\n\nAccording to Grazia Ietto-Gillies (2012), prior to Stephen Hymer’s theory regarding direct investment in the 1960s, the reasons behind Foreign Direct Investment and Multinational Corporations were explained by neoclassical economics based on macro economic principles. These theories were based on the classical theory of trade in which the motive behind trade was a result of the difference in the costs of production of goods between two countries, focusing on the low cost of production as a motive for a firm’s foreign activity. For example, Joe S. Bain only explained the internationalization challenge through three main principles: absolute cost advantages, product differentiation advantages and economies of scale. Furthermore, the neoclassical theories were created under the assumption of the existence of perfect competition. Intrigued by the motivations behind large foreign investments made by corporations from the United States of America, Hymer developed a framework that went beyond the existing theories, explaining why this phenomenon occurred, since he considered that the previously mentioned theories could not explain foreign investment and its motivations.\n\nFacing the challenges of his predecessors, Hymer focused his theory on filling the gaps regarding international investment. The theory proposed by the author approaches international investment from a different and more firm-specific point of view. As opposed to traditional macroeconomics-based theories of investment, Hymer states that there is a difference between mere capital investment, otherwise known as portfolio investment, and direct investment. The difference between the two, which will become the cornerstone of his whole theoretical framework, is the issue of control, meaning that with direct investment firms are able to obtain a greater level of control than with portfolio investment. Furthermore, Hymer proceeds to criticize the neoclassical theories, stating that the theory of capital movements cannot explain international production. Moreover, he clarifies that FDI is not necessarily a movement of funds from a home country to a host country, and that it is concentrated on particular industries within many countries. In contrast, if interest rates were the main motive for international investment, FDI would include many industries within fewer countries.\n\nAnother observation made by Hymer went against what was maintained by the neoclassical theories: foreign direct investment is not limited to investment of excess profits abroad. In fact, foreign direct investment can be financed through loans obtained in the host country, payments in exchange for equity (patents, technology, machinery etc.), and other methods.\nThe main determinants of FDI is side as well as growth prospectus of the economy of the country when FDI is made. Hymer proposed some more determinants of FDI due to criticisms, along with assuming market and imperfections. These are as follows:\n\nHymer's importance in the field of International Business and Foreign Direct Investment stems from him being the first to theorize about the existence of Multinational Enterprises (MNE) and the reasons behind Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) beyond macroeconomic principles, his influence on later scholars and theories in International Business, such as the OLI (Ownership, Location and Internationalization) theory by John Dunning and Christos Pitelis which focuses more on transaction costs. Moreover, “the efficiency-value creation component of FDI and MNE activity was further strengthened by two other major scholarly developments in the 1990s: the resource-based (RBV) and evolutionary theories\" (Dunning & Pitelis, 2008)\n\nTypes of FDI\n\nThe foreign direct investor may acquire voting power of an enterprise in an economy through any of the following methods:\n\nForeign direct investment incentives may take the following forms:\n\nGovernmental Investment Promotion Agencies (IPAs) use various marketing strategies inspired by the private sector to try and attract inward FDI, including diaspora marketing.\n\nThe rapid growth of world population since 1950 has occurred mostly in developing countries. This growth has been matched by more rapid increases in gross domestic product, and thus income per capita has increased in most countries around the world since 1950.\n\nAn increase in FDI may be associated with improved economic growth due to the influx of capital and increased tax revenues for the host country. Host countries often try to channel FDI investment into new infrastructure and other projects to boost development. Greater competition from new companies can lead to productivity gains and greater efficiency in the host country and it has been suggested that the application of a foreign entity’s policies to a domestic subsidiary may improve corporate governance standards. Furthermore, foreign investment can result in the transfer of soft skills through training and job creation, the availability of more advanced technology for the domestic market and access to research and development resources. The local population may benefit from the employment opportunities created by new businesses. In many instances, the investing company is simply transferring its older production capacity and machines, which might still be appealing to the host country because of technological lags or under-development, in order to avoid competition against its own products by the host country/company.\n\nA 2010 meta-analysis of the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) on local firms in developing and transition countries suggests that foreign investment robustly increases local productivity growth.\n\nThe Commitment to Development Index ranks the \"development-friendliness\" of rich country investment policies.\n\nFDI in China, also known as RFDI (renminbi foreign direct investment), has increased considerably in the last decade, reaching $19.1 billion in the first six months of 2012, making China the largest recipient of foreign direct investment and topping the United States which had $17.4 billion of FDI. In 2013 the FDI flow into China was $24.1 billion, resulting in a 34.7% market share of FDI into the Asia-Pacific region. By contrast, FDI out of China in 2013 was $8.97 billion, 10.7% of the Asia-Pacific share.\n\nDuring the global financial crisis FDI fell by over one-third in 2009 but rebounded in 2010.\n\nFDI into the Chinese mainland maintained steady growth in 2015 despite the economic slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. FDI, which excludes investment in the financial sector, rose 6.4 percent year on year to $126.27 billion in 2015.\n\nDuring the first nine months of 2016, China reportedly surpassed the US to become the world’s largest assets acquirer, measured by the value of corporate takeovers. As part of the transition by Chinese investors from an interest in developing economies to high-income economies, Europe has become an important destination for Chinese outward FDI. In 2014 and 2015, the EU was estimated to be the largest market for Chinese acquisitions, in terms of value.\n\nThe rapid increase in Chinese takeovers of European companies has fueled concerns among political observers and policymakers over a wide range of issues. These issues include potential negative strategic implications for individual EU member states and the EU as a whole, links between the Chinese Communist Party and the investing enterprises, and the lack of reciprocity in terms of limited access for European investors to the Chinese market. \n\nSimilarly, concerns among low-income households within Australia have prompted several non formal inquiries into direct foreign investment activities from china. As a result numerous Australian political representatives have been investigated, Sam Dastyari has resigned as a result.\n\nForeign investment was introduced in 1991 under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), driven by then finance minister Manmohan Singh. As Singh subsequently became the prime minister, this has been one of his top political problems, even in the current times. India disallowed overseas corporate bodies (OCB) to invest in India. India imposes cap on equity holding by foreign investors in various sectors, current FDI in aviation and insurance sectors is limited to a maximum of 49%.\n\nStarting from a baseline of less than $1 billion in 1990, a 2012 UNCTAD survey projected India as the second most important FDI destination (after China) for transnational corporations during 2010–2012. As per the data, the sectors that attracted higher inflows were services, telecommunication, construction activities and computer software and hardware. Mauritius, Singapore, US and UK were among the leading sources of FDI. Based on UNCTAD data FDI flows were $10.4 billion, a drop of 43% from the first half of the last year.\n\nNine from 10 largest foreign companies investing in India(from April 2000- January 2011) are based in Mauritius . List of the ten largest foreign companies investing in India (from April 2000- January 2011) are as follows --\n\nIn 2015, India emerged as top FDI destination surpassing China and the US. India attracted FDI of $31 billion compared to $28 billion and $27 billion of China and the US respectively. India received $63 billion in FDI in 2015. India also allowed 100% FDI in many sectors during 2016.\n\nBroadly speaking, the United States has a fundamentally \"open economy\" and low barriers to FDI.\n\nU.S. FDI totaled $194 Billion in 2010. 84% of FDI in the United States in 2010 came from or through eight countries: Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Canada. A major source of investment is real estate; the foreign investment in this area totaled $92.2 billion in 2013, under various forms of purchase structures (considering the U.S. taxation and residency laws).\n\nA 2008 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco indicated that foreigners hold greater shares of their investment portfolios in the United States if their own countries have less developed financial markets, an effect whose magnitude decreases with income per capita. Countries with fewer capital controls and greater trade with the United States also invest more in U.S. equity and bond markets.\n\nWhite House data reported in 2011 found that a total of 5.7 million workers were employed at facilities highly dependent on foreign direct investors. Thus, about 13% of the American manufacturing workforce depended on such investments. The average pay of said jobs was found as around $70,000 per worker, over 30% higher than the average pay across the entire U.S. workforce.\n\nPresident Barack Obama said in 2012, \"In a global economy, the United States faces increasing competition for the jobs and industries of the future.

Supporters of the bill argued that increased foreign direct investment would help job creation in the United States.\n\nForeign direct investment by country and by industry are tracked by Statistics Canada.

Established in 1996, the Academy has expanded its training to thousands of managers from 58 countries and six continents at its campuses in Cambridge, MA and Brussels, Belgium. The Academy is the only CI-dedicated institution to be externally accredited by the International Association of Continuing Education and Training (IACET). It grants the Competitive Intelligence Professional (CIP) certification based on a 9-course program, including a course in ethics and a pioneering course in business war gaming. To be certified, managers must complete the required coursework and pass a certification exam. To accommodate managers whose main interest is in using CI tools and managers working as CI professionals, the Academy offers two levels of certification: a basic CIP-I, and an advanced CIP-II. The Academy is currently the largest training institute in its field.\n\nOn March, 2011, the board of the professional association in the field of competitive intelligence- SCIP (Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professionals) voted to adopt the Academy's CIP program as its official global certification program to help create standards in the field of strategic and competitive intelligence. The certification was renamed SCIP-CIP certificate conferred by ACI.\n\nThe history of the Academy tracks closely the history of the field of competitive intelligence which has risen in importance during the 1980s with the increase in global competitive pressures and the spread of Internet search engines which made information more accessible. In 1986, the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals (SCIP) was founded in Washington, DC to serve as the professional association for academics, practitioners and consultants in CI. During the next decade, organizations experimented in acquiring and using CI with little discipline and no consistent results. For example, as a survey by the Academy showed, one of CI's main objectives, avoiding strategic surprises, was not being accomplished in many large companies. Three early developers of the Society banded together to create a standard of training and performance in the field. They were: Leonard Fuld, whose book, \"Competitor Intelligence\", was the first best seller on the subject, Ben Gilad, whose book The Business Intelligence System created the benchmark for setting up a corporate CI function, and Jan Herring who was the founding director of the first competitive intelligence function created in 1982 at Motorola Corp. Together with the growth of SCIP, the creation of the Academy accelerated greatly the formalization and acceptance of CI functions and positions across global companies, with some estimating that 97% of Fortune 500 corporations today have at least one CI analyst in each of their larger business units.\n\nAs the field continued to evolve, several organizations in recent years have joined the Academy in offering training programs in competitive intelligence, mostly as an extension of other degree programs, among them Mercyhurst College Institute for Intelligence Studies in PA (an extension of a government intelligence program), Simmons College in MA (part of Library and Information studies), and the University of Denver in CO (part of a graduate degree in information management). Other programs include the Ecole de Guerre Economique in France and Institute for Competitive Intelligence in Germany. Entry level courses are also offered by the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals.\n\nThe functional distribution of the Academy's alumni body covers managers and professionals from competitive and market intelligence functions, marketing, market research, business development, strategic planning, research scientists and development engineers. Though the typical trainee is a manager at a Global Fortune 500 company, past participants included some unusual representatives from the Catholic Church, various governments' defense agencies, farmer cooperatives, national economic development boards, and a Cabinet Minister.\n\n\nThe Academy's advisory board includes executives from US-based Intel, Procter and Gamble, Genentech, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Microsoft, Fidelity and Wyeth corporations, as well as Europe-based Shell, Roche, TetraPak and Orange, and Mexico-based Cemex.\n\n1. http://www.scip.org/Publications/CIMagIssueDetail.cfm?ItemNumber=1988\n2.

As of 2000 it had a 26.4% share of worldwide CRS airline bookings.\n\nIn addition to airline reservations, the Galileo CRS is also used to book train travel, cruises, car rental, and hotel rooms.\n\nThe Galileo system was moved from Denver, Colorado, to the Worldspan datacenter in Atlanta, Georgia, on September 28, 2008, following the 2007 merger of Travelport and Worldspan (although they now share the same datacenter, they continue to be run as separate systems). \n\nGalileo is subject to the Capps II and its successor Secure Flight program for the selection of passengers with a risk profile.\n\nGalileo is a member of the International Air Transport Association, of the OpenTravel Alliance and of SITA.\n\nGalileo traces its roots back to 1971 when United Airlines created its first computerized central reservation system under the name Apollo. During the 1980s and early 1990s, a significant proportion of airline tickets were sold by travel agents. Flights by the airline owning the reservation system had preferential display on the computer screen. Due to the high market penetration of the Sabre and Apollo systems, owned by American Airlines and United Airlines, respectively, Worldspan and Galileo were created by other airline groups in an attempt to gain market share in the computer reservation system market and, by inference, the commercial airline market. Galileo was formed in 1987 by nine European carriers -- British Airways, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Alitalia, Swissair, Austrian Airlines, Olympic, Sabena, Air Portugal and Aer Lingus.\n\nIn response and to prevent possible government intervention, United Airlines spun off its Apollo reservation system, which was then controlled by Covia. Galileo International was born when Covia acquired Europe's Galileo and merged it with the Apollo system in 1992.\n\nThe Apollo reservation system was used by United Airlines until March 3, 2012, when it switched to SHARES, a system used by its former Continental Airlines subsidiary. Apollo is still used by Galileo International (now part of Travelport GDS) travel agency customers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Japan.\n\nGalileo UK was originally created from Travicom which was the world's first multi-access reservations system using the technology developed by Videcom. Travicom was a company launched by Videcom, British Airways, British Caledonian and CCL in 1976 which in 1988 became Galileo UK.\n\n\n\n"}

HP Cloud Service Automation orchestrates the provisioning and deployment of complex IT services such as of databases, middleware, and packaged applications (i.e., ERP, Exchange). The software speeds deployment of application-based services across hybrid cloud delivery platforms and traditional IT environments.\n\nThe software is part of a broad portfolio of HP enterprise management software products aimed at helping companies manage the lifecycle of deployment and usage of cloud computing, whether through public or private clouds, or both.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Information Technology Laboratory, “Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”\n\nMany organizations are adopting cloud computing because it allows them to access applications, resources and services over the Internet on an “as-needed” or “per usage” basis. This has some cost and agility advantages for the IT department. According to a January 2011 Unisys poll, nearly half of U.S. companies consider cloud computing as the top IT priority.\n\nWhile cloud computing can save IT departments money and increase flexibility, it does present some challenges. These challenges include extra effort and increased difficulty for the IT department because of the complexity associated with the deployment and ongoing management of cloud infrastructure and applications. Automation and proper management are important when IT departments deploy cloud computing services because of these challenges.\n\nAccording to International Data Corporation (IDC), the use of distributed server/workload automation tools can help lower capital and power and cooling costs by tracking and reclaiming virtual machines, making IT staff more efficient by standardizing and streamlining manual processes, and speed the process of provisioning IT resources by enabling business users the ability to self-provision predefined IT resource.\n\nThe function of HP Cloud Service Automation is to accelerate the speed of deployment of application-based services across a hybrid cloud delivery environment. Traditionally, IT staff were required to patch and update physical servers manually. Using HP Cloud Service Automation, IT organizations can update thousands of servers automatically.\n\nHP Cloud Service Automation allows IT departments to move and manage applications among in-house (private) cloud systems, external (public) clouds and traditional IT systems. HP Cloud Service Automation software is also designed to deliver unified security, governance and compliance across applications, as well as physical and virtual infrastructures. The software automates key IT processes so that there is one consistent approach to IT resource management.\n\nHP Cloud Service Automation also allows IT departments to dynamically monitor and provision server, storage and network elements as well as applications to meet the needs of current and upcoming workloads. In addition, the solution allows IT to automatically grow and shrink the allocated resources in order to meet quality of service targets.\n\nHP Cloud Service Automation Software is a component of HP VirtualSystem, a series of integrated server, storage, and networking infrastructures from HP for Citrix, HP-UX, Microsoft, and VMware virtual environments. HP VirtualSystem is part of the HP Converged Systems portfolio of system-based products that use Converged infrastructure for specific workloads. HP Cloud Service Automation Software is also included in HP CloudSystem, a cloud infrastructure from HP that combines storage, servers, networking and software for organizations to build complete private, public and hybrid Cloud computing environments.\n\nIn May 2013, HP packaged version 10 of HP Operations Orchestration, version 10 of HP Server Automation, version 10 of HP Database and Middleware Automation and HP Cloud Service Automation 3.2 into a single integrated package. HP Cloud Service Automation is also available as a standalone software solution.\n\nHP Cloud Service Automation works with HP Operations Orchestration and HP Server Automation to provide IT lifecycle automation. HP Operations Orchestration is an integrated set of software and services that helps to automate distributed systems and heterogeneous computing environments. User organizations use HP OO to link together separate applications to create a workflow across them. HP Server Automation is used to manage physical and virtual servers as a lifecycle management platform. According to HP, HP SA helps to reduce administrator-to-server ratio by up to 60%.\n\n"}

Since January 1991 more than 200 data sets have been published.\n\nThree data series are compiled from the raw survey data:\n\n\nThese three components are published as the percentage change over the previous month and as the absolute value with regard to the index reference data, 1 January 2005 = 100. Given the growing importance of the services sector in Germany, Ifo changed the business climate indicator in 2018 to rebase the index and include responses from the services sector in its calculations.\n\nOften the results are depicted in the form of a \"business-cycle clock\".\n\nEvery month approximately 7,000 survey participants from firms in manufacturing, construction, wholesaling and retailing are requested to assess their current business situation as well as their business outlook for the coming six months. The Ifo Business Climate has been released monthly by the Ifo Institute since 1972.\n\nThe firms are queried as to\n\n\nThe balance value of the current business situation is the difference in percentage shares of the responses \"good\" and \"poor\"; the balance value of the expectations is the difference in percentage shares of the responses \"more favorable\" and \"less favorable\". The business climate is a geometric mean of the balances of the business situation and the business expectations. To calculate the index value, the business climate the transformed balances are normalized to the average of the year 2015.\n\nAs an indicator of economic activity, the Business Climate Index is meant to supplement data from the official statistics, over which it has the advantage of being more frequently compiled and more rapidly accessible (GDP, for example, is only released quarterly and published with a delay of ca. two quarters, with the likelihood of subsequent revisions).\n\nThe particular importance of the Ifo Business Climate Index is forecasting turning points in economic growth. A cyclical turning point is reliably indicated following the \"three-times rule\", that is movement in a particular direction three months in succession.\n\nThe Index reached its lowest value in united Germany in March 2009 with 82.2 points. In December 2008 the \"business expectations\" component hit an all-time low of 76.9 points. The lowest level of the second component of the Index, \"business situation\", was at its lowest point in May 2009 with 82.5 points.\n\nThe all-time high of the Ifo Index was reached in December 2010 with 109.5 index points, surpassing the previous record high of 108.8 points in December 2006. In March 2006 the surveyed firms gave the best-ever appraisals of the business outlook, with an index value of 105.3.\n\n"}

Issue tracking systems are generally used in collaborative settings—especially in large or distributed collaborations—but can also be employed by individuals as part of a time management or personal productivity regime. These systems often encompass resource allocation, time accounting, priority management, and oversight workflow in addition to implementing a centralized issue registry. \n\nIn the institutional setting, issue tracking systems are commonly used in an organization's customer support call center to create, update, and resolve reported customer issues, or even issues reported by that organization's other employees. A support ticket should include vital information for the account involved and the issue encountered. An issue tracking system often also contains a knowledge base containing information on each customer, resolutions to common problems, and other such data. \n\nAn issue tracking system is similar to a \"bugtracker\", and often, a software company will sell both, and some bugtrackers are capable of being used as an issue tracking system, and vice versa. Consistent use of an issue or bug tracking system is considered one of the \"hallmarks of a good software team\". \nA ticket element, within an issue tracking system, is a running report on a particular problem, its status, and other relevant data. They are commonly created in a help desk or call center environment and almost always have a unique reference number, also known as a \"case\", \"issue\" or \"call log\" number which is used to allow the user or help staff to quickly locate, add to or communicate the status of the user's issue or request.\n\nThese tickets are so called because of their origin as small cards within a traditional wall mounted work planning system when this kind of support started. Operators or staff receiving a call or query from a user would fill out a small card with the user's details and a brief summary of the request and place it into a position (usually the last) in a column of \"pending slots\" for an appropriate engineer, so determining the staff member who would deal with the query and the priority of the request.\n\nThe shared conceptual foundation between issue tracking systems and bugtrackers is that a valid issue must be amenable to a decisive resolution (such as \"completed\", \"fixed\", or a group consensus that the issue is not worth solving, such as \"not a problem\" or \"won't fix\"); that each issue is unique (duplicate problem reports are in most cases promptly amalgamated into a single active issue or ticket); and—beyond the screening stage—that there is precisely one person assigned formal responsibility to move the issue forward (this formal baton will often bounce around many times as the issue evolves). In bugtrackers, issues are generally quality or feature related with respect to a codebase (which is inherently a project management setting) whereas in generalized issue tracking systems, the tickets are often service-related or relationship-based, with closer ties to customer relationship management (CRM) concerns. \n\nIssues can have several aspects to them. Each issue in the system may have an urgency value assigned to it, based on the overall importance of that issue. Low or zero urgency issues are minor and should be resolved as time permits.\nOther details of issues include the customer experiencing the issue (whether external or internal), date of submission, detailed descriptions of the problem being experienced, attempted solutions or work-arounds, and other relevant information. As previously noted, each issue maintains a history of each change.\n\nIssue-tracking systems fulfill different functions, in particular:\n\nAn example scenario is presented to demonstrate how a common issue tracking system would work:\n\n\nIf the problem is not fully resolved, the ticket will be reopened once the technician receives new information from the customer.\nA Run Book Automation process that implements best practices for these workflows and increases IT personnel effectiveness is becoming very common.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1982, and was listed under NASDAQ as FORMF, under the Pacific Stock Exchange as JTF, and the Toronto Stock Exchange as JFM.\n\nThe company was originally named Indigo Software and was solely a software consulting firm. Indigo Software did work for the Canadian Federal Government and IBM (as the maintainer of an IBM CAD software product); among other clients. One significant government project resulted in an electronic forms product being created: iFiller, iPrint, et al.\n\nWith Microsoft's release of Windows 3.11, Indigo Software did a major enhancement to the forms software and re-branded it JetForm. The JetForm forms product was very successful, and Indigo Software's consulting work also began to focus on work associated with the JetForm software. Given the popularity of the forms software, Indigo Software made a decision to rename the company JetForm.\n\nIts eponymous series of products directly competed against other electronic forms software, such as Delrina's PerForm, and FormFlow products.\n\nIn September, 1996, Symantec, which had bought Delrina the previous year, sold their Electronic Forms Division to JetForm. JetForm continued to develop the FormFlow series of products under its own name.\n\nAround this time, JetForm bought the naming rights to the Ottawa Baseball Stadium, naming it \"JetForm Park\".\n\nOn September 13, 2001, JetForm changed its name to Accelio. Accelio was acquired by Adobe Systems in February 2002. The electronic forms products were officially retired in 2004. Adobe marketed JetForm as Adobe Central Output Server , without any major changes. Adobe's successor for the JetForm technology was released June 7, 2007, as Adobe LiveCycle Enterprise Suite (ES), part of the Adobe LiveCycle suite. The product was renamed again in April 9, 2009 to Adobe Central / Central Pro Output Server and reached its end of Extended Support on June 30, 2016. \n\nJetForm Rises Again, In 2007 two of the original founders Tom Hicks, Wayne Hall and four of the core software developers of JetForm Central came together to build a new enterprise class document designer, merge engine, presentation and delivery system. The software is called DocOrigin (a play off the Origin of Documents). DocOrigin was first released in 2009 and in 2013 version 3.0 was released.\n\nJetForm Design allowed for routing and tracking in workflow systems, on-screen form creation, and access to SQL and ODBC-compliant databases. JetForm Filler was used for completing on-screen forms. JetForm also developed the XML form format \"XFA\", which was later adopted by Adobe into its PDF software.\n\nOne of the Indigo Forms software's innovations when it was introduced was its ability to have its forms installed into Laserjet font cartridges. This meant that the product only had to send forms data to the printer; since the form was already encoded in the font cartridge. Given the slow printer interfaces used at that time, this greatly reduced print times.\n\n"}
{"id": "2635682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2635682", "title": "Kata", "text": "Kata\n\nKata, a Japanese word, meaning , is a detailed choreographed pattern of movements made to be practiced alone, but are also practiced within groups and in unison when training. It is practiced as a way to memorize and perfect the movement being executed. There are many professions which use the term Kata, but Kata as a term is known generally by the Martial Arts world, and typically reserved for Japanese empty hand combat systems (Karate -meaning empty hand). Traditional Korean Karate, called (Tang Soo Do) uses the term Kata and some Tang Soo Do schools do not, which is brought on by the memory of the Japanese and Korean war, where in at that time traditional Korean Karate was introduced.\n\nKata are used in many traditional Japanese arts such as theatre forms like kabuki and schools of tea ceremony (\"chadō\"), but are most commonly known for the presence in the martial arts. Kata are used by most Japanese and Okinawan martial arts, such as aikido, judo, kendo, kempo, and karate.\n\nKata originally were teaching and training methods by which successful combat techniques were preserved and passed on. Practicing kata allowed a company of persons to engage in a struggle using a systematic approaches, rather by practicing in a repetitive manner the learner develops the ability to execute those techniques and movements in a natural, reflex-like manner. Systematic practice does not mean permanently rigid. The goal is to internalize the movements and techniques of a kata so they can be executed and adapted under different circumstances, without thought or hesitation. A novice’s actions will look uneven and difficult, while a master’s appear simple and smooth.\n\n\"Kata\" is a loanword in English, from the 1950s in reference to the judo kata due to Jigoro Kano, and from the 1970s also of karate kata; but the word has come to be used as a generic term for \"forms\" in martial arts in general, or even figuratively applied to other fields.\n\nIn Japanese martial arts practice, kata is often seen as an essential partner to \"randori\" training with one complementing the other. However, the actual type and frequency of kata versus \"randori\" training varies from art to art. In iaido, solo kata using the Japanese sword (katana) comprises almost all of the training. Whereas in judo, kata training is de-emphasized and usually only prepared for dan grading.\n\nIn kenjutsu, paired kata at the beginners level can appear to be stilted. At higher levels serious injury is prevented only by a high sensitivity of both participants to important concepts being taught and trained for. These include timing and distance, with the kata practiced at realistic speed. This adjustability of kata training is found in other Japanese arts with roles of attacker and defender often interchanging within the sequence.\nMany martial arts use kata for public demonstrations and in competitions, awarding points for such aspects of technique as style, balance, timing, and verisimilitude (appearance of being real).\n\nThe most popular image associated with kata is that of a karate practitioner performing a series of punches and kicks in the air. The kata are executed as a specified series of approximately 20 to 70 moves, generally with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. There are perhaps 100 kata across the various forms of karate, each with many minor variations. The number of moves in a kata may be referred to in the name of the kata, e.g., \"Gojū Shiho\", which means \"54 steps.\" The number of moves may also have links with Buddhist spirituality. The number 108 is significant in Buddhism & Hinduism, and kata with 54, 36, or 27 moves (divisors of 108) are common. The practitioner is generally counselled to visualize the enemy attacks, and his responses, as actually occurring, and \"karateka\" are often told to \"read\" a kata, to explain the imagined events. Kata can contain techniques beyond the superficially obvious ones. The study of the meaning of the movements is referred to as the bunkai, meaning analysis, of the kata.\n\nOne explanation of the use of kata is as a reference guide for a set of moves. Not to be used following that \"set\" pattern but to keep the movements \"filed\". After learning these kata, this set of learned skills can then be used in a sparring scenario (particularly without points). The main objective here is to try out different combinations of techniques in a safe, practice environment to ultimately find out how to defeat your opponent.\n\nRecently, with the spread of Extreme Martial arts or XMA, a style of kata called CMX kata has formed. These kata are performed in tournaments and include gymnastics related elements, such as backflips, cartwheels, and splits. These kata can also be performed with weapons such as the Bo staff.\n\nJudo has several kata, mostly created in the late 19th century by Kano Jigoro, the founder of judo. The judo kata involve two participants. Judo kata preserve a number of techniques that are not permitted in competition or in \"randori\", including punches, kicks, and the use of the katana and other weapons. The study of kata is usually begun typically at around the green belt level. The most commonly studied judo kata is Nage-no-kata, which consists of fifteen throwing techniques. The Katame-no-kata is composed of pinning techniques, chokes, and joint locks. Kime-no-kata is a long kata consisting of self-defense techniques against both unarmed attacks, and attacks with swords and knives.\n\nWhile the Japanese term is most well known in the English language, forms are by no means exclusive to Japan. They have been recorded in China as early as the Tang dynasty, and are referred to in Mandarin as \"taolu\".\n\nSouth and Southeast Asian martial arts incorporate both preset and freestyle forms. In silat these are referred to as \"jurus\" and \"tari\" respectively. Malay folklore credits the introduction of forms to the Buddhist monk Bodhidharma.\n\nIn such as taekwondo and Tang Soo Do, the word \"hyung\" or \"hyeong\" is usually employed, though in some cases other words are used. The International Taekwon-Do Federation uses the word \"tul\", while the World Taekwondo Federation uses the word \"poomsae\" or simply the English translations \"pattern\" or \"form.\" Taekwondo patterns have multiple variations including \"Palgwe\" and the more popular \"Taeguk\" forms used by the WTF. Forms are included in certain taekwondo competitions and are a key element of gradings.\n\nIn Sanskrit, forms are known either as \"yudhan\" (combat form) or \"pentra\" (tactical deployment). Other Asian martial arts refer to forms by various terms specific to their respective languages, such as the Burmese word \"aka\", the Vietnamese \"quyen\" and the Kashmiri \"khawankay\".\n\nIn the Historical European martial arts and their modern reconstructions, forms are referred to as plays, drills or flourishes.\n\nMore recently kata has come to be used in English in a more general or figurative sense, referring to any basic form, routine, or pattern of behavior that is practiced to various levels of mastery.\n\nIn Japanese language \"kata\" (though written as 方) is a frequently-used suffix meaning “way of doing,” with emphasis on the form and order of the process. Other meanings are “training method” and “formal exercise.” The goal of a painter’s practicing, for example, is to merge his consciousness with his brush; the potter’s with his clay; the garden designer’s with the materials of the garden. Once such mastery is achieved, the theory goes, the doing of a thing perfectly is as easy as thinking it.\n\nKata is a term used by some programmers in the Software Craftsmanship movement. Computer programmers who call themselves \"Software Craftsmen\" will write 'Kata' - small snippets of code that they write in one sitting, sometimes repeatedly, often daily, in order to build muscle memory and practise their craft.\n\nOne of the things that characterize an organization’s culture is its kata – its routines of thinking and practice. Edgar Schein suggests an organization's culture helps it cope with its environment, and one meaning of \"kata\" is, \"a way to keep two things in sync or harmony with one another.\" A task for leaders and managers is to create and maintain the organizational culture through consistent role modeling, teaching, and coaching, which is in many ways analogous to how kata are taught in the martial arts.\n\n"}

Most often, business entities are formed to sell a product or a service. There are many types of business entities defined in the legal systems of various countries. These include corporations, cooperatives, partnerships, sole traders, limited liability companies and other specifically permitted and labelled types of entities. The specific rules vary by country and by state or province. Some of these types are listed below, by country. For guidance, approximate equivalents in the company law of English-speaking countries are given in most cases, for example:\n\nHowever, the regulations governing particular types of entities, even those described as roughly equivalent, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. When creating or restructuring a business, the legal responsibilities will depend on the type of business entity chosen.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutch, French or German names may be used.\n\n\n\n\nThere are three main types of business entity in Brunei, namely sole proprietorship, partnership and company.\n\nA private company contains the term \"Sendirian Berhad\" or \"Sdn. Bhd.\" as part of its name where as for a public company \"Berhad\" or \"Bhd.\" is used.\n\n\n\nIn Canada entities can be incorporated under either federal or provincial (or territorial) law. Unlimited liability corporations can be formed in Alberta \"AULC\" and Nova Scotia \"NSULC\".\n\nThe word or expression \"Limited\", \"Limitée\", \"Incorporated\", \"Incorporée\", \"Corporation\" or \"Société par actions de régime fédéral\" or the corresponding abbreviation \"Ltd.\", \"Ltée\", \"Inc.\", \"Corp.\" or \"S.A.R.F.\" forms part of the name of every entity incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act (R.S., 1985, c. C-44). ≈ Ltd. or Plc (UK)\n\nAs an exception, entities registered prior to 1985 may continue to be designated \"Société commerciale canadienne\" or by the abbreviation \"S.C.C.\"\n\nUnder the Canada Cooperatives Act (1998, c. 1), a co-operative must have the word \"cooperative\", \"co-operative\", \"coop\", \"co-op\", \"coopérative\", \"united\" or \"pool\", or another grammatical form of any of those words, as part of its name.\n\nUnlike in many other Western countries, Canadian businesses generally only have one form of incorporation available. The aforementioned AULC and NSULC are generally not used as operating business structures, but are instead used to create favorable tax positions for either Americans investing in Canada or vice versa.\n\nRather, Canadian businesses are generally formed under one of the following structures:\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of legal person business entities:\n\n\nTypes of natural person business entities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn SE or SCE may be created by registration in any of the EU/EEA Member States, and is subject to the European Company Statute. It may relocate its registered office to any other EU/EEA Member State with minimal formalities.\n\n\nThe abbreviations are usually in Finnish, but Swedish names may also be used either as is or in combination with Finnish, e.g. \"Oy Yritys Ab\".\n\nIn the corporations of real estate law, the ownership or membership may be vested either in the real property or in a legal or natural person, depending on the corporation type. In many cases, the membership or ownership of such corporation is obligatory for a person or property that fulfils the legal requirements for membership or wishes to engage in certain activities.\n\nIn addition to native types, European Union types are implemented:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Hungary, business entities are mainly regulated by the Companies Act of 2006, the Companies Registration Act of 2006 and the new Civil Code of 2013. All companies are required to indicate their type in their name.\n\n\n\n\nSituation in Ireland is similar to United Kingdom below, though without the class \"Community Interest Company\". There were two forms of Company Limited by Guarantee, but only the form \"without a share capital\" is now used. Irish names may also be used, such as \"cpt\" (cuideachta phoibli theoranta) for plc, and \"Teo\" (Teoranta) for Ltd.\n\n\n\nBusiness corporations are referred to as \"kaisha\" (会社) and are formed under the Companies Act of 2005. There are currently (2015) 4 types and each of them has legal personality:\nPartnerships are referred to as \"kumiai\" (組合). Each of these 4 types has no legal personality though other corporations, which include \"kumiai\" in their name, have:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Any of these entities can be incorporated as a \"Capital Variable\" entity, in which case has to add the \" de C.V.\" sufix to its company name.

This form is a little bit specific and was created for companies that are domiciled registered in other countries and have its part in Montenegro.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies are registered on the Companies Register and with a regional Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\nThe Commercial Code establishes the following types of companies:\n\n\n\n\nThere are three main forms of business:\n\n(a) Sole Proprietorship\n(b) Partnership\n(c) Company\n\n\nIn a sole proprietorship, an individual on his/her own account carries out the business or profession. No formal procedure or formality is required for setting up a sole proprietary concern.\n\n\nA partnership is a business relationship entered into by a formal agreement between two or more persons or corporations carrying on a business in common. The capital for a partnership is provided by the partners who are liable for the total debts of the firms and who share the profits and losses of the business concern according to the terms of the partnership agreement.\n\nPartnerships (other than banking companies) are generally limited in size to twenty partners. The interest of a partner is transferable only with the prior consent of the other partner(s). However, a partner's right to a share of the partnership income may be received in trust for another person.\n\nFor taxation purposes, partnerships are classified into:\n\n(i) Registered Firms\n(ii) Unregistered Firms\n\nThe income of the registered firm is subject to Super Tax before distribution to the partners. Also the individual income of the partners is subject to income tax at the usual rates.\n\nFor unregistered firms, income tax is levied on the firm's income and the partners are not liable to pay tax on the shares of profit received from the unregistered firm(s).\n\n\nA company is a legal entity formed under the Companies Ordinance, 1984. It can have share capital or can be formed without share capital.\n\nA company having share capital may be formed as:\n\n(i) A company limited by shares.\n(ii) A company limited by guarantee.\n(iii) An unlimited company.\n\n\nThe liability of its members is limited to the extent of their shares in the paid-up capital of the company. These companies may further be classified as public limited and private limited companies.\n\n\n(i) Restricts the right to transfer its shares;\n(ii) Limits the number of its members to fifty; and;\n(iii) Prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures of the company.\n\nA private limited company is required to use the words \"(Private) Limited\" as the last words of its name.\n\n\nMeans a company having the liability of its members limited by memorandum to such amounts as the members may respectively undertake to contribute to the capital of the company in the event of its winding up. A company limited by guarantee is usually formed on a 'non profit basis'. Companies limited by guarantee use the words (Guarantee) Limited\" as the last words of their n\nUnlimited Company\n\nMeans a company having unlimited liability of its members\n\nhttps://www.secp.gov.pk\n\n\n\nOlder forms (now rarely used)\n\n\n\n\"Societăți comerciale\", abbreviated SC (Companies):\n\nlimited liability company \"societate cu raspundere limitata\" (SRL);\njoint stock company \"societate pe actiuni\" (SA);\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Limited Company, Sole Proprietorship and Partnership are the predominant types of business found in Singapore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Code of Obligations (fifth book of Civil Code) (Act No: 6098)\n\nAccording to the Commercial Code (Act No: 6102)\n\nŞahıs şirketleri ≈ Partnerships (Unlike the partnerships in Anglo-American law, they also have legal personality like companies)\n\nSermaye şirketleri ≈ Companies\n\nAccording to the Capital Markets Act (Act No: 6362)\n\nAccording to the Cooperatives Act (Act No: 1136)\n\nOther entitites:\n\n\n\nCompany formation is regulated by the Ukrainian Civil Code and Commercial Code, Law of Commercial companies, Law of stock companies, law and order.\n\n\nIn the United States, the individual states incorporate most businesses. Very few special types are incorporated by the federal government.\n\nFor federal tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service has separate entity classification rules. Under the tax rules, an entity may be classified as a corporation, a partnership, a Cooperative or a disregarded entity. A corporation may be taxed as either a C corporation or elect to be treated as a Subchapter S corporation. A disregarded entity has one owner (or a married couple as owner) that is not recognized for tax purposes as an entity separate from its owner. Types of disregarded entities include single-member LLCs; qualified sub-chapter S subsidiaries and qualified real estate investment trust subsidiaries. A disregarded entity's transparent tax status does not affect its status under state law. For example, for federal tax purposes, a sole-member LLC (SMLLC) is disregarded, so that all its assets and liabilities are treated as owned by its single member. But under state law, an SMLLC can contract in its own name and its owner is generally not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the entity. To be recognized as a Cooperative for tax purposes Cooperatives must follow certain rules under Sub Chapter T of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nThe key word for a bank is \"national\". A bank chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) must have the word \"national\" in its name. A bank chartered by a state cannot have \"national\" in its name.\n\nFor a savings bank (formerly called a savings and loan association) or credit union, the key word is \"federal\", and the same rules apply; a federally chartered savings bank or credit union must have the word \"federal\" in its name, while a state chartered savings bank or credit union cannot have \"federal\" in its name.\n\n\nMany federal governmental units are specially formed public corporations, while some private organizations have received a charter from Congress.\n\nThe following are the main business designations and types:\n\n\n\n\nRequired designations for corporations, by U.S. state, territory or commonwealth:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1670481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1670481", "title": "Managed services", "text": "Managed services\n\nManaged services is the practice of outsourcing on a proactive basis certain processes and functions intended to improve operations and cut expenses. It is an alternative to the break/fix or on-demand outsourcing model where the service provider performs on-demand services and bills the customer only for the work done.\n\nUnder this subscription model, the client or customer is the entity that owns or has direct oversight of the organization or system being managed whereas the Managed Services Provider (MSP) is the service provider delivering the managed services. The client and the MSP are bound by a contractual, service-level agreement that states the performance and quality metrics of their relationship.\n\nAdopting managed services is intended to be an efficient way to stay up-to-date on technology, have access to skills and address issues related to cost, quality of service and risk. As the IT infrastructure components of many SMB and large corporations are migrating to the cloud, with MSPs (managed services providers) increasingly facing the challenge of cloud computing, a number of MSPs are providing in-house cloud services or acting as brokers with cloud services providers. A recent survey claims that a lack of knowledge and expertise in cloud computing rather than offerors' reluctance, appears to be the main obstacle to this transition. For example, in transportation, many companies face a significant increase of fuel and carrier costs, driver shortages, customer service requests and global supply chain complexities. Managing day-to-day transportation processes and reducing related costs come as significant burdens that require the expertise of Transportation Managed Services (or managed transportation services) providers.\n\nThe evolution of MSP started in the 1990s with the emergence of application service providers (ASPs) who helped pave the way for remote support for IT infrastructure. From the initial focus of remote monitoring and management of servers and networks, the scope of an MSP's services expanded to include mobile device management, managed security, remote firewall administration and security-as-a-service, and managed print services. Around 2005, Karl W. Palachuk, Amy Luby (Founder of Managed Service Provider Services Network acquired by High Street Technology Ventures), and Erick Simpson (Managed Services Provider University) were the first advocates and the pioneers of the managed services business model.\n\nThe first books on the topic of managed services: \"Service Agreements for SMB Consultants: A Quick-Start Guide to Managed Services\" and \"The Guide to a Successful Managed Services Practice\" were published in 2006 by Palachuk and Simpson, respectively. Since then, the managed services business model has gained ground among enterprise level companies. As the value-added reseller (VAR) community evolved to higher level of services, it adapted the managed service model and tailored it to SMB companies.\n\nIn the new economy, IT manufacturers are currently moving away from a \"box-shifting\" resale to a more customized, managed service offering. In this transition, the billing and sales processes of intangible managed services, appear as the main challenges for traditional resellers.\n\nThe managed services market is expected to grow from an estimated $152.45 billion in 2017 to $257.84 billion by 2022, representing a CAGR of 11.1%. With IT driving all business operations, the significance of aligning managed IT services with all levels in an organization has grown to ensure reliability and continuity of business goals.\n\nIn the information technology area, the most common managed services appear to evolve around connectivity and bandwidth, network monitoring, security, virtualization, and disaster recovery. Beyond traditional application and infrastructure management, managed services may also include storage, desktop and communications, mobility, help desk and technical support. In general, common managed services include the following applications.\n\nA managed services provider (MSP) is most often an information technology (IT) services provider that manages and assumes responsibility for providing a defined set of services to its clients either proactively or as the MSP (not the client) determines that services are needed. Most MSPs bill an upfront setup or transition fee and an ongoing flat or near-fixed monthly fee, which benefits clients by providing them with predictable IT support costs. Sometimes, MSPs act as facilitators who manage and procure staffing services on behalf of the client. In such context, they use an online application called vendor management system (VMS) for transparency and efficiency.\n\nThe managed services model has been useful in the private sector, notably among Fortune 500 companies, and has an interesting future in government.\n\nMain manage services provides originate from the United States (IBM, Accenture, Cognizant), Europe (Atos, Capgemini) and India (TCS, Infosys, Wipro).\n\n"}

{"id": "3883649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3883649", "title": "Perfection (law)", "text": "Perfection (law)\n\nIn law, perfection relates to the additional steps required to be taken in relation to a security interest in order to make it effective against third parties or to retain its effectiveness in the event of default by the grantor of the security interest. Generally speaking, once a security interest is effectively created, it gives certain rights to the holder of the security and imposes duties on the party who grants that security. However, in many legal systems, additional steps --- perfection of the security interest --- are required to enforce the security against third parties such as a liquidator.\n\nAs a legal concept, perfection must be distinguished from:\n\nThe same rule --- the common law rule in \"Dearle v Hall\", for instance --- may govern both perfection against third parties (e.g., subsequent security holders) and prioritization of competing security interests.\n\nIn most legal systems, the need for perfection arises only in relation to security interests that are proprietary in nature (such as a mortgage or equitable charge). Other arrangements which constitute security in the loose sense of the word --- for instance, title retention arrangements, hire purchase, and leasing transactions --- need not in general be perfected in the legal sense.\n\nIn India, Section 125 of the Companies Act, 1956 provides that certain charges shall be void against liquidator or creditors unless registered. Thus,if a charge is not registered with Registrar of Companies, and company happens to go for liquidation, even secured creditor shall be treated as unsecured.\n\nThere are three principal modes by which a security interest may be perfected (which method of perfection is applicable depends upon the nature of the security interest and the laws of the relevant country).\n\n\nSome security interests can be perfected only by the actual possession of the asset. For example, under a common-law pledge (or pawn), the right to enforce the sale of the asset is contingent upon the possession of that asset: an agreement that leaves the debtor in possession of the pledged collateral does not give rise to an enforceable security interest.\n\nIn certain cases, the possession does not need to be \"actual\" possession, but may be \"constructive\" possession. For example, possession of a document of title will often suffice where it is not possible to possess the goods. In many legal systems, there may also be constructive possession by attornment.\n\nThe law relating to perfection of security interests by taking of possession can sometimes be confused with the law relating to the granting of security interests, which provides that the deposit of certain assets (usually documents of title) can amount to an equitable mortgage of the goods.\n\nCertain security interests may be perfected by some kind of registration or filing. Although the terms are used interchangeably, it is more accurate to speak of registration as the lodgment of particulars, and filing as the lodgment of the security instrument itself.\n\nGenerally systems of registration divide into two types:\nEach has its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nRegistration against a particular asset only tends to be practical where the assets are of a nature and substance that makes it feasible to have a register for recording security interests against them. Most countries have systems for the registration of security relating to land, aircraft, ships and intellectual property rights. The advantage of a register relating to the asset is that if the debtor wishes to provide an asset as collateral, the proposed lender can swiftly check definitively whether the asset is encumbered or not. Nevertheless, specialist registers in some jurisdictions cannot always be considered \"a one-stop source of information\".\n\nRegistration against a debtor tends to operate by way of requiring the registration of certain security interests by the debtor. The advantage is that a lender can quickly see which assets of the debtor are encumbered and which are not. However, because many registration systems do not require all types of security interest to be registered gaps can remain. Also, systems which register security against the debtor do not act as a check that the debtor actually has title to any of the relevant assets, merely that he has not created any security interest over them.\n\nHowever, the position is complicated by the fact that many legal systems employ both, interchangeably. A security interest granted by a debtor over a particular asset in any given country may need to be registered against the debtor, against the asset, both or neither.\n\nIn some legal systems, perfection of a security interest requires notice to be given to a relevant third party. This most commonly arises in relation to security over a debt or other \"chose in action\", notice being required to be given to the party owing the debt or holding the fund. Under English law, an often cited example is the well-known rule in \"Dearle v Hall\". Under the rule if A is owed money by X, and then A grants an equitable charge over that debt to B, and then grants a second equitable charge over the same debt to C, then the ability to enforce the charge by either B or C against the money in X's hands is dependent upon the giving of notice to X. The controversy in the rule relates to the fact that it is also a rule of \"priority\", meaning that (if their rights are otherwise equal) the first one to give notice to X has the prior claim, irrespective of the order in which the equitable charges were granted.\n\nSimilarly, in many common law legal systems, where there is an assignment of a debt, the assignee cannot enforce the rights of the assigning creditor against the debtor unless notice of the assignment has been given, and until notice of the assignment has been given, the debtor can still discharge the debt by paying the money to the creditor, notwithstanding the assignment.\n\n"}

{"id": "4529662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4529662", "title": "Real estate entrepreneur", "text": "Real estate entrepreneur\n\nA real estate entrepreneur or a real estate investor to a lesser extent is someone who actively or passively invests in real estate. An active investor may buy a property, make repairs and/or improvements to the property, and sell it later for a profit. A passive investor might hire a real estate firm to find and manage an investment property for him. Typically, investors choose real estate for several reasons: cash flow, capital appreciation, depreciation, tax benefits and leverage.\n\nAppreciation occurs over time, generally, though an investor may \"force the equity\" in a property by making enhancements to it or the surrounding environment to increase its value. In general, residential real estate is valued by the \"comparable sales\" method which estimates the value of property under the principle of substitution. The method estimates property values by comparing a subject property to similar properties sold in similar locations within a recent period of time.\n\nDepreciation is one of the many benefits afforded to real estate investors. Though the property is actually increasing in value, the government allows owners to systematically depreciate the property over its projected useful life span. Depreciation is an allowable tax deduction. In addition to depreciation, an investor will usually claim the interest portion of his monthly mortgage payment as a tax deduction.\n\nLeverage is a powerful reason for investing in real estate. If an investor used 100% cash to acquire a house worth $100,000, and the house increased in value by $5,000 in one year, then the investor made a return of 5% (assuming no other costs in this case). However, if the investor obtained 95% financing, only $5,000 cash would be required at the closing table, and a bank or other lender would loan the remaining $95,000 to acquire the property.\n\nAssuming the same $5,000 increase in value, the investor's cash contribution of $5,000 would yield an increase in equity of $5,000 in one year, a 100% return. Leverage works in the opposite manner as well. A $1,000 decrease in value would produce a negative 20% return on the $5,000 investment.\n\nReal estate investing has become quite popular in recent years due to rising property values and low interest rates. However, Deflation in property values or a sharp increase in interest rates would dampen the market considerably.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "294216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294216", "title": "SWOT analysis", "text": "SWOT analysis\n\nSWOT analysis (or SWOT matrix) is a strategic planning technique used to help a person or organization identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to business competition or project planning. It is intended to specify the objectives of the business venture or project and identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving those objectives. Users of a SWOT analysis often ask and answer questions to generate meaningful information for each category to make the tool useful and identify their competitive advantage. SWOT has been described as the tried-and-true tool of strategic analysis. \n\nStrengths and weakness are frequently internally-related, while opportunities and threats commonly focus on the external environment. The name is an acronym for the four parameters the technique examines:\nThe degree to which the internal environment of the firm matches with the external environment is expressed by the concept of strategic fit. Identification of SWOTs is important because they can inform later steps in planning to achieve the objective. First, decision-makers should consider whether the objective is attainable, given the SWOTs. If the objective is \"not\" attainable, they must select a different objective and repeat the process.\n\nSome authors credit SWOT to Albert Humphrey, who led a convention at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) in the 1960s and 1970s using data from Fortune 500 companies. However, Humphrey himself did not claim the creation of SWOT, and the origins remain obscure.\n\nSWOT analysis aims to identify the key internal and external factors seen as important to achieving an objective. SWOT analysis groups key pieces of information into two main categories:\n\n\nAnalysis may view the internal factors as strengths or as weaknesses depending upon their effect on the organization's objectives. What may represent strengths with respect to one objective may be weaknesses (distractions, competition) for another objective. The factors may include all of the 4Ps as well as personnel, finance, manufacturing capabilities, and so on.\n\nThe external factors may include macroeconomic matters, technological change, legislation, and sociocultural changes, as well as changes in the marketplace or in competitive position. The results are often presented in the form of a matrix.\n\nSWOT analysis is just one method of categorization and has its own weaknesses. For example, it may tend to persuade its users to compile lists rather than to think about actual important factors in achieving objectives. It also presents the resulting lists uncritically and without clear prioritization so that, for example, weak opportunities may appear to balance strong threats.\n\nIt is prudent not to eliminate any candidate SWOT entry too quickly. The importance of individual SWOTs will be revealed by the value of the strategies they generate. A SWOT item that produces valuable strategies is important. A SWOT item that generates no strategies is not important.\n\nThe usefulness of SWOT analysis is not limited to profit-seeking organizations. SWOT analysis may be used in any decision-making situation when a desired end-state (objective) is defined. Examples include non-profit organizations, governmental units, and individuals. SWOT analysis may also be used in pre-crisis planning and preventive crisis management. SWOT analysis may also be used in creating a recommendation during a viability study/survey.\n\nSWOT analysis can be used effectively to build organizational or personal strategy. Steps necessary to execute strategy-oriented analysis involve identification of internal and external factors (using the popular 2x2 matrix), selection and evaluation of the most important factors, and identification of relations existing between internal and external features.\n\nFor instance, strong relations between strengths and opportunities can suggest good conditions in the company and allow using an \"aggressive\" strategy. On the other hand, strong interactions between weaknesses and threats could be analyzed as a potential warning and advice for using a \"defensive\" strategy.\n\nOne way of using SWOT is matching and converting. Matching is used to find competitive advantage by matching the strengths to opportunities. Another tactic is to convert weaknesses or threats into strengths or opportunities. An example of a conversion strategy is to find new markets. If the threats or weaknesses cannot be converted, a company should try to minimize or avoid them.\n\nAs part of the development of strategies and plans to enable the organization to achieve its objectives, that organization will use a systematic/rigorous process known as corporate planning. SWOT alongside PEST/PESTLE can be used as a basis for the analysis of business and environmental factors.\n\nIn many competitor analysis, marketers build detailed profiles of each competitor in the market, focusing especially on their relative competitive strengths and weaknesses using SWOT analysis. Marketing managers will examine each competitor's cost structure, sources of profits, resources and competencies, competitive positioning and product differentiation, degree of vertical integration, historical responses to industry developments, and other factors.\n\nMarketing management often finds it necessary to invest in research to collect the data required to perform accurate marketing analysis. Accordingly, management often conducts market research (alternately marketing research) to obtain this information. Marketers employ a variety of techniques to conduct market research, but some of the more common include:\n\nBelow is an example SWOT analysis of a market position of a small management consultancy with specialism in HRM.\n\nThe SWOT analysis has been used in community work as a tool to identify positive and negative factors within organizations, communities, and the broader society that promote or inhibit successful implementation of social services and social change efforts. It is used as a preliminary resource, assessing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in a community served by a nonprofit or community organization. This organizing tool is best used in collaboration with community workers and/or community members before developing goals and objectives for a program design or implementing an organizing strategy. The SWOT analysis is a part of the planning for social change process and will not provide a strategic plan if used by itself. After a SWOT analysis is completed, a social change organization can turn the SWOT list into a series of recommendations to consider before developing a strategic plan.\n\nStrengths and weaknesses (\"internal factors within an organization\"):\n\nOpportunities and threats (\"external factors stemming from community or societal forces\"):\n\nAlthough the SWOT analysis was originally designed as an organizational method for business and industries, it has been replicated in various community work as a tool for identifying external and internal support to combat internal and external opposition. The SWOT analysis is necessary to provide direction to the next stages of the change process. It has been used by community organizers and community members to further social justice in the context of Social Work practice.\n\nAs mentioned above, SWOT can be crucial to determining the success of a project, while factoring in funding, as well as accessibility and logic. Often, a city will spend a year weighing the Risk-benefits of a project before they even vote on it.\nElements to consider in a SWOT analysis include understanding the community that a particular organization is working with. This can be done via public forums, listening campaigns, and informational interviews. Data collection will help inform the community members and workers when developing the SWOT analysis. A needs and assets assessment is tooling that can be used to identify the needs and existing resources of the community. When these assessments are done and data has been collected, an analysis of the community can be made that informs the SWOT analysis.\n\nA SWOT analysis is best developed in a group setting such as a work or community meeting. A facilitator can conduct the meeting by first explaining what a SWOT analysis is as well as identifying the meaning of each term.\n\nOne way of facilitating the development of a SWOT analysis includes developing an example SWOT with the larger group then separating each group into smaller teams to present to the larger group after set amount of time. This allows for individuals, who may be silenced in a larger group setting, to contribute. Once the allotted time is up, the facilitator may record all the factors of each group onto a large document such as a poster board, and then the large group, as a collective, can go work through each of the threats and weaknesses to explore options that may be used to combat negative forces with the strengths and opportunities present within the organization and community. A SWOT meeting allows participants to creatively brainstorm, identify obstacles, and possibly strategize solutions/way forward to these limitations.\n\nThe uses of a SWOT analysis by a community organization are as follows: to organize information, provide insight into barriers that may be present while engaging in social change processes, and identify strengths available that can be activated to counteract these barriers.\n\n\"A SWOT analysis can be used to:\"\n\nThe SWOT analysis in social work practice framework is beneficial because it helps organizations decide whether or not an objective is obtainable and therefore enables organizations to set achievable goals, objectives, and steps to further the social change or community development effort. It enables organizers to take visions and produce practical and efficient outcomes that effect long-lasting change, and it helps organizations gather meaningful information to maximize their potential. Completing a SWOT analysis is a useful process regarding the consideration of key organizational priorities, such as gender and cultural diversity and fundraising objectives.\n\nSome findings from Menon et al. (1999) and Hill and Westbrook (1997) have suggested that SWOT may harm performance and that \"no-one subsequently used the outputs within the later stages of the strategy\". \n\nOther critiques include the misuse of the SWOT analysis as a technique that can be quickly designed without critical thought leading to a misrepresentation of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats within an organization's internal and external surroundings. If a firm becomes preoccupied with a single strength, such as cost control, they can neglect their weaknesses, such as product quality.\n\nAnother limitation includes the development of a SWOT analysis simply to defend previously decided goals and objectives. This misuse leads to limitations on brainstorming possibilities and \"real\" identification of barriers. This misuse also places the organization’s interest above the well-being of the community. Further, a SWOT analysis should be developed as a collaborative with a variety of contributions made by participants including community members. The design of a SWOT analysis by one or two community workers is limiting to the realities of the forces, specifically external factors, and devalues the possible contributions of community members.\n\nOverall, managers should remember that SWOT is a starting point for discussion and cannot, in itself, show managers how to achieve a competitive advantage. Because the SWOT analysis is a snapshot of the firm at a particular moment in time, the analysis might obscure the fact that both the internal and external environment are rapidly changing.\n\nIn project management, the alternative to SWOT known by the acronym SVOR (Strengths, Vulnerabilities, Opportunities, and Risks) compares the project elements along two axes: internal and external, and positive and negative. It takes into account the mathematical link that exists between these various elements, considering also the role of infrastructures. The SVOR table provides an intricate understanding of the elements at play in a given project:\nConstraints consist of: calendar of tasks and activities, costs, and norms of quality. The \"k\" constant varies with each project (for example, it may be valued at 1.3).\n\nMany reports have been published about the use of SWOT by real life companies, and how the idea is spreading. Coca-Cola has used this in their television ads in order to effectively target a customer, such as appeal to senses.\n\nIn the \"Silicon Valley\" episode \"Homicide\" (Season 2, Episode 6), Jared Dunn (Zach Woods) introduces the Pied Piper team to SWOT analysis. Later in that episode Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani) and Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) employ the method when deciding whether or not to inform a stunt driver that the calculations for his upcoming jump were performed incorrectly.\n\n"}
{"id": "155698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155698", "title": "Sales", "text": "Sales\n\nSales are activities related to selling or the number of goods or services sold in a given time period.\n\nThe \"seller\" or the provider of the goods or services complete a sale in response to an acquisition, appropriation, requisition or a direct interaction with the \"buyer\" at the point of sale. There is a passing of title (property or ownership) of the item, and the settlement of a price, in which agreement is reached on a price for which transfer of ownership of the item will occur. The \"seller\", not the purchaser generally executes the sale and it may be completed prior to the obligation of payment. In the case of indirect interaction, a person who sells goods or service on behalf of the owner is known as a salesman or saleswoman or salesperson, but this often refers to someone selling goods in a store/shop, in which case other terms are also common, including \"salesclerk\", \"shop assistant\", and \"retail clerk\".\n\nIn common law countries, sales are governed generally by the common law and commercial codes. In the United States, the laws governing sales of goods are somewhat uniform to the extent that most jurisdictions have adopted Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, albeit with some non-uniform variations.\n\nA person or organization expressing an interest in acquiring the offered item of value is referred to as a potential buyer, prospective customer or prospect. Buying and selling are understood to be two sides of the same \"coin\" or transaction. Both seller and buyer engage in a process of negotiation to consummate the exchange of values. The exchange, or selling, process has implied rules and identifiable stages. It is implied that the selling process will proceed fairly and ethically so that the parties end up nearly equally rewarded. The stages of selling, and buying, involve getting acquainted, assessing each party's need for the other's item of value, and determining if the values to be exchanged are equivalent or nearly so, or, in buyer's terms, \"worth the price\". Sometimes, sellers have to use their own experiences when selling products with appropriate discounts.\n\nFrom a management viewpoint it is thought of as a part of marketing, although the skills required are different. Sales often form a separate grouping in a corporate structure, employing separate specialist operatives known as \"salespersons\" (singular: \"salesperson\"). Selling is considered by many to be a sort of persuading \"art\". Contrary to popular belief, the methodological approach of selling refers to a \"systematic process of repetitive and measurable milestones, by which a salesman relates his or her offering of a product or service in return enabling the buyer to achieve their goal in an economic way\". According to a 2018 survey of salespeople, selling has become more difficult in recent years due to changes in technology and general access to prospects. While the sales process refers to a systematic process of repetitive and measurable milestones, the definition of the selling is somewhat ambiguous due to the close nature of advertising, promotion, public relations, and direct marketing.\n\nSelling is the profession-wide term, much like marketing defines a profession. Recently, attempts have been made to clearly understand who is in the sales profession, and who is not. There are many articles looking at marketing, advertising, promotions, and even public relations as ways to create a unique transaction.\n\nTwo common terms used to describe a salesperson are \"Farmer\" and \"Hunter\". The reality is that most professional salespeople have a little of both. A hunter is often associated with aggressive personalities who use aggressive sales technique. In terms of sales methodology, a hunter refers to a person whose focus is on bringing in and closing deals. This process is called \"sales capturing\". An example is a commodity sale such as a long distance salesperson, shoe salesperson and to a degree a car salesperson. Their job is to find and convert buyers. A sales farmer is someone who creates sales demand through activities that directly influence and alter the buying process.\n\nMany believe that the focus of selling is on the human agents involved in the exchange between buyer and seller. Effective selling also requires a systems approach, at minimum involving roles that sell, enable selling, and develop sales capabilities. Selling also involves salespeople who possess a specific set of sales skills and the knowledge required to facilitate the exchange of value between buyers and sellers that is unique from marketing, advertising, etc.\n\nWithin these three tenets, the following definition of professional selling is offered by the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD):\nTeam selling is one way to influence sales. Team selling is \"a group of people representing the sales department and other functional areas in the firm, such as finance, production, and research and development\". (Spiro) Team selling came about in the 1990s through total quality management (TQM). TQM occurs when companies work to improve their customer satisfaction by constantly improving all of their operations.\n\nMarketing and sales differ greatly but generally have the same goal. Selling is the final stage in marketing which puts the plan into effect, which also includes pricing, promotion, place, and product (the 4 P's). A marketing department in an organization has the goals of increasing the desirability and value to the customer and increasing the number and engagement of interactions between potential customers and the organization. Achieving this goal may involve the sales team using promotional techniques such as advertising, sales promotion, publicity, and public relations, creating new sales channels, or creating new products (new product development), among other things. It can also include bringing the potential customer to visit the organization's website(s) for more information, or to contact the organization for more information, or to interact with the organization via social media such as Twitter, Facebook and blogs. Social values also play a major role in consumer decision processes. Marketing is the whole of the work on persuasion made for the whole of the target people. Sales are the persuasion and effort that from one person to one person (B2C), one person makes to the corporation (B2B) in the face or in the phone or in the digital environment, to make a living resource enter the company.\n\nThe field of sales process engineering views \"sales\" as the output of a larger system, not just as the output of one department. The larger system includes many functional areas within an organization. From this perspective, \"sales\" and \"marketing\" (among others, such as \"customer service\") label for a number of processes whose inputs and outputs supply one another to varying degrees. In this context, improving an \"output\" (such as sales) involves studying and improving the broader sales process, as in any system, since the component functional areas interact and are interdependent.\n\nMany large corporations structure their marketing departments so they are directly integrated with all lines of business. They create multiple teams with a singular focus and the managers of these teams must coordinate efforts in order to drive profits and business success. For example, an \"inbound\" focused campaign seeks to drive more customers \"through the door\", giving the sales department a better chance of selling their product to the consumer. A good marketing program would address any potential downsides as well.\n\nThe sales department would aim to improve the interaction between the customer and the sales facility or mechanism (example, website) or salesperson. As Sales is the forefront of any organization, this would always need to take place before any other business process may begin. Sales management would break down the selling process and then increase the effectiveness of the discrete processes as well as the interaction between processes. For example, in many out-bound sales environments, the typical process includes outbound calling, the sales pitch, handling objections, opportunity identification, and the close. Each step of the process has sales-related issues, skills, and training needs, as well as marketing solutions to improve each discrete step, as well as the whole process. In many cases becoming a salesperson is a default career as not many people aspire to be a salesman but rather fall into the job due to circumstances. It can be highly rewarding as you receive remuneration in the form of a salary and also commission.\n\nOne further common complication of marketing involves the inability to measure results for a lot of marketing initiatives. In essence, many marketing and advertising executives often lose sight of the objective of sales/revenue/profit, as they focus on establishing a creative/innovative program, without concern for the top or bottom lines – a fundamental pitfall of marketing for marketing's sake.\n\nMany companies find it challenging to get marketing and sales on the same page. The two departments, although different in nature, handle very similar concepts and have to work together for sales to be successful. Building a good relationship between the two that encourages communication can be the key to success – even in a down economy.\n\nThe idea that marketing can potentially eliminate the need for salespeople depends entirely on context. For example, this may be possible in some B2C situations; however, for many B2B transactions (for example, those involving industrial organizations) this is mostly impossible. Another dimension is the value of the goods being sold. Fast-moving consumer-goods (FMCG) require no sales people at the point of sale to get them to jump off the supermarket shelf and into the customer's trolley. However, the purchase of large mining equipment worth millions of dollars will require a salesperson to manage the sales process – particularly in the face of competitors. Small and medium businesses selling such large ticket items to a geographically-disperse client base use manufacturers' representatives to provide this highly personal service while avoiding the large expense of a captive sales force.\n\nAnother area of discussion involves the need for alignment and integration of corporate sales and marketing functions. According to a report from the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Council, only 40 percent of companies have formal programs, systems or processes in place to align and integrate the two critical functions.\n\nTraditionally, these two functions, as referenced above, have operated separately, left in siloed areas of tactical responsibility. Glen Petersen's book \"The Profit Maximization Paradox\" sees the changes in the competitive landscape between the 1950s and the time of writing as so dramatic that the complexity of choice, price, and opportunities for the customer forced this seemingly simple and integrated relationship between sales and marketing to change forever. Petersen goes on to highlight that salespeople spend approximately 40 percent of their time preparing customer-facing deliverables while leveraging less than 50 percent of the materials created by marketing, adding to perceptions that marketing is out of touch with the customer and that sales is resistant to messaging and strategy.\n\nThere are two types of sales: direct selling and indirect selling.\n\nA sale can take place through:\n\n\nAgents in the sales process can represent either of two parties in the sales process; for example:\n\n\nIn the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act defines outside sales representatives as \"employees [who] sell their employer's products, services, or facilities to customers away from their employer's place(s) of business, in general, either at the customer's place of business or by selling door-to-door at the customer's home\" while defining those who work \"from the employer's location\" as inside sales. Inside sales generally involves attempting to close business primarily over the phone via telemarketing, while outside sales (or \"field\" sales) will usually involve initial phone work to book sales calls at the potential buyer's location to attempt to close the deal in person. Some companies have an inside sales department that works with outside representatives and book their appointments for them. Inside sales sometimes refers to upselling to existing customers.\n\n"}

{"id": "775067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=775067", "title": "Sports agent", "text": "Sports agent\n\nA sports agent is a legal representative (hence agent) for professional sports figures such as athletes and coaches. They procure and negotiate employment and endorsement contracts for the athlete or coach whom they represent.\nBecause of the unique characteristics of the sports industry, sports agents are responsible for communications with team owners, managers, and other individuals. Also, they are responsible for making recommendations in regard . In addition to finding income sources, agents often handle public relations matters for their clients. In some large sports agencies, such as IMG, Creative Artists Agency, Roc Nation Sports and Octagon, agents deal with all aspects of a client's finances, from investment to filing taxes.\n\nSports agents may be relied upon by their clients for guidance in all business aspects, and sometimes even more broadly. For example, hockey agents start recruiting clients as young as 15, allowing the agent to guide the athlete's career before the NHL draft, which happens usually at 18 years of age.\n\nDue to the length and complexity of contracts, many sports agents are lawyers or have a background in contract law. Agents are expected to be knowledgeable about finance, business management, and financial and risk analysis, as well as sports. It is important for a sports agent to follow trends in sports. Other skills an agent must possess are excellent communication and negotiation skills. Agents must be highly motivated, willing to work long hours, and capable of multitasking. It is very common for agents to be in negotiations on behalf of several clients at one time.\n\nSome agents are part of large companies, and some are on their own. The number of clients an individual agent can handle and how many clients his or her employing agency can handle in total are interdependent variables.\n\nBefore the 1990s, most football players did not use agents. In some cases, they used their fathers as agents. Because of most parents' naivete about the football business, these young footballers were often given less-than-stellar contracts by football clubs, which yielded lower salaries than they thought they deserved. In Sweden, there were only three licensed agents in 1995. As of 2002, there were 33. According to FIFA, there were 5,187 licensed association football agents worldwide, with 600 agents in Italy alone. Since 2001, agents have not been licensed by FIFA. Instead, agents are now licensed directly by each association.\n\nSports agents generally receive between 4 and 10% of the athlete's playing contract, and 10 to 20% of the athlete's endorsement contract, although these figures vary. NFL agents are not permitted to receive more than 3%, and NBA agents not more than 4%, of their client's playing contracts.\n\nThe popularity of television shows such as \"Entourage\", which stars a talent agent named Ari Gold, and \"Arliss\", have helped glamorize the profession. Prior to that, movies such as \"Jerry Maguire\", \"Two for the Money\", and \"Any Given Sunday\" depicted sports agents. In England, ITV's \"Footballers' Wives\" put a new spin on sports agents by casting a no-holds-barred female agent Hazel Bailey. The television show \"Ballers\", which started in 2015, also shows a strong depiction of sports agents.\n\nDue to the popularity of these works, there has been increase of attention in the profession. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair's son decided to become a football agent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been some efforts to transform the sports agency business from an individual, entrepreneurial business, to more of a corporate structure. These experiments met with varying degrees of longevity and success.\n\nSome sports agency firms were once prominent, but are now gone or reorganized:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56830751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56830751", "title": "Teal organisation", "text": "Teal organisation\n\nA teal organisation is an emerging organisational paradigm that advocates a level of consciousness including all previous world views within the operations of an organisation. The concept of teal organisation refers to the next stage in the evolution of consciousness and was introduced in 2014 by Frederic Laloux in his book on Reinventing Organizations. It also rests on previous studies done by evolutionary and social psychologists including Jean Gebser, Clare W. Graves, Don Edward Beck, Chris Cowan and Ken Wilber who explored the stages of development and impact of human consciousness.\n\nA teal organisation transcends and integrates the existing limitations of current static organisational paradigms including Amber, Orange and Green organisations. It is characterized by three breakthroughs in human collaboration, specific to this evolutionary level: \"self-management\" suggests a system based on peer relationships with no need for hierarchy, consensus, nor central command and control; \"wholeness\" is about a consistent set of practices that invite members to reclaim their inner wholeness and bring on the workplace “all of who they are”; \"evolutionary purpose\" introduces a teal organisation as a living organism with a direction of its own where its members are invited to listen and take note of the purpose it wants to serve. These breakthroughs overcome the limitations of previous organisational models in that they welcome the emotional, intuitive, and spiritual elements in lieu of the usual display of rationality, determination and strength; and concealment of doubts or vulnerability. During its evolution, a teal organisation exhibits properties similar to complex adaptive systems because the interactions and relationships between its elements are nonlinear and based on few simple rules or guiding principles. These elements learn from the past and their immediate environment and then adapt accordingly for the survival of the system. A number of notable organisations around the world has adopted and operates on the teal organisation model including The Morning Star Company (food processing, United States), Patagonia (apparel, United States), Sounds True (media, United States), AES (energy sector, international), Buurtzorg Nederland (health care, Netherlands), ESBZ (K–12 school, Germany), Heiligenfelde (mental health hospitals, Germany), Nucor (steel manufacturing, international).\n\n\n\n"}

Such an airline focuses on operating a network of air services, and outsourcing non-core activities to other organizations. Contracting out services within the aviation industry has reportedly become so common that many carriers could be classed as having features of a virtual airline, although it is arguable whether any current carriers meet a strict definition of the term.\n\nThe term is also used to describe travel companies and ticket agencies that market themselves as airlines, but are unlicensed and with flights undertaken by licensed operators often in the livery of the virtual airline.\n\nVirtual airlines originated following the drastic changes brought about by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. During the hyper-competitive years immediately following deregulation, major airlines found it increasingly unprofitable to compete against start-up carriers on many routes they currently served. Instead of forfeiting the routes entirely, the larger carriers often made marketing arrangements with smaller airlines to fly under the \"banner\", or aircraft livery, of the larger airline. These regional airlines, mimicking the well known major airlines in adverts and prescribing to make connections as seamless as possible, soon abandoned their own local service routes. In most cases, the regional airlines found it more profitable to serve the mainline hubs as a feeder operation rather than operate on their own.\n\n\n\n\n"}
