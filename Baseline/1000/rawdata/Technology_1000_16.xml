Appian was named the 2018 Washington D.C. area "Top Workplace" by [[The Washington Post]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/business/top-workplaces/|title=Top Workplaces 2018|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==

Appian was founded in 1999 by Matthew Calkins with co-founders Michael Beckley, Marc Wilson, and Robert Kramer. 

In 2001, Appian developed [[Army Knowledge Online]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2004/05/18/appian-software-picked-for-army-portal-upgrade.aspx|title=Appian software picked for Army portal upgrade|last=Gerin|first=Roseanne|publisher=Washington Technology|date=2004-05-18|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At the time, it was regarded as “the world's largest intranet"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2001/11/army-intranet-worlds-largest/|title=Army Intranet: World's Largest|last=Knapp|first=Louise|publisher=Wired|date=2001-11-15|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2004, Appian released Appian Enterprise, its first [[Business Process Management]] Suite (BPMS) software platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bptrends.com/reports/03%20Appian%20Report%203-15.pdf|title=The 2005 BPM Suites Report, Appian Enterprise 4.0|publisher=BPTrends|date=2005|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2014, Appian received $37.5 million in secondary investments from [[New Enterprise Associates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/appian-collects-375-million-from-new-enterprise-associates-as-it-eyes-ipo-plans/2014/03/04/9af5fe02-a3c2-11e3-8466-d34c451760b9_story.html?utm_term=.3f26e1488528|title=Appian collects $37.5 million from New Enterprise Associates as it plans IPO|last=Overly|first=Steven|publisher=Washington Post|date=2014-03-04|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

By 2016, Appian’s software platform had evolved to include broader aspects of application development with a focus on low-code development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article/344371/build-an-app-in-15-minutes-with-zero-coding-using-appian-qui|title=Build an App in 15 Minutes With Zero Coding Using Appian Quick Apps|last=Marvin|first=Rob|publisher=PC Mag|date=2016-05-12|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On May 25, 2017, Appian became a publicly-traded company, trading under the symbol APPN on the [[NASDAQ]] Global Exchange&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/25/appian-ipo-appn-stock-starts-trading-after-ipo.html|title=Appian shares soar more than 25% as the $75 million tech IPO hits the market|last=Balakrishnan|first=Anita|publisher=CNBC|date=2017-05-25|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/appian-shares-leap-35-after-ipo-1495734515|title=Appian Shares Leap 35% After IPO|last=Razumovskaya|first=Olga|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=2017-05-25|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Appian announced it will move its headquarters to [[Tysons Corner]], [[Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2018/april/headline-822700-en.html|title=Governor Northam Announces 600 New Jobs in Fairfax County

{{see also|Baseball broadcasting firsts|1939 in baseball|1939 in television}}

On August 26,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/archives/2009/08/70-years-ago-to.html 70 years ago today, the Dodgers made TV history]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/blogs/sports/watchdog-1.812020/major-league-baseball-made-tv-debut-70-years-ago-today-1.1395575 Major League Baseball made TV debut 70 years ago today]&lt;/ref&gt; the first ever Major League Baseball telecast (the [[1939 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]] vs. [[1939 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] from [[Ebbets Field]]) aired by [[W2XBS]], an experimental station in New York City which would ultimately become [[WNBC-TV]].

[[Red Barber]] called the game without the benefit of a monitor and with only two cameras capturing the game. One camera was on Barber and the other was behind the plate. Barber had to guess from which light was on and where it pointed.

In [[1939 in baseball|1939]], baseball games were usually covered by one camera providing a point-of-view along the third base line.

===1949===
{{main|1949 in baseball|1949 in television}}

#Equipment: Three [[black-and-white]] cameras,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2008-10-26-1948-world-series_N.htm Walker said Red Barber was among the announcers to handle the play-by-play duties of the games in Boston and critics complained the cameras often didn't show the part of the action he was describing. A regular-season game typically used two or three cameras, Walker said, but that would increase to four for special events such as the Series. (Fox is using 26 cameras this year.)]&lt;/ref&gt; all located on the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|Mezzanine level]].
#Camera lenses: Fixed, no zoom capabilities.
#Replays: None
#Graphics: None
#Audio: One microphone on the play-by-play announcer.

==1950s&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/baseballs_best/mlb_bb_library50.jsp Baseball's Best: 1950s]&lt;/ref&gt;==

===1951===
{{main|1951 in baseball|1951 in television}}

On August 11, 1951, [[WCBS-TV]] in New York City televised the first baseball game (in which the [[1951 Boston Braves season|Boston Braves]] beat the [[1951 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]] by the score of 8-1) in [[Television#color|color]].

On October 3 of that year, NBC aired the first [[East Coast of the United States|coast]]-to-[[West Coast of the United States|coast]] baseball telecast as the [[1951 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]] were beaten by the [[1951 New York Giants (MLB) season|New York Giants]] in the final game of a [[playoff]] series by the score of 5-4 (off [[Bobby Thomson]]'s [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|now-legendary home run]]).

===1953===
{{main|1953 in baseball|1953 in television}}

#Equipment: Four [[black-and-white]] cameras, all located on the [[Mezzanine level]].
#Camera lenses: Fixed, no zoom capabilities.
#Video: Quality of picture has improved since the 1940s.
#Replay: None

{{main|1957 in baseball|1957 in television}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/archives/2009/01/when-scully-tal.html As Bob Costas mentions on the MLB Network show, the great part about watching this game now is there's no center field camera, no replays, no different angles, very few graphics (except to put the players names in all caps with white letters), the announcers work alone, there's maybe something missing without any close-ups of the players and no bullpen shots. For a black-and-white telecast, it's pretty stark.]&lt;/ref&gt;

#Equipment: Four cameras&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/sites/nbcsports.com/files/1957_world_series_1.jpg |title=NBC gains television and radio rights to World Series |last= |first= |date= |website=NBC Sports History Page|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Mezzanine level]] while a fifth camera is added in center field.
#Camera lenses: Three fixed lenses on each camera that's manually rotated by a camera operator.
#Video: Quality of picture is a very sharp [[black-and-white]].
#Replays: None
#Graphics: White-text only; information about the balls and strikes are added.
#Broadcasters: Analysts added to broadcast alongside the play-by-play announcer.
#Audio: One mic is suspended from the press box for crowd noise.

{{main|1961 in baseball|1961 in television}}

#Equipment: Five cameras: Four on the [[Mezzanine level]] and one in center field.
#Camera lenses: Zoom capability existed albeit, limited.
#Video: [[Black-and-white]] picture quality has improved.
#Replays: Yes; regular speed; no longer than thirty seconds long at a line angle only.
#Graphics: White-text only including two lines of text.
#Audio: Improved - Audience can now hear the crack of the bat.

===1962===
{{main|1962 in baseball|1962 in television}}

On July 23, 1962, Major League Baseball had its first [[satellite]] telecast (via [[Telstar|Telstar Communications]]). The telecast included portion of a contest between the [[1962 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] vs. the [[1962 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] from [[Wrigley Field]] with [[Jack Brickhouse]] commentating on [[WGN-TV]].

===1969===
{{main|1969 in baseball|1969 in television}}

By [[1969 in television|1969]], the usage of [[chroma key]] (in which the commentators would open a telecast by standing in front of a [[greenscreen]] composite of the stadiums' crowds) became a common practice for baseball telecasts.

#Equipment: Five cameras: Four on the [[Mezzanine level]] and one in center field.
#Camera lenses: Zoom capability existed albeit, limited.
#Video: Color became an industry standard.
#Replays: Yes; regular speed; no longer than thirty seconds long at a line angle.
#Graphics: Electronic graphics introduced.
#Audio: Improved - Audience can now hear the crack of the bat.

===1974===
{{main|1974 in baseball|1974 in television}}

#Equipment: Seven cameras: One at first and third base each, one at home plate, one at center field, one at left field, and each in the dugout.
#Camera lenses: 18×1; the batter can now be seen from head to toe.
#Video: Color quality has improved since the 1960s.
#Replays: [[Slow motion|Slow-motion]] from all camera angles.
#Graphics: Video font with two color capabilities.
#Audio: [[Monaural|Mono.]] - much improved quality; an [[Sound effect|effect]] microphone is placed near the field.

===1975===
{{main|1975 in baseball|1975 in television}}

In the bottom of the 12th inning of Game 6 of the [[1975 World Series]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2015/10/21/game-changer-carlton-fisk-nbc-1975-world-series?xid=si_social|title=Game Changer: How Carlton Fisk's home run altered baseball and TV|last1=Verducci|first1=Tom|last2= |first2= |date=October 21, 2015|website=Sports Illustrated|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Boston]]'s [[Fenway Park]], [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] catcher [[Carlton Fisk]] was facing [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] pitcher [[Pat Darcy]]. Fisk then hit a pitch down the left field line that appeared to be heading to foul territory. The enduring image of Fisk jumping and waving the ball fair as he made his way to first base is arguably one of baseball's greatest moments. The ball struck the foul pole, giving the Red Sox a 7-6 win and forcing a seventh and deciding game of the Fall Classic. During this time, cameramen covering baseball games were instructed to follow the flight of the ball; reportedly, Fisk's reaction&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.218.69.11/search/cache?ei=UTF-8&amp;p=Mutual+Broadcasting+System+Major+League+Baseball&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;u=www.baseball-fever.com/archive/index.php/t-17096.html&amp;w=mutual+broadcasting+system+systems+major+majors+league+baseball&amp;d=F82G8OdmPcCb&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us In 1975 baseball announced a new kind of TV deal. Coverage of the World Series, playoffs, and All-Star Games would alternate between NBC and ABC. The networks saw the advantages: postseason baseball play was the perfect time to begin promoting the new fall TV season. Dual network coverage also brought an element of competition without economic overtones-quality of coverage. Then came October 21, 1975. The Boston Red Sox, unable to win a World Series since 1918, were on their way to a loss in six games to Cincinnati's "Big Red Machine". But a three-run pinch-hit homer by Bernie Carbo tied the game in the eighth, and in the twelfth (by then it was 12:34 a.m.) Carlton Fisk hit a solo shot over the "Green Monster" to win the game. Sixty-two million people saw it, and television couldn't have planned it better, because as Fisk hit his homer, the camera in the left field scoreboard followed him, not the ball, and on replay the audience saw Fisk furiously trying to wave the ball fair. It was the first-ever home run reaction shot. The next night, 75,890,000 people watched the seventh game, and baseball was definitely back. In 1976 baseball received revenue from radio and television approaching $51 million. Lou Harris said in 1977, "For the first time since 1968, more sports fans in the country follow baseball than football." Ten years later baseball received $350 million.]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; was only being recorded because [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] cameraman Lou Gerard, positioned inside Fenway's scoreboard at the base of the left-field [[Green Monster]] wall, had become distracted by a large rat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Lowitt]], "Rats!

Unlike Fox, TBS did not bludgeon the audience with an overabundance of crowd shots or fan interviews. Much of the camera work was exceptional. The close-ups of insects feasting on the neck of Yankees reliever Joba Chamberlain were so creepy that they could have been filmed by Wes Craven. For the most part, TBS did a nice job of letting the pictures work for them. Some of the graphics proved problematic, though. As SI's Tom Verducci pointed out, the Leadoff Line, the nine-foot arrow that measured the lead a runner gets off first base, overtly gimmicky and intrusive. Some SI.com readers complained that the graphic at the top of the screen showing how many runners were on base was too small. (To its credit, Behnke said that TBS adjusted it prior to the final game of the Indians-Yankees series by deepening the border and edgings.) Look for the same graphics to return for the LCS -- the Leadoff Line is sponsored by Travelers, not that most fans would know -- including the addition of microphones placed in the bases. "It's always a work in progress and we are our own worst critics," said Behnke, who averaged four hours of sleep during the Division Series. "We have this package for many years but I would say this: We are overwhelmingly deeply proud of what we have done through the divisional series and I can assure you that it will only be better when we done through the divisional series and I can assure you that it will only be better when we crank it up on Thursday."]&lt;/ref&gt; debuted various new looks, such as the first live online views from cameras in dugouts and ones focused on pitchers. TBS also introduced a graphic that creates sort of a rainbow to trace the arc of pitches on game replays. The graphic was superimposed in the studio so analysts like [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] for instance, could take virtual cuts at pitches thrown in games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2007-10-01-hiestand-weekend_N.htm "He'll be standing at a home plate with a bat," Behnke says.

The technology for the camera originated with the U.S. military looking at replays of missile impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hiestand: Costas' 12-year MLB playoff absence ends |author=Hiestand, Michael |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2012/10/09/hiestand-nfl-mlb-playoffs/1622587/ |newspaper=USA Today |date=10 October 2012 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dollar bill goes here.JPG|right|thumb|[[Vending machine|Slot]] to accept bills in change machine.]]
A '''change machine''' is a [[vending machine]] that accepts large denominations of [[currency]] and returns an equal amount of currency in smaller [[banknote|bills]] or [[coin]]s.  Typically these machines are used to provide coins in exchange for paper currency, in which case they are also often known as '''bill changers'''.

In the [[United States|US]], these devices are typically seen in the vicinity of machines that will not accept paper currency. This can be in a parking facility that has [[parking meter]]s, in [[laundromat]]s, or near [[vending machine]]s that lack [[bill validator]]s and don't accept paper currency.

Before the advent of ''coinless'' [[slot machine]]s, [[casino]]s would sometimes have change machines that would accept paper currency and return coins or tokens that could be used in the machines.  A similar arrangement has often been found at [[video arcade]]s.

In some cases, a machine may subtract a small amount (e.g. 5 cents) as a [[Fee|surcharge]] for the transaction.

'''Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence''' (a.k.a. '''CETI''') is a branch of the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] that focuses on composing and [[decipher]]ing [[interstellar messages]] that theoretically, could be understood by another technological civilization.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170628"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Steven |title=Greetings, E.T. (Please Don’t Murder Us.) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/magazine/greetings-et-please-dont-murder-us.html |date=28 June 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=28 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This field of study once was known as ''exosemiotics''.&lt;ref name="Reed2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Reed | first=Mary L | title=Exosemiotics: an inter-disciplinary approach | journal=Acta Astronautica | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=46 | issue=10-12 | year=2000 | issn=0094-5765 | doi=10.1016/s0094-5765(00)00037-0 | pages=719–723| bibcode=2000AcAau..46..719R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known CETI experiment of its kind was the 1974 [[Arecibo message]] composed by [[Frank Drake]].

There are multiple independent organizations and individuals engaged in CETI research; the generic application of abbreviations CETI and SETI ([[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]]) in this article should not be taken as referring to any particular organization (such as the [[SETI Institute]]).

CETI research has focused on four broad areas: [[mathematics|mathematical]] languages, pictorial systems such as the [[Arecibo message]], algorithmic communication systems (ACETI), and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering "natural" language communication. There remain many [[undeciphered writing systems]] in human communication, such as [[Linear A]], discovered by archeologists. Much of the research effort is directed at how to overcome similar problems of decipherment that arise in many scenarios of interplanetary communication.

On 13 February 2015, scientists (including [[Douglas Vakoch]], [[David Grinspoon]], [[Seth Shostak]], and [[David Brin]]) at an annual meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], discussed Active SETI and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] in the [[cosmos]] was a good idea.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150213"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2015-02-cosmos-risky.html|title=Should We Call the Cosmos Seeking ET?

== History ==

In the 19th century there were many books and articles about the possible inhabitants of other planets. Many people believed that intelligent beings might live on the [[Moon]], [[Mars]], and [[Venus]].&lt;ref name="Launius"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Launius | first=Roger D. | title=Venus-Earth-Mars: Comparative Climatology and the Search for Life in the Solar System | journal=Life | publisher=MDPI AG | volume=2 | issue=3 | date=19 September 2012 | issn=2075-1729 | doi=10.3390/life2030255 | pages=255–273| bibcode=2012Life....2..255L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since travel to other planets was not possible at that time, some people suggested ways to signal the extraterrestrials even before radio was discovered. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] is often credited with an [[Gauss's Pythagorean right triangle proposal|1820 proposal]] suggested that a giant triangle and three squares, the [[Pythagoras]], could be drawn on the [[Siberia]]n tundra. The outlines of the shapes would have been ten-mile-wide strips of pine forest, the interiors could be rye or wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Glenn|last=Garelik |first2=J. Madeleine|last2=Nash |first3=Richard|last3=Woodbury |title=Space: Onward to Mars|magazine=Time Magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967915,00.html|date=July 18, 1988|page=50|subscription=yes|volume=132|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|'''The Pythagoras]] [[Joseph Johann Littrow]] proposed in 1819 to use the Sahara as a sort of blackboard. Giant trenches several hundred yards wide could delineate twenty-mile-wide shapes. Then the trenches would be filled with water, and then enough kerosene could be poured on top of the water to burn for six hours. Using this method, a different signal could be sent every night.&lt;ref name="Moore2006"&gt;{{cite book | last=Moore | first=P. | title=Our Universe: An Introduction | publisher=AAPPL Artists &amp; Photographers Press, Limited | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-904332-41-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XC2CrRW01bMC&amp;pg=PA52 | access-date=23 July 2018 | page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, other astronomers were looking for signs of life on other planets. In 1822, [[Franz von Gruithuisen]] thought he saw a giant city and evidence of agriculture on the moon, but astronomers using more powerful instruments refuted his claims. Gruithuisen also believed he saw evidence of life on [[Venus]]. [[Ashen light]] had been observed on Venus, and he postulated that it was caused by a great fire festival put on by the inhabitants to celebrate their new emperor. Later he revised his position, stating that the Venusians could be burning their rainforest to make more farmland.&lt;ref&gt;Cattermole, P., &amp; Moore, P. (1997). Atlas of Venus. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1800s, the possibility of life on the moon was put to rest. Astronomers at that time believed in the [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Kant-Laplace hypothesis]], which stated that the farthest planets from the sun are the oldest—therefore Mars was more likely to have advanced civilizations than Venus.&lt;ref name="ebsolar"&gt;Owen, T. C. (2001) "Solar system: origin of the solar system", ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Deluxe CDROM edition&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent investigations focused on contacting Martians. In 1877 [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] announced he had discovered "canali" ("channels" in Italian, which occur naturally, and mistranslated as "canals", which are artificial) on Mars—this was followed by thirty years of Mars enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chayka |first1=Kyle |title=A Short History of Martian Canals and Mars Fever |url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a17529/a-short-history-of-martian-canals-and-mars-fever/ |website=popularmechanics.com |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Martian canals proved illusory.

The inventor [[Charles Cros]] was convinced that pinpoints of light observed on Mars and Venus were the lights of large cities. He spent years of his life trying to get funding for a giant mirror with which to signal the Martians. The mirror would be focused on the Martian desert, where the intense reflected sunlight could be used to burn figures into the Martian sand.&lt;ref name="Ley 1953 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Ley | first=W. | title=Rockets, missiles, and space travel | publisher=Viking Press | year=1953 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pZdTAAAAMAAJ | access-date=23 July 2018 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] mentioned many times during his career that he thought his inventions such as his [[Tesla coil]], used in the role of a [[Tesla coil#Utilization and production|"resonant receiver"]], could communicate with other planets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Seifer| first =Marc J.| title =Wizard: the life and times of Nikola Tesla: biography of a genius| publisher =Carol Pub.| year =1996| location =Secaucus, New Jersey|chapter=Martian Fever (1895-1896)| isbn = 978-1-55972-329-9 | oclc = 33865102| page =157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| date=July 20, 1931| title=Tesla at 75| periodical=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|volume=18|issue=3|pages=3|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,742063-3,00.html| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he even had observed repetitive signals of what he believed were extraterrestrial radio communications coming from Venus or Mars in 1899. These "signals" turned out to be terrestrial radiation, however.

Around 1900, the [[Guzman Prize]] was created; the first person to establish interplanetary communication would be awarded 100,000 francs under one stipulation: Mars was excluded because Madame Guzman thought communicating with Mars would be too easy to deserve a prize.&lt;ref&gt;Ley, Willy. Rockets, Missiles, and Space Travel (revised). New York: The Viking Press (1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical and scientific languages==

===Lincos (Lingua cosmica)===
{{main|Lincos (artificial language)}}
Published in 1960 by [[Hans Freudenthal]], ''Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse'',  expands upon Astraglossa to create a general-purpose language derived from basic mathematics and logic symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Freudenthal H |year=1960 |title=Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse. Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics (Book 28) | publisher=North-Holland, Amsterdam| ISBN=978-0-444-53393-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several researchers have expanded further upon Freudenthal's work. A dictionary resembling Lincos was featured in the Carl Sagan novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'' and film adaptation.

===Astraglossa===
Published in 1963 by [[Lancelot Hogben]], "Astraglossa" is an essay describing a system for combining numbers and operators in a series of short and long pulses. In Hogben's system, short pulses represent numbers, while trains of long pulses represent symbols for addition, subtraction, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hogben, Lancelot |title= Science in Authority |publisher= New York: W. W. Norton |year=1963 |ISBN=1245639935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carl Sagan ===
In the 1985 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'', [[Carl Sagan]] explored in some depth how a message might be constructed to allow communication with an alien civilization, using [[prime number]]s as a starting point, followed by various universal principles and facts of [[mathematics]] and science.

Sagan also edited a nonfiction book on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl. [[Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence]]. MIT Press, 1973, 428 pgs.{{ISBN|0262191067}}&lt;/ref&gt; An updated collection of articles on the same topic was published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Vakoch, Douglas. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4oxZgRn3QFYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22communication+with+extraterrestrial+intelligence%22+vakoch&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wrekTd_BGc7TiAKPupDjCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence]. SUNY Press, 2011, 500 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival (film)===
In 2016, [[McGill University]] Linguistics Professor, [[Jessica Coon]], spoke with Business Insider about how 2016 sci-fi blockbuster, [[Arrival (film)|''Arrival'']], properly portrayed how humans might actually communicate with aliens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Arrival' nails how humans might actually talk to aliens, a linguist says|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/alien-language-in-arrival-linguist-2016-11|website = Business Insider|accessdate = 2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; To create this language, film producers consulted with [[Wolfram Research]] Founder and CEO, [[Stephen Wolfram]] - creator of the computer programming language known as the [[Wolfram Language]] - and his son, Christopher. Together, they helped analyze approximately 100 [[logograms]] that ultimately served as the basis for the [[alien language]] utilized throughout the film. This work, along with many other thoughts with regard to artificial intelligence communication has been documented in an interview published by Space.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Arrival', AI and Alien Math: Q&amp;A with Stephen Wolfram|url = https://www.space.com/34783-stephen-wolfram-arrival-interview.html|website = Space.com|accessdate = 2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During production, Wolfram's personal copy of [[Lincos (artificial language)|''Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse'']] was also on set.

===A language based on the fundamental facts of science===
Published in 1992 by Carl Devito and Richard Oehrle, ''A language based on the fundamental facts of science'' is a paper describing a language similar in syntax to Astraglossa and Lincos, but which builds its vocabulary around known physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Devito, C. | author2=Oerle, R | last-author-amp=yes |title=A Language Based on the Fundamental Facts of Science| journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |year=1990| volume= 43 | pages=561–568 | PMID= 11540499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Busch general-purpose binary language used in Lone Signal transmissions===
In 2010, Michael W. Busch created a general-purpose binary language &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Testing SETI Messages Design |first1=Michael W. |last1=Busch |first2=Rachel M. |last2=Reddick |work=Astrobiology Science Conference 2010 |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2010/pdf/5070.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HnXxFGgj?url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2010/pdf/5070.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}; {{allow wrap|{{cite journal|title=Testing SETI Messages (Extended version) |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/lonesignal-prod-web/ENCODING-MWB_PAPER.pdf |first1=Michael W. |last1=Busch |first2=Rachel.

This was followed by an attempt to extend the syntax used in the Lone Signal hailing message to communicate in a way that, while neither mathematical nor strictly logical, was nonetheless understandable given the prior definition of terms and concepts in the Lone Signal hailing message.&lt;ref name="Extending the syntax used by the Lone Signal Active SETI project"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Extending the syntax used by the Lone Signal Active SETI project |first1=Charles R. |last1=Chapman |work= |url=http://sites.google.com/site/lonesignalactiveseti/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IqrYp0fX?url=https://sites.google.com/site/lonesignalactiveseti/ |archivedate=2013-08-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pictorial messages==
Pictorial communication systems seek to describe fundamental mathematical or physical concepts via simplified diagrams sent as [[bitmap]]s. These messages presume that the recipient has similar visual capabilities and can understand basic mathematics and geometry. A common critique of these systems is that they presume a shared understanding of special shapes, which may not be the case with a species with substantially different vision, and therefore a different way of interpreting visual information. For instance, an arrow representing the movement of some object could be interpreted as a weapon firing.

===Pioneer probes===
The two [[Pioneer plaque]]s were launched on [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11]] in 1972 and 1973, depicting the location of the Earth in the galaxy and the solar system, and the form of the human body.

===Voyager probes===
Launched in 1977, the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes carried two [[Voyager Golden Record|golden records]] that were inscribed with diagrams depicting the human form, our solar system, and its location. Also included were recordings of images and sounds from Earth.

===The Arecibo message===
The [[Arecibo message]], transmitted in 1974, was a 1679 [[pixel]] image with 73 rows and 23 columns. It shows the numbers one through ten, the atomic numbers of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus, the formulas for the sugars and bases in the nucleotides of DNA, the number of nucleotides in DNA, the double helix structure of DNA, a figure of a human being and its height, the population of Earth, a diagram of our solar system, and an image of the Arecibo telescope with its diameter.

===Cosmic Call messages===
The ''[[Cosmic Call]]'' messages consisted of a few digital sections - "Rosetta Stone", copy of Arecibo Message, Bilingual Image Glossary, the Braastad message, as well as text, audio, video, and other image files submitted for transmission by everyday people around the world. The "Rosetta Stone" was composed by [[Stephane Dumas]] and [[Yvan Dutil]] and represents a multi-page bitmap that builds a vocabulary of symbols representing numbers and mathematical operations. The message proceeds from basic mathematics to progressively more complex concepts, including physical processes and objects (such as a [[hydrogen]] atom). The message is designed with a noise resistant format and characters that make it resistant to alteration by noise. These messages were transmitted in 1999 and 2003 from [[Evpatoria Planetary Radar]] under scientific guidance of [[Alexander L. Zaitsev]]. Richard Braastad coordinated the overall project.

Star systems to which messages were sent, are the following:&lt;ref name="cplire.ru"&gt;[http://www.cplire.ru/rus/ra&amp;sr/VAK-2004.html Передача и поиски разумных сигналов во Вселенной&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multi-modal messages==

===Teen-Age Message===
{{Main|Teen Age Message}}
The ''[[Teen Age Message|Teen-Age Message]]'', composed by [[Russia]]n scientists ([[Aleksandr Leonidovich Zaitsev|Zaitsev]], Gindilis, Pshenichner, Filippova) and teens, was transmitted from the [[Evpatoria Planetary Radar|70-m dish of Evpatoria Deep Space Center]] to six star systems resembling that of the Sun on August 29 and September 3 and 4, 2001. The message consists of three parts:

Section 1 represents a coherent-sounding radio signal with slow Doppler wavelength tuning to imitate transmission from the Sun's center. This signal was transmitted in order to help extraterrestrials detect the TAM and diagnose the radio propagation effect of the interstellar medium.

Section 2 is analog information representing musical melodies performed on the [[theremin]]. This electric musical instrument produces a quasi-monochromatic signal, which is easily detectable across interstellar distances. There were seven musical compositions in the First Theremin Concert for Aliens. The 14-minute analog transmission of the theremin concert would take almost 50 hours by digital means; see [http://www.faces-from-earth.net/images/Files/Zaitsev_JCTE1107.pdf The First Musical Interstellar Radio Message].

Section 3 represents a well-known Arecibo-like binary digital information: the logotype of the TAM, bilingual Russian and English greeting to aliens, and image glossary.

Star systems to which the message was sent are the following:&lt;ref name="cplire.ru"/&gt;

===Cosmic Call 2 (Cosmic Call 2003) message===
The [[Cosmic Call]]-2 message contained text, images, video, music, the Dutil/Dumas message, a copy of the 1974 Arecibo message, BIG = Bilingual Image Glossary, the AI program ''Ella'', and the Braastad message.

==Algorithmic messages==
Algorithmic communication systems are a relatively new field within CETI. In these systems, which build upon early work on mathematical languages, the sender describes a small set of mathematic and logic symbols that form the basis for a rudimentary programming language that the recipient can run on a [[virtual machine]]. Algorithmic communication has a number of advantages over static pictorial and mathematical messages,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009|reason=cite a reliable source that says this}} including: localized communication (the recipient can probe and interact with the programs within a message, without transmitting a reply to the sender and then waiting years for a response), [[forward error correction]] (the message might contain algorithms that process data elsewhere in the message), and the ability to embed proxy agents within the message. In principle, a sophisticated program when run on a fast enough computing substrate, may exhibit complex behavior and perhaps, intelligence.

===CosmicOS===
''[[CosmicOS]]'', designed by Paul Fitzpatrick at [[MIT]], describes a [[virtual machine]] that is derived from [[lambda calculus]].

===Logic Gate Matrices===
''Logic Gate Matrices'' (a.k.a. LGM), developed by Brian McConnell, describes a universal [[virtual machine]] that is constructed by connecting coordinates in an n-dimensional space via mathematics and logic operations, for example: (1,0,0) &lt;-- (OR (0,0,1) (0,0,2)). Using this method, one may describe an arbitrarily complex computing substrate as well as the instructions to be executed on it.{{Clarify|date=March 2009|relevance to communication? Form of compression maybe?}}

==Natural language messages==
This research focuses on the event that we receive a signal or message that is either not directed at us (eavesdropping) or one that is in its natural communicative form. To tackle this difficult, but probable scenario, methods are being developed that first, will detect if a signal has structure indicative of an intelligent source, categorize the type of structure detected, and then decipher its content: from its physical level encoding and patterns to the parts-of-speech that encode internal and external ontologies.&lt;ref name=Elliott04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott01 /&gt;

Primarily, this structure modeling focuses on the search for generic human and inter-species language universals to devise computational methods by which language may be discriminated from non-language and core structural syntactic elements of unknown languages may be detected.&lt;ref name=Elliott00a /&gt; Aims of this research include: contributing to the understanding of language structure and the detection of intelligent language-like features in signals, to aid the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;ref name=Elliott02a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott02b /&gt;

The problem goal is therefore to separate language from non-language without dialogue, and learn something about the structure of language in the passing. The language may not be human (animals, aliens, computers...), the perceptual space may be unknown, and we cannot presume human language structure, but must begin somewhere. We need to approach the language signal from a naive viewpoint, in effect, increasing our ignorance and assuming as little as possible.&lt;ref name=Elliott00b /&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott07 /&gt;

If a sequence can be tokenized, that is, separated into "words", an unknown human language may be distinguished from many other data sequences by the frequency distribution of the tokens. Human languages conform to a [[Zipf's law|Zipfian distribution]], while many (but not all) other data sequences do not. It has been proposed that an alien language also might conform to such a distribution (&lt;ref name=Elliott00b /&gt;). When displayed in a log-log graph of frequency vs. rank, this distribution would appear as a somewhat straight line with a slope of approximately -1. [[SETI]] scientist [[Laurance Doyle]] explains that the slope of a line that represents individual [[Tokenizing#Token|tokens]] in a stream of tokens may indicate whether the stream contains linguistic or other structured content. If the line angles at 45°, the stream contains such content. If the line is flat, it does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Freeman|first=David|title='Through The Wormhole' Host Morgan Freeman: 'We Can't Be' Alone In The Universe (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/05/morgan-freeman_n_1322480.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=25 May 2013|date=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Through the Wormhole: Information Theory : Video : Science Channel|url=http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/through-the-wormhole/videos/through-the-wormhole-information-theory.htm|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interspecies communication ==
Some researchers have concluded that in order to communicate with extraterrestrial species, humanity must first try to communicate with Earth's intelligent animal species. [[John C. Lilly]] worked on with [[interspecies communication]] by teaching dolphins English (successful with rhythms, not with understandability, given their different mouth/blowhole shapes). He practiced various disciplines of spirituality and also  ingested [[psychedelic drug]]s such as [[LSD]] and (later) [[ketamine]] in the company of dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-ketamine-secrets-of-segas-ecco-the-dolphin-347 /the-ketamine-secrets-of-segas-ecco-the-dolphin]&lt;/ref&gt;  He tried to determine whether he could communicate non-verbally with dolphins, and also tried to determine if some extraterrestrial radio signals are intelligent communications.  Similarly, [[Laurance Doyle]],{{CN|date=November 2018}} [[Robert Freitas]]{{CN|date=November 2018}} and [[Brenda McCowan]]{{CN|date=November 2018}} compare the complexity of cetacean and human languages to help determine whether a specific signal from space is complex enough to represent a message that needs to be decoded.

'''Configuration management''' ('''CM''') is a [[systems engineering]] process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=202239 |title=''MIL-HDBK-61A, ""Military Handbook: Configuration Management Guidance'' |publisher=Department of Defense |date=7 February 2001 |accessdate=2012-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320093634/https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=202239 |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geia.org/ANSI-EIA-649-A-Standard----NATIONAL-CONSENSUS-STANDARD-FOR-CONFIGURATION-MANAGEMENT- |title=''ANSI/EIA-649B, ""National Consensus Standard for Configuration Management'' |publisher=TechAmerica |date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801125835/http://www.geia.org/ANSI-EIA-649-A-Standard----NATIONAL-CONSENSUS-STANDARD-FOR-CONFIGURATION-MANAGEMENT- |archivedate=1 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The CM process is widely used by military engineering organizations to manage changes throughout the [[system lifecycle]] of [[complex system]]s, such as [[weapon]] systems, [[military vehicles]], and [[information system]]s. Outside the military, the CM process is also used with IT service management as defined by [[ITIL]], and with other [[domain model]]s in the civil engineering and other [[industrial engineering]] segments such as roads, bridges, [[canal]]s, dams, and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History and Heritage of Civil Engineering |work=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] |url=http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216235716/http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 February 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-08 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institution of Civil Engineers What is Civil Engineering |work=[[Institution of Civil Engineers|ICE]] |url=http://www.ice.org.uk/downloads//little_book_full_colour.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923023137/http://www.ice.org.uk/downloads//little_book_full_colour.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-23 |accessdate=2007-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Configuration Management and the Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) National Lessons Learned Program''|work=Federal Transportation Administration|url=http://www.pacotechnologies.com/Pages/FTA-National-Lessons-Learned-Program.aspx|accessdate=2007-09-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907165342/http://www.pacotechnologies.com/Pages/FTA-National-Lessons-Learned-Program.aspx|archivedate=7 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
CM applied over the life cycle of a system provides visibility and control of its performance, functional, and physical attributes. CM verifies that a system performs as intended, and is identified and documented in sufficient detail to support its projected life cycle. The CM process facilitates orderly management of system information and system changes for such beneficial purposes as to revise capability; improve performance, reliability, or maintainability; extend life; reduce cost; reduce risk and liability; or correct defects. The relatively minimal cost of implementing CM is returned many fold in cost avoidance. The lack of CM, or its ineffectual implementation, can be very expensive and sometimes can have such catastrophic consequences such as failure of equipment or loss of life.

CM emphasizes the functional relation between parts, subsystems, and systems for effectively controlling system change. It helps to verify that proposed changes are systematically considered to minimize adverse effects. Changes to the system are proposed, evaluated, and implemented using a standardized, systematic approach that ensures consistency, and proposed changes are evaluated in terms of their anticipated impact on the entire system. CM verifies that changes are carried out as prescribed and that documentation of items and systems reflects their true configuration. A complete CM program includes provisions for the storing, tracking, and updating of all system information on a component, subsystem, and system basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |title=''Systems Engineering Fundamentals'' |publisher=Defense Acquisition University Press |date=January 2001 |accessdate=2012-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211165311/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |archivedate=11 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A structured CM program ensures that documentation (e.g., requirements, design, test, and acceptance documentation) for items is accurate and consistent with the actual physical design of the item. In many cases, without CM, the documentation exists but is not consistent with the item itself. For this reason, engineers, contractors, and management are frequently forced to develop documentation reflecting the actual status of the item before they can proceed with a change. This [[reverse engineering]] process is wasteful in terms of human and other resources and can be minimized or eliminated using CM.

==History==
Configuration Management originated in the [[United States Department of Defense]] in the 1950s as a technical management discipline for hardware material items—and it is now a standard practice in virtually every industry. The CM process became its own technical discipline sometime in the late 1960s when the DoD developed a series of [[United States Military Standard|military standards]] called the "480 series" (i.e., MIL-STD-480, MIL-STD-481 and MIL-STD-483) that were subsequently issued in the 1970s. In 1991, the "480 series" was consolidated into a single standard known as the MIL–STD–973 that was then replaced by MIL–HDBK–61 pursuant to a general DoD goal that reduced the number of military standards in favor of industry [[technical standards]] supported by [[standards organization|standards developing organizations]] (SDO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=32397 |title=''Memorandum, Specifications and Standards – A New Way of Doing Business'' |publisher=Secretary of Defense |date=29 June 1994 |accessdate=2012-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021123641/https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=32397 |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the beginning of what has now evolved into the most widely distributed and accepted standard on CM, [[ANSI–EIA–649]]–1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.wcupa.edu/~yang/495ppt/config_management.pdf |title=''Configuration Management Compliance Validation: Critical Review and Technology Assessment(CR/TA)Report'' |publisher=Defense Technical Information Center |date= |accessdate=14 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now widely adopted by numerous organizations and agencies, the CM discipline's concepts include [[systems engineering]] (SE), [[Integrated Logistics Support]] (ILS), [[Capability Maturity Model Integration]] (CMMI), [[ISO 9000]], [[Prince2]] project management method, [[COBIT]], [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library]] (ITIL), [[product lifecycle management]], and [[Application Lifecycle Management]].  Many of these functions and models have redefined CM from its traditional holistic approach to technical management. Some treat CM as being similar to a librarian activity, and break out change control or change management as a separate or stand alone discipline.

==Overview==

CM is the practice of handling changes systematically so that a [[system]] maintains its [[system integrity | integrity]] over time. CM implements the policies, procedures, techniques, and tools that manage, evaluate proposed changes, track the status of changes, and maintain an inventory of system and support documents as the system changes. CM programs and plans provide technical and administrative direction to the development and implementation of the procedures, functions, services, tools, processes, and resources required to successfully develop and support a complex system. During system development, CM allows [[program management]] to track requirements throughout the life-cycle through acceptance and operations and maintenance. As changes inevitably occur in the requirements and design, they must be approved and documented, creating an accurate record of the system status. Ideally the CM process is applied throughout the [[system lifecycle]]. Most professionals mix up or get confused with [[Asset management]] (AM), where it inventories the assets on hand. The key difference between CM and AM is that the former does not manage the financial accounting aspect but on service that the system supports.

The CM process for both hardware- and software-configuration items comprises five distinct disciplines as established in the MIL–HDBK–61A&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
and in ANSI/EIA-649. These disciplines are carried out{{by whom?|date=July 2016}} as policies and procedures for establishing [[Baseline_(configuration_management)|baselines]] and for performing a standard [[change management | change-management]] process.  The [[IEEE 12207]] process IEEE 12207.2 also has these activities and adds "Release management and delivery".

The five disciplines are:

# CM Planning and Management: a formal document and plan to guide the CM program that includes items such as: 
#* personnel
#* responsibilities and resources
#* training requirements
#* administrative meeting guidelines, including a definition of procedures and tools
#* baselining processes
#* configuration control and configuration-status accounting
#* naming conventions
#* audits and reviews
#* subcontractor/vendor CM requirements
# Configuration Identification (CI): consists of setting and maintaining baselines, which define the system or subsystem architecture, components, and any developments at any point in time. It is the basis by which changes to any part of a system are identified, documented, and later tracked through design, development, testing, and final delivery. CI incrementally establishes and maintains the definitive current basis for Configuration Status Accounting (CSA) of a system and its [[configuration item]]s (CIs) throughout their lifecycle (development, production, deployment, and operational support) until disposal.
# Configuration Control: includes the evaluation of all change-requests and change-proposals, and their subsequent approval or disapproval. It covers the process of controlling modifications to the system's design, hardware, firmware, software, and documentation.
# Configuration Status Accounting: includes the process of recording and reporting configuration item descriptions (e.g., hardware, software, firmware, etc.) and all departures from the baseline during design and production. In the event of suspected problems, the verification of baseline configuration and approved modifications can be quickly determined.
# Configuration Verification and Audit: an independent review of hardware and software for the purpose of assessing compliance with established performance requirements, commercial and appropriate military standards, and functional, allocated, and product baselines. Configuration audits verify that the system and subsystem configuration documentation complies with the functional and physical performance characteristics before acceptance into an architectural baseline.

==Software==
{{main|Software configuration management}}

The traditional software configuration management (SCM) process is looked upon by practitioners as the best solution to handling changes in software projects. It identifies the functional and physical attributes of software at various points in time, and performs systematic control of changes to the identified attributes for the purpose of maintaining software integrity and traceability throughout the software development life cycle.

The SCM process further defines the need to trace changes, and the ability to verify that the final delivered software has all of the planned enhancements that are supposed to be included in the release. It identifies four procedures that must be defined for each software project to ensure that a sound SCM process is implemented. They are:
#Configuration identification
#Configuration control
#Configuration status accounting
#Configuration audits

These terms and definitions change from standard to standard, but are essentially the same.

*Configuration identification is the process of identifying the attributes that define every aspect of a configuration item.  A configuration item is a product (hardware and/or software) that has an end-user purpose.  These attributes are recorded in configuration documentation and baselined. [[Baseline (configuration management)|Baselining]] an attribute forces formal configuration change control processes to be effected in the event that these attributes are changed.
*Configuration change control is a set of processes and approval stages required to change a configuration item's attributes and to re-baseline them.
*Configuration status accounting is the ability to record and report on the configuration baselines associated with each configuration item at any moment of time.
*Configuration audits are broken into functional and [[physical configuration audit]]s.  They occur either at delivery or at the moment of effecting the change.  A functional configuration audit ensures that functional and performance attributes of a configuration item are achieved, while a physical configuration audit ensures that a configuration item is installed in accordance with the requirements of its detailed design documentation.

=== Configuration management database ===
The [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library]] (ITIL) specifies the use of a Configuration management system (CMS) or [[Configuration management database]] (CMDB) as a means of achieving industry best practices for Configuration Management.  CMDBs are used to track Configuration Items (CIs) and the dependencies between them, where CIs represent the things in an enterprise that are worth tracking and managing, such as but not limited to computers, software, software licenses, racks, network devices, storage, and even the components within such items.

The benefits of a CMS/CMDB includes being able to perform functions like root cause analysis, impact analysis, change management, and current state assessment for future state strategy development. Example systems, commonly identifies themselves as [[IT service management|IT Service Management (ITSM)]] systems, include FreshService, ServiceNow and Samanage.

=== Information assurance ===
For [[information assurance]], CM can be defined as the management of security features and assurances through control of changes made to hardware, software, firmware, documentation, test, test fixtures, and test documentation throughout the life cycle of an information system.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Information Systems Security Glossary]]&lt;/ref&gt; CM for information assurance, sometimes referred to as '''S'''ecure '''C'''onfiguration '''M'''anagement, relies upon performance, functional, and physical attributes of IT platforms and products and their environments to determine the appropriate security features and assurances that are used to measure a system configuration state. For example, configuration requirements may be different for a [[network firewall]] that functions as part of an organization's Internet boundary versus one that functions as an internal local [[network firewall]].

==Maintenance systems==

Configuration management is used to maintain an understanding of the status of complex assets with a view to maintaining the highest level of serviceability for the lowest cost. Specifically, it aims to ensure that operations are not disrupted due to the asset (or parts of the asset) overrunning limits of planned lifespan or below quality levels.

In the military, this type of activity is often classed as "mission readiness", and seeks to define which assets are available and for which type of mission; a classic example is whether aircraft on board an aircraft carrier are equipped with bombs for ground support or missiles for defense.

===Operating System configuration management===
Configuration management can be used to maintain [[Operating system|OS]] configuration files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C. Lueninghoener|title=Getting Started with Configuration Management. ;login: issue:  April 2011, Volume 36, Number 2|url=https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/105457-Lueninghoener.pdf|accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Example systems include [[Ansible (software)|Ansible]], [[Bcfg2]], [[CFEngine]], [[Chef (software)|Chef]], [[Otter (software)|Otter]], [[Puppet (software)|Puppet]], [[Quattor]], [[SaltStack]], and [[Vagrant (software)|Vagrant]].

A theory of configuration maintenance was worked out by [[Mark Burgess (computer scientist)|Mark Burgess]],&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgess, Cfengine: a site configuration engine, USENIX Computing systems, Vol8, No. 3 1995 [https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/compsystems/1995/sum_burgess.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgess, On the theory of system administration, Science of Computer Programming 49, 2003. p1-46 [http://research.iu.hio.no/papers/sysadmtheory3.pdf pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724180113/http://research.iu.hio.no/papers/sysadmtheory3.pdf |date=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgess, Configurable immunity for evolving human-computer systems, Science of Computer Programming 51 2004, p197-213 [http://research.iu.hio.no/papers/immunity.pdf pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303000000/http://research.iu.hio.no/papers/immunity.pdf |date=3 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a practical implementation on present day computer systems in the software [[CFEngine]] able to perform real time repair as well as preventive maintenance.

===Preventive maintenance===
{{Main|Preventive maintenance}}
Understanding the "as is" state of an asset and its major components is an essential element in preventive maintenance as used in maintenance, repair, and overhaul and [[enterprise asset management]] systems.

Complex assets such as aircraft, ships, industrial machinery etc. depend on many different components being serviceable. This serviceability is often defined in terms of the amount of usage the component has had since it was new, since fitted, since repaired, the amount of use it has had over its life and several other limiting factors. Understanding how near the end of their life each of these components is has been a major undertaking involving labor-intensive record keeping until recent developments in software.

===Predictive maintenance===
{{Main|Predictive maintenance}}
Many types of component use electronic sensors to capture data which provides live [[condition monitoring]]. This data is analyzed on board or at a remote location by computer to evaluate its current serviceability and increasingly its likely future state using algorithms which predict potential future failures based on previous examples of failure through field experience and modeling. This is the basis for "predictive maintenance".

Availability of accurate and timely data is essential in order for CM to provide operational value and a lack of this can often be a limiting factor. Capturing and disseminating the operating data to the various support organizations is becoming an industry in itself.

The consumers of this data have grown more numerous and complex with the growth of programs offered by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). These are designed to offer operators guaranteed availability and make the picture more complex with the operator managing the asset but the OEM taking on the liability to ensure its serviceability.

==Construction==
More recently configuration management has been applied to large construction projects which can often be very complex and have a huge amount of details and changes that need to be documented. Construction agencies such as the Federal Highway Administration have used configuration management for their infrastructure projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Configuration Management for Transportation Management Systems Handbook''|work=Federal Highway Administration |url=http://www.everyspec.com/DOT/FHWA-OP-04-013_SEP2003_41209/ |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are construction-based configuration management tools that aim to document change orders and RFIs in order to ensure a project stays on schedule and on budget. These programs can also store information to aid in the maintenance and modification of the infrastructure when it is completed.  One such application, ccsNet, was tested in a case study funded by the Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) in which the efficacy of configuration management was measured through comparing the approximately 80% complete construction of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Agency (LACMTA) 1st and 2nd segments of the Red Line, a $5.3&amp;nbsp;billion rail construction project.  This study yielded results indicating a benefit to using configuration management on projects of this nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Configuration Management Case Study''|work=PACO Technologies, Inc|url=http://www.pacotechnologies.com/Pages/Case-Study.aspx|accessdate=28 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826174139/http://www.pacotechnologies.com/Pages/Case-Study.aspx|archivedate=26 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Decapping''' (decapsulation) or '''delidding''' of an [[integrated circuit]] is the process of removing the protective cover of a microchip so that the contained [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] is revealed for [[visual inspection]] of the micro circuitry imprinted on the die. This process is typically done in order to debug a manufacturing problem with the chip, or possibly to copy information from the device. Modern integrated circuits can be encapsulated in plastic, [[ceramic]], or epoxy.

Decapping is usually carried out by chemical etching of the covering, laser cutting, or mechanical removal of the cover using a [[Milling (machining)|milling machine]]. The process can be either destructive or non-destructive.

A '''dew warning''', also known as a '''dew alarm''' or '''dew signal''', is an [[error]] indication on [[VCR]]s and [[camcorder]]s if the VCR/camcorder develops [[dew]] inside the unit from being exposed to extreme temperature and/or humidity changes.&lt;ref&gt;Almost every tape based video recorder's user manual or service manual.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of moisture between the tape and the rotating head drum increases friction which prevents correct operation and can cause damage to both the recording device and the tape.  In extreme cases, if the dew sensor fails to function and stop the video recorder, moisture can cause the tape to stick to the spinning video head.  This can pull a large amount of tape from the cassette before the head drum stops spinning.  The tape will be extensively damaged, the video heads will often become clogged, and the mechanism may be unable to eject the cassette.

The dew sensor itself is mounted very close to the video head drum.  Contrary to how one might expect this to behave, the sensor increases its resistance when moisture is present.  Poor contacts on the sensor can therefore be a cause of random dew sensor warnings.

Usually, a "DEW" indicator or error code lights up on the display of most VCRs/camcorders, and on some, a [[buzzer]] may sound.

A '''digital strategy''' is a form of&amp;nbsp;[[strategic management]] and a business answer or response to a digital question,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.gartner.com/dave-aron/2013/11/12/the-difference-between-it-strategy-and-digital-strategy/|title=The Difference Between IT Strategy and Digital Strategy - Dave Aron|date=2013-11-12|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; often best addressed as part of an overall [[business strategy]]. A digital strategy is often characterized by the application of new technologies to existing business activity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/blogs-digital-what-is-digital-strategy|title=What Is A Digital Strategy? - Accenture|website=www.accenture.com|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or a focus on the enablement of new digital capabilities to their business&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/global/home/what-we-think/digitization/digital-strategy-capabilities|title=Digitization {{!}} Digital strategy and capabilities to win in a digitized world {{!}} PwC’s Strategy&amp;|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as those created by the&amp;nbsp;[[Information Age]]&amp;nbsp;and often as a result of advancements in digital technologies such as&amp;nbsp;[[Digital computers|computers]],&amp;nbsp;[[Digital data|data]],&amp;nbsp;[[telecommunication]]s,&amp;nbsp;[[Internet]], etc.). As is the case with its&amp;nbsp;[[business strategy]]&amp;nbsp;parent, a digital strategy can be formulated and implemented through a variety of different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Business_Strategy/Approaches_to_Strategic_Management|title=Business Strategy/Approaches to Strategic Management - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formulation often includes the process of specifying an organization's vision, goals, opportunities and related activities in order to maximize the business benefits of digital initiatives to an organization. These can range from an enterprise focus, which considers the broader opportunities and risks digital can create and often includes&amp;nbsp;[[customer intelligence]], collaboration, new product/market exploration, sales and service optimization,&amp;nbsp;[[Enterprise architecture|enterprise technology architectures and processes]], innovation and governance; to more marketing and customer-focused efforts such as web sites, mobile,&amp;nbsp;[[E-commerce|eCommerce]], social, site and&amp;nbsp;[[search engine optimization]], and advertising.

==Overview==
The digital strategy is part of the business strategy and experts maintain that it cannot be effective or successful if built independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Marketing Strategy: An Integrated Approach to Online Marketing|last=Kingsnorth|first=Simon|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|year=2016|isbn=9780749474706|location=London|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that it represents how the business strategy is influenced by leveraging digital resources to create differential value.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=10th European Conference on Information Systems Management: ECISM 2016|last=Silva|first=Paulo|last2=Guerreiro|first2=Antonio|last3=Quaresma|first3=Rui|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International Ltd.|year=2016|isbn=9781911218050|location=Reading, UK|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, it reshapes traditional organizational strategies into modular, distributed, cross-functional, and global business processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There, are numerous approaches to conducting digital strategy, but at their core, all go through four steps:&lt;ref name="mash1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Macala|title=How to Develop Your Digital Strategy|url=http://mashable.com/2012/09/05/how-to-digital-strategy/|accessdate=2 November 2013|newspaper=Mashable.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#identifying the opportunities and/or challenges in a business where online assets can provide a solution;
#identifying the unmet needs and goals of the external stakeholders that most closely align with those key business opportunities and/or challenges;&lt;ref&gt;Center for Digital Strategies (2003): ''[http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/digital/Programs/CorporateEvents/EnablingCustFocusdOrg/Overview_Article.pdf Enabling a Customer-Focused Organization: Thought Leadership Summit on Digital Strategies]'',  Center for Digital Strategies at the Tuck School of Business and Cisco Systems&lt;/ref&gt; 
#developing a vision around how the online assets will fulfill those business and external stakeholder needs, goals, opportunities and challenges,&lt;ref&gt;Quinn (2006):  ''[http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/digital/PressHits/SCMQA.pdf Ready for the Digital Future?]'',pg. 30-31, Supply Chain Management Review.&lt;/ref&gt; and 
#prioritizing a set of online initiatives which can deliver on this vision.
Within each of those stages, a number of techniques and analyses may be employed.

===Identifying the key opportunities and/or challenges in a business===
*Stakeholder interviews
Includes one-on-one interviews, group interviews and workshops with a company's senior management, marketing and sales, operations and service stakeholders with a goal of understanding the business strategy, challenges and opportunities, products, organization, processes, supply chain and vendors, distributors, customers, and competitive landscape, as well as the potential role of their online assets.

*[[Competitor analysis]]
Includes evaluations of a company's main competitors and potential substitutes with the goal of understanding a company's strengths and weaknesses relative to their competitors and potential substitutes.  While this often includes steps found in traditional marketing competitor analysis, such as products, prices, etc.  Competitor analysis includes two unique items:

:#[[Heuristic evaluation]]: An evaluation by an expert of the usability and user experience of a company's online assets compared and contrasted to those of its competitors and potential substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen (2004):  ''[http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040119.html How Big is the Difference Between Websites?]'', Jakob Nielsen''s Alertbox.&lt;/ref&gt;
:#Features/functionality analysis: An evaluation of the features and functionality provided by a company's online assets, compared and contrasted to those of its competitors and potential substitutes.

*[[Financial analysis]]
An analysis of a company's financial data (which may include everything from public financial statements to private ERP data) with the goal of understanding the financial impact (positive and negative) that certain changes would have on a company.

*Bridge between business challenges and digital roadmap 
ASSIMPLER Blueprinting - The Business Blueprinting of the organization is designed based on the ASSIMPLER framework. ASSIMPLER stands for Availability, Scalability, Security, Interoperability, Maintainability, Performance, Low cost of ownership, Extendability and Reliability - applied to business services and processes. The framework helps model the business expectations and challenges to be addressed through the Digital Strategy.

===Identifying the unmet needs and goals of external stakeholders (consumers of online assets)===
*External stakeholder interviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digitalstrategies.tuck.dartmouth.edu/cds-uploads/case-studies/pdf/Norwegian.pdf | title=Case Studies | publisher=Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth | work=Vincent L. Lacorte Case Studies | date=2013 | accessdate=2 May 2014 | author1=Sibley, Dave | author2=Johnson, Eric | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503055333/http://digitalstrategies.tuck.dartmouth.edu/cds-uploads/case-studies/pdf/Norwegian.pdf | archivedate=3 May 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Includes one-on-one interviews and focus groups with a company's external stakeholders, with a goal of understanding external stakeholders behaviours, needs, goals and perceptions of the company and their industry both in the broadest business context as well as specifically online.  In addition to standard marketing strategy methodologies and questions ([[Quantitative marketing research|quantitative]] and [[Qualitative marketing research|qualitative]]), external stakeholder interviews for Digital Strategy may include [[usability testing]], an analysis of how effectively external stakeholders can use the online assets developed by a company for their intended purposes.  In digital strategy this is used to uncover usability barriers that may prevent the online vision being achieved.

*[[Ethnography|Ethnographic research]]
An analysis of external stakeholder behaviors in their environment, for example:  field observations of shoppers in a store.  In addition to standard ethnographic research, digital strategy research may include video recording of an external stakeholder using their computers or specific computer applications or web sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hbr.org/2009/03/ethnographic-research-a-key-to-strategy/ | title=Ethnographic Research: A Key to Strategy | publisher=Harvard Business Review | date=March 2009 | accessdate=2 May 2014 | author=Anderson, Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Web analytics]]&lt;ref name="mash1"/&gt;
An analysis of the usage patterns of a company's online assets with the goal of better understanding external stakeholder behavior as well as identifying strengths and weakness of the company's current online offerings.  This may include understanding how many people are visiting a web site, what are the most popular pages, what are the most popular paths, where are people coming from, where do they drop off, how long do they stay, etc.

*Performance assessment: Review of effectiveness of current digital technologies.
*[[Path analysis (computing)|Funnel analysis]]
A specific methodology for web analytics where the company's online assets are modeled as a sales funnel, with a visit or impression representing a new lead, a certain page or action in the web site considered a conversion (such as a user hitting the purchase confirmation page) and specific pages in the web site representing specific stages of the sales funnel.  The goal of the analysis is to provide insight into the overall conversion rate as well as the key weak points of the funnel (the stages in which the largest percentages of users drop out of the funnel).&lt;ref&gt;Extra Paycheck Blog (2014):  ''[http://blog.extra-paycheck.com/wealthy-affiliate-review/ Online Business Training]'', Online Marketing.&lt;/ref&gt; This may also involve analysis of a company's [[search engine optimization]] situation and changes in online traffic pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.blissdrive.com/internet-marketing-tips/the-evolution-of-seo-how-digital-marketing-has-changed-in-the-last-5-years/ | title=The Evolution of SEO: How Digital Marketing Has Changed in the Last 5 Years | publisher=BlissDrive | date=27 March 2014 | accessdate=2 May 2014 | author=Fong, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Analytical [[Customer relationship management|CRM]]
An analysis of a company's customer databases and information repositories with the goal of segmenting customers into homogeneous groups across one or more dimensions of behavior, demographics, value, product or marketing message affinity, etc.  In digital strategy this often includes the online customer registration database which companies use to provide access to their customer specific, protected areas.

*[[Multichannel marketing|Multichannel]] analysis
An analysis of a customer's behavior (such as their purchase or service behavior) that looks across all of the different channels, in which customers interact with a company's products or information.  There are lots of different ways to do this; a representative example would be, a company focuses on the customer purchase process (how a customer becomes aware of a product, how a customer develops the intent to purchase a product, and how a customer actually purchases the product).  The analysis would look at which channels (for example:  phone, catalog, retail store, web site, 3rd party search engine, etc.) a customer uses at which stage of the purchase process, attempting to understand why each channel is used, each channel's relative [[Attribution (marketing)|attribution]] and evaluating the company's strengths or weaknesses in that particular channel for the particular stage of the process.&lt;ref&gt;Bean (2001):  ''[http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/digital/Research/ExecutivePublications/ApplicationOfTechnology.pdf The Application of Technology to Marketing:  A Twenty Year Perspective]'',pg. 5, Center for Digital Strategies at the Tuck School of Business.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Statistical survey]]s
An approach to the collection of external stakeholder feedback in a quantitative manner from a large population.  In digital strategy, surveys may be used to validate or invalidate key questions raised in more qualitative exercises such as external stakeholder interviews and focus groups.  Depending on the breadth of the survey population and the degree of variation within the population, survey results may be segmented to form homogeneous groups across one or more dimensions of behavior, demographics, value, product or marketing message affinity, etc.  Surveys are often conducted online using web surveys, e-mail lists, or 3rd party panels, although phone surveys or other offline methods may sometimes be used when there are questions as to the online savviness of a particular target population.

===Developing a vision and prioritizing a set of online initiatives===
*[[Business plan]] or [[Business case|case]]
A spreadsheet with supporting documentation that quantifies the investments and returns over time, resulting from the execution of the online strategy.  The Business plan also defines the Key Performance Indicators [[Key performance indicator|(KPIs)]] that will be used to measure and evaluate the success of the online strategy.

*Technical assessment
A design of a technical architecture which will meet the needs of the business vision and conform to the business plan and roadmap.  This is often done as a [[gap analysis]] where the current technical architecture is assessed.  A future technical architecture, which meets the needs of the online vision, is designed.  The gaps between the current state and future state are identified, and a series of initiatives or projects to fill those gaps are developed and sequenced.

*Organizational and process assessment
Similar to a technical assessment, organizational and process assessments look at the changes that need to be made to an organization and its processes in order to achieve the online vision.  They may involve a series of [[business process reengineering]] projects focused on the areas of an organization most affected by the online initiatives.

*[[IT portfolio management|Portfolio management]]
A way of prioritizing various initiatives by comparing their cost of implementation with their expected business benefits.  This is often done by creating a two by two matrix where cost of implementation runs along the x-axis (from high cost to low cost) and expected business benefit runs along the y-axis, from low benefit to high benefit.  Individual initiatives or projects are then plotted on the matrix in terms of their calculated costs and benefits.  Priorities are then determined according to which projects will provide the greatest benefit for the lowest cost.

*Online media plan
A plan detailing the allocation of media spending across online media (such as [[search engine marketing]], [[banner advertising]], and [[affiliate marketing]]) usually as part of the customer acquisition or retention elements of the digital strategy. Since the late 2000s, [[social media]] has become increasingly important in engaging with customers both for marketing and customer support purposes, especially benefiting smaller businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Jasper (2015): ''[http://digitalmarketingmagazine.co.uk/articles/the-increasing-importance-of-real-time-marketing/2437 The Increasing Importance of Real-Time Marketing]''. Digitalmarketingmagazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Proof of concept
Graphical representations or an outline of key ideas or processes of the digital strategy.  These are often created in order to better communicate a key concept or to build excitement among stakeholders when building consensus or socializing a digital strategy.

*Roadmap
A high-level project plan which details the durations and dependencies of all the initiatives in the digital strategy.  The roadmap will often include checkpoints to assess the progress and success of the digital strategy, over time.

*Measurement plan
A description of the [[key performance indicators]] used to measure the effectiveness of the digital strategy as well as the process for collecting and sharing this information.  The measurement plan usually covers the financial, operational, and e-business metrics and their relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Kim (2006):  ''[http://www.forrester.com/Research/Document/0,7211,39552,00.html#heading4 Reinventing The Marketing Organization:  Customer Groups Should Trump Channels, Products, Or Geography]''. Forrester.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burns (2006): ''[http://www.forrester.com/Research/Document/0,7211,40808,00.html Leaders Take A Strategic Approach To Web Analytics]''. Forrester.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Governance model
The organizational structure, roles, and process description of the operational entity that will manage the initiatives in a digital strategy.  The governance model describes who is responsible for what, how decisions are made, how issues are escalated, and how information on the performance of the projects is communicated within the organization.

==Personas==
As of 2007, a trend in digital strategy is the use of [[persona (marketing)|personas]] as a framework for using customer information to prioritize online initiatives.  Personas are character sketches which represent a typical member of one customer segment and highlights their needs, goals and behaviors.  Because it is representative of a customer segment, it allows decision makers to prioritize various features based on the needs of the segment.  Because it is a character sketch, it is sometimes easier for decision makers to internalize the key needs of the segment than it would be by reading large quantities of information.  A typical approach is to create the segment based on customer analysis such as customer interviews, ethnographic research, and statistical surveys.  Then assemble key decision makers or stakeholders, present the findings of the personas, and use them to kick start a brainstorming session around different online initiatives which can meet the personas needs and goals.

==Execution==
Historically, execution of a business or digital strategy is done as a big bang, with large initiatives such as site redesigns and transactional systems taking 6–12 months to develop and often an additional 6–12 months before they deliver any results.  As of 2007, a trend has emerged where companies adopt a more iterative approach to rolling out their strategies, one which leverages a series of smaller tests, which are carefully measured and analyzed and used to modify or optimize the digital strategy.  An example of this test-measure-optimize-scale approach is that a company might take some key pages on their site and test a number of versions of those pages with different marketing messages, design approaches, user experience optimizations, navigation optimizations, and even new features and functions using a [[multivariate analysis|multivariate]] or A/B test.  The company would then identify the page which had the best combination of changes in terms of some key business metric (such as conversion), analyzing the results to understand which changes were most instrumental in affecting the high conversion rate, and applying those learnings to future pages and future tests ([[conversion optimization]]).  

The advantage of this approach is that in the long run, it tends to be more successful in delivering business results, because each step is measured and adjusted for.  In addition, it tends to favor smaller (less risky, less expensive) steps rather than larger (more risky, more expensive) initiatives before getting the payback.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport (2006):  ''Competing on Analytics'', Harvard Business Review, January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The disadvantage is that over time this approach tends to converge on a solution ([[local optimum]]), not necessarily the best solution ([[global optimum]]) that might have been reached if a company starts from scratch instead of building each step on the previous one.  Another disadvantage is that although this solution tends to favor smaller, more incremental changes, there is often a larger up front cost to setting up all the measurement systems and staffing a company with the right analysts and change processes to react to these tests in a timely and effective manner.  As a result, companies often adopt a mix of big bang efforts augmented by some smaller, more iterative efforts as part of their overall strategy.  A person who is primarily focused on digital strategy may be referred to as a [[digital architect]] or digital strategist and a person who executes a digital strategy may be referred to as a [[digital marketing engineer]].

There are also several challenges when developing and implementing a digital strategy. This include human factors, particularly knowledge, skills, and attitudes, which impede full engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Context Sensitive Health Informatics: Human and Sociotechnical Approaches|last=Beuscart-Zephir|first=Marie Catherine|last2=Jaspers|first2=Monique|last3=Kuziemsky|first3=Craig|last4=Nohr|first4=Christian|last5=Aarts|first5=Jos|publisher=IOS Press|year=2013|isbn=9781614992929|location=Amsterdam|pages=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital strategy vs. online strategy==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2010}}
The two terms, "digital strategy" and "online strategy", tend to be thrown out somewhat interchangeably. However, there is some consensus{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} around the differences between digital strategy and online strategy.  According to some,{{who|date=May 2014}} digital strategy refers to the strategy a company takes to become a digital company, where digital connotes deeper interactions with their customers, more customized and personalized offerings and interactions, data driven decision making, and organizational models and processes that are more reactive to changes in the company's environment. Online is a subset of digital, as there may be digital assets which are not online. In this context, a company may use the term online strategy to be limited to the development of plans to deploy their online assets to maximize business results and digital strategy to be the more transformative step of changing the organization, although the latter is also referred as a [[Digital_transformation | digital transformation strategy]]. &lt;ref&gt; Matt, Christian; Hess, Thomas; Benlian, Alexander (2015).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3686">An '''early adopter''' (sometimes misspelled as ''early adapter'' or ''early adaptor'') or '''lighthouse customer''' is an early customer of a given company, product, or technology. The term originates from [[Everett M. Rogers]]' ''[[Diffusion of Innovations]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | publisher = Free Press of Glencoe, Macmillan Company
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Typically this will be a customer who, in addition to using the vendor's product or technology, will also provide considerable and candid feedback to help the vendor refine its future product releases, as well as the associated means of distribution, service, and support.  

[[File:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|Early adopters as shown in the [[Technology adoption lifecycle|Rogers' bell curve]]|384x237px]]

The relationship is [[synergy|synergistic]], with the customer having early (and sometimes unique, or at least uniquely early) access to an advantageous new product or technology, but he or she also serves as a kind of [[Human subject research|guinea pig]].

In exchange for being an early adopter, and thus being exposed to the problems, risks, and annoyances common to early-stage product testing and deployment, the lighthouse customer is sometimes given especially attentive vendor assistance and support, even to the point of having personnel at the customer's work site to assist with implementation.
The customer is sometimes given preferential pricing, terms, and conditions, although new technology is often very expensive, so the early adopter still often pays quite a lot.

The vendor, on the other hand, benefits from receiving early
revenues, and also from a lighthouse customer's endorsement and assistance in further developing the product and its go-to-market mechanisms. Acquiring lighthouse customers is a common step in new product development and implementation. The real-world focus that this type  of relationship can bring to a vendor can be extremely valuable.

Early adoption does come with pitfalls: early versions of products may be buggy and/or prone to malfunction.  Furthermore, more efficient, and sometimes less expensive, versions of the product usually appear a few months after the initial release ([[Apple iPhone]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.aol.com/top5/general/gadgets AOL Money]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13508_3-9790142-19.html Making sense of the million-dollar iPhone lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend of new technology costing more at release is often referred to as the "early adopter tax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-3251293-501465.html | title=The Early Adopter's Gamble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5489">An '''English writing style''' is a way of using the [[English language|English language]].

The style of a piece of writing is the way in which features of the language are used to convey meaning, typically but not always within the constraints of more widely accepted conventions of [[usage]], [[grammar]], and spelling.

An individual's writing style may be a very personal thing. Organizations that employ writers or commission written work from individuals may require that writers conform to a standardized style defined by the organization. This allows a consistent readability of composite works produced by many authors, and promotes usability of, for example, references to other cited works.

In many kinds of professional writing aiming for effective transfer of information, adherence to a standardised style of writing helps readers make sense of what the writer is presenting. Many standardised styles are documented in [[style guide]]s. Some styles are more widely used, others restricted to a particular journal. Adherence to no particular style is also a style in its own right; some may think it undesirable, others not.

==Personal styles==
All writing has some style, even if the author is not thinking about a personal style. It is important to understand that style reflects meaning. For instance, if a writer wants to express a sense of euphoria, he or she might write in a style overflowing with expressive modifiers. Some writers use styles that are very specific, for example in pursuit of an artistic effect. Stylistic rule-breaking is exemplified by the poet. An example is [[E. E. Cummings]], whose writing consists mainly of only [[lower case]] letters, and often uses unconventional [[typography]], [[White space (visual arts)|spacing]], and [[punctuation]]. Even in non-artistic writing, every person who writes has his or her own personal style.

==Proprietary styles==
Many large publications define a house style to be used throughout the publication, a practice almost universal among newspapers and well-known magazines. These styles can cover the means of expression and sentence structures, such as those adopted by ''[[Time (magazine)#Style|Time]]''. They may also include features peculiar to a publication; the practice at ''[[The Economist#Tone and voice|The Economist]]'', for example, is that articles are rarely attributed to an individual author. General characteristics have also been prescribed for different categories of writing, such as in [[News style|journalism]], the use of [[SI#SI writing style|SI units]], or [[questionnaire construction]].

==Academic styles==
University students, especially graduate students, are encouraged to write papers in an approved style. This practice promotes readability and ensures that references to cited works are noted in a uniform way. Typically, students are encouraged to use a style commonly adopted by journals publishing articles in the field of study. The list of ''Style Manuals &amp; Guides'', from the [[University of Memphis]] Libraries, includes thirty academic style manuals that are currently in print, and twelve that are available on-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Style Manuals &amp; Guides |url=http://exlibris.memphis.edu/instr/style.htm |publisher=University of Memphis Libraries |accessdate=2008-06-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702054147/http://exlibris.memphis.edu/instr/style.htm |archivedate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Citation of referenced works is a key element in academic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Research help | url= http://lts.brandeis.edu/research/help/ | publisher= [[Brandeis University]] | date= 2008-03-04 | accessdate= 2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements for writing and citing articles accessed on-line may sometimes differ from those for writing and citing printed works. Some of the details are covered in ''The Columbia Guide to Online Style''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= The Columbia Guide to Online Style: Second Edition | url= http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-13210-7/the-columbia-guide-to-online-style | last= Walker | first= Janice R |author2=Taylor, Todd | publisher= [[Columbia University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-231-13210-7 | date= September 2006 | quote= Updated and expanded, this guide now explains how to cite technologies such as Web logs and podcasts&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;and features additional guidelines for producing online and print documents based on new standards of markup language and publication technologies. | accessdate= 2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''field emission gun''' is a type of [[electron gun]] in which a sharply pointed Müller-type{{clarify|reason=what is this?|date=July 2014}} emitter&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Forbes, "Gas Field Ionization Sources," in [[Jon Orloff]], ed., ''Handbook of Charged Particle Optics, Second Edition'', CRC Press, 2009, p 87-128, {{ISBN|978-1-4200-4554-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is held at several kilovolts negative [[potential]] relative to a nearby [[electrode]], so that there is sufficient potential [[gradient]] at the emitter surface to cause [[field electron emission]]. Emitters are either of [[cold-cathode]] type, usually made of single crystal tungsten sharpened to a tip radius of about 100 nm, or of the [[Walter H. Schottky|Schottky]] type,&lt;ref&gt;L.W. Swanson &amp; G.A. Schwind, "Review of ZrO/W Schottky Cathode," in [[Jon Orloff]], ed., ''Handbook of Charged Particle Optics, Second Edition'', CRC Press, 2009, p 1-28, {{ISBN|978-1-4200-4554-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[thermionic emission]] is enhanced by barrier lowering in the presence of a high electric field. Schottky emitters are made by coating a tungsten tip with a layer of [[zirconium oxide]], which has the unusual property of increasing in [[electrical conductivity]] at high temperature.  

In  [[electron microscope]]s, a field emission gun is used to produce an electron beam that is smaller in diameter, more coherent and with up to three orders of magnitude greater current density or brightness than can be achieved with conventional [[thermionic emission|thermionic emitters]] such as tungsten or [[lanthanum hexaboride]] ({{chem|LaB|6}})-tipped filaments. The result in both [[scanning electron microscope|scanning]] and [[transmission electron microscope|transmission electron microscopy]] is significantly improved [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and spatial resolution, and greatly increased emitter life and reliability compared with thermionic devices.

[[Wind power]] has been growing in the United States since the 1970s.{{weasel inline|date=September 2016}}

==History==
The growth of [[wind power in the United States]] has been enhanced by a [[Tax credit#Renewable Energy/Production Tax Credit (PTC)|production tax credit]] (PTC), which pays 2.3¢/kWh for the first 10 years. Development has been off and on again due to the expiration and late renewal of the PTC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/savings/renewable-electricity-production-tax-credit-ptc Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC)]&lt;/ref&gt; It expired at the end of 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/07/17/dead-air-end-to-tax-credits-takes-big-bite-out-of-wind-power Dead Air: End of Tax Credit Deflates Wind Power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwec.net/index.php?id=121 United States]&lt;/ref&gt; only to be restored in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rechargenews.com/wind/1386834/Update-US-Senate-approves-one-year-wind-PTC-extension Update: US Senate approves one-year wind PTC extension]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 it was renewed but is phased out over a five-year period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/renewables-boom-expected-thanks-to-tax-credit/ Renewables Boom Expected Thanks to Tax Credit]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals set by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] is to increase the number of states which have over 1,000 MW of wind power to 15 by 2018. By the end of 2015 there were 17. Another goal was to increase the number of states with at least 100 MW to 30 by 2010. As of 2011, there are 29.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/wind/mission.html Mission, Vision, and Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 vision for wind calls for 10% generation by wind by 2020 (113 GW), 30% by 2030 (224 GW), and 35% by 2050 (404 GW). It calls for 40 states to each have at least 1 GW, and wind power in all 50 states. Larger wind turbines has expanded the commercial viability of wind to all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/eere/wind/maps/wind-vision Wind Vision: A New Era for Wind Power in the United States]&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts expect 25 GW more between 2016-18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transmissionhub.com/articles/2016/03/while-investment-may-slow-in-coming-years-plenty-of-transmission-construction-investment-happening.html |title=While investment may slow in coming years, plenty of transmission construction, investment happening |author=Corina Rivera Linares |publisher= |accessdate=22 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530102813/http://www.transmissionhub.com/articles/2016/03/while-investment-may-slow-in-coming-years-plenty-of-transmission-construction-investment-happening.html |archive-date=30 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Candle|Candles]] were used by the early [[Greeks]] to honour the goddess Artemis' birth on the sixth day of every lunar month.

[[Candle|Candles]] were made by the Romans beginning about 500 BC. These were true dipped candles and made from [[tallow]]. Evidence for candles made from [[whale fat]] in China dates back to the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221–206 BC).&lt;ref name=telesco&gt;{{cite book | last = Telesco | first = Patricia  | title = Exploring Candle Magick: Candle Spells, Charms, Rituals, and Divinations | publisher = Career Press  | year = 2001 | location =   | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ogHORLtm3KAC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=wax+boiling+cinnamon+candle&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=tiI6EMFlQa8qc-8HN8J7qfUXS3k | isbn = 1-56414-522-0| page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]], wax from boiling [[cinnamon]] was used for temple candles.&lt;ref name=telesco/&gt;

In parts of Europe, the Middle-East and Africa, where lamp oil made from olives was readily available, candle making remained unknown until the early middle-ages.  Candles were primarily made from [[tallow]] and [[beeswax]] in ancient times, but have been made from [[spermaceti]], purified animal fats ([[stearin]]) and [[paraffin wax]] in recent centuries.&lt;ref name= Ullmann/&gt;

==Antiquity==
The early [[Greeks]] used candles to honour the goddess Artemis' birth on the sixth day of every lunar month.

[[Ancient Rome|Romans]] began making true dipped candles from tallow, beginning around 500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/candles2.html |title=Candles, Roman, 500 BCE |website=Smith College Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; While oil lamps were the most widely used source of illumination in Roman Italy, candles were common and regularly given as gifts during [[Saturnalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyextra.com/feature/how-did-romans-celebrate-%E2%80%98christmas%E2%80%99 |title=How did the Romans celebrate ‘Christmas’? |website=History Extra |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mausoleum of [[Qin Shi Huang]] (259–210 BC), contained candles made from whale fat.  The word zhú was used as candle during the [[Warring States period]] (403&amp;ndash;221 BC); some excavated bronzewares from that era feature a pricket thought to hold a candle.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 79 80"&gt;{{cite book |last=Needham |first=Joseph |date=1986 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 1, Physics |location=Taipei |publisher=Caves Books Ltd |pages=79&amp;ndash;80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC &amp;ndash; 220 AD) ''Jizhupian'' dictionary of about 40 BC hints at candles being made of beeswax, while the ''[[Book of Jin]]'' (compiled in 648) covering the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265&amp;ndash;420) makes a solid reference to the beeswax candle in regards to its use by the statesman Zhou Yi (d. 322).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 79 80"/&gt; An excavated earthenware bowl from the 4th century AD, located at the [[Luoyang Museum]], has a hollowed socket where traces of wax were found.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 79 80"/&gt; Generally these Chinese candles were molded in paper tubes, using rolled rice paper for the wick, and wax from an indigenous insect{{clarifyme|date=August 2015}} that was combined with seeds{{clarifyme|date=August 2015}}.

Wax from boiling [[cinnamon]] was used for temple candles in [[India]].&lt;ref name=telesco/&gt; [[Yak]] butter was used for candles in [[Tibet]]&lt;ref&gt;http://picasaweb.google.com/mishalin77/082702#5111013648927170082{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a fish called the [[eulachon]] or "candlefish", a type of [[smelt (fish)|smelt]] which is found from Oregon to Alaska. During the 1st century AD, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] from this region used oil from this fish for illumination.&lt;ref name=telesco/&gt; A simple candle could be made by putting the dried fish on a forked stick and then lighting it.

==Middle Ages==
[[Image:Candles Oberflacht.jpg|thumb|upright|The oldest surviving bees wax candles north of the Alps from the alamannic graveyard of Oberflacht, Germany dating to 6th/7th century A.D.]]
After the collapse of the [[Roman empire]], trading disruptions made [[olive oil]], the most common fuel for oil lamps, unavailable throughout much of Europe. As a consequence, candles became more widely used. By contrast, in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], candle-making remained relatively unknown due to the availability of olive oil.

Candles were commonplace throughout Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]. Candle makers (known as [[chandlery|chandler]]s) made candles from fats saved from the kitchen or sold their own candles from within their shops. The trade of the chandler is also recorded by the more picturesque name of "smeremongere", since they oversaw the manufacture of sauces, vinegar, soap and cheese. The popularity of candles is shown by their use in [[Candlemas]] and in [[Saint Lucy]] festivities.

[[Tallow]], fat from cows or sheep, became the standard material used in candles in Europe. The unpleasant smell of tallow candles is due to the glycerine they contain. The smell of the manufacturing process was so unpleasant that it was banned by ordinance in several European cities. [[Beeswax]] was discovered to be an excellent substance for candle production without the unpleasant odour, but remained restricted in usage for the rich and for churches and royal events, due to their great expense.

In [[England]] and [[France]], candle making had become a [[guild|guild craft]] by the 13th century. The [[Worshipful Company of Tallow Chandlers|Tallow Chandlers Company]] of [[London]] was formed in about 1300 in London, and in 1456 was granted a [[coat of arms]]. The [[Worshipful Company of Wax Chandlers|Wax Chandlers Company]] dating from about 1330, acquired its charter in 1484. By 1415, tallow candles were used in street lighting. The first candle mould comes from the 15th century in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millhousecandles.com/history.php|title=A Short History of Candles|website=Millhouse Candles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
[[File:Colonial candle molds at fruitlands.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'Colonial'-style tapered candle molds]]
With the growth of the [[whaling|whaling industry]] in the 18th century, [[spermaceti]], an oil that comes from a cavity in the head of the [[sperm whale]], became a widely used substance for candle making. The spermaceti was obtained by crystallizing the oil from the sperm whale and was the first candle substance to become available in mass quantities. Like beeswax, spermaceti wax did not create a repugnant odor when burned, and produced a significantly brighter light. It was also harder than either tallow or beeswax, so it would not soften or bend in the summer heat. The first "standard candles" were made from spermaceti wax.

By 1800, an even cheaper alternative was discovered. [[Colza oil]], derived from [[Brassica campestris]], and a similar oil derived from [[rapeseed]], yielded candles that produce clear, smokeless flames. The French chemists [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] (1786–1889) and [[Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac]] (1778–1850) patented [[stearin]] in 1825. Like tallow, this was derived from animals, but had no glycerine content.

===Industrialization===
[[File:Joseph_Morgan_candle_maker.jpg|thumb|right|Joseph Morgan's candle making machine revolutionized candle making]]
The manufacture of candles became an industrialised mass market in the mid 19th century. In 1834, Joseph Morgan, a pewterer from [[Manchester]], England, patented a machine that revolutionised candle making. It allowed for continuous production of molded candles by using a cylinder with a moveable piston to eject candles as they solidified. This more efficient mechanized production produced about 1,500 candles per hour, (according to his patent ". . with three men and five boys [the machine] will manufacture two tons of candle in twelve hours"). This allowed candles to become an easily affordable commodity for the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Gordon  | title = Seven Centuries of Light: The Tallow Chandlers Company | publisher = Book Production Consultants plc | year = 1999 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OWt03_on0qUC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Joseph+Morgan+candles+1834&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=4YXvX0eEdKqze7B13yQiKehrgjs | isbn = 1-85757-064-2 | page = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Price's Palmitine Candles00.jpg|left|thumb|[[Price's Candles]] became the largest candle manufacturer in the world by the end of the 19th century]]
At this time, candlemakers also began to fashion wicks out of tightly [[braid]]ed (rather than simply twisted) strands of [[cotton]]. This technique makes wicks curl over as they burn, maintaining the height of the wick and therefore the flame. Because much of the excess wick is incinerated, these are referred to as "self-trimming" or "self-consuming" wicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.expressivecandles.com/history.php |title=A Brief History of Candles |access-date=2013-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318072713/http://www.expressivecandles.com/history.php |archive-date=2013-03-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848 James Young established the world’s first oil refinery at the Alfreton Ironworks in [[Riddings]], [[Derbyshire]]. Two paraffin wax candles were made from the naturally occurring paraffin wax present in the oil and these candles illuminated a lecture at the Royal Institution by Lyon Playfair. In the mid-1850s, [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] succeeded in distilling [[paraffin wax]] from coal and oil shales at [[Bathgate]] in [[West Lothian]] and developed a commercially viable method of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Golan | first = Tal  | title = Laws of Men and Laws of Nature: The History of Scientific Expert Testimony in England and America | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2004 | pages = 89–91 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kQhYsAmcj-EC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=james+young+patent+paraffin&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=GVRHQw_E_JpKCMJyDIHh_0mY8uI#PPA90,M1  | isbn = 0-674-01286-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paraffin wax was processed by distilling residue left after [[crude petroleum]] was refined. 

Paraffin could be used to make inexpensive candles of high quality. It was a bluish-white wax, burned cleanly, and left no unpleasant odor, unlike [[tallow]] candles. A drawback to the substance was that early coal- and petroleum-derived paraffin waxes had a very low melting point. The introduction of [[stearin]], discovered by [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]], solved this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using stearic acid or stearin in candlemaking|url=http://www.happynews.com/living/create/using-stearic-acid.htm|website=happynews.com|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stearic acid (stearin)|url=http://www.howtomakecandles.info/cm_article.asp?ID=ADDIT0003|website=howtomakecandles.info|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stearin is hard and durable, with a convenient melting range of 54–72.5&amp;nbsp;°C (129.2–162.5&amp;nbsp;°F). By the end of the 19th century, most candles being manufactured consisted of paraffin and stearic acid.

By the late 19th century, [[Price's Candles]], based in London was the largest candle manufacturer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJo7AwAAQBAJ|title=London's Industrial Heritage|author=Geoff Marshall|year=2013|publisher=The History Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company traced its origins back to 1829, when William Wilson invested in 1,000 acres (4&amp;nbsp;km²) of coconut plantation in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ball  | first = Michael  |author2=David Sunderland | title = An Economic History of London, 1800-1914 | publisher = Routledge | year = 2001 | pages = 131–132 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MI6JfTiEcdAC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Prices+Candles+Coconut&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=So7CcAanBJha_PZuwQsHDyhgyeo | isbn = 0-415-24691-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His aim was to make candles from coconut oil. Later he tried palm oil from palm trees. An accidental discovery swept all his ambitions aside when his son George Wilson, a talented chemist, distilled the first petroleum oil in 1854. George also pioneered the implementation of the technique of steam distillation, and was thus able to manufacture candles from a wide range of raw materials, including skin fat, bone fat, fish oil and industrial greases.

In America, [[Syracuse, New York]] developed into a global center for [[Industry in Syracuse, New York|candle manufacturing]] from the mid-nineteenth century. Manufacturers included Will &amp; Baumer, Mack Miller, Muench Kruezer, and [[Cathedral Candle Company]].

===Decline of the candle industry===
[[File:Birthday candles.jpg|thumb| Candles here are used to celebrate a birthday]]
Despite advances in candle making, the candle industry declined rapidly upon the introduction of superior methods of lighting, including [[kerosene]] and [[Kerosene lamp|lamps]] and the 1879 invention of the [[incandescent light bulb]].

From this point on, candles came to be marketed as more of a decorative item. Candles became available in a broad array of sizes, shapes and colors, and consumer interest in scented candles began to grow. During the 1990s, new types of candle waxes were being developed due to an unusually high demand for candles. Paraffin, a by-product of oil, was quickly replaced by new waxes and wax blends due to rising costs.

Candle manufacturers looked at waxes such as soy, palm and flax-seed oil, often blending them with paraffin in hopes of getting the performance of paraffin with the price benefits of the other waxes. The creation of unique wax blends, now requiring different fragrance chemistries and loads, placed pressure for innovation on the candle wick manufacturing industry to meet performance needs with the often tougher to burn formulations. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atkinsandpearce.com/candle-solutions/new-product-development/ Atkins &amp; Pearce Candle Wick History]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35228">The '''military funding of science''' has had a powerful transformative effect on the practice and products of [[scientific research]] since the early 20th century.  Particularly since [[World War I]], [[military technology|advanced science-based technologies]] have been viewed as essential elements of a successful military.

World War I is often called "the chemists’ war", both for the extensive [[Poison gas in World War I|use of poison gas]] and the importance of [[nitrates]] and advanced [[high explosive]]s.   Poison gas, beginning in 1915 with [[chlorine]] from the powerful German dye industry, was used extensively by the Germans and the British ; over the course of the war, scientists on both sides raced to develop more and more potent chemicals and devise countermeasures against the newest enemy gases.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Robert and Jeremy Paxman.  ''A Higher Form of Killing: The Secret History of Chemical and Biological Warfare''.  2002.  Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicists also contributed to the war effort, developing wireless communication technologies and sound-based methods of detecting [[U-boat]]s, resulting in the first tenuous long-term connections between academic science and the military.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, Daniel J.  ''The Physicists: The History of a Scientific Community in Modern America''.  New York: Alfred K. Knopf, 1971. pp 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] marked a massive increase in the military funding of science, particularly physics.  In addition to the [[Manhattan Project]] and the resulting [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]], British and American work on [[radar]] was widespread and ultimately highly influential in the course of the war; radar enabled detection of enemy ships and aircraft, as well as the radar-based [[proximity fuze]].  Mathematical [[cryptography]], [[meteorology]], and [[aerospace engineering|rocket science]] were also central to the war effort, with military-funded wartime advances having a significant long-term effect on each discipline.  The technologies employed at the end&amp;mdash;[[jet aircraft]], radar and proximity fuzes, and the atomic bomb&amp;mdash;were radically different from pre-war technology; military leaders came to view continued advances in technology as the critical element for success in future wars.  The advent of the [[Cold War]] solidified the links between military institutions and academic science, particularly in the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], so that even during a period of nominal peace military funding continued to expand.  Funding spread to the [[social sciences]] as well as the [[natural sciences]], and whole new fields, such as [[digital computing]], were born of military patronage.  Following the [[Cold War (1985-1991)|end of the Cold War]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], military funding of science has decreased substantially, but much of the American [[military-scientific complex]] remains in place.

The sheer scale of military funding for science since World War II has instigated a large body of historical literature analyzing the effects of that funding, especially for American science.  Since [[Paul Forman]]’s 1987 article “Behind quantum electronics: National security as a basis for physical research in the United State, 1940-1960,” there has been an ongoing historical debate over precisely how and to what extent military funding affected the course of scientific research and discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Paul.  "Behind quantum electronics: National security as basis for physical research in the United States, 1940-1960," ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 18, Pt. 1, pp 149-229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman and others have argued that military funding fundamentally redirected science—particularly physics—toward applied research, and that military technologies predominantly formed the basis for subsequent research even in areas of basic science; ultimately the very culture and ideals of science were colored by extensive collaboration between scientists and military planners.  An alternate view has been presented by [[Daniel Kevles]], that while military funding provided many new opportunities for scientists and dramatically expanded the scope of physical research, scientists by-and-large retained their intellectual autonomy.

==Science and military technology before the modern era==
[[Image:Replica catapult.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Replica catapult at [[Château des Baux]], [[France]]]]
While there were numerous instances of military support for scientific work before the 20th century, these were typically isolated instances; knowledge gained from technology was generally far more important for the development of science than scientific knowledge was to technological innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, Barton C.  "The Machines of War: Western Military Technology 1850-2000."  ''History and Technology'', Vol. 21, No. 3, September 2005, pp 255-300.  p 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thermodynamics]], for example, is a science partly born from military technology: one of the many sources of the [[first law of thermodynamics]] was [[Count Rumford]]’s observation of the heat produced by boring [[cannon]] barrels.&lt;ref&gt;von Baeyer, Hans Christian.  ''Warmth Disperses and Time Passes: The History of Heat''.  New York: The Modern Library, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathematics was important in the development of the Greek [[catapult]] and other weapons,&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, "The Machines of War," footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but analysis of [[ballistics]] was also important for the development of mathematics, while [[Galileo]] tried to promote the telescope as a military instrument to the military-minded [[Republic of Venice]] before turning it to the skies while seeking the [[patronage]] of the [[Medici]] court in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Biagioli, Mario.  ''Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, craft-based innovation, disconnected from the formal systems of science, was the key to military technology well into the 19th century.

[[Image:Interchangeable parts.gif|thumb|left|200px|Interchangeable gun parts, illustrated in the 1832 ''Edinburgh Encyclopaedia'']]
Even craft-based military technologies were not generally produced by military funding.  Instead, craftsmen and inventors developed weapons and military tools independently and actively sought the interest of military patrons afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, "The Machines of War," p 256.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the rise of [[engineering]] as a profession in the 18th century, governments and military leaders did try to harness the methods of both science and engineering for more specific ends, but frequently without success.   In the decades leading up to the [[French Revolution]], French artillery officers were often trained as engineers, and military leaders from this mathematical tradition attempted to transform the process of weapons manufacture from a craft-based enterprise to an organized and standardized system based on engineering principles and [[interchangeable parts]] (pre-dating the work of [[Eli Whitney]] in the U.S.).  During the Revolution, even natural scientists participated directly, attempting to create “weapons more powerful than any we possess” to aid the cause of the new French Republic, though there were no means for the revolutionary army to fund such work.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie, Charles Coulston.  "Science and secret weapons development in Revolutionary France, 1792–1804."  ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 23, No. 1, pp 35–152.  Quote from excerpt of [[Georges Cuvier]]’s eulogy of [[Claude-Louis Berthollet]], p 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these efforts, however, was ultimately unsuccessful in producing militarily useful results.  A slightly different outcome came from the longitude prize of the 18th century, offered by the British government for an accurate method of determining a ship’s [[longitude]] at sea (essential for the safe navigation of the powerful British navy): intended to promote—and financially reward—a scientific solution, it was instead won by a scientific outsider, the clockmaker [[John Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sobel, Dava]].  ''[[Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time]]''.  Penguin, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the naval utility of [[astronomy]] did help increase the number of capable astronomers and focus research on developing more powerful and versatile instruments.

Through the 19th century, science and technology grew closer together, particularly through electrical and acoustic inventions and the corresponding mathematical theories.  The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed a trend toward military mechanization, with the advent of repeating rifles with [[smokeless powder]], long-range artillery, [[high explosive]]s, [[machine gun]]s, and mechanized transport along with [[telegraph]]ic and later [[wireless telegraph|wireless]] battlefield communication.  Still, independent inventors, scientists and engineers were largely responsible for these drastic changes in military technology (with the exception of the development of [[battleship]]s, which could only have been created through organized large-scale effort).&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, “The Machines of War,” pp 256-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I and the interwar years==
{{see also|Technology during World War I}}
[[World War I]] marked the first large-scale mobilization of science for military purposes.  Prior to the war, the American military ran a few small laboratories as well as the [[United States Bureau of Standards|Bureau of Standards]], but independent inventors and industrial firms predominated.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly in Europe, military-directed scientific research and development was minimal.  The powerful new technologies that led to [[trench warfare]], however, reversed the traditional advantage of fast-moving offensive tactics; fortified positions supported by machine guns and artillery resulted in high attrition but strategic stalemate.  Militaries turned to scientists and engineers for even newer technologies, but the introduction of [[tank]]s and [[aircraft]] had only a marginal impact; the [[Poison gas in World War I|use of poison gas]] made a tremendous psychological impact, but decisively favored neither side.  The war ultimately turned on maintaining adequate supplies of materials, a problem also addressed by military-funded science&amp;mdash;and, through the international chemical industry, closely related to the advent of chemical warfare.

The Germans introduced gas as a weapon in part because [[naval blockade]]s limited their supply of [[nitrate]] for explosives, while the massive German [[dye]] industry could easily produce [[chlorine]] and [[organic chemical]]s in large amounts.  Industrial capacity was completely mobilized for war, and [[Fritz Haber]] and other industrial scientists were eager to contribute to the German cause; soon they were closely integrated into the military hierarchy as they tested the most effective ways of producing and delivering weaponized chemicals.  Though the initial impetus for gas warfare came from outside the military, further developments in chemical weapon technology might be considered military-funded, considering the blurring of lines between industry and nation in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Paxman, ''A Higher Form of Killing'',  pp 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Poison gas casualties from the [[Battle of Estaires]], April 10, 1918]]
Following the first chlorine attack by the Germans in May 1915, the British quickly moved to recruit scientists for developing their own gas weapons.  Gas research escalated on both sides, with chlorine followed by [[phosgene]], a variety of [[tear gas]]es, and [[mustard gas]].  A wide array of research was conducted on the physiological effects of other gases, such and [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[arsenic]] compounds, and a host of complex organic chemicals.  The British built from scratch what became an expansive research facility at [[Porton Down]], which remains a significant military research institution into the 21st century.  Unlike many earlier military-funded scientific ventures, the research at Porton Down did not stop when the war ended or an immediate goal was achieved.  In fact, every effort was made to create an attractive research environment for top scientists, and chemical weapons development continued apace&amp;mdash;though in secret&amp;mdash;through the interwar years and into World War II.  German military-backed gas warfare research did not resume until the Nazi era, following the 1936 discovery of [[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], the first nerve agent, through industrial [[insecticide]] research.

In the United States, the established tradition of engineering was explicitly competing with the rising discipline of physics for World War I military largess.  A host of inventors, led by [[Thomas Edison]] and his newly created [[Naval Consulting Board]], cranked out thousands of inventions to solve military problems and aid the war effort, while academic scientists worked through the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC) led by [[Robert Millikan]].  [[Submarine]] detection was the most important problem that both the physicists and inventors hoped to solve, as German [[U-boat]]s were decimating the crucial naval supply lines from the U.S. to England.  Edison’s Board produced very few useful innovations, but NRC research resulted in a moderately successful sound-based methods for locating submarines and hidden ground-based artillery, as well as useful navigational and photographic equipment for aircraft.  Because of the success of academic science in solving specific military problems, the NRC was retained after the war’s end, though it gradually decoupled from the military.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp 102-154&lt;/ref&gt;

Many industrial and academic chemists and physicists came under military control during the Great War, but post-war research by the Royal Engineers Experimental Station at Porton Down and the continued operation of the National Research Council were exceptions to the overall pattern; wartime chemistry funding was a temporary redirection of a field largely driven by industry and later medicine, while physics grew closer to industry than to the military.  The discipline of modern meteorology, however, was largely built from military funding.  During World War I, the French civilian meteorological infrastructure was largely absorbed into the military.  The introduction of military aircraft during the war as well as the role of wind and weather in the success or failure of gas attacks meant meteorological advice was in high demand.  The French army (among others) created its own supplementary meteorological service as well, retraining scientists from other fields to staff it.  At war's end, the military continued to control French meteorology, sending weathermen to French colonial interests and integrating weather service with the growing air corps; most of the early-twentieth century growth in European meteorology was the direct result of military funding.&lt;ref&gt;Pyenson, Lewis and Susan Sheets-Pyenson.  ''Servants of Nature: A History of Scientific Institutions, Enterprises, and Sensibilities''.  New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1999.  pp 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt;   World War II would result in a similar transformation of American meteorology, initiating a transition from an [[apprenticeship]] system for training weathermen (based on intimate knowledge of local trends and geography) to the university-based, science-intensive system that has predominated since.

==World War II==
{{see also|Technology during World War II}}
If World War I was the chemists’ war, World War II was the physicists’ war.  As with other [[total war]]s, it is difficult to draw a line between military funding and more spontaneous military-scientific collaboration during World War II.  Well before the [[Polish September Campaign|Invasion of Poland]], [[nationalism]] was a powerful force in the German physics community (see [[Deutsche Physik]]); the military mobilization of physicists was all but irresistible after the rise of [[National Socialism]].  German and Allied investigations of the possibility of a nuclear bomb began in 1939 at the initiative of civilian scientists, but by 1942 the respective militaries were heavily involved.  The [[German nuclear energy project]] had two independent teams, a civilian-controlled team under [[Werner Heisenberg]] and a military-controlled led by [[Kurt Diebner]]; the latter was more explicitly aimed at producing a bomb (as opposed to a power reactor) and received much more funding from the Nazis, though neither was ultimately successful.&lt;ref&gt;The extent to which Heisenberg’s team was devoted to aiding the Nazi’s by producing an atomic bomb is a matter of some historical dispute.  However, most recent scholarship suggests that the stagnation of the German project stemmed from Heisenberg’s doubts about the feasibility rather than the desirability of a Nazi bomb.  See: Rose, Paul Lawrence.  ''Heisenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb Project: A Study in German Culture''.  Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[Manhattan Project]] and other projects of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] resulted in a much more extensive military-scientific venture, the scale of which dwarfed previous military-funded research projects.  Theoretical work by a number of British and American scientists resulted in significant optimism about the possibility of a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. As the physicists convinced military leaders of the potential of nuclear weapons, funding for actual development was ratcheted up rapidly.  A number of large laboratories were created across the United States for work on different aspects of the bomb, while many existing facilities were reoriented to bomb-related work; some were university-managed while others were government-run, but all were ultimately funded and directed by the military.&lt;ref&gt;[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], the University of Chicago’s [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] (now [[Argonne National Laboratory]]), [[Hanford Site]] (now defunct), and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] were all created during the Manhattan Project, while Berkeley’s [[Radiation Laboratory]] and smaller labs across the country became part of the project as well.  Among others, see: Smyth, Henry DeWolf.  [[Smyth Report|''Atomic Energy for Military Purposes: The Official Report on the Development of the Atomic Bomb under the Auspices of the United States Government, 1940-1945]]''.   Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1945. Rhodes, Richard. ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb''.  New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  The May 1945 surrender of Germany, the original intended target for the bomb, did virtually nothing to slow the project’s momentum.  After Japan’s surrender immediately following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], many scientists returned to academia or industry, but the Manhattan Project infrastructure was too large—and too effective—to be dismantled wholesale; it became the model for future military-scientific work, in the U.S. and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp. 324-348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other wartime physics research, particularly in [[rocket]]ry and radar technology, was less significant in popular culture but much more significant for the outcome of the war.  German rocketry was driven by the pursuit of ''[[Wunderwaffe]]n'', resulting in the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[ballistic missile]]; the technology as well as the personal expertise of the German rocketry community was absorbed by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. rocket programs after the war, forming the basis of long-term military funded rocketry, ballistic missile, and later space research.  Rocket science was only beginning to make impact by the final years of the war.  German rockets created fear and destruction in London, but had only modest military significance, while air-to-ground rockets enhanced the power of American air strikes; [[jet aircraft]] also went into service by the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, ''The Machines of War,'' p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Radar work before and during the war provided even more of an advantage for the Allies.  British physicists pioneered [[long-wave radar]], developing an effective system for detecting incoming German air forces.  Work on potentially more precise [[short-wave radar]] was turned over to the U.S.; several thousand academic physicists and engineers not participating the Manhattan Project did radar work, particularly at MIT and Stanford, resulting in [[microwave]] radar systems that could resolve more detail in incoming flight formations.  Further refinement of microwave technology led to proximity fuzes, which greatly enhanced the ability of the U.S. Navy to defend against Japanese bombers.  Microwave production, detection and manipulation also formed the technical foundation to complement the institutional foundation of the Manhattan Project in much post-war defense research.

==American Cold War science==
In the years immediately following World War II, the military was by far the most significant patron of university science research in the U.S., and the national labs also continued to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Roger.  "Science, Universities, and National Defense, 1945-1970," ''Osiris'' (2nd series), Vol. 7, 1992, ''Science after '40'', pp 26-48.  p 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  After two years in political limbo (but with work on nuclear power and bomb manufacture continuing apace) the Manhattan Project became a permanent arm of the government as the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]].  The Navy—inspired by the success of military-directed wartime research—created its own R&amp;D organization, the [[Office of Naval Research]], which would preside over an expanded long-term research program at [[Naval Research Laboratory]] as well as fund a variety of university-based research.  Military money following up the wartime radar research led to explosive growth in both [[electronics]] research and electronics manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, "Behind quantum electronics," pp 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] became an independent service branch from the Army and established its own research and development system, and the Army followed suit (though it was less invested in academic science than the Navy or Air Force).  Meanwhile, the perceived communist menace of the Soviet Union caused tensions—and military budgets—to escalate rapidly.

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] primarily funded what has been broadly described as “physical research,” but to reduce this to merely chemistry and physics is misleading.  Military patronage benefited a large number of fields, and in fact helped create a number of the modern [[scientific discipline]]s.  At [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], for example, electronics, [[aerospace engineering]], [[nuclear physics]], and [[materials science]]&amp;mdash;all physics, broadly speaking&amp;mdash;each developed in different directions, becoming increasingly independent of parent disciplines as they grew and pursued defense-related research agendas.  What began as interdepartmental laboratories became the centers for graduate teaching and research innovation thanks to the broad scope of defense funding.  The need to keep up with corporate technology research (which was receiving the lion’s share of defense contracts) also prompted many science labs to establish close relationships with industry.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, Stuart.  ''The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford''.  New York: Columbian University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computing===
The complex histories of [[history of computer science|computer science]] and [[history of computer hardware|computer engineering]] were shaped, in the first decades of digital computing, almost entirely by military funding.  Most of the basic component technologies for digital computing were developed through the course of the long-running [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]]-[[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] program to develop an automated radar shield.  Virtually unlimited funds enabled two decades of research that only began producing useful technologies by the end of the 50s; even the final version of the SAGE command and control system had only marginal military utility.  More so than with previously-established disciplines receiving military funding, the culture of computer science was permeated with a [[Cold War]] military perspective.  Indirectly, the ideas of computer science also had a profound effect on [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]] and [[neuroscience]] through the mind-computer analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul  ''The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America''.  Cambridge: MIT Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geosciences and astrophysics===
The [[Outline of earth science|history of earth science]] and the [[history of astrophysics]] were also closely tied to military purposes and funding throughout the Cold War.  American [[geodesy]], [[oceanography]], and [[seismology]] grew from small sub-disciplines in into full-fledged independent disciplines as for several decades, virtually all funding in these fields came from the Department of Defense.  A central goal that tied these disciplines together (even while providing the means for intellectual independence) was the [[figure of the Earth]], the model of the earth’s [[geography]] and [[gravitation]] that was essential for accurate ballistic missiles.  In the 1960s, geodesy was the superficial goal of the satellite program [[Corona (satellite)|CORONA]], while military [[reconnaissance]] was in fact a driving force.  Even for geodetic data, new secrecy guidelines worked to restrict collaboration in a field that had formerly been fundamentally international; the Figure of the Earth had geopolitical significance beyond questions of pure geoscience.  Still, geodesists were able to retain enough autonomy and subvert secrecy limitations enough to make use of the findings of their military research to overturn some of the fundamental theories of geodesy.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, John.  "Crossing the Olentangy River: The Figure of the Earth and the Military-Industrial-Academic-Complex, 1947-1972," ''Studies in the History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', Vol. 31, No. 3, pp 371-404. 2000
Cloud, John.  "Imaging the World in a Barrel: CORONA and the Clandestine Convergence of the Earth Sciences," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, pp 231-251.  April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like geodesy and satellite photography research, the advent of [[radio astronomy]] had a military purpose hidden beneath official astrophysical research agenda.  Quantum electronics permitted both revolutionary new methods of analyzing the universe and&amp;mdash;using the same equipment and technology&amp;mdash;the monitoring of Soviet electronic signals.&lt;ref&gt;van Keuren, David K.  "Cold War Science in Black and White: US Intelligence Gathering and Its Scientific Cover at the Naval Research Laboratory, 1948-62," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, pp 207-229.  April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military interest in (and funding of) seismology, meteorology and oceanography was in some ways a result of the defense-related payoffs of physics and geodesy.  The immediate goal of funding in these fields was to detect clandestine [[nuclear testing]] and track [[nuclear fallout|fallout radiation]], a necessary precondition for treaties to limit the nuclear weapon technology earlier military research had created.  In particular, the feasibility of monitoring underground nuclear explosions was crucial to the possibility of a [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|comprehensive]] rather than [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kai-Henrik.  "The Politics of Seismology: Nuclear Testing, Arms Control, and the Transformation of a Discipline," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 33, No. 5, pp 743-781.  October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the military-funded growth of these disciplines continued even when no pressing military goals were driving them; as with other natural sciences, the military also found value in having ‘scientists on tap’ for unforeseen future R&amp;D needs.&lt;ref&gt;Mukerji, Chandra.  ''A Fragile Power: Scientists and the State''.  Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological sciences===
The [[biology|biological sciences]] were also affected by military funding, but, with the exception of nuclear physics-related medical and genetic research, largely indirectly.  The most significant funding sources for basic research before the rise of the military-industrial-academic complex were philanthropic organizations such as the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].  After World War II (and to some extent before), the influx of new industrial and military funding opportunities for the physical sciences prompted philanthropies to divest from physics research&amp;mdash;most early work in high-energy physics and biophysics had been the product of foundation grants&amp;mdash;and refocus on biological and medical research.

The [[social sciences]] also found limited military support from the 1940s to the 1960s, but much defense-minded social science research could be—and was—pursued without extensive military funding.  In the 1950s, social scientists tried to emulate the interdisciplinary organizational success of the physical sciences’ Manhattan Project with the synthetic [[behavioral science movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Though somewhat related, "behavioral science" in this context should not be confused with the [[behavioral sciences]] or [[radical behaviorism|behaviorism]], the strictly mechanistic approach to psychology promoted by B. F. Skinner.  See: Robin, Ron.  ''The Making of the Cold War Enemy: Culture and Politics in the Military-Intellectual Complex''.  Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social scientists actively sought to promote their usefulness to the military, researching topics related to [[propaganda]] (put to use in [[Korean War|Korea]]), decision making, the psychological and sociological causes and effects of [[communism]], and a broad constellation of other topics of Cold War significance.  By the 1960s, economists and political scientists offered up [[modernization theory]] for the cause of Cold War [[nation-building]]; modernization theory found a home in the military in the form of [[Project Camelot]], a study of the process of revolution, as well as in the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]]’s approach to the [[Vietnam War]].  Project Camelot was ultimately canceled because of the concerns it raised about scientific [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in the context of such a politicized research agenda; though natural sciences were not yet susceptible to implications of the corrupting influence of military and political factors, the social sciences were.&lt;ref&gt;For modernization theory, and its role in the Vietnam War, see: Latham, Michael E.  ''Modernization as Ideology: American Social Science and "Nation-Building" in the Kennedy Era''.  Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2000.

==Historical debate==
Historian [[Paul Forman]], in his seminal 1987 article, proposed that not only had military funding of science greatly expanded the scope and significance of American physics, it also initiated "a qualitative change in its purposes and character."&lt;ref&gt;Forman, "Behind quantum electronics," p 150.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians of science were beginning to turn to the Cold War relationship between science and the military for detailed study, and Forman’s “distortionist critique” (as [[Roger Geiger]] has described it) served to focus the ensuing debates.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Roger.  "Review of ''The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford''," ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 34 pp 629-631.  1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman and others (e.g., [[Robert Seidel]], Stuart Leslie, and for the history of the social sciences, [[Ron Robin]]) view the influx of military money and the focus on applied rather than basic research as having had, at least partially, a negative impact on the course of subsequent research.  In turn, critics of the distortionist thesis, beginning with [[Daniel Kevles]], deny that the military "seduced American physicists from, so to speak, a 'true basic physics'."&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, Daniel J.  "Cold war and hot physics: Science, security, and the American state, 1945-56," ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 20, No. 2, pp 239-264.  1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kevles, as well as Geiger, instead view the effects of military funding relative to such funding simply being absent—rather than put to alternate scientific use.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, “Science, Universities, and National Defense, 1945-1970.”  See also: Geiger, Roger.  ''Knowledge &amp; Money: Research Universities and the Paradox of the Marketplace''.  Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004.
In Geiger’s broad analysis of the relationship between political economy and academic research, the character and purpose of funding sources play little role, and there is no discussion of the distinctiveness of military funding.  Rather, such funding is significant only in the context of ‘[[crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]’ other economic forces.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most recent scholarship has moved toward a tempered version of Forman's thesis, in which scientists retained significant autonomy despite the radical changes brought about by military funding.&lt;ref&gt;Hounshell, David A.  "Epilogue: Rethinking the Cold War; Rethinking Science and Technology in the Cold War; Rethinking the Social Study of Science and Technology," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, April 2001, pp 289-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14950">The '''Industrious Revolution''' is the title given to a period of time, usually given as between 1600 and 1800&lt;ref name="Clark1998p841"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 841.&lt;/ref&gt; that led up to the [[Industrial Revolution]].  It is a term first coined by the Japanese demographic historian [[Akira Hayami]] &lt;small&gt;([[:ja:速水融|速水融]])&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;ref name="DeVries2008p78"&gt;De Vries (2008), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and accepted by other historians to help further explain the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of this theory deals with the spending behaviours of families in the period.  It also deals with the production and consumption of goods.  In fact, Industrious Revolutions are often characterized by a rise in demand for "market-supplied goods",&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p265"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; which will minimize the value of domestic goods, before the ultimate consumption. Industrious Revolutions often occur during a period where labour wages have stagnated or decreased.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p265" /&gt;  The theory of a pre-industrial Industrious Revolution is contested within the history community.

== Origin ==
Hayami introduced the concept of Industrious Revolution in a Japanese-language work published in 1967. It was coined to compare the labour-intensive technologies of Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868) with the capital-intensive technologies of Britain's Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Industrious Revolution: Consumer Behavior and the Household Economy, 1650 to the Present|last=de Vries|first=Jan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521895026|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayami observed that the two countries took different paths due to the different mix of factor endowments (capital for Britain and labour for Japan). He introduced Industrious Revolution to describe the Japanese developmental trajectory, which - lacking the British capital - exploited the benefits of increasing labour absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Resurgence of East Asia: 500, 150 and 50 Year Perspectives|last=Arrighi|first=Giovanni|last2=Hamashita|first2=Takeshi|last3=Selden|first3=Mark|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=978-0415316361|location=London|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Industrious vs. Industrial Revolution ==
This proposed Industrious Revolution does not aim to replace the [[Industrial Revolution]] in history; rather it is designed to supplement it.  By revamping the history of the period directly preceding the [[Industrial Revolution]], some historians hope to ensure that people get a better understanding of a particular aspect of the [[Early Modern Period]].
	
The basic picture painted of the pre-Industrial Revolution is that the [[Industrial Revolution]] was the result of a surplus of money and crops, which led to the development of new technology.  This new technology eventually developed into factories.  The Industrious Revolution addresses this belief, saying instead, that the overwhelming desire for more goods directly preceded the Industrial Revolution. The theory states that during the Industrious Revolution there was an increase in demand for goods, but that supply did not rise as quickly.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p255"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Eventually, some achievements of industry and agriculture, as well as the decisions made by households, helped to increase the supply, as well as the demand for goods. These behaviours, when combined constitute an Industrious Revolution.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p255" /&gt;  A quick summation of the differences between the Industrious Revolution and the [[Industrial Revolution]] is that the former is concerned with demand, and the latter is supply based.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p256"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The right mindset to a productional economy and world may have increased the supply of technology, but they would have had little impact on invention without a demand for new techniques. 
	
The theory of an Industrious Revolution, as put forward by historian Jan de Vries, claims that there were two parts to the Industrious Revolution.  First, there was a reduction of leisure time as the utility of monetary income rose.  Second, the focus of labour shifted from goods and services to marketable goods.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p257"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some within the field of [[cultural history]] have theorized that a further motive for an industrious revolution is a shift in the view on what it takes for an individual to be considered independent.  Independence was equated with land ownership prior to an industrious revolution.  Wage earners were granted a degraded and dependent status.  Typically, as in the case of pre-industrial Great Britain and America, these dependent sorts were deemed unworthy of full citizenship rights.  Industrious revolutions shift the meaning of independence from land-holding to earning a competency.  A wage earner could now be considered independent if he/she earned enough money to support a household.  Hard work was viewed as essential for reaching this goal.

== Opposition ==
One of the suggested hallmarks of an Industrious Revolution is that of increased work days.  However, according to historians Gregory Clark and Ysbrand Van Der Werf, there has been no information found to suggest an increase in work days, in the time period between the [[Medieval]] Period and the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p839"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 839.&lt;/ref&gt; These records even indicate that before 1750, some people were working three hundred days per year.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p836"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 836.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even in the period preceding the [[Industrial Revolution]] people were working at least two hundred and ninety days in a year.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p837"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 837.&lt;/ref&gt;  So, this information would demonstrate that there was very little increase in days worked.  Since increase in work loads is one of the suggested hallmarks of an Industrious Revolution, this would work against the theory.
	
Clark and Van Der Werf have also examined the output of a couple of English industries.  For one, they looked at records of the saw mills in England.  Between 1300 and 1800, the period directly preceding and following the proposed Industrious Revolution, the estimated amount of lumber sawed increased about eighty percent.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p835"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 835.&lt;/ref&gt;    However, this increase in lumber sawed can be attributed to new technologies, and not in fact the influence of an Industrious Revolution.  In contrast, they mention the [[threshing]] industry.  Unlike the lumber sawing business, this industry shows “clear downward movement”&lt;ref name="Clark1998p834"&gt;Clark &amp; Van Der Werf (1998), p. 834.&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[threshing]] rates, after which there are no longer any trends.&lt;ref name="Clark1998p834" /&gt; This information would help to disprove the idea of an Industrious Revolution, since, as it has been put forth, there is no universal trend displaying an increase of work habits.

In a later work, Hayami cited that de Vries and other theorists' interpretations did not use the term in the same way he does. Hayami noted that these saw Industrious Revolution and Industrial Revolution as a continuum while the original idea considers the two revolutions as opposing concepts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japan's Industrious Revolution: Economic and Social Transformations in the Early Modern Period|last=Hayami|first=Akira|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9784431551416|location=Tokyo|pages=95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayami also stressed that the term explained how the Japanese became industrious for some reason at one point and that eventually they will no longer be.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Production of goods ==
Prior the proposed era of the Industrious Revolution most goods were produced either by household or by [[guilds]].&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p202"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many households involved in the production of marketable goods.  Most of what was produced by these households were things that involved cloth- textiles, clothing, as well as art,&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p202" /&gt; and tapestries.&lt;ref name="Jardine1996p399"&gt;Jardine (1996), p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;  These would be produced by the households, or by their respective [[guilds]].  It was even possible for [[guilds]] and merchants to outsource into more rural areas, to get some of the work done. These merchants would bring the raw materials to the workers, who would then, using the supplied materials, make the goods.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p419"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, young girls would be hired to make silk, because they were the only people believed to have hands dexterous enough to make the silk properly.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p418"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other occupations such as knitting, a job that was never organized into guilds, could easily be done within the household.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The income of the household became dependent upon the quality and the quantity of everyone's work.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994"&gt;De Vries (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Even if people were not working for an individual [[guild]] they could still supply and make items not controlled by the [[guilds]]. These would be small, but necessary items like wooden dishes, or soaps.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006p205"&gt;Wiesner-Hanks (2006), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; So, basically, much of production was done by, or for, [[guilds]]. This would indicate that much of what was done was not done for one individual household, but for a larger group or organization. 

Prior to the Industrious Revolution, the household was the major site of production, and could be comparable to a factory. However, things were to change a bit during the Industrious Revolution.  If the theory is to be believed, then there was a shift in the running of the household.  The everyday goods and products used by the household would slowly shift from mostly homemade, to mostly "commercially produced goods".&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p262"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the women would be more than likely to be able to attain jobs outside of the household.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p261-62"&gt;De Vries (1994), pp. 261–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is also seen within the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], where women would often find small jobs to help supplement their husband's wages.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  This would demonstrate the gradual movement away from the household as a centre of production.

==Patterns of consumption==
The patterns of consumption present in England at this time period were similar to what one might find in Europe, as well as in some of the Ottoman territories. This is unsurprising, however, since most of Europe and the Ottoman Empire were all connected through trade.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p252"&gt;De Vries (1994), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;  Through these trade connections, people were able to buy many of the luxury goods that they desired.  Very common amongst the nobility was the idea of [[Conspicuous consumption]].  This can be traced back, even into the [[Middle Ages]].  People, the nobility especially, had trade connections throughout Europe, and many of them would use these connections to buy the works of art, etc. that they desired.&lt;ref name="Jardine1996"&gt;Jardine (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not extend only to the rich however: even [[Medieval]] peasants enjoyed imported luxury items; there is evidence to suggest that some English peasants drank imported French wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Peasant |title=Medieval Lives |last=Jones |first=Terry |authorlink= |author2=Ereira, Alan |year=2005 |publisher=BBC Press |location=London |isbn=978-0-563-48793-7 |page=23 |chapter-url=}}{{Verify credibility|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People were consuming products well before the Industrious Revolution. There were stock exchanges all over Europe, even London.&lt;ref name="Wiesner-Hanks2006" /&gt; People were also clearly making products for consumption, as the large number of guilds existing within Europe at that point would suggest.  What would cause the period between 1600 and 1800 to be labeled an Industrious Revolution, by looking at the patterns of consumption, is the rise in demand for these products.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994p255" /&gt; So, what would set this period in time apart would be more demands for luxury items.  Especially those items that could not be produced in the homes or by the [[guilds]].  During the proposed Industrious Revolution, this demand for luxury items would be greater than the supply could accommodate.&lt;ref name="DeVries1994" /&gt;  A rise in the rate at which people were consuming goods, especially when combined with other factors of the times, could have potentially heralded the Industrious Revolution.

{{InfoMaps}}
'''Information mapping''' is a research-based method for writing clear and user focused information, based on the audience's needs and the purpose of the information. The method is applied primarily to designing and developing business and technical communications. It is used as a content standard within organizations throughout the world.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

== Overview of the information mapping method ==
The information mapping method is a research-based methodology used to analyze, organize and present information based on an audience's needs and the purpose of the information. The method applies to all subject matter and media technology. Information mapping has close ties to [[information visualization]], [[information architecture]], [[graphic design]], [[information design]], [[data analysis]], [[experience design]], graphic [[user interface design]], and [[knowledge management]] systems.

== Components of the method ==
Information mapping provides a number of tools for analyzing, organizing and presenting information.

=== Information types ===
Some of [[Robert E. Horn]]'s best-known work was his development of the theory of information types. Horn identified six types of information that account for nearly all the content of business and technical communications. The types categorize elements according to their purpose for the audience:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
{| class="wikitable"!
!Information Type
!Description
|-
|'''Procedure'''
|A set of steps an individual performs to complete a single task
|-
|'''Process'''
|A series of events, stages or phases that occurs over time and has a specific outcome
|-
|'''Principle'''
|A statement designed to dictate, guide or require behavior
|-
|'''Concept'''
|A class or group of things that share a critical set of attributes
|-
|'''Structure'''
|A description or depiction of anything that has parts or boundaries
|-
|'''Fact'''
|A statement that is assumed to be true
|}

=== Research-based principles ===
The information mapping method proposes six principles for organizing information so that it is easy to access, understand, and remember:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
{| class="wikitable"
!Principle
!Description
|-
|'''Chunking'''
|Break up information into small, manageable units
|-
|'''Relevance'''
|Limit each unit of information to a single topic
|-
|'''Labeling'''
|Label each unit of information in a way that identifies its contents
|-
|'''Consistency'''
|Be consistent in use of terminology as well as in organizing, formatting and sequencing information
|-
|'''Accessible detail'''
|Organize and structure information so those who need detail can access it easily, while those who don't can easily skip it
|-
|'''Integrated graphics'''
|Use graphics within the text to clarify, emphasize and add dimension
|}

=== Units of information ===
Documents written according to information mapping have a modular structure. They consist of clearly outlined information units (''maps'' and ''blocks'') that take into account how much information a reader is able to assimilate.

There is an essential difference between an information unit and the traditional text paragraph. A ''block'' is limited to a single topic and consists of a single type of information. Blocks are grouped into ''maps'', and each map consists only of relevant blocks. The hierarchical approach to structuring information greatly facilitates electronic control of content via [[content management system]]s and knowledge management systems.

== Advantages of information mapping ==
The information mapping method offers advantages to writers and readers, as well as to an entire organization.

=== Advantages for writers ===
Information mapping offers these advantages for writers:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
* An easily learned systematic approach to the task of writing that once learned, enables writers to minimize down time and start writing immediately
* A subject-matter independent approach that can be applied to all business-related or technical content
* A content standard that greatly facilitates team writing and management of writing projects
* Enhanced writer productivity, with less time required for both draft development and review, and
* Easy updating and revision of content throughout its life cycle

=== Advantages for readers ===
Information mapping offers these advantages for readers:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
* Quick, easy access to information at the right level of detail, even for diverse audiences
* Improved comprehension
* Fewer errors and misunderstandings
* Fewer questions for supervisors, and
* Shorter training cycles, less need for re-training

=== Advantages for organizations ===
Also an entire organization can benefit from using a content standard like information mapping if the method is used with the following objectives in mind:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
* Revenue growth by reducing time to create content and accelerating time to market
* Cost reduction by capturing employee knowledge, increasing operational efficiency, reducing support calls, and decreasing translation costs
* Risk mitigation by increasing safety and compliance

== History ==
Information mapping was developed in the late 20th century by [[Robert E. Horn]], a researcher in the cognitive and behavioral sciences. Horn was interested in visual presentation of information to improve accessibility, comprehension and performance. Horn's development of the information mapping method has won him recognition from the [[International Society for Performance Improvement]] and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].{{cn|date=March 2016}}

=== Review of research ===
Many independent studies have confirmed that applying the information mapping method to business and technical communications results in quicker, easier access to information, improved comprehension and enhanced performance. It also facilitates repurposing for publication in different formats.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

Doubts have been raised over the strength of the research Horn uses to justify some of his principles. For instance, his chunking principle requires lists, paragraphs, sub-sections and sections in a document to contain no more than 7±2 chunks of information.&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Horn, ''Developing Procedures, Policies &amp; Documentation'', Info-Map, Waltham, 1992, page 3-A-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Horn does not state where he got this principle, but an Information Mapping website stated that the principle is "based on George A. Miller's 1956 research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infomap.com/index.cfm/themethod/Mapping_FAQs |title=Mapping FAQs |work=Infomap.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218043241/http://www.infomap.com/index.cfm/TheMethod/Mapping_FAQs |archivedate=2010-02-18 |accessdate=2017-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller did write a paper in 1956 called "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on our Capacity for Processing Information", but its relevance to writing is tenuous.&lt;ref name="Marnell"&gt;Geofrey Marnell, ''Essays on Technical Writing'', Burdock Books, Brighton, 2016, pp. 111–155).&lt;/ref&gt; Miller himself said that his research had nothing to do with writing.&lt;ref&gt;See http://members.shaw.ca/philip.sharman/miller.txt, Viewed 14 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Insisting that lists, paragraphs, sub-sections and sections throughout  a document contain no more than 7±2 chunks of information paradoxically assumes that the size of what is not read in a document can influence a reader's ability to comprehend what they do read.&lt;ref name="Marnell"/&gt;

# Grasping or holding instruments: Smooth [anatomical] and Toothed [surgical] Forceps, Towel Clamps, vascular clamps, and organ holders.
# Hemostatic instruments: Billroth’s clamps, hemostatic “mosquito” forceps, atraumatic hemostatic forceps, Deschamp’s needle, Höpfner’s hemostatic forceps.
# Retractors:Farabef’s C-shaped laminar hook, blunt-toothed hook, sharp-toothed hook, grooved probe, tamp forceps
# tissue unifying instruments and materials: needle holders, surgical needles, staplers, clips, adhesive tapes.

Legal Tech companies are generally [[startup companies|startups]] founded with the purpose of [[disruptive innovation|disrupting]] the traditionally conservative legal market.&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Bob|title=Four Areas of Legal Ripe for Disruption by Smart Startups|url=http://www.lawtechnologytoday.org/2014/12/smart-startups/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Law Technology Today|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[TechCrunch]], as of December 2014, "legal technology is booming, with companies attempting to disrupt the legal space at every level and from every angle"&lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Basha|title=Legal Tech Startups Have A Short History And A Bright Future|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/06/legal-tech-startups-have-a-short-history-and-a-bright-future/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=TechCrunch|date=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Forbes]] noted in February 2015 that there were “hundreds of legal startups popping up all over the US and Europe”.&lt;ref name="Forbes1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Juetten|first1=Mary|title=The Future Of Legal Tech: It's Not As Scary As Lawyers Think|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryjuetten/2015/02/19/legal-tech-or-tech-legal/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Legal technology traditionally referred to the application of technology and software to help law firms with [[legal matter management|practice management]], [[document management system|document storage]], [[invoicing|billing]], [[accounting]] and [[electronic discovery]].&lt;ref name="lawinsider"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hibnick|first1=Eva|title=What is Legal Tech?|url=http://www.thelawinsider.com/insider-news/what-is-legal-tech|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=The Law Insider|date=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, Legal Tech has evolved to be associated more with technology startups disrupting the [[practice of law]] by giving people access to online software that reduces or in some cases eliminates the need to consult a lawyer, or by connecting people with lawyers more efficiently through online marketplaces and lawyer-matching websites.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"/&gt;

==Industry context==
The legal industry is widely seen to be conservative and traditional, with Law Technology Today noting that "in 50 years, the customer experience at most law firms has barely changed".&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;  Reasons for this include the fact law firms face weaker cost-cutting incentives than other professions (since they pass disbursements directly to their client) and are seen to be risk averse (as a minor technological error could have significant financial consequences for a client).&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;

However, the growth of the hiring by businesses of in-house counsel and their increasing sophistication, together with the development of email, has led to clients placing increasing cost and time pressure on their lawyers.&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;  In addition, there are increasing incentives for lawyers to become technologically competent, with the [[American Bar Association]] voting in August 2012 to amend the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] to require lawyers to keep abreast of "the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Client-Lawyer Relationship, Rule 1.1 Competence - Comment|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_1_competence/comment_on_rule_1_1.html|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambrogi|first1=Robert|title=The Cloud Has Landed: 10 Legal Tech Innovations and What They Mean|url=http://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/WisconsinLawyer/Pages/Article.aspx?Volume=88&amp;Issue=4&amp;ArticleID=23997|website=Wisconsin Lawyer|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the saturation of the market leading many lawyers to look for cutting-edge ways to compete.  &lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"/&gt; The exponential growth in the volume of documents (mostly email) that must be reviewed for litigation cases has greatly accelerated the adoption of technology used in eDiscovery, with elements of machine language and artificial intelligence being incorporated and cloud-based services being adopted by law firms.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Investment in Legal Tech is predominantly focused in the United States with more than $254 million invested in 2014 in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legaltransformationinstitute.com/blog/2014/3/10/legal-startup-funding-2014-so-far |title=Legal Startup Funding &amp;#124; 2014 So Far [Update 10/24/14&amp;#93; — LTI |website=Legaltransformationinstitute.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there is significant growth worldwide.&lt;ref name="Forbes2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Basha|title=Is The Legal Tech Boom Over? It Hasn't Even Begun|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/basharubin/2014/08/12/is-legal-tech-boom-over-it-hasnt-even-begun/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanford Law School]] has started CodeX, the Center for Legal Informatics, an interdisciplinary research center, which also incubates companies started by law students and computer scientists. Some companies that have come out of the program include [[Lex Machina]] and [[Legal.io]].&lt;ref name="lawinsider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stanford Law School |url=https://www.law.stanford.edu/organizations/programs-and-centers/codex-the-stanford-center-for-legal-informatics |title=CodeX - Programs and Centers - Stanford Law School |website=Law.stanford.edu |date=2016-11-27 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sinclair MTV-1 Front.jpg|thumb|Front view of Sinclair MTV-1]]
[[File:Sinclair MTV-1B.jpg|thumb|Sinclair MTV-1B]]

The '''MTV-1 Micro TV''' was the second model of a [[handheld television|near pocket-sized]] [[television]]. The first was the Panasonic IC model TR-001 introduced in 1970. The MTV-1 was developed by [[Clive Sinclair]] (Sinclair Radionics Ltd). It was shown to the public at [[trade show]]s in [[London]] and [[Chicago]] in January, 1977, and released for sale in 1978. Development spanned 10 years and included a cash infusion of {{GBP|1.6 million|link=yes}} (about {{USD|2.9 million}}&lt;ref name="GBP1976-1978" /&gt;) from the UK government in 1976.

The MTV-1 used a [[Germany|German]] [[Telefunken|AEG Telefunken]] {{convert|2|inch|cm|adj=on}} black-and-white, electrostatic [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), the smallest CRT built into a commercially available product, and included a rechargeable 4-[[AA battery|AA]]-cell [[NiCad]] battery pack. It measured {{convert|4|*|6.25|*|1.625|in|mm}} and weighed {{convert|28|oz|g}}. It was able to receive either [[phase alternating line|PAL]] or [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] transmissions on [[very high frequency|VHF]] or [[ultra high frequency|UHF]]. A [[Wales|Welsh]] company, Wolsey Electronics, manufactured it for Sinclair. Custom [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s made by [[Texas Instruments]] and Sinclair contributed to its small size and low power consumption.

The original {{USD|395}} (about {{GBP|205}}&lt;ref name="GBP1976-1978" /&gt;) price tag proved to be too high to sell many of them, and Sinclair lost over {{GBP|1.8 million}} in 1978, eventually selling its remaining inventory to liquidators at greatly reduced prices.

The MTV-1B, released later in 1978 at the much lower price of {{GBP|99}}, was able to receive only British and South African UHF PAL signals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10848">'''Mobile collaboration''' is a technology-based process of communicating using electronic assets and accompanying software designed for use in remote locations. Newest generation hand-held electronic devices feature video, audio, and telestration (on-screen drawing) capabilities broadcast over secure networks, enabling multi-party conferencing in real time (although real time communication is not a strict requirement of mobile collaboration and may not be applicable or practical in many collaboration scenarios).

Differing from traditional [[videoconferencing|video conferencing]], mobile collaboration utilizes [[wireless]], [[Cellular network|cellular]] and [[broadband]] technologies enabling effective [[collaboration]] independent of location. Where traditional video conferencing has been limited to boardrooms, offices, and lecture theatres, [[recent technological advancements]] have extended the capabilities of video conferencing for use with discreet, [[Mobile device|hand-held mobile devices]], permitting true mobile collaborative possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Scope ==
The scope of mobile collaboration takes into account a number of elements that continue to evolve in their sophistication and complexity: video, audio and telestration capabilities, conferencing and [[telepresence]] systems, collaboration tools, [[Data transmission|transmission]] technologies, and mobility.

== Forecasts ==
[[Cisco Systems]] predicts "two-thirds of the world's mobile data traffic will be video by 2015."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Unified Communications Interoperability Forum]] (UCIF), a non-profit alliance of technology vendors states that "one important driver for the growth of UC ([[unified communications]]) is mobility and the remote worker. No segment is growing faster than mobile communications, and virtually every [[Smartphone|smart phone]] will be equipped with [[Videotelephony|video chat]], [[Instant Messaging|IM]], directory, and other UC features within a few years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manufacturing ===
Manufacturers of all kinds use mobile collaboration technology in a number of ways. Recent trends in [[globalization]] and [[outsourcing]] in particular, have meant that companies need to communicate with employees, suppliers, and customers the world over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy ===
Companies in the energy sector face unique challenges due to, for example, the vast distances between a head office and the remote, harsh environment of an offshore oil rig, as well as the often inadequacies or absence of  necessary transmission networks. Recent advancements in mobile collaboration technology and transmission networks are making it possible for employees in these situations to collaborate in secure and reliable ways with colleagues thousands of miles away. The use of mobile collaboration in the energy sector is enabling companies to conduct remote inspections, safety audits, maintenance, repair and overhaul work, as well as IT/communication infrastructure troubleshooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare ===
Although [[telemedicine]] technology has been in use for a number of years in the healthcare sector, mobile collaboration technology extends these capabilities to locations now reachable through the use of hand-held devices such as a remote community, long-term care facility, or a patient’s home. Healthcare professionals in multiple locations can together view, discuss, and assess patient issues. The use of mobile collaboration technology within the healthcare sector has the potential to improve the quality and access to care, while making its delivery more cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Mobile collaboration technology might also be used for remote education. From one on one tutoring to large classes it has many uses. Homeschooling could really benefit from this technology as you participate in a lecture from anywhere in the world. Most useful you can record your classes or lectures and review them. Internet schools, including higher education, will most certainly also benefit from this development in mobile education. Though these methods are not widely used they are quite useful and most likely will become widely popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Franchise businesses ==
Mobile collaboration between franchiser and franchisee allows modern technology to be used to allow a better flow of communications similar to face-to-face, albeit remotely via video/voice media such as smartphones, tablets, iPhones, iPads, etc. to be collectively used without requiring one party to travel to another location.  This in turn reduces travel time and expenses not to mention better and quicker modes of communication.

Franchisers who have several hundred franchisees find it an absolute must.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Refimprove|date=September 2018}}
A '''mobile network operator''' or '''MNO''', also known as a '''wireless service provider''', '''wireless carrier''', '''cellular company''', or '''mobile network carrier''', is a provider of [[wireless communications]] services that owns or controls all the elements necessary to sell and deliver services to an end user including [[radio spectrum]] allocation, [[wireless network]] infrastructure, [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|back haul]]  infrastructure, billing, customer care, [[provisioning]] computer systems and marketing and repair organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27804/mobile-network-operator-mno/|title=What is a Mobile Network Operator (MNO)? - Definition from Technopedia|website=Technopedia|access-date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=September 2018}}

In addition to obtaining revenue by offering retail services under its own brand, an MNO may also sell access to network services at wholesale rates to mobile virtual network operators.

A key defining characteristic of a mobile network operator is that an MNO must own or control access to a [[frequency allocation|radio spectrum license]] from a regulatory or government entity. A second key defining characteristic of an MNO is that an MNO must own or control the elements of the network infrastructure necessary to provide services to subscribers over the licensed spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2018-07-04-why-a-wireless-open-access-network-wont-work/#.Wz_ildhKjBI|title=Why a wireless open access network won’t work|publisher=Daily Maverick|author=Ivo Vegter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mobile network operator typically also has the necessary provisioning, billing and customer care computer systems and the marketing, customer care and engineering organizations needed to sell, deliver and bill for services. However, an MNO can outsource any of these systems or functions and still be considered a mobile network operator.

'''Mobile social networking''' (MSN) is [[social networking]] where individuals with similar interests converse and connect with one another through their [[mobile phone]] and/or [[tablet computer|tablet]]. Much like web-based social networking, mobile social networking occurs in [[virtual communities]].

Many web-based social networking sites, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], have created [[mobile application]]s to give their users instant and real-time access from anywhere they have access to the Internet. Additionally, native mobile social networks have been created, such as [[Instagram]], [[Foursquare]], and [[Strava]], to allow communities to be built around mobile functionality.

More and more, the line between mobile and web is being blurred as mobile apps use existing social networks to create native communities and promote discovery, and web-based social networks take advantage of mobile features and accessibility.

As mobile web evolved from proprietary mobile technologies and networks, to full mobile access to the Internet, the distinction changed to the following types:

# Web-based social networks being extended for mobile access through [[mobile browser]]s and [[smartphone]] [[application software|apps]]
# Native mobile social networks with dedicated focus on mobile use such as [[mobile communication]], [[location-based service]]s, and [[augmented reality]]

While mobile and web-based social networking systems often work symbiotically to spread content, increase accessibility, and connect users, consumers are increasingly spending their attention on native apps compared to [[web browser]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/|title=Mobile marketing statistics 2016|date=2016-10-26|newspaper=Smart Insights|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The evolution of social networking on [[mobile network]]s started in 1999 with basic [[online chat|chatting]] and [[texting]] services. With the introduction of various technologies in mobile networks, social networking has reached an advance level over four generations.&lt;ref name="buongiorno_final"&gt;[http://www.telecoms.com/files/2009/05/buongiorno_final-fmt_nl-3110-f.pdf White paper on Mobile Social Networks]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1999–2000===
Technologies used in this generation are application-based, pre-installed on mobile handsets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mobile Social Networking and Computing: A Multidisciplinary Integrated Perspective|last=Wang|first=Yufeng|last2=Ma|first2=Jianhua|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=9781466552753|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Features include text-only chat via [[chat room]]s. The people who used these services were anonymous. The services of this generation's mobile social networks can be used on a pay-as-you-go or [[Subscription billing service|subscription-to-service]] basis.

===2004–2006===
The introduction of [[3G]] and [[camera phone]]s added many features such as uploading photos, [[mobile search]] for person based on profile, and contacting/flirting with another person anonymously. Regional distributions of these features include Japan, Korea, Australia, Western Europe and US. The applications are mostly useful for dating purposes. The services of this generation's mobile social networks can be used on a pay-as-you-go or subscription-to-service basis.

===2006–2008===
The experiments for this generation mobile social networks started in 2006. It was adopted widely in 2008/2009. This generation brought tremendous changes and made mobile social networks as a part of daily life. The features include a richer [[user experience]], automatic publishing to [[user profile|web profile]] and [[status update]]s, some [[Web 2.0]] features, search by group/join by interests, [[Alert messaging|alerts]], [[location-based service]]s and content sharing (especially music). Technologies include [[WAP 2.0]], Java on the server, [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]], and voice capture. Applications introduced were customized with general interests such as music and mobile-specific [[content distribution]]. Regional distributions of this generation of mobile social networks include Japan, Korea, Western Europe, and North America. [[Online advertising|Advertising]] and ad-supported content become increasingly important. The services in this generation can be used with pay-as-you-go plans; subscription-based plans were still popular as networks increased their scale to become content distribution platforms.

===2008 – present===
Fourth generation began in 2008 and reached in 2010. All the features in third generation are advanced in this generation of social mobile networks. The features of this generation include the features of the third generation, the ability to hide/mask one's presence, asynchronous [[video chat|video conversation]], multi-point audio chat conversation with one button, and multiplayer mobile gaming. Technologies which made these features possible are Web 2.0 widgets, [[Flash Lite]], [[OpenSocial]], and [[Open Handset Alliance]]. The business model of previous generations continued along with [[virtual currency]] – the purchase and trade of virtual goods.

In parallel to the increase of various technologies in mobile networks, the number of hours spent per adult on mobile devices per day has increased dramatically since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/|title=Mobile marketing statistics 2016|date=2016-10-26|newspaper=Smart Insights|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, mobile devices have surpassed desktop/laptops as the most used device per day for internet usage. A steady increase of mobile application usage over the past few years has contributed to the rise of mobile social networks, as well as to the diversity of usage of mobile social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flurrymobile.tumblr.com/post/136677391508/stateofmobile2015|title=Media, Productivity &amp; Emojis Give Mobile Another Stunning Growth Year|newspaper=Flurry Blog|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the use of mobile social networks has increased, the location-based services within the mobile social network has also been increasing. Social network service companies now provide more location-based services for customers' wide use of the mobile devices and their convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shankar|first=P.|last2=Huang|first2=Yun-Wu|last3=Castro|first3=P.|last4=Nath|first4=B.|last5=Iftode|first5=L.|date=2012-03-01|title=Crowds replace experts: Building better location-based services using mobile social network interactions|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6199845/|journal=2012 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications|pages=20–29|doi=10.1109/PerCom.2012.6199845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Mobile social networking sites allow users to create a [[user profile|profile]], send and receive messages via phone or computer and visit an online version of a mobile site. There were different models which were adapted by different networking sites. Most of these sites have many unique features or special functions, but the main function of the site remains the same as other services. All these sites are categorized according to the following business models and usage.

=== Social network ===
Similar to there being many online social networking sites, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], there are just as many social network on mobile devices. They offer vast number of functions including multimedia posts, photo sharing, and instant messaging. Most of these mobile apps offer free international calling and texting capabilities. Today, social networking apps are not just for the social aspect, but are frequently used for professional aspects as well, such as LinkedIn, which is still constantly growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2012/05/21/facebook-vs-linkedin-whats-the-difference/#60f7f5aa792f|title=Facebook vs. LinkedIn - What's the Difference?|last=Bersin|first=Josh|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with sharing multimedia posts and instant messaging, social networks are commonly used to connect immigrants in a new country. While the thought of moving to a new country may be intimidating for many, social media can be used to connect immigrants of the same land together to make assimilation a little less stressful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Media in Industrial China|last=Wang|first=Xinyuan|publisher=UCL Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=London|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Messaging===

This model is focused on the ability to send short, text-based messages to an individual, group of close friends, or even a large group of classmates, simultaneously. This category enables messages to reach the right people as quickly as possible. Many messaging apps are very popular, maybe even more than classical texting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://onereach.com/blog/are-mobile-messaging-apps-overtaking-text-messaging-not-exactly/|title=Are Mobile Messaging Apps Overtaking Text Messaging? Not Exactly|newspaper=OneReach Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some social network platforms, such as [[Facebook]], have their own native messaging applications, similar to [[Facebook Messenger]]. Different countries have a certain messenger that is predominant, like China with [[WeChat]], Korea with [[KakaoTalk]], and the US with [[WhatsApp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://readwrite.com/2014/03/06/10-biggest-popular-mobile-messaging-apps-world-whatsapp/|title=The 10 Most Popular Mobile Messaging Apps In The World|last=6|first=Posted on March|last2=Mobile|first2=2014 in|date=2014-03-06|website=ReadWrite|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media share ===
This can be viewed as an advanced version of the messenger category. In addition to text messages, audio and video files can be transmitted among a group, such as [[Skype]] or [[OoVoo|Oovoo]], which are forms of online video chatting. In the case of [[Instagram]] and [[Vine (service)|Vine]], photos and videos of personal lives are shared to either friends or to the public. Similarly, [[Pinterest]] is used to share photos, but on a more community level. The largest media sharing app today is [[YouTube]], which allows people post videos and share with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/womensmedia/2014/05/04/things-you-should-know-about-youtube-vimeo-vine-and-instagram/#6ced8cf26027|title=Things You Should Know About YouTube, Vimeo, Vine, and Instagram|last=WomensMedia|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these services store media content online for easy storage and access.

===Local discoverability===
Some mobile social networks, such as [[Yelp]], [[Foursquare|FourSquare]] and [[Yik Yak|YikYak]], allow users to search for local venues. Many of these apps publish [[Crowdsourcing|crowd-sourced]] reviews and tips about restaurants, shops, places of interest and more. Yelp and FourSquare also personalizes each user's database according to their latest search and interest to make searching more efficient.

===Social gaming===

This model is about connecting people through both [[multi-player game]]s and competitive [[single-player game]]s. Mobile devices are always increasing their capacity for graphics performance and computing power, making them capable gaming devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2012/09/13/mobile-game-developers-discuss-iphone-5-graphics-matter/#2fa052fd6cad|title=Mobile Game Developers Discuss iPhone 5: "Graphics Matter"|last=Evangelho|first=Jason|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader in this category is [[Zynga]], creators of ''[[Farmville]]'' and ''[[Words with Friends]]'', though it has suffered a decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/10/18/zynga-social-games-growth/|title=Zynga in Slumps-Ville, But Social Games Are Still Hot|last=Review|first=MIT Technology|website=Mashable|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hearthstone (video game)|Hearthstone]]'' is another popular mobile game where players use monster and spell cards to fight each other. Many games also introduce the idea of having another player as an "ally" during game play. For example, in ''[[Naruto Blazing]]'', players can choose one person from a set of players to be on their team while fighting enemies throughout the game. Mobile social networks can also connect people outside of the mobile environment. ''[[Pokémon Go|Pokemon Go]]'' incorporated augmented reality to allow players to catch Pokemon while together physically while outside. Players can also battle each other at gyms in various locations in the world. Facebook has also integrated games through its chat messenger. For example, friends can play chess by sending "@fbchess play" to the other person or basketball by sending a basketball emoji and clicking on the emoji.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/feature/a788495/hidden-facebook-games-how-to-find-play-facebook-messengers-secret-games-basketball-chess/|title=How to find and play ALL of the hidden Facebook games|date=2016-12-17|newspaper=Digital Spy|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating===
These are location-based apps that allow users to create a profile and are matched with those who have similar interests. Some of these sites use radar to ping a user if there is a matching single profile within a certain distance. [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]] was the first dating app that started the trend and has one of the largest user base. Other dating apps include [[Coffee Meets Bagel]] and [[OkCupid]]. These sites are marked with serious security measures, so that no personal details are released without the user's consent. However, there still has been several dangerous incidents that rose questions of whether Tinder-like apps are safe and should be kept around.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/crimes-linked-to-tinder-and-grindr-increase-seven-fold/|title=Crimes linked to Tinder and Grindr increase seven fold|newspaper=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Music apps connect people by sharing playlists and being able to see what other people are listening to. [[Spotify]], a very popular music site, is also used to social networking in a sense that people can see what their friends are listening to at the moment as well. Users can also follow certain artists or even friends that they want to, which is a form of “liking” a post on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/spotify-branches-out-into-its-own-social-network/|title=Spotify branches out into its own social network|newspaper=CNET|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other social media music apps include radio stations like [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]] and [[last.fm]].

=== Fitness ===
Recently, mobile social networks has also been used to motivate individuals to stick to their fitness and health goals. These social networks either work as a form of encouragement by rewarding the individual when they have accomplish a goal, or as a form of punishment by disciplining those who failed to accomplish their goal through a monetary cost or social pressure. An example of this network is [http://www.pactapp.com/ PACT]. In PACT, individuals make a weekly goal to exercise more or eat healthier and set a monetary amount that you will pay if you don’t succeed. Using the app, you can prove that you were at the gym through GPS or that you ate healthy meals by uploading pictures of the meal. If you succeed in your goal, you earn cash paid by members who didn’t keep to their goals.

[[Strava]] is another mobile social network application that lets you keep track of your activities using GPS and analyze your performance through metrics such as speed and distance. Using the social network, you can meet other individuals who are also into the same activities as you and find out about new track routes or challenges or other athletic content.

=== Mobile commerce ===
Mobile commerce, or [[Mobile commerce|m-commerce]], is a branch of [[e-commerce]], that is available in a form of apps and mobile sites. In some apps like [[letgo]], it is easy for the buyer to talk to the seller about specifics about the product or negotiate the price and this assumes a form of social networking. It also narrows the search down by cities and topics to make it more efficient. Some major e-commerce sites, such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[eBay]], are also available in apps, so that people can shop anytime and anywhere. Particularly, however, some mobile social media networks add m-commerce functionalities to their applications. For instance, there is the case of the Facebook Marketplace where people can sell and purchase products through their mobile devices. Many e-commerce and m-commerce applications are also increasingly developed to interface with other applications such as mobile payment, banking, and ticketing applications so customers can easily pay or accept payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mobile Commerce|last=Bandyopadhyay|first=Karabi|publisher=PHI Learning|year=2013|isbn=9788120348059|location=Delhi|pages=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enhanced Discovering Computers|last=LeVermaat|first=Misty|last2=Sebok|first2=Susan|last3=Freund|first3=Steven|last4=Frydenberg|first4=Mark|last5=Campbell|first5=Jennifer|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2016|isbn=9781305657458|location=Boston, MA|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is the case of Instagram, which in 2018 became open to merchants using the [[Shopify]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/09/17/instagram-stories-shopping-shopify/|title=You Can Now Shop Directly From Instagram Stories|last=King|first=Rachel|date=September 17, 2018|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Mobile payments ===
Mobile payment social networks such as [[Venmo]] and [[Square cash|Square Cash]] allow for person-to-person money transfer between family and friends, with a swipeable feed of payment details similar to Facebook's [[News Feed]].

=== Miscellaneous ===
There are still many functionalities of mobile social networks that do not fall into any specific categories. One is collecting rebates. [[Ibotta]] allows users to submit receipts to collect rebates for items they have purchased. They also added in a teamwork element where you can work with your friends to reach goals such as redeeming a certain amount of dollars or redeeming a certain amount of rebates for monetary rewards. Observers are also expecting the mobile social computing platform to be pivotal in the emergence of new technologies due to its rich sensing capabilities. For instance, it can augment real-world experiences, allowing mobile devices to bridge the physical world and the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Facebook mobile social networking ==
The rise of the digital age has made social media a lasting trend, Facebook is still the leader of social networks, were initially as web-based and then extended towards access via mobile browsers and smartphone apps. Compared with Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest, Facebook continues to dominate the social media world. As of the fourth quarter of 2015, 823 million Facebook users accessed the social network exclusively through mobile device, exceed from 526 million users in the previous year. In 2016, there was Instagram started as mobile and later developed into web-based platforms as well. In 2016, there was practically 1.6 billion active users around the world.  Moreover, in the United States, a study named the usage of the most popular mobile social networking percentages showed that social media audiences spent a total of 230 billion minutes on Facebook in 2014, 80% higher than Instagram. Until January 2016, 52% of users in North America accessed social media through mobile when the global mobile social penetration rate was 27%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/topics/2478/mobile-social-networks/|title=Topic: Mobile social media|website=www.statista.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report in 2017 showed that around 1 billion users will visit Facebook via mobile devices and during this year, the US market plays a significant role with nearly 80% of Facebook users using mobile devices to access their accounts. Facebook mobile advertising revenue account for 10 billion dollars and occupy for 74% of revenue in total. It shows that by 2018, more than 75% of the Facebook users worldwide will access the service via their mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.business.com/articles/best-facebook-marketing-strategies/|title=Best Facebook Marketing Strategies - business.com|work=business.com|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety issues==
Safety issues (including [[Internet security|security]], privacy, and trust) in mobile social networks are concerned about the condition of being protected against different types of failure, damage, error, accidents, harm or any other non-desirable event, while mobile carriers contact each other in mobile environments. However, lack of a protective infrastructure in these networks has turned them in to convenient targets for various perils. This is the main impulse why MSNs carry disparate and intricate safety concerns and embrace divergent safety challenging problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Najaflou |first1=Yashar |last2=Jedari |first2=Behrouz |last3=Xia |first3=Feng |last4=T. Yang |first4=Laurence |last5=S. Obaidat |first5=Mohammad |title=Safety Challenges and Solutions in Mobile Social Networks |journal=IEEE Systems Journal |date=2015 |volume=9 |issue=3 |page=834 - 854 |doi=10.1109/JSYST.2013.2284696 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6642041/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been cases where a user was caused bodily harm through mobile social media. For example, Kurt Eichenwald was sent a tweet with a flashing animated image by another user who knew that Eichenwald had epilepsy, causing a seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/12/21/twitter-seizure/|title=Twitter Agrees to Hand Over User Data After Tweet Triggers Epileptic Seizure|website=Fortune|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these dangers, many mobile social networks such as Twitter and Facebook have implemented various methods for protecting user safety such as removing harmful users, detecting malware, and verifying a user's identity; however, these policies are still in the workings.

Other than online safety issues, the evolution of mobile devices has also introduced new offline, or physical, safety concerns. The distractions caused by mobile social networks have cause numerous accidents due to the user not paying attention to their surroundings. According to the [[National Safety Council]], nearly 330,000 injuries occur each year from accidents where the driver was texting while driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edgarsnyder.com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics.html|title=Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving|website=edgarsnyder.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety issues caused by distractions from mobile social network became more prominent after the release of [[Pokémon Go|Pokemon Go]] in July 2016. In Pokemon Go, users can catch pokemon while walking around outdoors on their phones. While this game has positive impacts such as getting players to exercise, increasing museum and theme park visitors, and helping single people find dates, it has also led to more accidents. In California, two men fell over 40 feet from an ocean bluff while playing Pokemon Go.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4407012/california-men-fall-bluff-pokemon-go/|title=California Men Fall Off Ocean Bluff While Playing Pokémon Go|website=Time|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Auburn, a driver went off the road and hit a tree because he was playing Pokemon Go while driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/07/14/pokmon-go-player-crashes-his-car-into-tree/87074762/|title=Pokémon Go player crashes his car into a tree|newspaper=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pittsburgh, a teenager crossed a highway to catch a pokemon and was hit by a car because she was distracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4405221/pokemon-go-teen-hit-by-car/|title=Pennsylvania Teenager Hit By Car While Playing Pokémon Go|website=Time|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another safety concern arose from mobile dating applications such as Tinder and Hinge, where single people are matched up with each other to go on dates. These environments make it much easier for criminals to commit crimes such as rape and murder because it is difficult for users to completely know the other person before agreeing to meet them face to face. In England and Wales, there were 204 reported crimes due to Tinder or Grindr in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/01/11/tinder-and-grindr-are-more-dangerous-than-ever-according-to-uk-report/|title=Tinder and Grindr are more dangerous than ever, according to UK report|last=Connolly|first=Amanda|date=2016-01-11|newspaper=The Next Web|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number rose to 412 in 2015. On November 23, 2016, [[Stephen Port]] was convicted for rape and murder of 4 men who he met on the Grindr. In April 2016, Ingrid Lyne was murdered and her accused murderer was a man she had met on a dating app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kiro7.com/news/local/new-details-in-murder-case-raise-questions-about-dating-app-dangers/489930421|title=New details in murder case raise questions about dating app dangers|last=Clancy|first=Amy|date=2017-02-03|newspaper=KIRO|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are many dangers to meeting people online, it has also successfully helped single people find love and marriage. Increasing the safety procedures regarding mobile dating applications is an ongoing work by the police force and by the developers of these mobile applications.

==In the United States==
[[File:Stat.png|thumb|250px|United States mobile social networking market]]
While Japan, Korea, and China have a higher usage rate of mobile social networks compared to other western countries, the United States is a prevalent user of mobile social networks. The US has a population of 303.82 million people and a mobile penetration of 72% with 219.73 million mobile subscribers in 2008. Informa forecasts the number of mobile subscribers to rise to 243.27 million by 2013.&lt;ref name="buongiorno_final"/&gt;

The mobile data market in the US is at a developed stage of growth where non-messaging data revenues account for 20% of US operators'  overall data revenues. In September 2012, the CTIA (Cellular Telephone Industries Association) announced that data service revenues rose 40% to US $14.8 billion. The CTIA announced that SMS usage had maintained its strong growth.&lt;ref name="buongiorno_final"/&gt;

Social networking once began in the online space, but it has rapidly spread to mobile platforms. Currently, consumption of mobile internet usage is being driven by mobile social networking. Data shows that the US has 220.14 million online internet users which is 72.5% of the population. Flat-rate data plans have been prevalent in the US for a number of years but the customer adoption of mobile internet was slow until 2008. However, the introduction of the iPhone has definitely increased the market for mobile internet. iPhones have transformed the mobile social network market, and today there is numerous mobile development for social network apps.&lt;ref name="buongiorno_final"/&gt;

The US mobile social networking market experienced steady growth in 2008 with 6.4 million mobile social network users. Since then, the number of mobile users has continued to grow and below is graph forecasting the growth until 2013.&lt;ref name="buongiorno_final"/&gt; According to Statista.com, the most popular social media networking app as of 2016 is Facebook at 123.55 million monthly users, surpassing the next most popular app, Facebook Messenger, which has 97.86 million monthly users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/248074/most-popular-us-social-networking-apps-ranked-by-audience/|title=Top U.S. mobile social apps by users 2016 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Motorola Timeport L7089.jpg|thumb|[[Motorola]] Timeport, the first tri-band mobile phone (1999)]]
In [[telecommunications]], a '''multi-band device''' (including '''dual-band''', '''tri-band''', '''quad-band''' and '''penta-band''' devices) is a communication device (especially a [[mobile phone]]) that supports multiple [[radio frequency]] bands. All devices which have more than one channel use multiple frequencies; a band however is a group of frequencies containing many channels. Multiple bands in mobile devices support [[roaming]] between different regions where different standards are used for mobile telephone services. Where the bands are widely separated in frequency, parallel transmit and receive signal path circuits must be provided, which increases the cost, complexity and power demand of multi-band devices.

The term '''quad-band''' describes a device that supports four frequency bands: 850 and 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz, mostly used in [[the Americas]] ([[ITU region]] 2), and the 900 and 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz bands used elsewhere.  Most [[GSM]]/[[UMTS]] phones support all four bands, while most [[CDMA2000]]/1xRTT phones (mostly North America and voice transmission only) do not, and so are considered only '''dual-band''' devices.  A few phones support both of the domestic frequencies but only one foreign one for limited [[roaming]], making them '''tri-band''' phones.

The term '''penta-band''' describes a device that supports a fifth frequency band, commonly the 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz band in much of the world.  The [[Advanced Wireless Services]] (AWS) 1700&amp;nbsp;MHz band also seeing increased usage.

==4G LTE bands==
In the [[United States]] only, the two largest carriers are instead implementing 4G LTE in the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band, which was reallocated from [[TV broadcasting]] during the [[digital television transition in the United States|DTV transition]].  [[TV station]]s were forced to move to lower [[UHF]] and even far worse [[VHF]] frequencies with poorer [[mobile TV]] and even regular [[terrestrial TV]] performance{{Citation needed|reason=UHF has no poorer reception that UHF with roof-top antennas. The DTV transition did not address mobile TV signals. Some TV stations, such as KGO-TV, broadcasting analog on VHF, elected to remain VHF after the transition, and broadcast UHF during the transition; the FCC offered such stations the choice between VHF and UHF.|date=October 2013}}, because the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band has better [[radio propagation]] characteristics that allow [[mobile phone signal]] to penetrate deeper into buildings with less [[attenuation]] than the 1700&amp;nbsp;MHz or 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz bands.

[[AT&amp;T Mobility]] devices use former [[TV channel]] 55 nationwide (purchased from [[Qualcomm]]'s defunct [[MediaFLO]] [[pay TV]] service), and also channel 56 in densely populated areas such as [[California]] and the [[Northeast Corridor]].  [[Verizon Wireless]] holds frequencies just above TV channel 51, which is still in use, causing [[adjacent-channel interference]] that is preventing the carrier from using them until the planned top-down [[spectrum repacking]] occurs.  It more recently acquired higher blocks within the former TV band, which it plans to use first.

'''Neophile''' or '''Neophiliac''', a term popularised by cult writer [[Robert Anton Wilson]],  is a personality type characterized by a strong affinity for [[novelty]]. The term was used earlier by [[Christopher Booker]] in his book [[The Neophiliacs]] (1969), and by [[J. D. Salinger]] in his short story [[Hapworth 16, 1924]] (1965).

==Characteristics==
Neophiles/Neophiliacs have the following basic characteristics:

* The ability to adapt rapidly to extreme change.
* A distaste or downright loathing of [[tradition]], repetition, and routine.
* A tendency to become bored quickly with old things.
* A desire, bordering on obsession in some cases, to experience novelty.
* A corresponding and related desire to create novelty by creating or achieving something and/or by stirring social or other forms of unrest.
* A complete objection to or distrust of commitment.

A neophile is distinct from a [[revolutionary]] in that anyone might become a revolutionary if pushed far enough by the reigning authorities or social norms, whereas neophiles are revolutionaries by nature. Their intellectual abhorrence of tradition and repetition usually bemoans a deeper emotional need for constant novelty and change. The meaning of neophile approaches and is not mutually exclusive to the term [[visionary]], but differs in that a neophile actively seeks first-hand experience of novelty rather than merely pontificating about it.

The opposite of a neophile is a [[neophobia|neophobe]]; a person with an aversion to novelty and change. Wilson observes that neophobes tend to regard neophiles, especially extreme ones, with fear and contempt, and to brand them with titles such as "[[witch]]," "[[satanist]]," "[[heresy|heretic]]," etc. He also speculates in his [[Prometheus Rising]] series of books that the [[industrial revolution]] and related [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] represents one of the first periods of history in which neophiles were a dominant force in society. Neophiles accelerate change because they like it that way.

==Types==
Open-source advocate and programmer [[Eric S. Raymond]] observes that this personality is especially prevalent in certain fields of expertise; in business, these are primarily [[computer science]] and other areas of high technology. Raymond speculates that the rapid progress of these fields (especially computers) is a result of this. A neophile's love of novelty is likely to lead them into subjects outside of the normal areas of human interest. Raymond observes a high concentration of neophiles in or around what he calls "leading edge subcultures" such as science fiction fandom, [[neo-paganism]], [[transhumanism]], etc. as well as in or around nontraditional areas of thought such as fringe philosophy or the [[occult]]. Raymond observes that most neophiles have roving interests and tend to be widely well-read.

There is more than one type of neophile. There are social neophiles (the extreme social butterfly), intellectual neophiles (the revolutionary [[philosopher]] and the [[technophile]]), and physical/kinetic neophiles (the [[extreme sports]] enthusiast). These tendencies are not mutually exclusive, and might exist simultaneously in the same individual.

The word "neophilia" has particular significance in Internet and [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] culture. ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'' gave the following definition to neophilia:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The trait of being excited and pleased by novelty. Common among most hackers, [[Science fiction|SF]] fans, and members of several other connected leading-edge subcultures, including the pro-technology '[[Whole Earth Review|Whole Earth]]' wing of the [[ecology movement]], [[space activist]]s, many members of [[Mensa International|Mensa]], and the [[Discordianism|Discordian]]/[[neo-pagan]] underground (see [[geek]]). All these groups overlap heavily and (where evidence is available) seem to share characteristic hacker tropisms for science fiction, [[music]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Research has uncovered a possible link between certain predisposition to some kind of neophilia and increased levels of the enzyme [[monoamine oxidase]] A.&lt;ref name="pmid16538181"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shiraishi H, Suzuki A, Fukasawa T, Aoshima T, Ujiie Y, Ishii G, Otani K | title = Monoamine oxidase A gene promoter polymorphism affects novelty seeking and reward dependence in healthy study participants | journal = Psychiatr.

No Problem!|date=2010-10-05|newspaper=Popular Mechanics|language=en|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of alternatives to expendable rockets have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;George Dvorsky, [http://io9.com/how-humanity-will-conquer-space-without-rockets-1676441431 How Humanity Will Conquer Space Without Rockets], io9 Dec. 30, 2014 (accessed Jan 3 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;  In some systems such as a combination launch system, [[skyhook (structure)|skyhook]], [[rocket sled launch]], [[rockoon]], or [[air launch to orbit|air launch]], a rocket would be part, but only part of the system used to reach orbit.

Present-day launch costs are very high – $2,500 to $25,000 per kilogram from [[Earth]] to [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO).  As a result, launch costs are a large percentage of the cost of all space endeavors.  If launch can be made cheaper the total cost of space missions will be reduced.  
Due to the exponential nature of the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation|rocket equation]], providing even a small amount of the velocity to LEO by other means has the potential of greatly reducing the cost of getting to orbit.

Launch costs in the hundreds of dollars per kilogram would make possible many proposed large-scale space projects such as [[space colonization]], [[space-based solar power]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/1997-Mankins-FreshLookAtSpaceSolarPower.pdf A Fresh Look at Space Solar Power: New Architectures, Concepts, and Technologies.

==Static structures==
In this usage, the term "static" is intended to convey the understanding that the structural portion of the system has no internal moving parts.

===Space tower===
A space tower is a tower that would reach [[outer space]]. To avoid an immediate need for a vehicle launched at orbital velocity to raise its [[perigee]], a tower would have to extend above the edge of space (above the 100&amp;nbsp;km [[Kármán line]]),&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Gatland. ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Space Technology''.&lt;/ref&gt; but a far lower tower height could reduce atmospheric drag losses during ascent.  If the tower went all the way to [[geosynchronous orbit]] at approximately 36,000&amp;nbsp;km, or 22,369 miles, objects released at such height could then drift away with minimal power and would be in a circular orbit. The concept of a structure reaching to geosynchronous orbit was first conceived by [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The original concept envisioned by Tsiolkovsky was a compression structure.  
Building a compression structure from the ground up proved an unrealistic task as there was no material in existence with enough compressive strength to support its own weight under such conditions.&lt;ref name="JBIS1999"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
Other ideas use very tall compressive towers to reduce the demands on launch vehicles.  The vehicle is "elevated" up the tower, which may extend above the [[atmosphere]] and is launched from the top.  Such a tall tower to access near-space altitudes of {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} has been proposed by various researchers.&lt;ref name="landis1996"&gt;Landis, Geoffrey, "Compression Structures for Earth Launch," 7th Advanced Space Propulsion Workshop, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, April 9–11, 1996; also [http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1998-3737 paper AIAA-98-3737], 24th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hjelmstad, Keith, [http://hieroglyph.asu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hjelmstad-on-Stephenson-Structural-Design-of-the-Tall-Tower.pdf "Structural Design of the Tall Tower"], ''Hieroglyph'', 11/30/2013. (retrieved 1 Sept 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The height is limited by materials,&lt;ref&gt;In his book "Structures or why things don't fall down" (pub {{clarify|date=September 2012}} Pelican 1978 – 1984 {{clarify|date=September 2012}}), [[J.E. Gordon|professor&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Gordon]] considers the height of the Tower of Babel. He wrote: ''brick and stone'' weigh about 120&amp;nbsp;LB/ft^3, or 2,000&amp;nbsp;kg/m^3, and the crushing strength of these materials is approximately 6000 PSI, or 40M N/m^2. Elementary arithmetic shows that a tower with parallel walls could have been built to a height of 7000 feet, or 2&amp;nbsp;kilometers, before the bricks at the bottom were crushed. However by making the walls taper towards the top they could well have been built to a height where the men of Shinnar would run short of oxygen before the brick walls crushed beneath their own dead weight." {{clarify|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with higher structures possible if the structure tapers (i.e. the upper parts are narrower than the bottom), but with current construction techniques, cost increases exponentially with construction height. [[Buckling]] may be a failure mode before exceeding a material's nominal [[compressive strength|compressive yield strength]] (though designs such as with a [[truss]] may help compensate), but, aside from that and aside from design against weather, the theoretical scale height of a structure is the allowable load of its material divided by the product of density and local gravitational acceleration, where needed material cross-section increases by a factor of [[Euler's number|''e'']]&amp;nbsp;(2.718...) over each scale height.&lt;ref name=structuralmethods&gt;[[Wikibooks : Space Transport and Engineering Methods/Structural Methods|Structural Methods]]. Retrieved May&amp;nbsp;26,&amp;nbsp;2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

For common plain carbon steel under a typical allowable stress limit, its scale height is [[Approximation#Mathematics|≈]] 1.635 kilometer.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} A 4.9-kilometer-high tower&amp;nbsp;(3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;its&amp;nbsp;scale&amp;nbsp;height) of such would accordingly mass at least 20 times the weight supported at its top (as [[Euler's number|''e'']]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[Approximation#Mathematics|≈]] 20). In contrast, an example of a more expensive high-performance aerospace material, Amoco T300/ERL1906 carbon composite, has a scale height of 54 kilometers at a [[safety factor]]&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;2, though construction challenges, including wind loading, would apply. Earth's atmosphere has approximately 50% of its mass under&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;kilometers&amp;nbsp;elevation, 90% below 16&amp;nbsp;kilometers, and 99% below 30&amp;nbsp;kilometers of altitude.&lt;ref name=structuralmethods/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdas.com/m1.html|title=Atmosphere Table|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural [[mountains]] reach up to 9&amp;nbsp;km altitude. As of 2018, the [[List of tallest structures in the world|tallest man-made structure]] is the [[Burj Khalifa]], which is 829.8 m tall. A tower or other high-altitude facility could form one component of a launch system, such as being the base station of a space elevator, or a support pillar for the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] part of a mass driver or the "[[gun barrel]]" of a space gun.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Tensile structures==
{{Main article|Tether propulsion}}
Tensile structures for non-rocket spacelaunch are proposals to use long, very strong cables (known as [[Tether propulsion|tethers]]) to lift a payload into space. Tethers can also be used for changing orbit once in space.

Orbital tethers can be tidally locked ([[Skyhook (structure)|skyhook]]) or rotating (rotovators).  They can be designed (in theory) to pick up the payload when the payload is stationary or when the payload is hypersonic (has a high but not orbital velocity).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Endo-atmospheric tethers can be used to transfer kinetics (energy and momentum) between large conventional aircraft (subsonic or low supersonic) or other motive force and smaller aerodynamic vehicles, propelling them to hypersonic velocities without exotic propulsion systems.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Skyhook===

===Space elevator===
{{Main article|Space elevator}}
[[File:Space elevator structural diagram--corrected for scale+CM+etc.svg|right|thumb|224px|alt=Diagram of a space elevator.  At the bottom of the tall diagram is the Earth as viewed from high above the North Pole.  About six Earth-radii above the Earth an arc is drawn with the same center as the Earth.  The arc depicts the level of geosynchronous orbit.  About twice as high as the arc and directly above the Earth's center, a counterweight is depicted by a small square.  A line depicting the space elevator's cable connects the counterweight to the equator directly below it.  The system's center of mass is described as above the level of geosynchronous orbit.  The center of mass is shown roughly to be about a quarter of the way up from the geosynchronous arc to the counterweight.  The bottom of the cable is indicated to be anchored at the equator.  A climber is depicted by a small rounded square.  The climber is shown climbing the cable about one third of the way from the ground to the arc. Another note indicates that the cable rotates along with the Earth's daily rotation, and remains vertical. |A space elevator would consist of a cable anchored to the [[Earth]]'s surface, reaching into [[outer space|space]].]]

A space elevator is a proposed type of space transportation system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.isec.org/index.php/what-is-a-space-elevator What is a Space Elevator?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Its main component is a ribbon-like cable (also called a [[space tether|tether]]) anchored to the surface and extending into space above the level of geosynchronous orbit. As the planet rotates, the centrifugal force at the upper end of the tether counteracts gravity, and keeps the cable taut. Vehicles can then climb the tether and reach orbit without the use of rocket propulsion.

Such a cable could be made out of any material able to support itself under tension by tapering the cable's diameter sufficiently quickly as it approached the Earth's surface.  On [[Earth]], with its relatively strong gravity, current materials are not sufficiently [[specific strength|strong and light]].  With conventional materials, the taper ratio would need to be very large, increasing the total launch mass to a fiscally infeasible degree.  However, [[carbon nanotube]] or [[Boron nitride#Boron nitride nanotubes|boron nitride nanotube]] based materials have been proposed as the tensile element in the tether design.  Their measured strengths are high compared to their linear densities.  They hold promise as materials to make an Earth-based space elevator possible.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, Bradley Carl. [http://www.niac.usra.edu/studies/521Edwards.html The NIAC Space Elevator Program]. NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts&lt;/ref&gt;

Landis and Cafarelli suggested that a tension structure ("space elevator") extending downward from geosynchronous orbit could be combined with the compression structure ("Tsiolkovski tower") extending upward from the surface, forming the combined structure reaching geosynchronous orbit from the surface, and having structural advantages over either one individually.&lt;ref name="JBIS1999" /&gt;

The space elevator concept is also applicable to other planets and [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]]. For locations in the Solar System with weaker gravity than Earth's (such as the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]]), the strength-to-density requirements aren't as great for tether materials.  Currently available materials (such as [[Kevlar]]) could serve as the tether material for elevators there.

===Endo-atmospheric tethers===
[[File:Kite Launcher at Max Vtip.png|left|thumb|112px|KITE Launcher&amp;nbsp;— transferring momentum to the vehicle.]]
An endo-atmospheric tether uses the long cable within the atmosphere to provide some or all of the velocity needed to reach orbit. The tether is used to transfer kinetics (energy and momentum) from a massive, slow end (typically a large subsonic or low supersonic aircraft) to a hypersonic end through aerodynamics or centripetal action. The ''Kinetics Interchange TEther (KITE) Launcher'' is one proposed endo-atmospheric tether.&lt;ref name="Johansen" /&gt;

==Dynamic structures==

===Space fountain===
{{Main article|Space fountain}}
[[File:Space fountain.svg|thumb|176px|Hyde design space fountain.]]
A space fountain is a proposed form of [[space elevator]] that does not require the structure to be in [[geosynchronous orbit]], and does not rely on [[tensile strength]] for support. In contrast to the original space elevator design (a [[tether]]ed [[satellite]]), a space fountain is a tremendously tall [[tower]] extending up from the [[Earth|ground]]. Since such a tall tower could not support its own [[weight]] using traditional materials, massive [[Pelletizing|pellets]] are projected upward from the bottom of the tower and redirected back down once they reach the top, so that the [[force]] of redirection holds the top of the tower aloft.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Orbital ring===
{{Main article|Orbital ring}}
[[File:OrbitalRing.svg|288px|thumb|Orbital ring.]]
An orbital ring is a concept for a space elevator that consists of a ring in [[low Earth orbit|low&amp;nbsp;Earth orbit]] that rotates at slightly above orbital speed, and has fixed tethers hanging down to the ground.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The first design{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} of an orbital ring offered by A. Yunitsky in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;A. Yunitskii, “General Planetary Transport System”,&amp;nbsp;“TM”&amp;nbsp;{{clarify|date=September 2012}} (Technology for Young),&amp;nbsp;no.&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;1982 (in Russian). [http://www.ipu.ru/stran/bod/ing/sovet2.htm www.ipu.ru/stran/bod/ing/sovet2.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050416022703/http://www.ipu.ru/stran/bod/ing/sovet2.htm |date=2005-04-16 }}; pictures: [http://www.ipu.ru/stran/bod/ing/soviet_ris.htm www.ipu.ru/stran/bod/ing/soviet_ris.htm]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1982 [[Paul Birch (writer)|Paul Birch]] JBIS design&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulbirch.net/ "Orbital Ring Systems and Jacob's Ladders – I-III"]&lt;/ref&gt; of an orbital ring system, a rotating cable is placed in a low Earth orbit, rotating at slightly faster than orbital speed. Not in orbit, but riding on this ring, supported electromagnetically on superconducting magnets, are ring stations that stay in one place above some designated point on Earth. Hanging down from these ring stations are short space elevators made from cables with high tensile-strength-to-mass ratio.  Birch claimed that the ring stations, in addition to holding the tether, could accelerate the orbital ring eastwards, causing it to [[precession|precess]] around Earth. If it were possible to make the precession rate large enough – once per day, the rate of rotation of the Earth – the ring would be "geostationary" without having to be at the normal geostationary altitude or even in the equatorial plane.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Launch loop===
{{Main article|Launch loop}}
[[File:LaunchLoop.svg|right|thumb|320px|Launch loop.]]
A launch loop or [[Lofstrom loop]] is a design for a [[belt (mechanical)|belt]]-based [[Maglev (transport)|maglev]] [[orbital launch]] system that would be around 2000&amp;nbsp;km long and maintained at an altitude of up to 80&amp;nbsp;km (50&amp;nbsp;mi). [[Spacecraft|Vehicles]] weighing 5 metric tons would be [[Maglev (transport)|electromagnetically accelerated]] on top of the cable which forms an acceleration track, from which they would be projected into Earth [[orbit]] or even beyond. The structure would constantly need around 200 MW of power to keep it in place.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== Pneumatic freestanding tower ===
One proposed design is a freestanding tower composed of high strength material (e.g. [[kevlar]]) tubular columns inflated with a low density gas mix, and with dynamic stabilization systems including [[gyroscopes]] and "pressure balancing".&lt;ref name='hdl.handle.net/10315/2587'&gt; {{cite journal

The design presented is "at 5 km altitude and extending to 20&amp;nbsp;km above sea level", and the authors suggest that "the approach may be further scaled to provide direct access to altitudes above 200&amp;nbsp;km".

A major difficulty of such a tower is buckling since it is a long slender construction.

==Projectile launchers==
With any of these projectile launchers, the launcher gives a high velocity at, or near, ground level.  In order to achieve orbit, the projectile must be given enough extra velocity to punch through the atmosphere, unless it includes an additional propulsion system (such as a rocket). Also, the projectile needs either an internal or external means to perform [[orbital insertion]].  The designs below fall into three categories, electrically driven, chemically driven, and mechanically driven.

===Electromagnetic acceleration===
Electrical launch systems include mass drivers, [[railgun]]s, and [[coilgun]]s. All of these systems use the concept of a stationary launch track which uses some form of linear electrical motor to accelerate a projectile.

====Mass driver====
{{Main article|Mass driver}}
[[File:Lunar base concept drawing s78 23252.jpg|thumb|right|288px|A mass driver for lunar launch (artist's conception).]]
[[File:Railgun-1.svg|thumb|right|224px|Electro-dynamic interactions in a railgun.]]
A mass driver is basically a very long and mainly horizontally aligned [[launch track]] or tunnel for space launch, curved upwards at the end. The concept was proposed by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] in 1950,&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Arthur C., "Electromagnetic Launching as a Major Contribution to Space-Flight,"  ''J. British Interplanetary Soc., 9'',  No. 6 (1950), pp. 261–267. Reprinted in Arthur C. Clarke, ''Ascent to Orbit: A Scientific Autobiography'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and was developed in more detail by [[Gerard K. O'Neill]], working with the [[Space Studies Institute]], focusing on the use of a mass driver for launching material from the Moon.

A mass driver uses some sort of repulsion to keep a [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] separated from the track or walls. Then it uses a [[linear motor]] (an alternating-current motor such as in a coil gun, or a [[homopolar motor]] as in a railgun) to accelerate the payload to high speeds. After leaving the launch track, the payload would be at its launch velocity.

====StarTram====
{{Main article|StarTram}}
StarTram is a proposal to launch vehicles directly to space by accelerating them with a mass driver. Vehicles would float by [[maglev]] repulsion between superconductive magnets on the vehicle and the aluminum tunnel walls while they were accelerated by AC magnetic drive from aluminum coils. The power required would probably be provided by superconductive energy storage units distributed along the tunnel. Vehicles could coast up to low or even geosynchronous orbital height; then a small rocket motor burn would be required to circularize the orbit.

Cargo-only Generation 1 systems would accelerate at 10–20 Gs and exit from a mountain top. While not suitable for passengers, they could put cargo into orbit for $40 per kilogram, 100 times cheaper than rockets.

Passenger-capable Generation 2 systems would accelerate for a much longer distance at 2 Gs. The vehicles would enter the atmosphere at an altitude of 20&amp;nbsp;km from an evacuated tunnel restrained by Kevlar tethers and supported by magnetic repulsion between superconducting cables in the tunnel and on the ground.  For both Gen 1–2 systems, the mouth of the tube would be open during vehicle acceleration, with air kept out by [[magnetohydrodynamic]] pumping.&lt;ref name="Startram"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StarTramBook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powell|first1=James|last2=Maise|first2=George|last3=Pellegrino|first3=Charles|title=StarTram: The New Race to Space|date=October 23, 2013|publisher=Shoebox Publishing|isbn=1493577573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.startram.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical===

====Space gun====
{{Main article|Space gun}}
[[File:Project Harp.jpg|thumb|right|208px|[[Project HARP]], a prototype of a space gun.]]
A space gun is a proposed method of launching an object into [[outer space]] using a large [[gun]], or [[cannon]].  Science fiction writer [[Jules Verne]] proposed such a launch method in ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'', and in 1902 a movie, ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'', was adapted.

However, even with a "[[gun barrel]]" through both the [[Earth's crust]] and [[troposphere]], the [[g-forces]] required to generate [[escape velocity]] would still be more than what a human tolerates. Therefore, the space gun would be restricted to [[freight]] and ruggedized satellites. Also, the projectile needs either an internal or external means to stabilize on orbit.

Gun launch concepts do not always use combustion.  In pneumatic launch systems, a projectile is accelerated in a long tube by air pressure, produced by ground-based turbines or other means.  In a [[light-gas gun]], the pressurant is a gas of light molecular weight, to maximize the speed of sound in the gas.

In the 1990s, [[John Hunter (scientist)|John Hunter]] of [[Quicklaunch]] proposed use of a 'Hydrogen Gun' to launch unmanned payloads to orbit for less than the regular launch costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quicklaunchinc.com/ Quicklaunch website] (Dead link- see archirved version at internet archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20120724005949/http://quicklaunchinc.com/)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ram accelerator====
{{Main article|Ram accelerator}}
A ram accelerator also uses chemical energy like the ''space gun'' but it is entirely different in that it relies on a jet-engine-like propulsion cycle utilizing [[ramjet]] and/or [[scramjet]] combustion processes to accelerate the [[projectile]] to extremely high speeds.

It is a long tube filled with a mixture of combustible gases with a frangible diaphragm at either end to contain the gases. The projectile, which is shaped like a ram jet core, is fired by another means (e.g., a space gun, discussed above) supersonically through the first diaphragm into the end of the tube.  It then burns the gases as fuel, accelerating down the tube under jet propulsion. Other physics come into play at higher velocities.

====Blast wave accelerator====
A blast wave accelerator is similar to a ''space gun'' but it differs in that rings of explosive along the length of the barrel are detonated in sequence to keep the accelerations high. Also, rather than just relying on the pressure behind the projectile, the blast wave accelerator specifically times the explosions to squeeze on a tail cone on the projectile, as one might shoot a pumpkin seed by squeezing the tapered end.

===Mechanical===

====Slingatron====
In a slingatron,&lt;ref name="Tidman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sling"&gt;Book, "Slingatron – A Mechanical Hypervelocity Mass Accelerator"; Derek A. Tidman; {{ISBN|978-1-4276-2658-5}}; Aardvark Global Publishing&amp;nbsp;LLC (November 1, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[projectile]]s are accelerated along a rigid tube or track that typically has circular or spiral turns, or combinations of these geometries in two or three dimensions. A projectile is accelerated in the curved tube by propelling the entire tube in a small-amplitude circular motion of constant or increasing frequency without changing the orientation of the tube, i.e. the entire tube gyrates but does not spin. An everyday example of this motion is stirring a beverage by holding the container and moving it in small horizontal circles, causing the contents to spin, without spinning the container itself.

This gyration continually displaces the tube with a component along the direction of the centripetal force acting on the projectile, so that work is continually done on the projectile as it advances through the machine. The centripetal force experienced by the projectile is the accelerating force, and is proportional to the projectile mass.

===Air launch===
{{main article|Air launch}}
In air launch, a carrier aircraft carries the space vehicle to high altitude and speed before release.  This technique was used on the suborbital X-15 and [[SpaceshipOne]] vehicles, and for the [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus]] orbital launch vehicle.

The main disadvantages are that the carrier aircraft tends to be quite large, and separation within the airflow at supersonic speeds has never been demonstrated, thus the boost given is relatively modest.

===Spaceplanes===
{{Main article|Spaceplane}}
[[File:X43a2 nasa scramjet.jpg|right|thumb|208px|[[X-43A]] with scramjet attached to the underside.]]
A spaceplane is an [[aircraft]] designed to pass the [[edge of space]]. It combines some features of an aircraft with some of a [[spacecraft]]. Typically, it takes the form of a spacecraft equipped with [[wing|aerodynamic surfaces]], one or more rocket engines, and sometimes additional [[jet engine|airbreathing propulsion]] as well.

Early spaceplanes were used to explore hypersonic flight (e.g. [[X-15]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Käsmann|first=Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;W.|title=Weltrekord-Flugzeuge [World Speed Record Aircraft]&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;Die schnellsten Jets der Welt|date=1999|publisher=Kolpingring, Germany: Aviatic Verlag|isbn=3-925505-26-1|page=105|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some air-breathing engine-based designs (cf [[X-30]]) such as aircraft based on [[scramjet]]s or [[pulse detonation engine]]s could potentially achieve orbital velocity or go some useful way to doing so; however, these designs still must perform a final rocket burn at their apogee to circularize their trajectory to avoid returning to the atmosphere.  Other, reusable turbojet-like designs like [[Skylon (spacecraft)|Skylon]] which uses [[precooled jet engine]]s up to Mach&amp;nbsp;5.5 before employing rockets to enter orbit appears to have a mass budget that permits a larger payload than pure rockets while achieving it in a single stage.

==Balloon==
[[Balloons]] can raise the initial altitude of rockets. However, balloons have relatively low payload (although see the [[SkyCat|Sky Cat]] project for an example of a heavy-lift balloon intended for use in the lower atmosphere), and this decreases even more with increasing altitude.

The lifting gas could be [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]].  Helium is not only expensive in large quantities but is also a [[Non-renewable resource|nonrenewable resource]]. This makes balloons an expensive launch assist technique. Hydrogen could be used as it has the advantage of being cheaper and lighter than helium, but the disadvantage of also being highly flammable. Rockets launched from balloons, known as " [[rockoon]]s", have been demonstrated but to date, only for suborbital ("sounding rocket") missions.  The size of balloon that would be required to lift an orbital launch vehicle would be extremely large.

One prototype of a balloon launch platform has been made by [[JP Aerospace]] as "Project Tandem",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpaerospace.com/Tandem/tandem.html |title= Tandem Flies to 95,085 feet! }} (accessed 4 January 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; although it has not been used as a rocket launch vehicle.  JP Aerospace further proposes a hypersonic, lighter than air upper stage.  A Spanish company, [[zero2infinity]], is officially developing a launcher system called [[bloostar]] based on the [[rockoon]] concept, expected to be operational by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reyes|first1=Tim|title=Balloon launcher Zero2Infinity Sets Its Sights to the Stars|journal=Universe Today|date=October 17, 2014|url=http://www.universetoday.com/115391/balloon-launcher-zero2infinity-sets-its-sights-to-the-stars/|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerard K. O'Neill]] proposed that by using very large balloons it may be possible to construct a space port in the [[stratosphere]]. Rockets could launch from it or a mass driver could accelerate payloads into the orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerard K. O'Neill|date = 1981|title=2081 : a hopeful view of the human future}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the advantage that most (about 90%) of the atmosphere is below the space port.

[[File:Lateral aerial view of a SpaceShaf.png|270px|thumb|Artist depiction of an aerial view of a SpaceShaft.]]

A SpaceShaft is a proposed version of an atmospherically buoyant structure that would serve as a system to lift cargo to [[Near space|near-space]] [[altitude]]s, with platforms distributed at several [[elevation]]s that would provide [[Habitation Module|habitation facilities]] for long term human operations throughout the mid-[[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] and near-space altitudes.&lt;ref name="k"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksjtracker.mit.edu/2009/07/01/space-shaft-or-the-story-that-would-have-been-a-bit-finer-if-only-one-had-known/|title=Space Shaft: Or, the story that would have been a bit finer, if only one had known...|publisher=Knight Science Journalism, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=April 21, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813220906/http://ksjtracker.mit.edu/2009/07/01/space-shaft-or-the-story-that-would-have-been-a-bit-finer-if-only-one-had-known/|archivedate=August 13, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurospaceward.org/PDF/Sat_5Dec09_Final_V2.pdf|title=3rd International Conference on Space Elevator, CNT Tether Design, and Lunar Industrialization Challenges|location=Luxembourg|date=December 5–6, 2009|publisher=EuroSpaceWard|accessdate=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For space launch, it would serve as a non-rocket first stage for rockets launched from the top.&lt;ref name="ss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceshaft.org/iframes/content/02_technologies/0202_SpaceShaft/iFSpaceShaft1.html|title=The SpaceShaft|publisher=www.spaceshaft.org|accessdate=April 21, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827165138/http://spaceshaft.org/iframes/content/02_technologies/0202_SpaceShaft/iFSpaceShaft1.html|archivedate=August 27, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hybrid launch systems==
[[File:480914main ELHVrailartistconcept.jpg|thumb|320px|[[NASA]] art for a concept combining three technologies: electromagnetic [[rocket sled launch|launch assist]] from a hypothetical {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} track at [[Kennedy Space Center]], a [[scramjet]] aircraft, and a carried rocket for use after [[air launch]] reaches orbit.]]

Separate technologies may be combined. In 2010, [[NASA]] suggested that a future scramjet aircraft might be accelerated to 300&amp;nbsp;m/s (a solution to the problem of [[ramjet|ramjet engines]] not being startable at zero airflow velocity) by electromagnetic or other [[rocket sled launch|sled launch]] assist, in turn air-launching a second-stage rocket delivering a satellite to orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/horizontallaunch.html|title=Emerging Technologies May Fuel Revolutionary Launcher|accessdate=2011-05-24|author=NASA |author-link=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All forms of projectile launchers are at least partially hybrid systems if launching to [[low Earth orbit]], due to the requirement for [[Space gun#Getting to orbit|orbit circularization]], at a minimum entailing several percent of total [[delta-v]] to raise [[perigee]] (e.g. a tiny rocket burn), or in some concepts much more from a rocket thruster to ease ground accelerator development.&lt;ref name="Startram"/&gt;

Some technologies can have exponential scaling if used in isolation, making the effect of combinations be of counter-intuitive magnitude. For instance, 270&amp;nbsp;m/s is under 4% of the velocity of [[low Earth orbit]], but a NASA study estimated that Maglifter [[rocket sled launch|sled launch]] at that velocity could increase the payload of a conventional [[Expendable launch system|ELV]] [[rocket]] by 80% when also having the track go up a 3000‑meter mountain.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=24756.0;attach=288934|title=The Maglifter: An Advanced Concept Using Electromagnetic Propulsion in Reducing the Cost of Space Launch|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of ground launch limited to a given maximum acceleration (such as due to human [[g-force]] tolerances if intended to carry passengers) have the corresponding minimum launcher length scale not linearly but with velocity squared.&lt;ref name = physics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mot.html#mot1|title=Constant Acceleration|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tethers can have even more non-linear, exponential scaling. The tether-to-payload [[Space tether#Mass ratio|mass ratio]] of a [[space tether]] would be around [[Space tether#Mass ratio|1:1 at a tip velocity 60% of its characteristic velocity]] but becomes [[Space tether#Mass ratio|more than 1000:1 at a tip velocity 240% of its characteristic velocity]]. For instance, for anticipated practicality and a moderate mass ratio with current materials, the HASTOL concept would have the first half (4&amp;nbsp;km/s) of velocity to orbit be provided by other means than the tether itself.&lt;ref name=DesSim/&gt;

A proposal to use a hybrid system combining a mass driver for initial lofting followed by additive thrust by a series of ground-based lasers sequenced according to wavelength was proposed by Mashall Savage in the book ''[[The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps|The Millennial Project]]'' as one of the core theses of the book, but the idea has not been pursued to any notable degree. Savage's specific proposals proved to be infeasible on both engineering and political grounds, and while the difficulties could be overcome, the group Savage founded, now called the [[Living Universe Foundation]], has been unable to raise significant funds for research.

Combining multiple technologies would in itself be an increase to complexity and development challenges, but reducing the performance requirements of a given subsystem may allow reduction in its individual complexity or cost. For instance, the number of parts in a liquid-fueled rocket engine may be [[Rocket#Costs and economics|two orders of magnitude less if pressure-fed rather than pump-fed]] if its [[delta-v]] requirements are limited enough to make the weight penalty of such be a practical option, or a high-velocity ground launcher may be able to use a relatively moderate performance and inexpensive [[Solid-fuel rocket|solid fuel]] or [[Hybrid rocket|hybrid]] small motor on its projectile.&lt;ref name = CheapRockets&gt;[[:File:LEOonthecheap.pdf|U.S. Air Force Research Report&amp;nbsp;no.&amp;nbsp;AU&amp;nbsp;ARI&amp;nbsp;93-8: LEO On The Cheap]]. Retrieved April&amp;nbsp;29,&amp;nbsp;2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reusable launch system#Launch assistance|Assist]] by non-rocket methods may compensate against the [[Reusable launch system#Weight penalty|weight penalty]] of making an orbital [[Reusable launch system|rocket reusable]]. Though [[suborbital]], the first private manned spaceship, [[SpaceShipOne]] had reduced rocket performance requirements due to being a combined system with its [[air launch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/spaipone.htm|title=SpaceShipOne|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautix|accessdate=May 25, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123091739/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/spaipone.htm|archivedate=January 23, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Efficiency - A more effective way to gather information from a candidate than the conventional process;
* Relational - Analysis of a candidate relationship and behavior through social network posts.

The cybervetting is so contradictory that most of the participants didn’t acknowledge its usage regardless the familiarity they have with this theme. Only a few number of participants talked openly about having cybervetting current candidates.

==Legal position==
Legal experts have warned human resources departments about vetting prospective employees online, due to the possibility of discrimination and the unreliability of this information.&lt;ref name=dilemma&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/2008/06/24/46448/vetting-through-social-networking-sites-weekly-dilemma.html|title=Vetting through social networking sites: weekly dilemma|last=Wort|first=Jo|date=24 June 2008|work=Personnel Today|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of the UK Children's Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety argued that it was "possibly illegal, but certainly unethical". While the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] advised that just looking at information on someone's social networking profiles would not be illegal, an employment law specialist noted that under the [[Data Protection Act 1998]], processing and storing the information or using it to make discriminatory decisions could be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3355337/Facebook-vetting-could-be-illegal.html|title=Facebook vetting 'could be illegal'|last=Farmer|first=Ben|date=27 November 2007|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Age discrimination]] might result from such a practice, due to the age profile of users of social networking sites.&lt;ref name=dilemma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Business/Workplace-Twittering.htm|title=Workplace Twittering|date=16 June 2009|work=Cambridge News|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failed candidates may be able to use discrimination legislation to ask about vetting operations and even ask for IT records to check access to social networks.&lt;ref name=friend/&gt; In the US, vetting using social networking sites risks breaching the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (FCRA), which requires employers to gain the consent of applicants before doing a [[background check]], state laws that limit the consideration of off-duty conduct in making employment decisions, and any searches risk breaching prohibitions against commercial use contained in the [[terms of service]] of the social networking sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shrm.org/Publications/hrmagazine/editorialcontent/pages/1007sr-zeidner.aspx|title=How Deep Can You Probe?|last=Zeidner|first=Rita|date=1 October 2007|work=HR Magazine|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a trainee teacher at a high school in Pennsylvania was denied her teaching degree after her supervisor found a picture she posted on MySpace captioned "Drunken pirate" and deemed it "unprofessional". She sued, arguing that by acting on the basis of her legal out-of-hours behavior [[Millersville University of Pennsylvania#Controversies|Millersville University]] had breached her [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights, but a federal district court ruled that the photograph was not "protected speech" under the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25privacy-t2.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1|title=The Web Means the End of Forgetting|last=Rosen|first=Jeffrey|date=19 July 2010|work=New York Times|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open-source appropriate technology''' ('''OSAT''') is [[appropriate technology]] developed through the principles of the [[open-design movement]]. OSAT refers to, on the one hand, technology designed with special consideration to the environmental, ethical, cultural, social, political, and economic aspects of the community it is intended for. On the other hand, OSAT is developed in the open and licensed in such a way as to allow their designs to be used, modified and distributed freely.&lt;ref name="Pearce" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, J. M. (2014). Free and open source appropriate technology. in ''The Routledge Companion to Alternative Organization'', 308. {{ISBN|9780415782265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Open source is a development method for [[appropriate technology]] that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process. [[appropedia:|Appropedia]] is an example of open-source appropriate technology. There anyone can both learn how to make and use AT free of concerns about patents. At the same time anyone can also add to the collective open-source knowledge base by contributing ideas, observations, experimental data, deployment logs, etc. It has been claimed that the potential for open-source-appropriate technology to drive [[applied sustainability]] is enormous.&lt;ref name="buitenhuis" /&gt; The built in continuous [[peer-review]] can result in better quality, higher reliability, and more flexibility than conventional design/patenting of technologies. The free nature of the knowledge also obviously provides lower costs, particularly for those technologies that do not benefit to a large degree from scale of manufacture. Finally, OSAT also enables the end to predatory intellectual property lock-in. This is particularly important in the context of technology focused on relieving suffering and saving lives in the [[developing world]].

The "open-source" model can act as a driver of [[sustainable development]]. Reasons include:

* It enables localization for communities that do not have the resources to tempt commercial developers to provide local versions of their products. It thus minimizes the need to ship materials over long distances and organizes material activities accordingly;&lt;ref name="hbr.org"&gt;Kostakis, Vasilis. Roos, Andreas. [https://hbr.org/2018/06/new-technologies-wont-reduce-scarcity-but-heres-something-that-might New Technologies Won’t Reduce Scarcity, but Here’s Something That Might]. ''Harvard Business Review'', 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Local manufacturing also makes maintenance easier and also encourages manufacturers to design products to last as long as possible;&lt;ref name="hbr.org"/&gt;
* It can be free as in "gratis" as well as free as in "libre", an important consideration for developing communities.&lt;ref&gt;
 Zelenika and J.M. Pearce, [https://www.academia.edu/9013667/Innovation_Through_Collaboration_Scaling_up_Technological_Solutions_for_Sustainable_Development Innovation Through Collaboration: Scaling up Technological Solutions for Sustainable Development], ''Environment, Development and Sustainability'' 16(6): 1299-1316 (2014). {{doi|10.1007/s10668-014-9528-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the lateral scaling concepts of [[Jeremy Rifkin]].&lt;ref&gt;Rifkin, Jeremy. The zero marginal cost society: The internet of things, the collaborative commons, and the eclipse of capitalism. Macmillan, 2014. {{ISBN|978-1137278463}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus optimizes the sharing of knowledge and design as there are no patent costs to pay for.&lt;ref name="hbr.org"/&gt;

== Ethical considerations ==

For solutions, many researchers, companies, and academics do work on products meant to assist [[sustainable development]]. [[Vinay Gupta]] has suggested that those developers agree to three principles:&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt;

# I will not permit any human being to be deprived of life-giving technology by the profit motive.
# Any works that I patent I will make available to others who are engaged in humanitarian activity for free, except where this would breach other contractual responsibilities.
# I will not use patent law to slow the pace of innovation or service delivery to the needy under any circumstances.

The ethics of information sharing in this context has been explored in depth.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, P. (2014). [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/73133/1/Phillipa_Shea_Thesis.pdf Community arts and appropriate internet technology: participation, materiality, and the ethics of sustainability in the digitally networked era].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, C. M. (2014). [http://www.ejisdc.org/Ojs2/index.php/ejisdc/article/viewFile/1233/510 Exploring information ethics for inclusive open development]. The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support in the literature ==

* It has been investigated how open sharing of designs, specifications, and technical information can enhance effectiveness, widespread use, and innovation of appropriate technology.&lt;ref name="buitenhuis" /&gt;
* OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="Zelenika" /&gt;
* OSAT has been claimed to assist in development of medical technology particularly for the developing world.&lt;ref name="Kapczynski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sali" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, S.R. and Barry, M., 2011. Health technologies and innovation in the global health arena. New England Journal of Medicine, 365(9), pp.779-782.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has been claimed that the sharing of design processes, appropriate tools, and technical information enables more effective and rapid development of appropriate technologies for both industrialized and non-industrialized regions.&lt;ref name="pearce-mushtaq" /&gt; In addition, it is claimed that this sharing will require the appropriate-technology community to adopt open standards/licenses, document knowledge, and build on previous work.&lt;ref name="pearce-mushtaq" /&gt;
* OSAT can be used to generate [[renewable energy]]&lt;ref&gt;Louie H. Experiences in the construction of open source low technology off-grid wind turbines. In2011 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting 2011 Jul 24 (pp. 1-7). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;
* OSAT in [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]&lt;ref&gt;Pscheidt, M. and van der Weide, T.P., 2010. Bridging the Digital Divide by Open Source: A Theoretical Model of Best Practice.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In education ==

* At the university level, the use of open-source-appropriate technology classroom projects has been shown to be successful in forging  the connection between physics and social benefit:&lt;ref name="Pearce-2" /&gt;  This approach has the potential to use university students' access to resources and testing equipment in furthering the development of appropriate technology. Similarly OSAT has been used as a tool for improving [[service learning]].&lt;ref name="Pearce-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saleh" /&gt; [[MIT]] has completed a study looking at the usefulness of using [[appropriate technology]] education and its relation to OSAT.&lt;ref name="Grue" /&gt;
* It has been proposed that the evolution of the open-source [[3D printer]]s can enable a new method of development for OSAT&lt;ref name="Villumsen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zelenika-Zovko" /&gt;

==Open source scientific equipment==
* [[Open source hardware]] for science can also be considered OSAT. Hundreds of scientific tools have already been developed and shared. Recently (2014) [[Open Source Lab (book)|open source labs]] have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Pearce, [[Open Source Lab (book)|Open-Source Lab: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs]], Elsevier, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation ==
Appropriate technology is designed to promote [[Decentralization|decentralized]], [[labor-intensive]], [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] and [[environmentally sound]] businesses.&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-335190-1|pages=3, 270|author=Hazeltine, B.|author2=Bull, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll Pursell says that the movement declined from 1965 to 1985, due to an inability to counter advocates of agribusiness, large private utilities, and multinational construction companies.&lt;ref name="Pursell" /&gt; Recently (2011), several barriers to OSAT deployment have been identified:&lt;ref name="Zelenika-Pearce" /&gt;
* AT seen as inferior or "poor person's" technology
* Technical transferability and robustness of AT
* Insufficient funding
* Weak institutional support
* The challenges of distance and time in tackling rural poverty.

In May 2017, a funding round with [[Goldman Sachs]], [[CapitalG]], [[Pritzker Group]], and others invested $600&amp;nbsp;million in Outcome Health, giving it a $5.6&amp;nbsp;billion valuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2017/05/30/outcome-health-new-drug-marketing-billionaire/#2cc693fe6b0f|title=This 31-Year-Old Is Worth $3B For Bringing Drug Marketing Into Your Doctor's Office|first=Alex|last=Konrad|date=|website=Forbes|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the largest single funding round in Chicago since [[Groupon]] in 2011, when it raised $950&amp;nbsp;million in its fifth funding round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/chicagos-newest-billionaire-is-self-made/|title=Chicago's newest billionaire, 31-year-old Rishi Shah, is self-made|author=|date=|website=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report in [[The Wall Street Journal]] unnamed former employees and advertisers accused the company of overcharging their customers for advertisements and misquoting third-party analyses and falsifying documents on the ads' performance. According to the accusations, Outcome Health reported that the ads appeared on more video screens than they had installed.&lt;ref name="WSJ10122017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TC101217"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lynley|first1=Matthew|title=Startups  advertising In-office medical advertising startup Outcome Health reportedly misled advertisers|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/12/in-office-medical-advertising-startup-outcome-health-reportedly-misled-advertisers/|website=Tech Crunch|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lanny Davis]], a company spokesperson, responded by saying a law firm had been hired to "review allegations about certain employees’ conduct that have been raised internally."&lt;ref name="WSJ10122017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winkler|first1=Rolfe|title=Outcome, a Hot Tech Startup, Misled Advertisers With Manipulated Information, Sources Say|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/outcome-a-hot-tech-startup-misled-advertisers-with-manipulated-information-sources-say-1507834627|accessdate=13 October 2017|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Over-the-Air programming''' (OTA) refers to various methods of distributing new [[software]], configuration settings, and even [[Over the Air Rekeying|updating encryption keys]] to devices like [[cellphone]]s, [[set-top box]]es or [[Secure voice|secure voice communication]] equipment (encrypted 2-way radios). One important feature of OTA is that one central location can send an update to all the users, who are unable to refuse, defeat, or alter that update, and that the update applies immediately to everyone on the channel. A user could "refuse" OTA but the "channel manager" could also "kick them off" the channel automatically.

In the context of the [[mobile content]] world these include '''over-the-air service provisioning''' (OTASP), '''over-the-air provisioning''' (OTAP) or '''over-the-air parameter administration''' (OTAPA),  or provisioning handsets with the necessary settings with which to access services such as [[Wireless access point|WAP]] or [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]].

As mobile phones accumulate new applications and become more advanced, OTA configuration has become increasingly important as new updates and services come on stream. OTA via [[Short Message Service|SMS]] optimizes the configuration data updates in [[Subscriber identity module|SIM]] cards and handsets and enables the distribution of new software updates to mobile phones or provisioning handsets with the necessary settings with which to access services such as WAP or MMS. OTA messaging provides remote control of mobile phones for service and subscription activation, personalization and programming of a new service for mobile operators and telco third parties.&lt;ref name="MME2001req"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010811201929/http://www.microsoft.com/mobile/phones/mme/default.asp|archivedate=11 August 2001|url=http://www.microsoft.com/mobile/phones/mme/default.asp|accessdate=19 April 2011|title=Mobile Phones&amp;nbsp;— Mobile Explorer|publisher=Microsoft|year=2001|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various standardization bodies were established to help develop, oversee, and manage OTA.  One of them is the [[Open Mobile Alliance]] (OMA).

More recently, with the new concepts of [[Wireless Sensor Networks]] and the [[Internet of Things]], where the networks consist of hundreds or thousands of nodes, OTA is taken to a new direction: for the first time OTA is applied using unlicensed frequency bands (868&amp;nbsp;MHz, 900&amp;nbsp;MHz, 2400&amp;nbsp;MHz) and with low consumption and low data rate transmission using protocols such as [[802.15.4]] and [[ZigBee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gascón|first=David|title=Over the Air Programming with 802.15.4 and ZigBee - OTA|url=http://www.libelium.com/over_the_air_programming_OTA_802.15.4_ZigBee/|work=Libelium|publisher=Libelium|accessdate=28 May 2012|author2=Alberto Bielsa |author3=Félix Genicio |author4=Marcos Yarza |date=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[sensor node|Motes]] are often located in places that are either remote or difficult to access. As an example, [[Libelium]] has implemented a smart and easy-to-use OTA programming system for [[ZigBee]] WSN devices. This system enables firmware upgrades without the need of physical access, saving time and money if the nodes must be re-programmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Libelium.com 50 Sensor applications for a Smarter World. Get Inspired!|url=http://www.libelium.com/50_sensor_applications|work=Libelium.com|publisher=Libelium.com|accessdate=28 May 2012|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smartphones==
On modern [[mobile device]]s such as [[smartphone]]s, an '''over-the-air update''' may refer simply to a software update that is distributed over [[Wi-Fi]] or [[mobile broadband]] using a function built into the operating system, with the "over-the-air" aspect referring to its use of wireless internet instead of requiring the user to connect the device to a computer via [[USB]] to perform the update.

[[Patch (computing)|Firmware updates]] are available for download from the &lt;ref&gt;http://www.prestigio.com/news/firmware_updates/New_firmware_MultiPhone_4055_DUO&lt;/ref&gt; OTA service.

== Mechanism ==

The OTA mechanism requires the existing software and hardware of the target device to support the feature, namely the receipt and installation of new software received via the [[wireless telephony|wireless]] network from the provider.

New software is transferred to the phone, installed, and put into use. It is often necessary to turn the phone off and back on for the new programming to take effect, though many phones will automatically perform this action.

== Methods ==

Depending on implementation, OTA software delivery can be initiated upon action, such as a call to the provider's customer support system or other dialable service, or can be performed automatically. Typically it is done via the former method to avoid service disruption at an inconvenient time, but this requires subscribers to manually call the provider. Often, a carrier will send a broadcast [[Short message service|SMS]] text message to all subscribers (or those using a particular model of phone) asking them to dial a service number to receive a software update.

[[Verizon Wireless]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] provides a number of OTA functions to its subscribers via the *228 service code. Option 1 updates phone configuration, option 2 updates the [[Preferred roaming list|PRL]]. Similarly Voitel Wireless and StraightTalk, which both use Verizon network, use *22890 service code to program Verizon based wireless phones. [[Interop Technologies]] provides a number of nationwide wireless operators in the US with an SS7 Based Over-the-Air device management solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/wifirevolution/articles/24338-alaska-digitel-buys-ota-programming-solution-from-interop.htm |title=Alaska DigiTel Buys OTA Pgramming Solution from Interop Technologies |publisher=Tmcnet.com |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solution allows operators to manage wireless device functionality including renumbering handsets, updating phone settings, applications and subscriber data and adjusting [[Preferred roaming list|PRL]] to manage cost structures.

To provision parameters in a mobile device OTA, the device needs to have a provisioning client capable of receiving, processing and setting the parameters.  For example, a Device Management client in a device may be capable of receiving and provisioning applications, or connectivity parameters.

In general, the term OTA implies the use of wireless mechanisms to send provisioning data or update packages for firmware or software updates to a mobile device&amp;nbsp;— this is so that the user does not have to go to a store or a service center to have applications provisioned, parameters changed or firmware or software updated. Non-OTA options for a user are a) to go to a store and seek help b) use a PC and a cable to connect to the device and change settings on a device, add software to device, etc.

== OTA standards ==

There are a number of standards that describe OTA functions. One of the first was the [[GSM 03.48]] series.
The ZigBee suite of standards includes the ZigBee Over-the-Air Upgrading Cluster which is part of the ZigBee Smart Energy Profile and provides an interoperable (vendor-independent) way of updating device firmware.

== Similarities ==

OTA is similar to firmware distribution methods used by other mass-produced [[consumer electronics]], such as [[cable modem]]s, which use [[TFTP]] as a way to remotely receive new programming, thus reducing the amount of time spent by both the owner and the user of the device on maintenance.

Over-the-air provisioning (OTAP) is also available in wireless environments (though it is disabled by default for security reasons). It allows an access point (AP) to discover the IP address of its controller. When enabled, the controller tells the other APs to include additional information in the Radio Resource Management Packets (RRM) that would assist a new access point in learning of the controller. It is sent in plain text however, which would make it vulnerable to sniffing. That's why it is disabled by default.

'''Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP)''' is a [[3GPP]] protocol used on the Sx/N4 interface between the control plane and the user plane function, specified in TS 29.244&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.3gpp.org/dynareport/29244.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. It is one of the main protocols introduced in the [[5G]] Next Generation Mobile Core Network (aka [[5GC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.wirelessmoves.com/2018/04/the-5g-core-network-5gc-part-1-network-entities.html|title=The 5G Core Network (5GC) – Part 1 – Network Entities|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but also used in the [[4G LTE|4G/LTE]] [[Evolved Packet Core|EPC]] to implement the [[Control and User Plane Separation]] (CUPS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3gpp.org/cups|title=Control and User Plane Separation of EPC nodes (CUPS)|first=Kevin|last=Flynn|website=www.3gpp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;. PFCP and the associated interfaces seek to formalize the interactions between different types of functional elements used in the Mobile Core Networks as deployed by most operators providing 4G, as well as 5G, services to mobile subscribers. These 2 types of components are: 

# The Control Plane (CP) functional elements, handling mostly signaling procedures (e.g. network attachment procedures, management of User-data Plane paths and even delivery of some light-weight services as [[SMS]]) 
# The User-data Plane (UP) functional elements, handling mostly packet forwarding, based on rules set by the CP elements (e.g. packet forwarding for [[IPv4]], [[IPv6]] - or possibly even [[Ethernet]] with future [[5G]] deployments - between the various supported wireless [[Radio access network|RANs]] and the [[Packet Data Network|PDN]] representing the [[Internet]] or an enterprise network). 

PFCP's scope is similar to that of [[OpenFlow]], however it was engineered to serve the particular use-case of [[Mobile network|Mobile Core Networks]]. PFCP lacks the same general-purpose targets, describing well the [[3GPP]]-specific functional basic blocks of packet forwarding used in [[2G]], [[3G]], [[4G LTE|4G/LTE]], Non-3GPP [[Wi-Fi|WiFi]] and [[5G]] networks.

== Overview ==
Albeit similar to [[GPRS Tunnelling Protocol|GTP]] in concepts and implementation, PFCP is complementary to it. It provides the control means for a signaling component of the Control-Plane to manage packet processing and forwarding performed by an User-Plane component. Typical [[Evolved Packet Core|EPC]] or [[5G]] Packet Gateways are split by the protocol in 2 functional parts, allowing for a more natural evolution and scalability.
[[File:PFCP in EPC.png|alt=PFCP in the Evolved Packet Core - the Sx interface|none|thumb|690x690px|PFCP in the Evolved Packet Core - the Sx interface ([http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/bLHTIyCm57s_l-8ywh9IEgQ8e0moLdoHG1PzsKlcnYoKLhQo-P0VhxrT4mqMzJoCd7Fknyr7DpiqTjziYiPQmY3qP0qvw2SCSVRr53BEjf1mv8D5bCtQsTTP1eU0l4hpjpRT0UGBk2YVDTTFoC4ntEy-20oH276UKr-b-WQoqmHhVSptRJle_1dIw-n1THhwcELy4Ow2OqFDM8iumIDCFwXn3v editable image source])]]
The PFCP protocol is used on the following [[3GPP]] mobile core interfaces:

* Sxa - between SGW-C and SGW-U
* Sxb - between PGW-C and PGW-U
* Sxc - between TDF-C and TDF-U
* N4 - between SMF and UPF

Note: Sxa and Sxb can be combined, in case a merged SGW/PGW is implemented.
[[File:PFCP 5GC.png|alt=PFCP in the 5G Core (aka NGC) - the N4 interface|none|thumb|530x530px|PFCP in the 5G Core (aka NGC) - the N4 interface ([http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/dT8_QyCm40Nm_Jx56-CS8gGjtLeI7BnLY0PdoYAmIGr61bkGnH--rIl-Gpkr3mrtFp-4CJuCqVUnQgBt8c3Kg9glA63t-zc8Ac167DyA-XB5cJPrsASlcKqM6_4xj7N7Fk1djlO9-Eiz_-nSbixEgE41x2E5I2C-Sq-vYdaXRjwpeuMcZI6MhW1cLBYJnIZJvoRki0ffXTVlJKIG1kHTY7tNmh editable image source])]]
== Functionality ==
The Control-Plane functional element (e.g. PGW-C, SMF) controls the packet processing and forwarding in the User-Plane functional elements (e.g. PGW-U, UPF), by establishing, modifying or deleting  PFCP Sessions. Per session multiple PDRs, FARs, QERs, URR and/or BARs are sent.

Here are the main concepts used, organized in their logical association model:

* PDRs - Packet Detection Rules - contain information for matching data packets to certain processing rules. Both outer encapsulation and inner user-plane headers can be matched. The following rules can be applied on positive matching:
** FARs - Forwarding Action Rules - whether and how the packets matching PDRs should be dropped, forwarded, buffered or duplicated, including a trigger for first packet notification; it includes packet encapsulation or header enrichment rules. In case of buffering, the following rules can be applied:
*** BARs - Buffering Action Rules - how much data to buffer and how to notify the Control-Plane.
** QERs - [[Quality of service|QoS]] Enforcement Rules - rules for providing Gating and QoS Control, flow and service level marking.
** URRs - Usage Reporting Rules - contain rules for counting and reporting traffic handled by the User-Plane function, generating reports to enable charging functionality in the Control-Plane functions.

== Transport ==
Very similar to [[GPRS Tunnelling Protocol|GTP-C]], PFCP uses [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]. Port 8805 is reserved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=8805|title=Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry|website=www.iana.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

For reliability, a similar re-transmission strategy as for [[GPRS Tunnelling Protocol|GTP-C]] is employed, lost messages being sent N1-times at T1-intervals. Transactions are identified by the 3-byte long Sequence Number, the IP address and port of the communication peer.

The protocol includes an own Heart-beat Request/Response model, which allows monitoring the availability of communication peers and detecting restarts (by use of a Recovery-Timestamp Information Element).

For User-Plane packet exchanges between the Control and User Plane functional elements, [[GPRS Tunnelling Protocol|GTP-U]] for the Sx-u interface, or alternatively a simpler [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] or [[Ethernet]] encapsulation for the N4-u interface (to be confirmed, as standards are still incomplete).

A '''quantum vacuum thruster''' ('''QVT''' or '''Q-thruster''') is a theoretical system that uses the same principles and equations of motion that a conventional [[Plasma propulsion engine|plasma thruster]] would use, namely [[magnetohydrodynamics]] (MHD), to make predictions about the behavior of the propellant. However, rather than using a conventional plasma as a propellant, a QVT uses the [[quantum vacuum fluctuations]] of the [[Zero-point energy|zero-point field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Harold|last2=March|first2=Paul|last3=Lawrence|first3=James|last4=Vera|first4=Jerry|last5=Sylvester|first5=Andre|last6=Brady|first6=David|last7=Bailey|first7=Paul|title=Measurement of Impulsive Thrust from a Closed Radio-Frequency Cavity in Vacuum|journal=Journal of Propulsion and Power|volume=33|issue=4|date=2016|doi=10.2514/1.B36120|url=http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/1.B36120|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joosten ;|first1=B. Kent|last2=White|first2=Harold G.|title=Human outer solar system exploration via Q-Thruster technology|journal=Aerospace Conference, 2015 IEEE|date=2015|doi=10.1109/AERO.2015.7118893|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140013174.pdf|isbn=978-1-4799-5379-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; If QVT systems were to truly work they would eliminate the need to carry any propellant, as the system uses the quantum vacuum to assist with thrust. It would also allow for much higher specific impulses for QVT systems compared to other spacecraft as they would be limited only by their power supply’s energy storage densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=H.|last2=March|first2=P.|title=Advanced Propulsion Physics: Harnessing the Quantum Vacuum|journal=Nuclear and Emerging Technologies for Space|date=2012|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/nets2012/pdf/3082.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold G. White|Harold White's]] [[Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory]] (NASA Eagleworks) suggests that their [[RF resonant cavity thruster|RF cavity]] may be an example of a quantum vacuum thruster (QVT or Q-thruster).

== History and controversy ==
The name and concept is controversial.  In 2008, Yu Zhu and others at China's Northwestern Polytechnical University claimed to measure thrust from such a thruster, but called it a "microwave thruster without propellant" working on quantum principles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 2011 it was mentioned as something to be studied by [[Harold G. White]] and his team at [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|NASA]]'s [[Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory|Eagleworks]] Laboratories,&lt;ref name="NASA" /&gt; who were working with a prototype of such a thruster.  Other physicists, such as [[Sean M. Carroll]] and [[John Baez]], dismiss it because the quantum vacuum as currently understood is not a plasma and does not possess plasma-like characteristics.

==Theory of operation==
[[File:EmDrive built by Eagleworks inside the test chamber.jpg|thumb|Prototype resonant cavity thruster built by [[Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory|NASA Eagleworks]]]]

A vacuum can be viewed not as empty space but as the combination of all [[Zero-point energy|zero-point fields]]. According to [[quantum field theory]] the universe is made up of matter fields whose [[Quantum|quanta]] are [[fermions]] (e.g. [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s) and force fields, whose quanta are [[boson]]s (i.e. [[photon]]s and [[gluon]]s). All these fields have some intrinsic [[zero-point energy]].&lt;ref name="Academic Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milonni|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter W. Milonni|title=The Quantum Vacuum: An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics|date=1994|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|isbn=9780124980808|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPHJCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Describing the quantum vacuum, a ''[[Physics Today]]'' article cited by the NASA team describes this ensemble of fields as "''a turbulent sea, roiling with waves associated with a panoply of force-mediating fields such as the photon and Higgs fields''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bush|first1=John W. M.|title=The new wave of pilot-wave theory|journal=Physics Today|date=2015|volume=68|issue=8|pages=47–53|doi=10.1063/PT.3.2882|url=http://newfos.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/Pilot_Waves_Phys_Today_Aug_2015.pdf|bibcode=2015PhT....68h..47B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the equivalence of mass and energy expressed by [[Einstein]]'s [[E = mc2|E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], any point in [[Spacetime|space]] that contains energy can be thought of as having mass to create particles. [[Virtual particles]] spontaneously flash into existence and annihilate each other at every point in space due to the energy of [[quantum fluctuations]]. Many real physical effects attributed to these vacuum fluctuations have been experimentally verified, such as [[spontaneous emission]], [[Casimir force]], [[Lamb shift]], [[Electron magnetic moment|magnetic moment of the electron]] and [[Delbrück scattering]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milonni|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter W.

A QVT system seeks to make use of this predicted Casimir-like momentum transfer.

White models of the perturbed quantum vacuum around a hydrogen atom as a [[Dirac vacuum]] consisting of virtual electron-positron pairs. Given the nontrivial variability in local energy densities resulting from virtual pair production, he suggests the tools of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) can be used to model the quasiclassical behavior of the quantum vacuum as a plasma.

The 2016 NASA paper highlights that [[stochastic electrodynamics]] (SED) allows for a pilot-wave interpretation of quantum mechanics.

=== Controversy and criticism ===
Some notable physicists have found the Q-thruster concept to be implausible. For example, mathematical physicist [[John Baez]] has criticized the reference to "quantum vacuum virtual plasma" noting that: "There's no such thing as 'virtual plasma' ".&lt;ref&gt;https://plus.google.com/117663015413546257905/posts/WfFtJ8bYVya&lt;/ref&gt; Noted Caltech theoretical physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]] has also affirmed this statement, writing "[t]here is no such thing as a ‘quantum vacuum virtual plasma,’...".&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2014/08/06/nasa-validate-imposible-space-drive-word/#.VCYphStdU3c&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lafleur found that [[quantum field theory]] predicts no net force, implying that the measured thrusts are unlikely to be due to quantum effects. However, Lafleur noted that this conclusion was based on the assumption that the electric and magnetic fields were homogeneous, whereas certain theories posit a small net force in inhomogeneous vacuums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1411.5359 |title=Can the quantum vacuum be used as a reaction medium to generate thrust? |date=2014-11-19 |last1=Lafleur |first1=Trevor |class=quant-ph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, the violation of energy and momentum conservation laws have been heavily criticized. In a presentation at Nasa Ames Research Centre in November 2014, Harold White addressed the issue of conservation of momentum by stating that the Q-thruster conserves momentum by creating a wake or anisotropic state in the quantum vacuum. White indicated that once false positives were ruled out, Eagleworks would explore the momentum distribution and divergence angle of the quantum vacuum wake using a second Q-thruster to measure the quantum vacuum wake.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wokn7crjBbA&lt;/ref&gt; In a paper published in January 2014, White proposed to address the conservation of momentum issue by stating that the Q-thruster pushes quantum particles (electrons/positrons) in one direction, whereas the Q-thruster recoils to conserve momentum in the other direction. White stated that this   principle  was similar to how a submarine uses its propeller to push water in one direction, while the submarine recoils to conserve momentum.&lt;ref&gt;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140013174.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the violations of fundamental laws of physics can be avoided.

=== Other hypothesized quantum vacuum thrusters ===
A number of physicists have suggested that a spacecraft or object may generate thrust through its interaction with the quantum vacuum. For example, Fabrizio Pinto in a 2006 paper published in the ''[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]]'' noted it may be possible to bring a cluster of polarisable vacuum particles to a hover in the laboratory and then to transfer thrust to a macroscopic accelerating vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2006.59.247 |title=Progress in Quantum Vacuum Engineering Propulsion |publisher=JBIS |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Jordan Maclay in a 2004 paper titled "A Gedanken Spacecraft that Operates Using the Quantum Vacuum (Dynamic Casimir Effect)" published in the [[scientific journal]] ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'' noted that it is possible to accelerate a spacecraft based on the dynamic [[Casimir effect]], in which [[electromagnetic radiation]] is emitted when an uncharged mirror is properly accelerated in vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=A Gedanken Spacecraft that Operates Using the Quantum Vacuum (Dynamic Casimir Effect) |journal=Foundations of Physics  |volume=34  |issue=3  |pages=477–500  |date=2004-03-01  |arxiv=physics/0303108 |bibcode=2004FoPh...34..477M  |author1=MacLay  |first1=G.

E. |last2= Little |first2=S. R. |bibcode = 2010arXiv1012.5264P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, researcher Yoshinari Minami in a 2008 paper titled "Preliminary Theoretical Considerations for Getting Thrust via Squeezed Vacuum" published in the ''Journal of the British Interplanetary Society'' noted the theoretical possibility of extracting thrust from the excited vacuum induced by controlling squeezed light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2008.61.315 |title=Preliminary Theorectical Considerations for Getting Thrust via Squeezed Vacuum |publisher=JBIS |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Alexander Feigel in a 2009 paper noted that propulsion in [[quantum vacuum]] may be achieved by rotating or aggregating magneto-electric [[nano-particle]]s in strong perpendicular electrical and magnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=0912.1031 |title=A magneto-electric quantum wheel |date=2009-12-05 |last1=Feigel |first1=Alexander |class=quant-ph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Puthoff,&lt;ref name=Puthoff/&gt; although this method can produce angular momentum causing a static disk (known as a Feynman disk) to begin to rotate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v285/n5761/abs/285154a0.html |title=Observation of static electromagnetic angular momentum in vacua |publisher=Nature Publishing Group |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09 |volume=285 |issue=5761 |doi=10.1038/285154a0 |journal=Nature |pages=154–155|bibcode=1980Natur.285..154G |year=1980 |last1=Graham |first1=G.

== Experiments ==
In 2013, the [[Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory|Eagleworks]] team tested a device called the Serrano Field Effect Thruster, built by Gravitec Inc. at the request of [[Boeing]] and [[DARPA]].

Using a [[torsion pendulum]], [[Harold G.

Using the same measurement equipment, a non-zero force was also measured on a "null" resonator that was not designed to experience any such force, which they suggest hints at "interaction with the quantum vacuum virtual plasma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anomalous Thrust Production from an RF Test Device Measured on a Low-Thrust Torsion Pendulum |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140006052.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; All measurements were performed at atmospheric pressure, presumably in contact with air, and with no analysis of systematic errors, except for the use of an RF load without the resonant cavity interior as a control device.&lt;ref&gt;http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2014-4029&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015, Paul March from that team made new results public, claiming positive experimental force measurements with a torsional pendulum in a hard vacuum: about 50&amp;nbsp;µN with 50 W of input power at 5.0×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]], and new null-thrust tests.&lt;ref name="NBF_20150206"&gt;{{cite web

As of 2015, Eagleworks is attempting to gather performance data to support the development of a Q-thruster engineering prototype for [[reaction control system|reaction-control-system]] applications in the force range of 0.1–1 N with a corresponding input electrical power range of 0.3–3&amp;nbsp;kW. The group plans to begin by testing a refurbished test article to improve the historical performance of a 2006 experiment that attempted to demonstrate the [[Woodward effect]]. The photograph shows the test article and the plot diagram shows the thrust trace from a 500g load cell in experiments performed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=March|first1=P.|last2=Palfreyman|first2=A.|title=The Woodward Effect: Math Modeling and Continued Experimental Verifications at 2 to 4 MHz| journal=Proceedings of Space Technology and Applications International Forum (STAIF)|volume=813|pages=1321|year=2006|editor=M.

The group hopes that testing the device on a high-fidelity torsion pendulum (1–4&amp;nbsp;μN at 10–40 W) will unambiguously demonstrate the feasibility of this concept. The team is maintaining a dialogue with the [[International Space Station|ISS national labs office]] for an on-orbit [[International Space Station#Scientific research|detailed test objective]] (DTO) to test the Q-thrusters operation in the vacuum and weightlessness of outer space.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110023492_2011024705.pdf|title=Eagleworks Laboratories: Advanced Propulsion Physics Research|date=2 December 2011|accessdate=10 January 2013|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Maglifter.jpg|thumb|right|350px|An example of rocket sled launch assist: NASA's Maglifter proposal for giving a 500+ ton rocket initial velocity from a mountain.]]

A '''rocket sled launch''', also known as "ground based launch assist", "catapult launch assist", and "sky ramp launch", is a proposed method for [[Non-rocket spacelaunch|launching]] [[space]] vehicles. With this concept the launch vehicle is supported by an eastward pointing rail or maglev track that goes up the side of a mountain while an externally applied force is used to accelerate the launch vehicle to a given velocity.  Using an externally applied force for the initial acceleration reduces the propellant the launch vehicle needs to carry to reach orbit.  This allows the launch vehicle to carry a larger payload and reduces the cost of getting to orbit.  When the amount of velocity added to the launch vehicle by the ground accelerator becomes great enough, [[single-stage-to-orbit]] flight with a reusable launch vehicle becomes possible.

For hypersonic research in general, tracks at [[Holloman Air Force Base]] have tested, as of 2011, small rocket sleds moving at up to {{convert|6453|mph|km/h|abbr=on|}} (Mach 8.5).&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. Air Force: {{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123004755|title=Test Sets World Land Speed Record|accessdate=April 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120604184801/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123004755|archivedate=June 4, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effectively a 'sky ramp' would make the most expensive, first stage of a rocket fully reusable since the sled is returned to its starting position, to be refueled and may be reused in the order of hours after use. Present launch vehicles have performance-driven costs of [[Rocket#Costs and economics|thousands of dollars per kilogram of dry weight]]; sled launch would aim to reduce performance requirements and amortize hardware expenses over frequent, repeated launches.  Designs for mountain based inclined rail 'rocket' sleds often use jet engines or rockets to accelerate the spacecraft mounted on it. Electromagnetic methods (such as Bantam, Maglifter, and [[StarTram]]) are another technique investigated to accelerate a rocket before launch, potentially scalable to greater rocket masses and velocities than [[air launch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias-spes.org/SPESIF2010/Plenary%20I/Rather_abs.html|title=Transformational Technologies to Expedite Space Access and Development|publisher=SPESIF, Dr. John Rather, prior Assistant Director for Space Technology Program Development at [[NASA]]|accessdate=28 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323091323/http://www.ias-spes.org/SPESIF2010/Plenary%20I/Rather_abs.html|archivedate=23 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = NASAmaglifter&gt;{{cite web|citeseerx=10.1.1.110.9317|title=Maglifter Tradeoff Study and Subscale System Demonstrations|publisher=NASA|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the problem==
[[NASA]] studies have shown that the [[Space Shuttle]] used more than a third of its fuel just to reach {{convert|1000|mph|km/h|abbr=on|}}.&lt;ref&gt;''NASA: {{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/basics/launch.html|title=Space Shuttle Basics|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If a rocket were already moving at launch, with corresponding reduced propellant needs, a greater fraction of liftoff mass could have been payload and hardware.

==An example==

Due to factors including the exponential nature of the [[rocket equation]] and higher [[propulsive efficiency#Rocket engines|propulsive efficiency]] than if a rocket takes off stationary, a [[NASA]] Maglifter study estimated that a {{convert|270|m/s|mph|abbr=on}} launch of an [[Expendable launch system|ELV]] rocket from a 3000-meter altitude mountain peak could increase payload to [[Low earth orbit|LEO]] by 80% compared to the same rocket from a conventional [[launch pad]].&lt;ref name = MaglifterMankins&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=24756.0;attach=288934|title=The Maglifter: An Advanced Concept Using Electromagnetic Propulsion in Reducing the Cost of Space Launch|publisher=NASA|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mountains of such height are available [[Mountain peaks of the United States|within the mainland U.S.]] for the easiest logistics, or nearer to the Equator for a little more gain from [[Earth's rotation]]. Among other possibilities, a larger [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) could be reduced in liftoff mass by 35% with such launch assist, dropping to 4 instead of 6 engines in one case considered.&lt;ref name = MaglifterMankins/&gt;

At an anticipated efficiency close to 90%, electrical energy consumed per launch of a 500-ton rocket would be around 30 [[Joule#Gigajoule|GJ]], 8000 [[kilowatt hour]]s (each kilowatt-hour costing a few cents at the current [[cost of electricity]] in the United States), aside from any additional losses in energy storage. It is a system with low marginal costs dominated by initial capital costs&lt;ref name = NASAmaglifter/&gt;  Although a fixed site, it was estimated to provide a substantial net payload increase for a high portion of the varying launch azimuths needed by different satellites, with rocket maneuvering during the early stage of post-launch ascent (an alternative to adding [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] for later [[orbital inclination change]]).  Maglev guideway costs were estimated as $10 – $20 million per mile in the 1994 study, which had anticipated annual maglev maintenance costs on the order of 1% of capital costs.&lt;ref name = MaglifterMankins/&gt;

==Benefits of high altitude launches==

Rocket sled launch helps a vehicle gain altitude, and proposals commonly involve the track curving up a mountain.  Advantages to any launch system that starts from high altitudes include reduce [[gravity drag]] (the cost of lifting fuel in a gravity well).  The thinner air will reduce [[air resistance]] and allow more efficient engine geometries.  Rocket nozzles have different shapes (expansion ratios) to maximize thrust at different air pressures. (Though NASA's [[aerospike engine]] for the [[Lockheed Martin X-33]] was designed to change geometry to remain efficient at a variety of different pressures, the aerospike engine had added weight and complexity; [[Lockheed Martin X-33|X-33]] funding was canceled in 2001; and other benefits from launch assist would remain even if aerospike engines reached flight testing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/engines/rs2200.htm|title=RS-2200|accessdate=April 28, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317035653/http://www.astronautix.com/engines/rs2200.htm|archivedate=March 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/x-33/aero_faq.htm|title=The Aerospike Nozzle|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the air is 39% thinner at 2500 meters. The more efficient rocket plume geometry and the reduced air friction allows the engine to be 5% more efficient per amount of fuel burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/aerospike/compensation.shtml|title=Altitude Compensation|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage to high altitude launches is that it eliminates the need to throttle back the engine when the "[[Max Q]]" limit is attained.  Rockets launched in thick atmosphere can go so fast that air resistance may cause structural damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/dynpress.html|title=Dynamic Pressure|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Engines are throttled back when Max Q is reached, until the rocket is high enough that they can resume full power.  The [[Atlas V]] 551 gives an example of this.  It reaches its Max Q at 30,000 feet.  Its engine is throttled back to 60% thrust for 30 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/design_lib/Atlas5.pl.guide.pdf|title=Atlas Launch System Mission Planner's Guide|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reduced acceleration adds to the gravity drag the rocket must overcome.  Additionally, space craft engines concerned with Max Q are more complex as they must be throttled during launch.

A launch from high altitude need not throttle back at Max Q as it starts above the thickest portion of the Earth's atmosphere.

Debora A. Grant and James L. Rand in: "The Balloon Assisted Launch System - A Heavy Lift Balloon"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=mtgpaper&amp;gID=2127|title=The Balloon Assisted Launch System|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: "It was established some time ago that a ground launched rocket capable of reaching 20 km would be able to reach an altitude of almost 100km if it was launched from 20km."  They suggest that small rockets are lifted above the majority of the atmosphere by balloon in order to avoid the problems discussed above.

==Compatibility with reusable launch vehicles==

Rocket sleds at China Lake testing ground have reached Mach 4 while carrying 60,000&amp;nbsp;kg masses.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} A sled track that gave a Mach 2 or greater launch assist could reduce the fuel to orbit by 40% or more, while helping counter the [[Reusable launch system#Weight penalty|weight penalty]] when aiming to make a fully [[Reusable launch system|reusable launch vehicle]].  Angled at 55 degrees to vertical, a track on a tall mountain could allow a single stage to orbit reusable vehicle with no new technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g2mil.com/timeline.htm|title=Sky Ramp Technology|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rocket sled launches in fiction==
*[[Robert A. Heinlein]] used a lunar maglev launcher in [[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]].  One on Earth was built by the novel's end.
*[[Dean Ing]] used a similar system in his 1988 novel "The Big Lifters".

'''Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media''' ('''RRCHNM'''), formerly the '''Center for History and New Media''' ('''CHNM''') is a research institution in the [[George Mason University]] in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]] specializing in history and information technology. It was established by [[Roy Rosenzweig]] in 1994 to research and use [[digital media]] and [[information technology]] in [[history|historical]] research, education, digital tools and resources, [[digital preservation]], and outreach.

== Digital preservation ==
[[File:Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media F.jpg|thumb|right|Center for History and New Media Offices]]
Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the Center for History and New Media in partnership with the American Social History Project at the [[City University of New York]] organized the September 11 Digital Archive with funding from the [[Alfred P. Sloan]] Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the September 11 Digital Archive, CHNM and ASHP utilized electronic media to collect, preserve, and present the past, with a digital repository of material including more than 150,000 first-hand accounts, emails, images, and other digital materials.  This project has inspired a new project, the Hurricane Digital Memory Bank, which is collecting the stories and digital artefacts related to the [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]], and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; CHNM continues to explore methods, tools, and technologies for archiving and preserving information, data, and documents digitally.

== Educational resources ==
The Center for History and New Media worked in partnership with the American Social History Project (ASHP) at the City University of New York, to develop an online resource directed at [[History of the United States|American History]] teachers, along with online resources about the [[French Revolution]].  More recent projects have focused on developing online educational resources about [[World History]], and a project on historical thinking, in partnership with the [[Smithsonian Institution]]’s [[National Museum of American History]].  CHNM is also involved with educational outreach with teachers in [[Virginia]] school districts.

CHNM has also developed a number of online databases and other resources for historians and history teachers, including a listing of 1,200 history departments worldwide, a practical guide to Digital History, a collection of essays on history and new media.  Another online database is Making the History of 1989, which chronicles the fall of [[communism]] in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created in collaboration with the [[German Historical Institute]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], the 1989 Project is powered by CHNM's [[Omeka]] software, and includes resources for teachers and students, ranging from lesson plans to an [[archive]] of [[primary source]] materials.

CHNM collaborated with the [[Jewish Women's Archive]] on Katrina's Jewish Voices, a virtual archive of stories, images, and reflections about the New Orleans and Gulf Coast Jewish communities before and after Hurricane Katrina.

== Software resources ==
[[File:Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media A - Stierch.jpg|thumb|right|Community area of the center]]
CHNM is responsible for the development of two notable [[Open-source software|open source]] software projects: [[Zotero]] and [[Omeka]]. [[Zotero]] is [[reference management software]] which is used by [[academia|academics]] to read and cite the [[Academic publishing|academic literature]]. [[Omeka]] is a [[content management system]] that uses the [[Dublin Core]] metadata standard to build digital collections and publish digital exhibits. Both projects are free, and reflect CHNM's dedication to democratizing the practice of history.

The Center for History and New Media also distributes a set of free additional digital tools for historians and teachers, including Web Scrapbook, Survey Builder, Scribe (a note taking application designed with historians in mind), Poll Builder, H-Bot (an automated historical fact finder), and Syllabus Finder, which allows you to find and compare syllabi from thousands of universities and colleges on any topic, using the [[Google]] search engine.

In 2017, with financial support of the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], CHNM released Tropy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Scholarship ==
Projects like Zotero provide tools for historians to research and analyze the past. But will digital media change the nature of scholarly argument, communication, and publication? In order to encourage experimentation in this arena, American Quarterly in collaboration with the American Studies Crossroads Project and CHNM organized an experiment in hypertext publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imaging the French Revolution is another experiment in digital scholarship. In a series of essays, seven scholars analyze forty-two images of crowds and crowd violence in the French Revolution. Offering the most relevant examples and comments from an on-line forum, those same scholars consider issues of interpretation, methodology, and the impact of digital media on scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a roundtable of historians brought together to discuss the translation and reception of the Declaration of Independence in Japan, Mexico, Russia, China, Poland, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Israel. In addition to these reflections, the site includes actual translations of the Declaration into several different languages and "re-translations" back into English to illustrate the effects of translation on how a key historical document has been understood.

== Public outreach ==
CHNM has also developed some projects with an explicit focus on broad, public audiences.  [[Gulag]]: Many Days, Many Lives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Sleepers, Wake! Technology and the Future of Work''''' is a book written by [[Barry Jones (Australian politician)|Barry Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person135889|title=Prof Hon Barry Jones|last=|first=|date=|website=The University of Melbourne|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally published in 1982 and reprinted many times. A revised and updated edition was published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/6993736|title=''Sleepers, Wake! : Technology and the Future of Work'' / Barry Jones|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Australia|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the premise that technologically advanced nations are currently passing through a [[Post-industrial society|post-industrial]] or [[information revolution]], Jones analyzes the unique threats and opportunities of the sudden rise in information to the field such as manufacturing, service employment, and basic income.

Jones argues that science and technology have changed the quality, length, and direction of life in the past century far more than politics, education, ideology, or religion. Therefore, inventors such as [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Henry Ford]] have shaped human experience more broadly and enduringly than [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].

Some of the book's key points, such as the claim that technological innovation is a major component of economic growth, are more widely accepted now than in 1982. But, to quote Barry Jones himself, "The central thesis was that people were going to be living longer, far longer, ''but it was possible that they would be working a good deal less''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/dimensions/dimensions_future/Transcripts/s616084.htm ''New Dimensions'': "Future of Work"], broadcast transcript, 24 July 2002, with [[George Negus]], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] {{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1617/BasicIncome|title=Basic income: a radical idea enters the mainstream|last=Arthur|first=Don|date=18 November 2016|website=Parliament of Australia|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{failed verification|date=February 2017}}

Due to the rising issues for the labour force, Jones proposed the need to assist workers in income support and choosing to stay or leave the workforce. However, Jones noted in the 1990 edition that the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] [[Hawke Government|government]] did not pursue the idea of basic income when it won office [[Australian federal election, 1983|in 1983]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Sleepers, Wake!'' analyzes the major changes in the workforce and presents the possible political programs to assist the society in profiting from the technological advancements.

The fourth edition uses [[Census in Australia|1991 Commonwealth census]] data as confirmation of his thesis about changes in the labour force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=525198|title=Sleepers, Wake!: Technology and the Future of Work|last=|first=|date=|website=The ACM Digital Library|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Jones was Australia's [[Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Australia)|Minister for Science]] in the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] [[Hawke–Keating Government|government from 1983]] to 1990.

{{confused|Technology readiness level}}

'''Technology readiness''' refers to people’s propensity to embrace and use new technologies for accomplishing goals in home life and at work. The construct can be viewed as an overall state of mind resulting from a gestalt of mental enablers and inhibitors that collectively determine a person’s predisposition to use new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parasuraman|first=A.|year=2000|title=Technology Readiness Index (TRI) a multiple-item scale to measure readiness to embrace new technologies|journal=[[Journal of Service Research]]|volume=2|issue=4|pages=307-320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Technology Readiness Index''' can be viewed as a variation on the [[Technology acceptance model]] (TAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/technology-readiness-index-tri/29544|title=What is Technology Readiness Index|accessdate=31 January 2016|website=igi-global.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a multidimensional [[psychographic]] construct, offering a way to segment online customers based upon their underlying positive and negative technology beliefs.

Technology readiness has four underlying dimensions:
*''optimism'', a positive view of technology and a belief that it offers people increased control, flexibility, and efficiency
*''innovativeness'', the tendency to be a technology pioneer and thought leader
*''discomfort'', perceived lack of control over technology and a feeling of being overwhelmed by it
*''insecurity'', distrust of technology and skepticism about its ability to work properly.

While optimism and innovativeness are contributors to technology readiness, discomfort and insecurity are inhibitors.

'''1992 [[Spinner (wheel)]]'''
* A spinner is a type of [[hubcap]] that spins independently inside of a wheel itself when a vehicle is in motion, and continues to spin once the vehicle has come to a stop. As an attachment to the car's wheel, a spinner operates by using one or more roller bearings to isolate the spinner from the wheel, allowing it to turn while the wheel is at rest. The invention of the spinner is credited to [[James J.D. Gragg]] of Tulsa, Oklahoma who filed a patent on October 28, 1992 and was issued [[United States]] Patent [[#5,290,094]] on March 4, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Automotive wheel enhancers|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=X34mAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1994 [[CMOS image sensor]]'''
[[File:Active pixel sensor prototype.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Early prototype of a CMOS image sensor]]
A CMOS image sensor ([[CMOS|complementary metal-oxide semiconductor]]) is an image sensor consisting of an integrated circuit containing an array of pixel sensors, each pixel containing a photodetector and an active amplifier. Starting at the same point, they have to convert light into electrons by using the [[CMOS]] process. [[CMOS]] image sensors can be found in digital SLR cameras, embedded web-cams, video cameras, automotive safety systems, swallowable-pill cameras, toys and video games, and wireless video-security networks.

'''1994 [[DNA computing]]'''

DNA computing uses DNA, biochemistry and molecular biology, instead of the traditional silicon-based computer technologies. DNA computing, or, more generally, molecular computing, is a fast-developing interdisciplinary area.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Research and development in this area concerns theory, experiments and applications of DNA computing. DNA computing is fundamentally similar to parallel computing in that it takes advantage of the many different molecules of DNA to try many different possibilities at once. [[Leonard Adleman]] of the University of Southern California initially pioneered this field in 1994. Adleman demonstrated a proof-of-concept use of DNA as a form of computation which solved the seven-point Hamiltonian path problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Molecular Computation Of Solutions To Combinatorial Problems|publisher= Science Journal|url= http://www.usc.edu/dept/molecular-science/papers/fp-sci94.pdf|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050206144827/http://www.usc.edu/dept/molecular-science/papers/fp-sci94.pdf|archivedate= February 6, 2005|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Segway PT is a two-wheeled, self-balancing, zero-emission, electric vehicle used for "personal transport". Segways have had success in niche markets such as transportation for police departments, military bases, warehouses, corporate campuses or industrial sites, as well as in tourism. The earliest patent resembling the modern Segway PT, U.S. patent #6,357,544, was filed on May 27, 1994 and issued to [[Dean Kamen]] on December 30, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title= Human Transporter|publisher= United States Patent and Trademark Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamen introduced his invention to the public in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= About Segway – Who We Are|publisher= Segway|url= http://www.segway.com/about-segway/who-we-are.php|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110901212801/http://www.segway.com/about-segway/who-we-are.php|archivedate= September 1, 2011|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1994 [[Quantum cascade laser]]'''

A quantum cascade laser is a sliver of [[semiconductor]] material about the size of a tick. Inside, electrons are constrained within layers of gallium and aluminum compounds, called quantum wells are{{clarify|date=September 2015}} nanometers thick, much smaller than the thickness of a hair. Electrons jump from one energy level to another, rather than moving smoothly between levels and tunnel from one layer to the next going "through" rather than "over" energy barriers separating the wells. When the electrons jump, they emit photons of light. The quantum cascade laser was co-invented by [[Alfred Y. Cho]], [[Claire F. Gmachl]], [[Federico Capasso]], Deborah Sivco, Albert Hutchinson, and Alessandro Tredicucci at [[Bell Laboratories]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Team|publisher=Bell Laboratories|url=http://www.bell-labs.com/org/physicalsciences/projects/qcl/qcl4.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213151811/http://www.bell-labs.com/org/physicalsciences/projects/qcl/qcl4.html|archivedate=December 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4, 1994, the Bell Labs team filed U.S. patent #5,457,709 that was issued on October 10, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Unipolar semiconductor laser|publisher= United States Patent and Trademark Office|url= http://www.google.com/patents?id=aRAfAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter of bosons confined in an external potential and cooled to temperatures very near to absolute zero ({{convert|0|K|C F|disp=or}}). [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] and [[Albert Einstein]] first conceptualized BEC  in 1924–1925; in 1995 [[Wolfgang Ketterle]] at [[MIT]] and [[Eric Allin Cornell|Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] at the University of Colorado at Boulder National Institute of Standards and Technology Laboratory produced a BEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Bose-Einstein Condensation, A New Form of Matter|publisher= University of Washington|url= http://www.npl.washington.edu/AV/altvw77.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1995 [[Screenless hammer mill]]'''
* The screenless hammer mill, like regular [[hammer mill]]s, is used{{by whom|date=September 2015}} to pound grain. The screenless hammer mill uses air flow to separate small particles from larger ones, rather than a screen, and is thus more reliable which results in much more energy efficiency. The screenless hammer mill was invented in 1995 by MIT professor and engineer [[Amy B. Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Screenless hammermill|publisher= Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/smith.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1996 [[Bait car]]'''
* A bait car is a vehicle used by a law enforcement agency to capture car thieves. The vehicles are specially modified with features including GPS tracking and hidden cameras that record audio, video, time and date, which can all be remotely monitored by police. A remote-controlled immobilizer is installed in the vehicle that allows police to disable the engine and lock the doors. Jason Cecchettini invented the concept and technology in 1996.

'''1997 [[Virtual reality therapy]]'''
* Virtual Reality Immersion Therapy or VRIT is a method using specially encoded virtual environments and computers to evaluate and treat anxiety disorders such as acrophobia or PTSD. Conceived in the early 1990s by Dr. Ralph Lamson, VRIT was clinically proven and the key patent 6,425,764 was filed in 1997 for this major contribution to treatment of medical conditions involving sensory induced disorders by recreating such sensations in a controlled manner in an [[immersive virtual environment]] with feedback to achieve mastery over the causative sensations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Virtual Reality Battles PTSD 9 2011|publisher=CNN|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjyRu1e-Jmo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1998 [[HVLS Fans|HVLS fan]]'''
* An HVLS fan ("HVLS" stands for "high-volume low-speed") is a type of rotational [[mechanical fan]] that moves large amounts of circulating air. In addition, HVLS fans have been found{{by whom|date=September 2015}} to be more beneficial than traditional HVAC fans as they are more cost effective as well as having a stronger cooling effect while helping to maintain a constant temperature and humidity. Using 10 overhead airfoil blades in a barn, the HVLS fan was invented in 1998 by Walter Boyd who was challenged to find a better means to reduce the heat stress of dairy cattle which in turn, would increase milk production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= HVLS History|publisher= MacroAir Technologies, Inc.|url= http://www.macro-air.com/about-macroair/hvls-history|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110902180250/http://www.macro-air.com/about-macroair/hvls-history|archivedate= September 2, 2011|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1999 [[Torino scale]]'''
* The Torino Scale, invented by [[Richard P. Binzel]] in 1999, is a method for categorizing the impact hazard associated with near-Earth objects (NEOs) such as asteroids and comets. It was intended as a tool for astronomers and the public to assess the seriousness of collision predictions, by combining probability statistics and known kinetic damage potentials into a single threat-value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= About the Torino Scale|publisher=GNO, Inc.|url= http://www.whatonearth.com/moreinfo.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1999 [[Phase-change incubator]]'''
* The phase-change incubator is a low-cost, low-maintenance incubator to help test for microorganisms in water supplies. It uses small balls containing a chemical compound that, when heated and then kept insulated, will stay at 37&amp;nbsp;°C (approx. 99&amp;nbsp;°F) for 24 hours. MIT professor and engineer [[Amy B.

'''2007 [[Nanowire battery]]'''

A nanowire battery is a [[lithium-ion battery]] consisting of a stainless steel anode covered in silicon nanowires. Silicon, which stores ten times more lithium than graphite, allows a far greater energy density on a steel anode, thus reducing the mass of the battery. The high surface area further allows for fast charging and discharging. The practicality of nanowire batteries is reasoned that a laptop computer that runs on a regular lithium-ion battery for two hours could potentially operate up to 20 hours using a nanowire battery without recharging, which would be a considerable advantage for many people resulting in energy conservation and cost savings. The nanowire battery was co-invented in 2007 by Chinese-American Dr. Yi Cui, an assistant professor of materials science and engineering along with his colleagues at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sulfur in hollow nanofibers overcomes challenges of lithium-ion battery design|publisher=Stanford University|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/october/sulfur-nanofibers-battery-100411.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Silicon nanowire battery holds 10 times the charge of existing ones|publisher=Digital Journal|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/247725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tracking system''' is used for the [[surveillance|observing]] of persons or objects on the move and supplying a [[time series|timely ordered sequence]] of location data for further processing.

== Tracking in virtual space ==
In [[virtual space]] technology, a tracking system is generally a system capable of rendering virtual space to a human observer while tracking the observer's [[coordinates]]. For instance, in dynamic virtual auditory space simulations, a real-time head tracker provides feedback to the central processor, allowing for selection of appropriate head-related transfer functions at the estimated current position of the observer relative to the environment.

== Tracking in real world ==
There are myriads of tracking systems. Some are 'lag time' indicators, that is, the data is collected after an item has passed a point for example a [[bar code]] or choke point or gate. Others are 'real-time' or 'near real-time' like [[Global Positioning System]]s (GPS) depending on how often the data is refreshed. There are bar-code systems which require a person to scan items and [[Automatic identification and data capture|automatic identification]] ([[RFID]] auto-id). For the most part, the tracking worlds are composed of discrete hardware and software systems for different applications. That is, bar-code systems are separate from [[Electronic Product Code]] (EPC) systems, GPS systems are separate from active real time locating systems or [[Real-time locating|RTLS]] for example, a passive RFID system would be used in a warehouse to scan the boxes as they are loaded on a truck - then the truck itself is tracked on a different system using GPS with its own features and software. The major technology “silos” in the supply chain are:

Indoors assets are tracked repetitively reading e.g. a barcode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clancy|first=Heather|title=California security company uses barcodes to help track assets|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/small-business-matters/california-security-company-uses-barcodes-to-help-track-assets/1493|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  any passive and active [[RFID]] and feeding read data into Work in Progress models (WIP) or Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) or ERP software. The readers required per choke point are meshed auto-ID or hand-held ID applications.

However tracking could also be capable of providing monitoring data without binding to a fixed location by using a cooperative tracking capability, e.g. an [[Real-time locating system|RTLS]].

=== Yard management ===
Outdoors mobile assets of high value are tracked by choke point,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cisco Unveils Wireless Location Solution and New Unified Wireless Network Software Release|url=http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2007/prod_052207.html|publisher=CISCO|accessdate=May 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
802.11, [[Real-time locating|Received Signal Strength Indication]] (RSSI), Time Delay on Arrival (TDOA), active RFID or GPS Yard Management; feeding into either third party yard management software from the provider or to an existing system. Yard Management Systems (YMS) couple location data collected by RFID and GPS systems to help supply chain managers to optimize utilization of yard assets such as trailers and dock doors. YMS systems can use either active or passive RFID tags.

=== Fleet management ===
[[Fleet management]] is applied as a [[GPS tracking|tracking application using GPS]] and composing tracks from subsequent vehicle's positions. Each vehicle to be tracked is equipped with a GPS receiver and relays the obtained coordinates via [[cellular network|cellular]] or [[satellite network]]s to a home station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 tips for selecting a GPS fleet management solution|url=http://phcnews.com/aug_11/gps_feature.php|publisher=Phc News|accessdate=August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130826091614/http://phcnews.com/aug_11/gps_feature.php|archivedate=2013-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fleet management is required by:
* Large fleet operators, (vehicle/railcars/trucking/shipping)
* Forwarding operators (containers, machines, heavy cargo, valuable shippings)
* Operators who have high equipment and/or cargo/product costs
* Operators who have a dynamic workload

=== Attendance management ===
One such use of the [[RFID]] technology is in tracking [[student ID|IDs of students]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hadlock|first=Charles|title=RFID chips let schools track students -- and retain funding -- but some parents object|url=http://dailynightly.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/14/14425733-rfid-chips-let-schools-track-students-and-retain-funding-but-some-parents-object|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=Oct 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using GPS IDs would resolve the decreasing attendance in schools by [[surveillance|monitoring]] the whereabouts of students when they did not attend class (Jensen, 2008).  It is also used to efficiently check attendance. Perks of this tracking system is allowing students to check out library books buy food in the cafeterias (Jensen, 2008).  The GPS IDs also act as a security measure to monitor any unwanted visitors or an emergency locator if a student cannot be found (Jensen, 2008).  In the Spring Independent School District, students have been using for many years in check that students are staying in school during the day.  Since they have instigated the system, attendance has increased thus schooling funding has increased as well (Jensen, 2008).

Recently, debates over the Fourth Amendment have come up. Conservative students wish to keep their [[privacy]] and forbid to wear tracking devices, especially  hackers can break into these systems to find out students’ information.  Since many schools, such as those in the Spring Independent School District, require students to wear the tracking IDs, students argue that it is an immediate violation of their privacy (Jensen, 2008).  Yet, the Fourth Amendment is not violated in these cases since students are not tracked in their homes (Warner, 2007).  Each school’s decision over GPS IDs varies as states develop laws against these IDs in schools and as students protest for their [[privacy rights]].

=== Mobile phone services ===
[[Location-based services]] or LBS is a term that is derived from the [[telematics]] and telecom world. The combination of [[A-GPS]], newer GPS and cellular locating technology is what has enabled the latest “LBS” for handsets and PDAs. Line of sight is not necessarily required for a location fix. This is a significant advantage in certain applications since a GPS signal can still be lost indoors. As such, A-GPS enabled cell phones and PDAs can be located indoors and the handset may be tracked more precisely. This enables non-vehicle centric applications and can bridge the indoor location gap, typically the domain of [[RFID]] and [[Real-time locating system|RTLS]] systems, with an off the shelf cellular device.

Currently, A-GPS enabled handsets are still highly dependent on the LBS carrier system, so handset device choice and application requirements are still not apparent. Enterprise system integrators need the skills and knowledge to correctly choose the pieces that will fit the application and geography.

== Operational requirements ==
Regardless of the tracking technology, for the most part the end-users just want to locate themselves or wish to find points of interest. The reality is that there is no "one size fits all" solution with locating technology for all conditions and applications.

Application of tracking is a substantial basis for [[vehicle tracking]] in fleet management, [[asset management]], individual navigation, social networking, or mobile resource management and more. Company, group or individual interests can benefit from more than one of the offered technologies depending on the context.

=== GPS applications ===
[[GPS]] has global coverage but can be hindered by line-of-sight issues caused by buildings and urban canyons.  RFID is excellent and reliable indoors or in situations where close proximity to tag readers is feasible, but has limited range and still requires  costly readers.  RFID stands for [[Radio-frequency identification|Radio Frequency Identification]]. This technology uses electromagnetic waves to receive the signal from the targeting object to then save the location on a reader that can be looked at through specialized software (Warner, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RFID|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/site/faqs#Anchor-What-363|publisher=RFID Journal LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real-time Locating Systems (RTLS)===
[[Real-time locating system|RTLS]] are enabled by [[Wireless LAN]] systems (according to [[IEEE 802.11]]) or other [[wireless]] systems (according to [[IEEE 802.15]]) with [[multilateration]]. Such equipment is suitable for certain confined areas, such as campuses and office buildings. RTLS require system-level deployments and server functions to be effective.

Rev. 854.|url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/llr/vol40/iss2/12/|quote = Imagine a world where children all wear wristbands about the size of a Zippo lighter'-not as the newest fashion statement, but instead for security.  These wristbands can transmit a signal with an effective range of over two football fields, narrowing down each child's position to within thirty feet.  Furthermore, the system can track the children over a two square mile area surrounding their school.  If a child walks off their path or does not make it to school on time, the centralized system automatically sends an e-mail or text message to the child's parents.  ...
