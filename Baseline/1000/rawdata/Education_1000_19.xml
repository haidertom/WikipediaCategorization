An '''academic equivalency evaluation''' is an analytical report which determines the equivalency in the [[United States]] [[educational system]] of a potential US [[immigrant]]'s foreign academic and professional credentials. This evaluation determines the level of [[education]] and number of years completed, as well as the field of [[Academic specialization|specialization]]. Academic evaluations consider the educational system of the foreign country, the quality of the [[university]] attended by the candidate, the [[credit hour]]s and number of years of [[coursework]], the nature of the courses, and the grades attained in the courses.

==Uses==
An academic equivalency evaluation is primarily required for [[H-1B visa]] applicants who have not earned an [[academic degree]] at a university or college in the United States, but have acquired a degree from another country. H-1B visas require a [[bachelor's degree]] or its equivalent as a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/08/1184- 8 U.S.C. 1184(i)(1)(B)]&lt;/ref&gt; Academic equivalency evaluations provide the equivalent basis the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] accepts in order to apply for an H-1B visa. Academic equivalency evaluations can also be used towards other visas such as [[TN status]], [[E-3 visa|E-3]], [[L-1B]], [[Permanent residence (United States)|Green Card]], and [[United States Permanent Resident Card#Application process for employment-based visa|I-140]].

==Documents Required==
Companies that provide academic equivalency evaluations typically require copies of any diplomas, transcripts, and post-graduate degrees, that a candidate may have.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trustfortecorp.com/academic.html Requirements for an academic equivalency evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt; Academic degrees that can be evaluated may include, but not limited to; bachelor's degrees, [[master's degrees]], or [[Ph.D.]], etc.

'''Academic program prioritization''' is the activity or process in which an [[academic institution]] assesses and prioritizes its programs for the purpose of more strategically allocating its funding and resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d.umn.edu/vcaa/program_prioritization.html Program prioritization homepage at the University of Minnesota Duluth]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a process a school engages in when it intends to make systematic changes. For instance, [[Boise State University]] underwent a yearlong process of exploring and assessing its programs with the intention of making the university more focused and more aligned with the needs of its students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.boisestate.edu/prioritization/ Program prioritization homepage at Boise State University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Program prioritization is similar to [[program evaluation]] but differs in that it not only involves evaluating programs but also involves making financial decisions concerning program funding. Program prioritization can be a significant issue, having the potential to affect the lives and goals of both students and faculty.  This page deals with program prioritization in the context of [[higher education]], and it attempts to provide a basic description of what this entails.

==General description==

A school engaged in the process of prioritizing its programs may decide to either increase, decrease, continue, or discontinue the funding for particular programs, leading to these programs being either expanded, downsized, unchanged, or discontinued entirely. For example, in 2013, [[Western Carolina University]] announced that after a process of program prioritization it would discontinue several programs including a bachelor’s in [[Germans studies|German]], a minor in [[women’s studies]], as well master’s programs in [[music]], [[health sciences]], [[English studies|English]], and [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;"Belcher announces program cuts, 3 programs saved", News page, Western Carolinian University [http://www.westerncarolinian.com/news/belcher-announces-program-cuts-3-programs-saved-1.3048901#.Uw49fPldUuc]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Programs are generally prioritized on the basis of their student populations and potential to attract new students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indstate.edu/academicaffairs/program_prioritization.htm Program prioritization homepage, Indiana State University]&lt;/ref&gt; Though, other factors may also weigh in on the likelihood of a program being downsized or discontinued, such as its overall cost for the university.

==Causes==

Prioritization of programs and reallocation of funding are usually necessitated by the combination of two factors: 1) A school’s desire to develop and expand, and 2) limited funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/11/11/priorities "The Pressure to Prioritize", Inside Higher Ed]&lt;/ref&gt; If a school wants to grow and expand its programs, but doesn’t possess the resources to develop each program equally, prioritization may become necessary. Schools are under pressure to expand and therefore they are going to be under pressure to reallocate funding towards more successful programs.&lt;ref&gt;Dickeson, Robert C., 2010,"Prioritizing Academic Programs and Services: Reallocating Resources to Achieve Strategic Balance" [https://www.amazon.com/Prioritizing-Academic-Programs-Services-Reallocating/dp/0470559683]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since Wikipedia was a few years old, there have been numerous '''academic studies about Wikipedia''' in [[peer-reviewed]] publications. This research can be grouped into two categories. The first analyzed the production and reliability of the encyclopedia content, while the second investigated social aspects, such as usage and administration. Such studies are greatly facilitated by the fact that [[Wikipedia]]'s database can be downloaded without help from the site owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1145/1641309.1641326 |isbn=978-1-60558-730-1 |title=Measuring the wikisphere |first2=James |year=2009 |last2=Purtilo |author=S - tuckman, Jeff |journal=Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

===Production===

====A minority of editors produce the majority of persistent content====

}}&lt;/ref&gt; also mentioned in ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Nicholson |title=How I fell in love with Wikipedia |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/apr/10/wikipedia.internet |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2010-11-29 |date=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a team of six researchers from the [[University of Minnesota]] measured the relationship between editors' edit count and the editors' ability to convey their writings to Wikipedia readers, measured in terms of persistent word views (PWV)—the number of times a word introduced by an edit is viewed. The accounting method is best described using the author's own words: "each time an article is viewed, each of its words is also viewed. When a word written by editor X is viewed, he or she is credited with one PWV." The number of times an article was viewed was estimated from the web server logs.

The researchers analyzed 25 [[10^12|trillion]] PWVs attributable to registered users in the interval September 1, 2002 − October 31, 2006. At the end of this period, the top 10% of editors (by edit count) were credited with 86% of PWVs, the top 1% about 70%, and the top 0.1% (4200 users) were attributed 44% of PWVs, i.e. nearly half of Wikipedia's "value" as measured in this study. The top 10 editors (by PWV) contributed only 2.6% of PWVs, and only three of them were in top 50 by edit count. From the data, the study authors derived the following relationship:
{{quote|
Growth of PWV share increases [[Super-exponentiation|super-exponentially]] by edit count rank; in other words, elite editors (those who edit the most times) account for ''more'' value than they would [be attributed] given a [[power-law]] relationship.
}}

The study also analyzed the impact of [[Internet bot|bots]] on content. By edit count, bots dominate Wikipedia; 9 of the top 10 and 20 of the top 50 are bots. In contrast, in the PWV ranking only two bots appear in the top 50, and none in the top 10.

Based on the steady growth of the influence on those top 0.1% editors by PWV, the study concluded unequivocally:

{{quote|
... Frequent editors dominate what people see when they visit Wikipedia and ... this domination is increasing.
}}

====Work distribution and social strata====
{{further|Criticism of Wikipedia#Social stratification}}
A peer-reviewed paper noted the "[[social stratification]] in the Wikipedia society" due to the "admins class". The paper suggested that such stratification could be beneficial in some respects but recognized a "clear subsequent shift in power among levels of stratification" due to the "status and power differentials" between administrators and other editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~echi/papers/2007-CHI/2007-05-altCHI-Power-Wikipedia.pdf |date=2007-01-31 |title=Power of the Few vs. Wisdom of the Crowd: Wikipedia and the Rise of the Bourgeoisie |author=Chi, Ed |author2=Kittur, Aniket |author3=Pendleton, Bryan A. |author4=Suh, Bongwon |author5=Mytkowicz, Todd |last-author-amp=yes |work=Computer/Human Interaction 2007 Conference |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analyzing the entire edit history of Wikipedia up to July 2006, the same study determined that the influence of administrator edits on contents has steadily diminished since 2003, when administrators performed roughly 50% of total edits, to 2006 when only 10% of the edits were performed by administrators. This happened ''despite'' the fact that the average number of edits per administrator had increased more than fivefold during the same period. This phenomenon was labeled the "rise of the crowd" by the authors of the paper. An analysis that used as metric the number of words edited instead of the number of edit actions showed a similar pattern. Because the admin class is somewhat arbitrary with respect to the number of edits, the study also considered a breakdown of users in categories based on the number of edits performed. The results for "elite users", i.e. users with more than 10,000 edits, were somewhat in line with those obtained for administrators, except that "the number of words changed by elite users has kept up with the changes made by novice users, even though the number of edits made by novice users has grown proportionally faster". The elite users were attributed about 30% of the changes for 2006. The study concludes:

{{quote|
Thus though their influence may have waned in recent years, elite users appear to continue to contribute a sizeable portion of the work done in Wikipedia. Furthermore, ... edits made by elite users appear to be substantial in nature. ...
}}

===Reliability===
&lt;!-- TODO: a summary of the peer-reviewed papers in this area --&gt;
{{Main article|Reliability of Wikipedia}}

Jean Goodwin has assessed whether trust in Wikipedia is based on epistemic or pragmatic merits. While readers may not assess the actual knowledge and expertise of the authors of a given article, they may assess the contributors' passion for the project, and communicative design through which that passion is made manifest, and provide a reason for trust.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, Jean. (2010). The authority of Wikipedia. In Juho Ritola (Ed.), Argument cultures: Proceedings of the Ontario Society for the Study of Argumentation Conference. Windsor, ON, Canada: Ontario Society for the Study of Argumentation.CD-ROM.24 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geography===

Wikipedia articles cover about half a million places on Earth. However, research conducted by the Oxford Internet Institute has shown that the geographic distribution of articles is highly uneven. Most articles are written about North America, Europe, and East Asia, with very little coverage of large parts of the developing world, including most of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zerogeography.blogspot.com/2009/11/mapping-geographies-of-wikipedia.html |title=Mapping the Geographies of Wikipedia Content |author=Graham, Mark |work=Mark Graham: Blog |publisher=ZeroGeography |date=2009-11-12 |accessdate=2009-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208013500/http://zerogeography.blogspot.com/2009/11/mapping-geographies-of-wikipedia.html |archive-date=2009-12-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural language processing===

The textual content and the structured hierarchy of Wikipedia has become an important knowledge source for researchers in [[natural language processing]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. In 2007 researchers at [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]] developed a technique called Explicit Semantic Analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |citeseerx=10.1.1.76.9790 |title=Computing Semantic Relatedness using Wikipedia-based Explicit Semantic Analysis |first1=Evgeniy |last1=Gabrilovich |first2=Shaul |last2=Markovitch |year=2007 |pages=1606–1611 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc. |booktitle=Proceedings of IJCAI}}&lt;/ref&gt; which uses the world knowledge contained in Wikipedia articles. Conceptual representations of words and texts are created automatically and used to compute the similarity between words and texts.

Researchers at [[Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab]] use the linguistic and world knowledge encoded in Wikipedia and Wiktionary to automatically create linguistic knowledge bases which are similar to expert-built resources like [[WordNet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://atlas.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Publications/2008/lrec08_camera_ready.pdf |title=Extracting Lexical Semantic Knowledge from Wikipedia and Wiktionary |first1=Torsten |last1=Zesch |first2=Christoph |last2=Müller |first3=Iryna |last3=Gurevych |year=2008 |booktitle=Proceedings of the Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strube and Ponzetto created an algorithm to identify relationships among words by traversing Wikipedia via its categorization scheme, and concluded that Wikipedia had created "a taxonomy able to compete with WordNet on linguistic processing tasks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=WikiRelate! Computing semantic relatedness using Wikipedia psu.edu |author1=M Strube |author2=SP Ponzetto |publisher=Proceedings of the National Conference |year=2006 |url=http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-223.pdf |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of content fields==

===Health information===
{{main article|Health information on Wikipedia}}
Health information on Wikipedia is popularly accessed as results from [[search engines]] and [[Search engine result page]], which frequently deliver links to Wikipedia articles.&lt;ref name="laurent"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Laurent |first1=M. R. |last2=Vickers |first2=T.

The number and demographics of people who seek health information on Wikipedia, the scope of health information on Wikipedia, and the quality of the information on Wikipedia have been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heilman |first=JM |last2=Kemmann |first2=E |last3=Bonert |first3=M |last4=Chatterjee |first4=A |last5=Ragar |first5=B |last6=Beards |first6=GM |last7=Iberri |first7=DJ |last8=Harvey |first8=M |last9=Thomas |first9=B |last10=Stomp |first10=W |last11=Martone |first11=MF |last12=Lodge |first12=DJ |last13=Vondracek |first13=A |last14=de Wolff |first14=JF |last15=Liber |first15=C |last16=Grover |first16=SC |last17=Vickers |first17=TJ |last18=Meskó |first18=B |last19=Laurent |first19=MR |title=Wikipedia: a key tool for global public health promotion |url=http://www.jmir.org/2011/1/e14/ |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research |date=Jan 31, 2011 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=e14 |pmid=21282098 |doi=10.2196/jmir.1589 |pmc=3221335}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are drawbacks to using Wikipedia as a source of health information.

==Social aspects==

===Demographics===
A 2007 study by [[Hitwise]], reproduced in ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1614751,00.html |title=Who's Really Participating in Web 2.0 |author=Bill Tancer |publisher=''[[Time Magazine]]'' |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2007-04-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430011528/http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0%2C8599%2C1614751%2C00.html |archivedate=30 April 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that visitors to Wikipedia are almost equally split 50/50 male/female, but that 60% of edits are made by male editors.

[[WikiWarMonitor]] which is part of the [[European Commission]], [[CORDIS]] FP7 FET-Open supported project called ICTeCollective, have published:

in 2011 in [[IEEE Xplore]] "Edit wars in Wikipedia" for IEEE Third International Conference on Social Computing (SocialCom).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6113205&amp;url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6113205 |first1=R. |title=2011 IEEE Third Int'l Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2011 IEEE Third Int'l Conference on Social Computing |last1=Sumi |first2=T. |last2=Yasseri |first3=A. |last3=Rung |first4=A. |last4=Kornai |first5=J. |last5=Kertesz |date=1 October 2011 |publisher= |pages=724–727 |via=IEEE Xplore |doi=10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.47 |arxiv=1107.3689 |chapter=Edit Wars in Wikipedia |isbn=978-1-4577-1931-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 in ''[[PLoS ONE]]'', it reported that based on circadian activity pattern analysis, the shares of contributions to English Wikipedia, from North America and Europe are almost equal, whereas this increases to 75% of European contributions for the [[Simple English Wikipedia]]. The research also covers some other demographic analysis on the other editions in different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0038869 |pmid=22745683 |pmc=3380063 |volume=7 |issue=6 |title=Dynamics of Conflicts in Wikipedia |journal=PLoS ONE |pages=e38869 |arxiv=1202.3643 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...738869Y |year=2012 |last1=Yasseri |first1=Taha |last2=Sumi |first2=Robert |last3=Rung |first3=András |last4=Kornai |first4=András |last5=Kertész |first5=János}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 published as a book "The Most Controversial Topics in Wikipedia: A Multilingual and Geographical Analysis"; analysed the volume of editing of articles in various language versions of Wikipedia in order to establish the most controversial topics in different languages and groups of languages. For the English version, the top three most controversial articles were [[George W. Bush]], [[Anarchism]] and [[Muhammad]]. Topics in other languages causing most controversy were Croatia (German), Ségolène Royal (French), Chile (Spanish) and Homosexuality (Czech).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1305/1305.5566.pdf |title=The most controversial topics in Wikipedia: A multilingual and geographical analysis |author1=Yasseri T. |author2=Spoerri A. |author3=Graham M. |author4=Kertész J |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2014 |accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A descriptive study&lt;ref name=buttler07&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Butler |first1=Brian |last2=Joyce |first2=Elisabeth |last3=Pike |first3=Jacqueline |title=Don't look now, but we've created a bureaucracy |page=1101 |year=2008 |doi=10.1145/1357054.1357227 |journal=Proceedings of the Twenty-sixth Annual CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI '08 |isbn=978-1-60558-011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; that analyzed English language Wikipedia's policies and guidelines up to September 2007 identified a number of key statistics:

* 44 official policies
* 248 guidelines

Even a short policy like "ignore all rules" was found to have generated a lot of discussion and clarifications:

{{quote|
While the "Ignore all rules" policy itself is only sixteen words long, the page explaining what the policy means contains over 500 words, refers readers to seven other documents, has generated over 8,000 words of discussion, and has been changed over 100 times in less than a year.
}}

The study sampled the expansion of some key policies since their inception:
*[[Wikipedia:Ignore all rules]]: 3600% (including the additional document explaining it)
*[[Wikipedia:Consensus]]: 1557%
*[[Wikipedia:Copyrights]]: 938%
*[[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]]: 929%
*[[Wikipedia:Deletion policy]]: 580%
*[[Wikipedia:Civility]]: 124%

The number for "deletion" was considered inconclusive however because the policy was split in several sub-policies.

A 2007 joint peer-reviewed study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kriplean |first1=Travis |last2=Beschastnikh |first2=Ivan |last3=McDonald |first3=David W. |last4=Golder |first4=Scott A. |title=Community, consensus, coercion, control |page=167 |year=2007 |doi=10.1145/1316624.1316648 |journal=Proceedings of the 2007 International ACM Conference on Conference on Supporting Group Work - GROUP '07 |isbn=978-1-59593-845-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by researchers from the [[University of Washington]] and [[HP Labs]] examined how policies are employed and how contributors work towards consensus by quantitatively analyzing a sample of active talk pages. Using a November 2006 database dump, the study focused on 250 talk pages in the tail of the distribution: 0.3% of all talk pages, but containing 28.4% of all talk page revisions, and more significantly, containing 51.1% of all links to policies. From the sampled pages' histories, the study examined only the months with high activity, called critical sections—sets of consecutive months where both article and talk page revisions were significant in number.

The study defined and calculated a measure of policy prevalence. A critical section was considered ''policy-laden'' if its policy factor was at least twice the average. Articles were tagged with 3 [[indicator variable]]s:

* controversial
* featured
* policy-laden

All possible levels of these three factors yielded 8 sampling categories. The study intended to analyze 9 critical sections from each sampling category, but only 69 critical sections could be selected because only 6 articles (histories) were simultaneously featured, controversial, and policy laden.

The study found that policies were by no means consistently applied. Illustrative of its broader findings, the report presented the following two extracts from Wikipedia talk pages in obvious contrast:

* a discussion where participants decided that calculating a mean from data provided by a government agency constituted original research:

{{quote|
{{quotation|
is the mean...not considered original research? [U3]&lt;br/&gt;
It doesn't look like it to me, it looks like the original research was done by [Gov't agency] or am I missing something? [U4]&lt;br/&gt;
If the [Gov't agency] has not published the actual mean, us "calculating" it would be OR, no? I'm not sure. [U3]&lt;br/&gt;
No, why would it be? Extrapolating data from info already available is not OR. [U5]&lt;br/&gt;
From WP:NOR "articles may not contain any new analysis or synthesis of published arguments, concepts, data, ideas or statements that serves to advance a position." For what' worth... [U4]
}}
}}

* a discussion where logical deduction was used as counterargument for the original research policy:

{{quote|
{{quotation|
Your notion is WP:OR. I can easily provide. . . a scholarly article that says that anti-authoritarianism is not central to Panism. You are synthesizing all kinds of ideas here, based on your POV. [U6]&lt;br/&gt;
Simple deductive reasoning is not original research. Panism is inherently anti-authoritarian; therefore, an authoritarian economic system cannot be Panist. Which do you disagree with: the premise or the conclusion? [U7]
}}
}}

Claiming that such ambiguities easily give rise to power plays, the study identified, using the methods of [[grounded theory (Strauss)]]&lt;!-- do not "fix" this link; it is correct as it is written --&gt;, 7 types of power plays:

* article scope (what is off-topic in an article)
* prior consensus (past decisions presented as absolute and uncontested)
* power of interpretation (a sub-community claiming greater interpretive authority than another)
* legitimacy of contributor (his/her expertise)
* threat of sanction (blocking etc.)
* practice on other pages (other pages being considered models to follow)
* legitimacy of source (authority of references being disputed)

Due to lack of space, the study detailed only the first 4 types of power plays that were exercised by merely interpreting policy. A fifth power play category was analyzed; it consisted of blatant violations of policy that were forgiven because the contributor was valued for his contributions despite his lack of respect for rules.

====Article scope====
The study considers that Wikipedia's policies are ambiguous on scoping issues. The following [[scenario|vignette]] is used to illustrate the claim:

{{quote|
{{quotation|
... consensus is bullshit because I have the facts on my side. I also have the exhortation of Wikipedia to be bold... deleting a discussion of the Catholic church's... view of paleocentrism is not only inaccurate, but violates [[WP:NPOV]] ... .Deleting/emasculating it would violate several Wikipedia policies: NPOV, be bold... If you all want an article just on the scientific theory of paleocentrism, write one yourself. [U12]&lt;br/&gt;
We DID write an article just on the scientific theory of paleocentrism, before you showed up... You're obviously new here, [U12]... arguing based on your reading of NPOV and Be bold is a bit ridiculous, like a kid just out of high school arguing points of constitutional law. These things are principles that have an established meaning. People who have been here for years understand them much better than you do. They won't prove effective weapons for you to wield in this argument... [U13]&lt;br/&gt;
The social impact of "paleocentrism" is not "paleocentrism"... Wikipedia:wiki is not paper, we don't need to cram every tertiary aspect of the topic into the article proper, and we don't need to consider it incomplete when we don't ... [U14]&lt;br/&gt;
... the first thing the link Wikipedia:wiki is not paper says is:""Wikipedia "is" an encyclopedia."" A real encyclopedia like Encyclopædia Britannica has a fantastic section on paleocentrism, including all the social, political, and philosophical implications. [U12]&lt;br/&gt;
As discussed at Wikipedia:wiki is not paper, Wikipedia articles should give a brief overview of the centrally important aspects of a subject. To a biologist like yourself, the centrally aspect of paleocentrism certainly isn't its social implications, but to the rest of society it is. ... [U12]&lt;br/&gt;
... What you're talking about isn't "paleocentrism". Central issues to paleocentrism are periodic equilibrium, geomorphous undulation, airation. These are the issues that actually have to do with the process of paleocentrism itself. These "social aspects" you're talking about are "peripheral", "not central". They are "about" paleocentrism, they "surround" paleocentrism, but they "are not paleocentrism"... [U15]
}}
}}

The study gives the following interpretation for the heated debate:

{{quote|
Such struggles over article scope take place even in a hyper-linked environment because the title of an article matters. The "paleocentrism" article is more prestigious and also more likely to be encountered by a reader than an article entitled "the social effect of paleocentrism."
}}

====Prior consensus====
The study remarks that in Wikipedia consensus is never final, and what constitutes consensus can change at any time. The study finds that this temporal ambiguity is fertile ground for power plays, and places the generational struggle over consensus in larger picture of the struggle for article ownership:
{{quote|
In practice, ... there are often ''de facto'' owners of pages or coalitions of contributors that determine article content. Prior consensus within this group can be presented as incontestable, masking the power plays that may have gone into establishing a consensus. ... At issue is the legitimacy of prior consensus. Longtime contributors do not want to waste time having arguments
about issues that they consider to be solved. Pointing to prior consensus, just like linking to policies, provides a method
for dealing with trollish behavior. On the other hand, newcomers or fringe contributors often feel that their perspectives
were not represented in prior arguments and want to raise the issue again.
}}

The study uses the following discussion snippet to illustrate this continuous struggle:

{{quote|
{{quotation|
Most all the stuff [U17] describes below has already been hashed
out. . . It's like that game of whack-a-mole: they try one angle,
it gets refuted; they try a second angle, it gets refuted; they try
a third angle, it gets refuted; and then they try the first angle
again. [U18]&lt;br/&gt;
It would be interesting to see how many different users
try to contribute to this article and to expand the alternate
views only to be bullied away by those who believe in [Cosmic Polarity] religiously... why don't you consider that perhaps they have a point and that [U19], [U20] and the rest of you drive editors away from this article with your heavy-handed, admin-privileged POV push? [U21]
}}
}}

====Power of interpretation====
A vignette illustrated how administrators overrode consensus and deleted personal accounts of user/patients suffering from an anonimized illness (named Frupism in the study). The administrator's intervention happened as the article was being nominated to become as a featured article.

====Legitimacy of contributor====
This type of power play is illustrated by a contributor (U24) that draws on his past contributions to argue against another contributor who is accusing U24 of being unproductive and disruptive:

{{quote|
{{quotation|
Oh, you mean "I" hang around to make a point about the lack of quality on Wikipedia? Please take another look at my edit count!! LOL. I have over 7,000 edits... As you know, I can take credit for almost entirely writing from scratch 2 of the 6 or 7 FAs in philosophy... [U24]
}}
}}

====Explicit vie for ownership====
The study finds that there are contributors who consistently and successfully violate policy without sanction:

{{quote|
U24 makes several blatant "us or them" vies for power: if U25's actions persist, he will leave. ... Such actions clearly violate policies against article ownership, civility toward other contributors, and treatment of newcomers. As a newcomer, U25 may not know of these policies, but U26 certainly does. The willing blindness [of U26] stems from the fact that U24 is a valued contributor to philosophy articles and is not bashful about pointing this out. There is a scarcity of contributors with the commitment to consistently produce high-quality content; the Wikipedian community is willing to tolerate abuse and policy violations if valued work is being done.
...
{{quotation|
With all due respect, that didn't answer the question... I wanted to know what it was in U25's proposal which was unacceptable. . . His lack of reference etc. is all a fault, sure, but that's why I provided one (Enquiry, section 8). [U26]&lt;br/&gt;
... this point is already addressed in the article... It may need to be expanded a bit. I can easily do that myself when I have time... Is there anythin else? Do you also support U25's vie that the article is "poor", that is needs to overhauled from top to bottom, the meanignlsess nonsens that he actually did try to insert above or the other OR that he has stated on this page? Basically, there are two sides on this matter, this article can be taken over by cranks like what's his name, or not? If it does, I go. You can either support me or not. Where do you stand?... [U24]&lt;br/&gt;
I do not by any stretch of the imagination support the view that the article is poor. In fact, I disagree with many of the things U25 has said elsewhere on this page... I'm genuinely sorry if this upset you. [U26]

===Obtaining administratorship===

{{See also|Wikipedia administrators}}

Researchers from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] devised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burke |first1=Moira |last2=Kraut |first2=Robert |title=Taking up the mop |page=3441 |year=2008 |doi=10.1145/1358628.1358871 |journal=Proceedings of the Twenty-sixth Annual CHI Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI '08 |isbn=978-1-60558-012-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[probit model]] of editors who have successfully passed [[WP:Requests for adminship|the peer review process to become admins]]. Using only Wikipedia metadata, including the text of edit summaries, their model is 74.8% accurate in predicting successful candidates.

The paper observed that despite protestations to the contrary, "in many ways election to admin is a promotion, distinguishing an elite core group from the large mass of editors." Consequently, the paper used [[policy capture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stumpf |first1=S. A. |last2=London |first2=M. |year=1981 |title=Capturing rater policies in evaluating candidates for promotion |url=|journal=The Academy of Management Journal |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=752–766 |doi=10.2307/256174 |jstor=256174}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a method that compares nominally important attributes to those that actually lead to promotion in a work environment.

The overall success rate for promotion was 53%, dropping from 75% in 2005 to 42% in 2006 and 2007. This sudden increase in failure rate was attributed to a higher standard that recently promoted administrators had to meet, and supported by anecdotal evidence from another recent study&lt;ref&gt;Forte, A., and Bruckman, A. Scaling consensus: Increasing decentralization in Wikipedia governance. Proc. HICSS 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; quoting some early admins who have expressed doubt that they would pass muster if their election (RfA) were held recently. In light of these developments the study argued that:

Contrary to expectations perhaps, "running" for administrator multiple times is detrimental to the candidate's chance of success. Each subsequent attempt has a 14.8% lower chance of success than the previous one. Length of participation in the project makes only a small contribution to the chance of a successful RfA.

Another significant finding of the paper is that one Wikipedia policy edit or WikiProject edit is worth ten article edits. A related observation is that candidates with experience in multiple areas of the site stood better chance of election. This was measured by the '''diversity score''', a simple count of the number of areas that the editor has participated in. The paper divided Wikipedia in 16 areas: article, article talk, articles/categories/templates for deletion (XfD), (un)deletion review, etc. (see paper for full list). For instance, a user who has edited articles, her own user page, and posted once at (un)deletion review would have a diversity score of 3. Making a single edit in any additional region of Wikipedia correlated with a 2.8% increased likelihood of success in gaining administratorship.

Making minor edits also helped, although the study authors consider that this may be so because minor edits correlate with experience. In contrast, each edit to an Arbitration or Mediation committee page, or a Wikiquette notice, all of which are venues for dispute resolution, decreases the likelihood of success by 0.1%. Posting messages to administrator noticeboards had a similarly deleterious effect. The study interpreted this as evidence that editors involved in escalating or protracted conflicts lower their chances of becoming administrators.

Saying "thanks" or variations thereof in edit summaries, and pointing out point of view ("POV") issues (also only in edit summaries because the study only analyzed metadata) were of minor benefit, contributing to 0.3% and 0.1% to candidate's chances in 2006–2007, but did not reach statistical significance before.

A few factors that were found to be irrelevant or marginal at best:
* Editing user pages (including one's own) does not help. Somewhat surprisingly, user talk page edits also do not affect the likelihood of administratorship.
* Welcoming newcomers or saying "please" in edit summaries had no effect.
* Participating in consensus-building, such as RfA votes or the village pump, does not increase the likelihood of becoming admin. The study admits however that participation in consensus was measured quantitatively but not qualitatively.
* Vandal-fighting as measured by the number of edits to the vandalism noticeboard had no effect. Every thousand edits containing variations of "revert" was positively correlated (7%) with adminship for 2006–2007, but did not attain statistical significance unless one is willing to lower the threshold to p&lt;.1). More confusingly, before 2006 the number of reverts was negatively correlated (-6.8%) with adminship success, against without attaining statistical significance even at p&lt;.1. This may be because of the introduction of a policy known as "3RR" in 2006 to reduce reverts.&lt;ref&gt;[[WP:3RR]] and [[WP:EW]], policies which prevent repetitive reverting.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study suggests that some of the 25% unexplained variability in outcomes may be due to factors that were not measured, such as quality of edits or participation in off-site coordination, such as the (explicitly cited) secret mailing list reported in ''[[The Register]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Metz |first=Cade |title=Secret mailing list rocks Wikipedia |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/12/04/wikipedia_secret_mailing |publisher=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper concludes:

{{quote|
Merely performing a lot of production work is insufficient for "promotion" in Wikipedia. Candidates' article edits were
weak predictors of success. They also have to demonstrate more managerial behavior. Diverse experience and contributions to the development of policies and WikiProjects were stronger predictors of RfA success. This is consistent with the findings that Wikipedia is a bureaucracy&lt;ref name=buttler07/&gt; and that coordination work has increased substantially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kittur, Aniket |author2=Suh, Bongwon |author3=Pendleton, Bryan A. |author4=Chi, Ed H. |year=2007 |title=He says, she says: conflict and coordination in Wikipedia |journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing |pages=453–462 |doi=10.1145/1240624.1240698 |isbn=978-1-59593-593-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Viegas, Fernanda B. |author2=Wattenberg, Martin |author3=Kriss, Jesse |author4=van Ham, Frank |year=2007 |title=Talk Before You Type: Coordination in Wikipedia |journal=40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences |pages=575–582 |doi=10.1109/HICSS.2007.511 |citeseerx=10.1.1.210.1057}}&lt;/ref&gt; ... Participation in Wikipedia policy and WikiProjects was not predictive of adminship prior to 2006, suggesting the community as a whole is beginning to prioritize policymaking and organization experience over simple article-level coordination.

'''Accredited Symbian Developer''' ('''ASD''') was an (now defunct) accreditation program for [[software developer]]s using [[Symbian OS]], a mobile phone operating system, having been terminated in April 2011 after the closure of the [[Symbian Foundation]]. The scheme was operated independently on the Foundation's behalf by Majinate Limited, which also closed for business when the Foundation closed.

==Qualifications required==

The primary qualification for being [[Professional certification|accredited]] as an ASD was a pass in an on-line multiple choice examination that adhered to the Principles of Symbian OS curriculum. This curriculum was reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that the accreditation kept up to date with developments in the Symbian operating system. The final release of the curriculum was made in 2009 although it still adhered closely to the ASD Primer, a learning aid published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] under the Symbian Press imprint.

==Curriculum==

The final version of the curriculum contained the following major topics:

* [[C++|C++ Language]] Fundamentals
* [[Class (computer science)|Classes]] And [[Object (computer science)|Objects]]
* Class Design And [[Inheritance (computer science)|Inheritance]]
* Symbian OS Types &amp; Declarations
* Cleanup Stack
* Object Construction
* Descriptors
* [[Dynamic array|Dynamic Arrays]]
* Active Objects
* System Structure
* Client Server
* File Server, Store &amp; Streams
* [[Internet socket|Sockets]]
* Tool Chain
* Platform Security
* [[Binary compatibility|Binary Compatibility]]

Each topic was assessed and marked separately in the examination and a pass required both a high score and coverage of the majority of topics.

'''ActivePresenter''' is a [[screencasting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teknobites.com/2009/08/24/best-sites-and-applications-for-screencasting|title=Best Sites and Applications for Screencasting • Technology Bites|date=24 August 2009|website=teknobites.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[eLearning]] software for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[OS X|Mac OS X]] which can be used to create software demonstrations, software simulations, and quizzes. It allows exporting to a series of images, [[HTML]] slideshows, documents ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]), [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] presentations, videos ([[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]], [[MP4]], [[WMV]], [[WebM]]), [[Flash video]]s and interactive simulations ([[HTML5]], [[Adobe Flash]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atomisystems.com/activepresenter/features-comparison/|title=ActivePresenter Feature Comparison - Atomi Systems, Inc.|website=atomisystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For eLearning, ActivePresenter can pack exported materials into [[SCORM]] or [[Experience API (Tin Can API)|xAPI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecoachingsoftware.com/scorm_tools.html|title=Tools for creation SCORM compliant content for elearning solutions|website=thecoachingsoftware.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iscorm.cn/post/586.html |title=Tools for creating SCORM content |access-date=2011-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826222538/http://www.iscorm.cn/post/586.html |archive-date=2014-08-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For software simulations, it can use mouse hovers, left or right mouse clicks, and key presses with [[modifier key]]s.

ActivePresenter can also be used to convert Microsoft PowerPoint presentations to one of its output formats though lacking some animations and effects as well as convert between several video formats indirectly.

== History ==
ActivePresenter has been developed by Atomi Systems Inc. since 2007. Version 1.0 was released in October 2008 and became available in online market six months later with three editions, including free of charge edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atomisystems.com/news/activepresenter-goes-online/|title=ActivePresenter goes online - Atomi Systems, Inc.|date=29 April 2009|website=atomisystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions ==
Three editions are available at different prices, each having the capabilities of lower ones, plus added features.
The features of the various editions are compared in a table on the ActivePresenter Web site.&lt;ref name=compare&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atomisystems.com/activepresenter/features-comparison/|title=ActivePresenter Feature Comparison - Atomi Systems, Inc.|website=atomisystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free Edition ===
This edition is free of charge (freeware). It has most ActivePresenter features, but unrestricted export is limited to JPEG and PNG images, and WMV, AVI, MPEG4, WebM video formats, and SCORM.&lt;ref name=compare/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atomisystems.com/activepresenter/free-edition/|title=Free screen recorder - screencast software for Windows &amp; macOS|website=atomisystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other output formats are supported to demonstrate features, but an obtrusive watermark is added to output, and even with watermark it may not be used for any other purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atomisystems.com/community/75/using-the-free-edition-in-commercial-websites Discussion on Atomi Systems Web site.] Company moderator says: "The difference between editions is just available output format, forbidden output format will have a watermark and can only be used for feature demonstration and not for any other purposes (neither commercial nor non-commercial)."&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-2012 versions added watermarks to all exported output.&lt;ref&gt;From 22 January 2012 the ActivePresenter website (available via [[Wayback machine]]) announced "NO WATERMARK". Earlier versions did watermark exports.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standard Edition ===
This edition additionally allows exporting to series of images, videos, flash videos and documents.&lt;ref name=compare/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atomisystems.com/activepresenter/standard-edition/|title=Standard Edition - Atomi Systems, Inc.|website=atomisystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; User can also export to Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, or HTML5 simulations with watermark on them.

The '''Age of Interruption''' refers to a seeming increase in fractured attention due to media tools and virtual [[multitasking]]. The term was popularized by [[Thomas Friedman]] in a 2006 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' opinion editorial.

== Origin of term ==
Friedman deemed the age of "malady of modernity", and characterized it as reflecting [[information overload]] and lack of adequate attention span:

"Continuous partial attention is when you are on the Internet or cellphone or BlackBerry while also watching TV, typing on your computer and answering a question from your kid. That is, you are multitasking your way through the day, continuously devoting only partial attention to each act or person you encounter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Thomas|title=The Age of Interruption|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/opinion/05friedman.html?_r=0|work=New York Times|date=5 July 2006|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology and education ==
Characterized by information overload and multitasking, the age of interruption is a relatively recent but still frequently studied topic in education and technology disciplines. Educators and technology researchers study the phenomenon in relation to its effects on social, cognitive and emotional development. Ellen Rose, a professor of education at [[University of New Brunswick]] in [[Canada]], studies online learning environments, with particular expertise in social effects of technology and [[media ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Work of Ellen Rose| url=https://www.unb.ca/fredericton/education/people/ellenrose.html|publisher=University of New Brunswick|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 academic article, she posits that the Age of Interruption is another age in technological formation, following the Information Age. She discusses the Age of Interruption in relation to younger generations ([[digital native]]s) who have an over-abundance of information along with a general attitude of inattention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bassendowski |first=Sandra |title=The Age of Interruption |url=http://cjni.ca/journal/?p=1897 |journal=Canadian Journal of Nursing Infomatics |date=April 2012 |volume=6 |issue=4 |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, other researchers find a more optimistic view of technology's relationship to multitasking. In ''Media as Extensions'', Lin (2009) determined that the hyperlinked structure of information on the web may promote learning and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lin|first=Lin|title=Breadth-biased versus focused cognitive control in media multitasking behaviors|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=September 2009|volume=106|issue=37|pages=15521–15522|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15521.full|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=14 December 2012|doi=10.1073/pnas.0908642106|pmid=19805207|pmc=2747151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Anarchism]]''' has had a special interest on the issue of '''[[education]]''' from the works of [[William Godwin]]&lt;ref name="infed.org"&gt;[http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-good.htm "william godwin and informal education" by infed]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Stirner]]&lt;ref name="tmh.floonet.net"&gt;[http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html Introduction to ''[[The False Principle of our Education]]' by [[Max Stirner]] by James J. Martin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515103317/http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html |date=May 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; onwards.

A wide diversity of issues related to education have gained the attention of anarchist theorists and activists. They have included the role of education in [[social control]] and [[socialization]], the rights and liberties of youth and children within educational contexts, the inequalities encouraged by current educational systems, the influence of state and religious [[ideologies]] in the education of people, the division between social and manual work and its relationship with education, [[sex education]] and [[art education]].

Various alternatives to contemporary mainstream educational systems and their problems have been proposed by anarchists which have gone from [[alternative education]] systems and environments, [[self-education]], advocacy of [[Youth rights|youth]] and [[children rights]], and [[freethought]] activism.

==Early anarchist views on education==

===William Godwin===
[[File:WilliamGodwin.jpg|180px|left|thumb|[[William Godwin]]]]For English [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] anarchist [[William Godwin]] education was "the main means by which change would be achieved."&lt;ref name="infed.org"/&gt; Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness.&lt;ref name="infed.org"/&gt; For Godwin, education had to have "A respect for the child’s autonomy which precluded any form of coercion", "A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child’s own motivation and initiatives" and "A concern about the child’s capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school."&lt;ref name="infed.org"/&gt;

In his ''[[Political Justice]]'' he criticizes state sponsored schooling "on account of its obvious alliance with national government".&lt;ref name="web.bilkent.edu.tr"&gt;[http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pj68.html [[Political Justice]] by [[William Godwin]]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902020059/http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pj68.html |date=September 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For him the State "will not fail to employ it to strengthen its hands, and perpetuate its institutions.".&lt;ref name="web.bilkent.edu.tr"/&gt; He thought "It is not true that our youth ought to be instructed to venerate the constitution, however excellent; they should be instructed to venerate truth; and the constitution only so far as it corresponded with their independent deductions of truth.".&lt;ref name="web.bilkent.edu.tr"/&gt; A long work on the subject of education to consider is ''The Enquirer.  Reflections On Education, Manners, And Literature.  In A Series Of Essays.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/godwin/enquirer.html ''The Enquirer.  Reflections On Education, Manners, And Literature.  In A Series Of Essays.'' by [[William Godwin]]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302000916/http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/godwin/enquirer.html |date=March 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Max Stirner===
[[File:Stirner-kar1900.jpg|180px|right|thumb|[[Max Stirner]]]][[Max Stirner]] was a German philosopher linked mainly with the anarchist school of thought known as [[individualist anarchism]] who worked as a schoolteacher in a [[gym]]nasium for young girls.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', volume 8, The Macmillan Company and The Free Press, New York 1967&lt;/ref&gt; He examines the subject of education directly in his long essay ''[[The False Principle of our Education]]''. In it "we discern his persistent pursuit of the goal of individual self-awareness and his insistence on the centering of everything around the individual personality".&lt;ref name="tmh.floonet.net"/&gt; As such Stirner "in education, all of the given material has value only in so far as children learn to do something with it, to use it".&lt;ref name="tmh.floonet.net"/&gt; In that essay he deals with the debates between realist and humanistic educational  commentators and sees that both "are concerned with the learner as an object, someone to be acted upon rather than one encouraged to move toward subjective self-realization and liberation" and sees that "a knowledge which only burdens me as a belonging and a possession, instead of having gone along with me completely so that the free-moving ego, not encumbered by any dragging possessions, passes through the world with a fresh spirit, such a knowledge then, which has not become personal, furnishes a poor preparation for life".&lt;ref name="tmh.floonet.net"/&gt;

He concludes this essay by saying that "the necessary decline of non-voluntary learning and rise of the self-assured will which perfects itself in the glorious sunlight of the free person may be expressed somewhat as follows: knowledge must die and rise again as will and create itself anew each day as a free person.".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html [[The False Principle of our Education]]' by [[Max Stirner]]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515103317/http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html |date=May 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner thus saw education "is to be life and there, as outside of it, the self-revelation of the individual is to be the task."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For him "pedagogy should not proceed any further towards civilizing, but toward the development of free men, sovereign characters".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==The classics and the late 19th century==

===Mikhail Bakunin===
On "Equal Opportunity in Education"&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Michail_Bakunin__Equal_Opportunity_in_Education.html "Equal Opportunity in Education" by [[Mikhail Bakunin]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Russian anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] denounced what he saw as the social inequalities caused by the current educational systems. He put this issue in this way "will it be feasible for the working masses to know complete emancipation as long as the education available to those masses continues to be inferior to that bestowed upon the bourgeois, or, in more general terms, as long as there exists any class, be it numerous or otherwise, which, by virtue of birth, is entitled to a superior education and a more complete instruction? Does not the question answer itself?..."&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt;

He also denounced that "Consequently while some study others must labour so that they can produce what we need to live — not just producing for their own needs, but also for those men who devote themselves exclusively to intellectual pursuits.&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt; As a solution to this Bakunin proposed that "Our answer to that is a simple one: everyone must work and everyone must receive education...for work's sake as much as for the sake of science, there must no longer be this division into workers and scholars and henceforth there must be only men. "&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt;
[[File:Bakunin2.jpg|180px|right|thumb|180px|[[Mikhail Bakunin]]]]

===Peter Kropotkin===
[[File:Young Kropotkin.png|180px|left|thumb|180px|[[Peter Kropotkin]]]]Russian [[anarcho-communist]] theorist [[Peter Kropotkin]] suggested in "Brain Work and Manual Work" that "The masses of the workmen do not receive more scientific education than their grandfathers did; but they have been deprived of the education of even the small workshop, while their boys and girls are driven into a mine, or a factory, from the age of thirteen, and there they soon forget the little they may have learned at school. As to the scientists, they despise manual labour."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Brain_Work_and_Manual_Work.html "Brain Work and Manual Work" by [[Peter Kropotkin]]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Fields__Factories_and_Workshops__or_Industry_Combined_with_Agriculture_and_Brain_Work_with_Manual_Work.html ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops|Fields, Factories and Workshops: or Industry Combined with Agriculture and Brain Work with Manual Work]]'' by [[Peter Kropotkin]]]&lt;/ref&gt; So for Kropotkin "We fully recognise the necessity of specialisation of knowledge, but we maintain that specialisation must follow general education, and that general education must be given in science and handicraft alike. To the division of society into brainworkers and manual workers we oppose the combination of both kinds of activities; and instead of `technical education,' which means the maintenance of the present division between brain work and manual work, we advocate the éducation intégrale, or complete education, which means the disappearance of that pernicious distinction."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==The Early 20th century==

===Leo Tolstoy===
[[File:L.N.Tolstoy Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Leo Tolstoy]], influential [[christian anarchist]] and [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho pacifist]] theorist]]The Russian [[christian anarchist]] and famous novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] established a school for peasant children on his estate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Matt_Hern__The_Emergence_of_Compulsory_Schooling_and_Anarchist_Resistance.html "The Emergence of Compulsory Schooling and Anarchist Resistance" by Matt Hern]&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy returned to Yasnaya Polyana and founded thirteen schools for his serfs' children, based on the principles Tolstoy described in his 1862 essay "The School at Yasnaya Polyana".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tolstoy | first = Lev N. |author2=Leo Wiener |author3=translator and editor  | title = The School at Yasnaya Polyana - The Complete Works of Count Tolstoy: Pedagogical Articles.

Tolstoy differentiated between education and culture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; He wrote that "Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself... Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; For him "without compulsion, education was transformed into culture".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia and the Modern schools===
{{main|Escuela Moderna}}
[[File:Francisco Ferrer Guardia.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]], [[Catalan people|Catalan]] anarchist pedagogue]]In 1901, [[Catalan people|Catalan]] anarchist and [[Freethought|free-thinker]] [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established "modern" or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Fidler"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Geoffrey C.

Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html Francisco Ferrer's Modern School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807032003/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |date=2010-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Bookchin]] wrote: "This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally."&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 7, ''[[anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchosyndicalism]], The New Ferment''. In Murray Bookchin, ''[[The Spanish Anarchists: The Heroic Years, 1868–1936]]''. AK Press, 1998, p.115. {{ISBN|1-873176-04-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of ''[[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]]'' in the [[United States]],&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt; [[Cuba]], [[South America]] and [[London]]. The first of these was started in [[New York City]] in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901.

Ferrer wrote an extensive work on education and on his educational experiments called ''The Origin and Ideals of the Modern School''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Francisco_Ferrer__The_Origin_and_Ideals_of_the_Modern_School.html#toc8 [[Francisco Ferrer]]. ''The Origin and Ideals of the Modern School'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Modern School movement in the United States ====
{{main|Modern School (United States)}}
[[Image:The Modern School in New York City, circa 1911-12.jpg|thumb|190px|right|The NYC Modern School, ca. 1911–1912, Principal Will Durant and pupils. This photograph was the cover of the first issue of ''The Modern School'' magazine.]]The Modern Schools, also called Ferrer Schools, were [[United States]] [[school]]s, established in the early twentieth century, that were modeled after the [[Escuela Moderna]] of [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]], the Catalan educator and [[anarchism|anarchist]]. They were an important part of the anarchist, [[Anarchistic free school|free schooling]], [[socialism|socialist]], and [[labor movement]]s in the U.S., intended to educate the working-classes from a [[secular]], [[class-conscious]] perspective. The Modern Schools imparted day-time academic classes for children, and night-time continuing-education lectures for adults.

The first, and most notable, of the Modern Schools was founded in New York City, in 1911, two years after Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia's execution for [[sedition]] in monarchist Spain on 18 October 1909. Commonly called the Ferrer Center, it was founded by notable anarchists — including [[Leonard Dalton Abbott|Leonard Abbott]], [[Alexander Berkman]], [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], and [[Emma Goldman]] — first meeting on [[St. Mark's Place]], in Manhattan's [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], but twice moved elsewhere, first within lower Manhattan, then to [[Harlem]]. The Ferrer Center opened with only nine students, one being the son of [[Margaret Sanger]], the [[contraceptives]]-rights activist. Starting in 1912, the school's principal was the philosopher [[Will Durant]], who also taught there. Besides Berkman and Goldman, the Ferrer Center faculty included the [[Ashcan School]] painters [[Robert Henri]] and [[George Bellows]], and its guest lecturers included writers and political activists such as Margaret Sanger, [[Jack London]], and [[Upton Sinclair]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]], ''[[The Modern School Movement]]'', AK Press (2005), p.212: At the Ferrer Center, Berkman was called “The Pope”, Goldman was called “The Red Queen”.&lt;/ref&gt; Student Magda Schoenwetter, recalled that the school used [[Montessori]] methods and equipment, and emphasised academic freedom rather than fixed subjects, such as spelling and arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''[[Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America]]'', “Interview with Magda Schoenwetter”, AK Press (2005), {{ISBN|1-904859-27-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-904859-27-7}}, p.230: “What everybody is yowling about now — freedom in education — we had then, though I still can’t spell or do multiplication.”&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Modern School'' magazine originally began as a newsletter for parents, when the school was in New York City, printed with the manual [[printing press]] used in teaching printing as a profession. After moving to the Stelton Colony, New Jersey, the magazine's content expanded to poetry, prose, art, and libertarian education articles; the cover emblem and interior graphics were designed by [[Rockwell Kent]]. Artists and writers, among them [[Hart Crane]] and [[Wallace Stevens]], praised ''The Modern School'' as “the most beautifully printed magazine in existence.”

After the 4 July 1914 [[Lexington Avenue bombing]], the police investigated and several times raided the Ferrer Center and other labor and anarchist organisations in New York City.&lt;ref name=Avrich&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''The Modern School Movement''. Princeton: Princeton University Press (1980); Avrich, Paul, ''[[Anarchist Portraits]]'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-00609-1}} (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging the urban danger to their school, the organizers bought 68 acres (275,000 m²) in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey]], and moved there in 1914, becoming the center of the Stelton Colony. Moreover, beyond New York City, the [[Ferrer Colony and Modern School]] was founded (ca. 1910–1915) as a Modern School-based community, that endured some forty years. In 1933, James and Nellie Dick, who earlier had been principals of the Stelton Modern School, founded the Modern School in [[Lakewood, New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=Avrich/&gt; which survived the original Modern School, the Ferrer Center, becoming the final surviving such school, lasting until 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationrevolution.org/aerogramme11.html AERO-GRAMME #11: The Alternative Education Resource Organization Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929213939/http://www.educationrevolution.org/aerogramme11.html |date=2011-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emma Goldman ===
[[File:Emma Goldman 2.jpg|180px|left|thumb|[[Emma Goldman]]]]In an essay entitled "The child and its enemies" [[Lithuanian American|Lithuanian-American]] [[anarcha-feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]] manifested that "The child shows its individual tendencies in its plays, in its questions, in its association with people and things. But it has to struggle with everlasting external interference in its world of thought and emotion. It must not express itself in harmony with its nature, with its growing personality. It must become a thing, an object. Its questions are met with narrow, conventional, ridiculous replies, mostly based on falsehoods; and, when, with large, wondering, innocent eyes, it wishes to behold the wonders of the world, those about it quickly lock the windows and doors, and keep the delicate human plant in a hothouse atmosphere, where it can neither breathe nor grow freely."&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Emma_Goldman__The_Child_and_its_enemies.html [[Emma Goldman]]. "The Child and its enemies."]&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman in the essay entitled "The Social Importance of the Modern School" saw that "the school of today, no matter whether public, private, or parochial...is for the child what the prison is for the convict and the barracks for the soldier — a place where everything is being used to break the will of the child, and then to pound, knead, and shape it into a being utterly foreign to itself."&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Emma_Goldman__The_Social_Importance_of_the_Modern_School.html [[Emma Goldman]]. "The Social Importance of the Modern School"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way "it will be necessary to realize that education of children is not synonymous with herdlike drilling and training. If education should really mean anything at all, it must insist upon the free growth and development of the innate forces and tendencies of the child. In this way alone can we hope for the free individual and eventually also for a free community, which shall make interference and coercion of human growth impossible."&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

Goldman in her essay on the Modern School also dealt with the issue of [[Sex education]]. She denounced that "educators also know the evil and sinister results of ignorance in sex matters. Yet, they have neither understanding nor humanity enough to break down the wall which puritanism has built around sex...If in childhood both man and woman were taught a beautiful comradeship, it would neutralize the oversexed condition of both and would help woman's emancipation much more than all the laws upon the statute books and her right to vote."&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

==Later 20th century and contemporary times==
{{main|Anarchistic free school|Deschooling Society|Unschooling}}
Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Purkis | first = Jon | title = Changing Anarchism | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-7190-6694-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent (2010) ''Modern Political Ideologies'', 3rd edition, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell p.129&lt;/ref&gt; British anarchists [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]] manifested that "A.S. Neill is the modern pioneer of libertarian education and of “hearts not heads in the school”. Although he has denied being an anarchist, it would be hard to know how else to describe his philosophy, though he is correct in recognising the difference between revolution in philosophy and pedagogy, and the revolutionary change of society. They are associated but not the same thing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/stuart-christie-albert-meltzer-the-floodgates-of-anarchy [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]]. ''The Floodgates of Anarchy'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, although Summerhill and other [[Democratic education|free schools]] are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political [[class struggle]]-approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Judith |last=Suissa |url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1288/anarchy-in-the-classroom|title= Anarchy in the classroom |journal=[[The New Humanist]] |volume=120 |issue=5 |date=September–October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Herbert Read ===
The English anarchist philosopher, art critic and poet, [[Herbert Read]] developed a strong interest in the subject of education and particularly in [[art education]]. Read's anarchism was influenced by [[William Godwin]], [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Max Stirner]]. Read "became deeply interested in children’s drawings and paintings after having been invited to collect works for an exhibition of British art that would tour allied and neutral countries during the Second World War. As it was considered too risky to transport across the Atlantic works of established importance to the national heritage, it was proposed that children’s drawings and paintings should be sent instead. Read, in making his collection, was unexpectedly moved by the expressive power and emotional content of some of the younger artist’s works. The experience prompted his special attention to their cultural value, and his engagement of the theory of children’s creativity with seriousness matching his devotion to the avant-garde. This work both changed fundamentally his own life’s work throughout his remaining twenty-five years and provided art education with a rationale of unprecedented lucidity and persuasiveness. Key books and pamphlets resulted: ''Education through Art'' (Read, 1943); ''The Education of Free Men'' (Read, 1944); ''Culture and Education in a World Order'' (Read, 1948); ''The Grass Read'', (1955); and ''Redemption of the Robot'' (1970)".&lt;ref name="ibe.unesco.org"&gt;[http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/archive/publications/ThinkersPdf/reade.pdf David Thistlewood. "HERBERT READ (1893–1968)"  in ''PROSPECTS: the quarterly review of comparative education''. Paris, UNESCO: International Bureau of Education, vol. 24, no.1/2, 1994, p. 375–90]&lt;/ref&gt;

Read "elaborated a socio-cultural dimension of creative education, offering the notion of greater international understanding and cohesiveness rooted in principles of developing the fully balanced personality through art education. Read argued in Education through Art that "every child, is said to be a potential neurotic capable of being saved from this prospect, if early, largely inborn, creative abilities were not repressed by conventional Education. Everyone is an artist of some kind whose special abilities, even if almost insignificant, must be encouraged as contributing to an infinite richness of collective life. Read’s newly expressed view of an essential ‘continuity’ of
child and adult creativity in everyone represented a  synthesis' the two opposed models of twentieth-century art education that had predominated until this point...Read did not offer a curriculum but a theoretical defence of the genuine and true. His claims for genuineness and truth were based on the overwhelming evidence of characteristics revealed in his study of child art...From 1946 until his death in 1968 he was president of the Society for Education in Art (SEA), the renamed ATG, in which capacity he had a platform for addressing [[UNESCO]]...On the basis of such representation Read, with others, succeeded in establishing the International Society for Education through Art (INSEA)
as an executive arm of UNESCO in 1954."&lt;ref name="ibe.unesco.org"/&gt;"

===Paul Goodman===
[[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]] was an important anarchist critic of contemporary educational systems as can be seen in his books  ''[[Growing Up Absurd]]'' and ''[[Compulsory Mis-education]]''. Goodman believed that in contemporary societies "It is in the schools and from the mass media, rather than at home or from their friends, that the mass of our citizens in all classes learn that life is inevitably routine, depersonalized, venally graded; that it is best to toe the mark and shut up; that there is no place for spontaneity, open sexuality and free spirit. Trained in the schools they go on to the same quality of jobs, culture and politics. This is education, miseducation socializing to the national norms and regimenting to the nation's "needs" "&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;[http://mises.org/journals/jls/2_4/2_4_7.pdf ROBERT H. CHAPPELL. ANARCHY REVISITED: AN INQUIRY INTO THE PUBLIC EDUCATION DILEMMA. Journal of Libertarian Studies Vol. 2, No.4, pp 357-372 Pergamon Press. 1978.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Paul Goodman.jpg|180px|left|thumb|[[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], american anarchist writer of ''[[Growing Up Absurd|Growing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized Society]]'']] --&gt;
Goodman thought that a person's most valuable educational experiences "occur outside the school. Participation in the activities of society should be the chief means of learning. Instead of requiring students to succumb to the theoretical drudgery of textbook learning, Goodman recommends that education be transferred into  factories, museums, parks, department stores, etc, where the students can actively participate in their education...The ideal schools would take the form of small discussion groups of no more than twenty individuals. As has been indicated, these groups would utilize any effective environment that would be relevant to the interest of the group. Such education would be necessarily non-compulsory, for any compulsion to attend places authority in an external body disassociated from the needs and aspirations of the students. Moreover, compulsion retards and impedes the students' ability to learn."&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt; As far as the current educational system Goodman thought that "The basic intention behind the compulsory attendance laws is not only to insure the socialization process but also to control the labour supply quantitatively within an industrialized economy characterized by unemployment and inflation. The public schools and universities have become large holding tanks of potential workers."&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt;

===Ivan Illich===
The term [[deschooling]] was popularized by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Illich| first=Ivan |title=Deschooling Society |place= New York|publisher= Harper and Row| year= 1971| isbn= 0-06-012139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illich thought that "the dismantling of the public education system would coincide with a pervasive abolition of all the suppressive institutions of society".&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt; Illich "charges public schooling with institutionalizing acceptable moral and behavioral standards and with constitutionally violating the [[Youth rights|rights of young adults]]...IIlich subscribes to Goodman's belief that most
of the useful education that people acquire is a by-product of work or leisure and not of the school. Illich refers to this process as "informal education". Only through this unrestricted and unregulated form of learning can the individual
gain a sense of self-awareness and develop his creative capacity to its fullest extent.".&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt; Illich thought that the main goals of an alternative education systems should be "to provide access to available resources to all who want to learn: to empower
all who want to share what they know; to find those who want to learn it from them; to furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their challenges known. The system of learning webs is aimed at individual freedom and expression in education by using society as the classroom. There would be reference services to index items available for study in laboratories, theatres, airports, libraries, etc.; skill exchanges which would permit people to list their skills so that potential students could contact them; peer-matching, which would communicate an individual's interest so that he or she could find educational associates; reference services to educators at large, which would be a central directory of professionals, para professionals and freelancers.".&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt;

=== Colin Ward ===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:Colin Ward.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Colin Ward in his workroom, October 2003]] --&gt;[[Anarchism in England|English anarchist]] [[Colin Ward]] in his main theoretical publication ''[[Anarchy in Action]]'' (1973) in a chapter called "Schools No Longer" "discusses the genealogy of education and schooling, in particular examining the writings of [[Everett Reimer]] and Ivan Illich, and the beliefs of anarchist educator Paul Goodman.  Many of Colin’s writings in the 1970s, in particular ''Streetwork: The Exploding School'' (1973, with Anthony Fyson), focused on learning practices and spaces outside of the school building. In introducing ''Streetwork'', Ward writes, “[this] is a book about ideas: ideas of the environment as the educational resource, ideas of the enquiring school, the school without walls…”.  In the same year, Ward contributed to ''Education Without Schools'' (edited by Peter Buckman) discussing ‘the role of the state’.  He argued that “one significant role of the state in the national education systems of the world is to perpetuate social and economic injustice”".&lt;ref name="Mills, S. 2010"&gt;[http://www.infed.org/thinkers/colin_ward.htm Mills, S. (2010) 'Colin Ward: The ‘Gentle’ Anarchist and Informal Education’ at ''the encyclopaedia of informal education.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Child in the City'' (1978), and later ''The Child in the Country'' (1988), Ward "examined the everyday spaces of young people’s lives and how they can negotiate and re-articulate the various environments they inhabit. In his earlier text, the more famous of the two, Colin Ward explores the creativity and uniqueness of children and how they cultivate ‘the art of making the city work’. He argued that through play, appropriation and imagination, children can counter adult-based intentions and interpretations of the built environment.  His later text, The Child in the Country, inspired a number of social scientists, notably geographer Chris Philo (1992), to call for more attention to be paid to young people as a ‘hidden’ and marginalised group in society."&lt;ref name="Mills, S. 2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10953">In classrooms where '''assessment for learning''' is practised, students are encouraged to be more active in their learning and associated assessment. The ultimate purpose of assessment for learning is to create self-regulated learners who can leave school able and confident to continue learning throughout their lives. Teachers need to know at the outset of a unit of study where their students are in terms of their learning and then continually check on how they are progressing through strengthening the feedback they get from their learners. Students are guided on what they are expected to learn and what quality work looks like.  The teacher will work with the student to understand and identify any gaps or misconceptions (initial/diagnostic [[Educational assessment|assessment]]). As the unit progresses, the teacher and student work together to assess the student's knowledge, what she or he needs to learn to improve and extend this knowledge, and how the student can best get to that point ([[formative assessment]]). Assessment for learning occurs at all stages of the learning process.

Researchers whose work has informed much of this assessment reform include Ken O'Connor, Grant Wiggins,&lt;ref name=ltag&gt;http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt; Jay McTighe,&lt;ref name=ltag/&gt; Richard Stiggins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assessmentinst.com/author/rick-stiggins/|title=Assessment Training Institute|website=www.assessmentinst.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Black, [[Dylan Wiliam]], Chris Harrison, Bethan Marshall, Gordon Stobart, Caroline Gipps, Joanna Goodman, Thomas Guskey, Damian Cooper,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damiancooperassessment.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Philippe Perrenoud, Royce Sadler, Bronwen Cowie, Margaret Heritage and Ronán Howe.

==Historical perspective==
In past decades, teachers would design a unit of study that would typically include objectives, teaching strategies, and resources.  The student's mark on this test or exam was taken as the indicator of his or her understanding of the topic. In 1998, Black &amp; Wiliam produced a review that highlighted that students who learn in a formative way achieve significantly better than matched control groups receiving normal teaching. Their seminal work developed into several important research projects on Assessment for Learning by the King's College team including Kings-Medway-Oxfordshire Formative Assessment Project (KMOFAP), Assessment is For learning (Scotland), Jersey-Actioning-Formative assessment (Channel Islands), and smaller projects in England, Wales, Peru, and the USA.

==Complex assessment==
A complex assessment is the one that requires a rubric and an expert examiner. Example items for complex assessment include thesis, funding proposal, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Ho Sung Kim, Quantification for complex assessment: uncertainty estimation in final year project thesis assessment, European Journal of Engineering Education, 2013, pp 1-16 https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03043797.2012.742869&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Ho Sung Kim, Uncertainty analysis for peer assessment final year project, European Journal of Engineering Education, Vol 39 (1), 2014, pp 68-83 https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03043797.2013.833171&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of assessment is due to the format implicitness. In the past it has been puzzling to deal with the ambiguous assessment criteria for final year project (FYP) thesis assessment. Webster, Pepper and Jenkins (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Webster, F., D. Pepper, and A. Jenkins. 2000. “Assessing the undergraduate dissertation.” Assessment &amp; Evaluation in
Higher Education, 25 (1): 71–80.&lt;/ref&gt;
discussed some common general criteria for FYP thesis and their ambiguity regarding use, meaning and application. Woolf (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, H., 2004. “Assessment criteria: reflections on current practices.” Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education,
29 (4): 439–493.&lt;/ref&gt;
more specifically stated on the FYP assessment criterion weighting:‘The departments are as silent on the weightings that they apply to their criteria as they are on the
number of criteria that contribute to a grade’. A more serious concern was raised by Shay (2004) who argued that the FYP assessment for engineering and social sciences is ‘a socially situated
interpretive act’, implying that many different alternative interpretations and grades are possible for one assessment task. The problems with the FYP thesis assessment have thus received much
attention over the decades since the assessment difficulty was discussed by Black (1975).&lt;ref&gt;Black, J., 1975. “Allocation and assessment of project work in the final year of engineering degree course at the University of Bath”. Assessment in Higher Education, 1 (1): 35–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
There are a number of assessment terms that will appear in any discussion of assessment. Listed below are common interpretations of some of these terms:

'''Assessment'''
A working definition of [[Educational assessment|Assessment]] for learning from a widely cited article contends:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"the term 'assessment' refers to all those activities undertaken,,,
by teachers, and by their students in assessing themselves, which
provide information to be used as feedback to modify the teaching and learning activities in which they are engaged.&lt;ref name="BlackBox"&gt;Black, P.J. &amp; Wiliam, D. (1998) Inside the Black Box: Raising standards through classroom assessment. King's College, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since this seminal article, educators have differentiated assessment according to its purpose:

'''Assessment for learning'''

*comprises two phases—initial or diagnostic assessment and formative assessment
*assessment can be based on a variety of information sources (e.g., portfolios, works in progress, teacher observation, conversation)
*verbal or written feedback to the student is primarily descriptive and emphasizes strengths, identifies challenges, and points to next steps
*as teachers check on understanding they adjust their instruction to keep students on track
*no grades or scores are given - record-keeping is primarily anecdotal and descriptive
*occurs throughout the learning process, from the outset of the course of study to the time of summative assessment

'''Assessment as learning'''
*begins as students become aware of the goals of instruction and the criteria for performance
*involves goal-setting, monitoring progress, and reflecting on results
*implies student ownership and responsibility for moving his or her thinking forward (metacognition)
*occurs throughout the learning process

'''Assessment of learning'''
*assessment that is accompanied by a number or letter grade (summative)
*compares one student's achievement with standards
*results can be communicated to the student and parents
*occurs at the end of the learning unit

'''Evaluation'''
*judgment made on the basis of a student's performance

'''Diagnostic assessment (now referred to more often as "pre-assessment")
*assessment made to determine what a student does and does not know about a topic
*assessment made to determine a student's learning style or preferences
*used to determine how well a student can perform a certain set of skills related to a particular subject or group of subjects
*occurs at the beginning of a unit of study
*used to inform instruction:makes up the initial phase of assessment for learning

'''Formative assessment'''
*assessment made to determine a student's knowledge and skills, including learning gaps as they progress through a unit of study
*used to inform instruction and guide learning
*occurs during the course of a unit of study
*makes up the subsequent phase of assessment for learning

'''Summative assessment'''
*assessment that is made at the end of a unit of study to determine the level of understanding the student has achieved
*includes a mark or grade against an expected standard

==Principles==
Among the most comprehensive listing of principles of assessment for learning are those written by the QCA (Qualifications and Curriculum Authority). The authority, which is sponsored by England's [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]], is responsible for national curriculum, assessment, and examinations. Their principal focus is on crucial aspects of assessment for learning, including how such assessment should be seen as central to classroom practice, and that all teachers should regard assessment for learning as a key professional skill.

The UK Assessment Reform Group (1999) identifies "The big 5 principles of assessment for learning"

# The provision of effective feedback to students.
# The active involvement of students in their own learning.
# Adjusting teaching to take account of the results of assessment.
# Recognition of the profound influence assessment has on the motivation and self-esteem of pupils, both of which are critical influences on learning.
# The need for students to be able to assess themselves and understand how to improve.

===Feedback===

The purpose of an Assessment for Learning (AFL) task is to provide feedback to both the teacher and learner regarding the learner's progress towards achieving the learning objective(s).  This feedback should be used by the teacher to revise and develop further instruction.  An effective AFL method is to use a performance task coupled with a [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]]. This type of assessment is fundamental in illustrating how and why such principles need to be adhered to.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14178">A '''behavioral cusp''' is any [[behavior]] change that brings an organism's behavior into contact with new contingencies that have far-reaching consequences.&lt;ref name="rosales97"/&gt; A behavioral cusp is a special type of behavior change because it provides the learner with opportunities to access new reinforcers, new contingencies, new environments, new related behaviors (generativeness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alessi | first1 = G. | year = 1987 | title = Generative strategies and teaching for generalization | url = | journal = The Analysis of Verbal Behavior | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 15–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and competition with archaic or problem behaviors. It affects the people around the learner, and these people agree to the behavior change and support its development after the intervention is removed.

The concept has far reaching implications for every individual, and for the field of developmental psychology, because it provides a behavioral alternative to the concept of [[Developmental psychology|maturation]] and change due to the simple passage of time, such as [[developmental milestones]]. The cusp is a behavior change that presents special features when compared to other behavior changes.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==History==
The concept was first proposed{{when|date=August 2014}} by [[Sidney W. Bijou]], an American developmental psychologist.&lt;ref&gt;Bosch, S. and Hixson, M.D. (2004). The Final Piece to a Complete Science of Behavior: Behavior Development and Behavioral Cusps. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 5 (3), 244–253 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the cusp was to link behavioral principles to rapid spurts in development (see [[Behavior analysis of child development]]).

A behavioral cusp as conceptualized by Jesus Rosales-Ruiz &amp; [[Donald M. Baer|Donald Baer]] in 1997 is an important behavior change that affects future behavior changes.&lt;ref name="rosales97"&gt;{{citation |last= Rosales-Ruiz |first=J. |last2=Baer |first2=D.M. |year=1997 |chapter=Behavioral cusps: a developmental and pragmatic concept for behavior analysis |title=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=30 |pages= 533–544 |pmc=1284066 |pmid=9316263 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1997.30-533}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavioral cusp, like the [[reinforcer]], is apprehended by its effects. Whereas a reinforcer acts on a single response or a group of related responses, the effects of a behavioral cusp regulate a large number of responses in a more distant future.

The concept has been compared to a [[developmental milestone]], however, not all cusps are milestones. For example, learning to play soccer is not a milestone, but it was life-changing for [[Pelé]]. As a result of learning to kick grapefruits (the initial important change or cusp), Pelé accessed (1) new environments, (2) new reinforcers, (3) new soccer moves, (4) dropped competing behaviors (smoking), and (5) gained international acclaims for his skill. Soccer is not a [[developmental milestone]] because it is not a necessary skill in most environments.

==Properties==
The following properties are special features of a behavioral change that lead to more change, and an increased likelihood of social adaptation, independence, and [[cultural fitness]].

===New reinforcers===
New reinforcers are accessible and enrich the perspective of the learner. Additionally these reinforcers may lead to an increase in the variety of behaviors. If the reinforcers are promoting health and social behaviors, they will lead to an improved quality of life.

====Case example====
A child who learns to open a door may access the swing for the first time and learns to use the swing.&lt;ref name="rosales97"/&gt; Here, the new skill (swinging motion is the reinforcer) may lead to more complex and social activities such as (1) turn taking, (2) asking someone to share the swing, (3) taking turns pushing someone, which in turn (4) may provide more social opportunities to speak and (5) interact with the play partners, etc.

====Case non-example====
A child learns to open a door and walks outside. He finds some ants behind a shrubbery and watches the ants. His parents are looking for him, they get worried and are calling him. The child is unusually mesmerized by columns of ants on the ground and does not hear the calls. His parents find him shortly after, but they are frantic from their 5-minute search and accidentally scare him from going outside. In this non-example, learning to open doors that lead outside resulted in consequences that did not directly benefit the child and maybe decrease important skills related to exploration and search. In this case, no new reinforcers were contacted and learning to open the backyard door (that has a special latch) was effectively a waste of time because the child's parents don't usually approve being alone in the backyard.

===New contingencies of reinforcement===
New contingencies are responsible for the selection of novel and more [[adaptive behaviors]] while decreasing problematic or archaic behaviors. Contingencies of reinforcement (before&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Reinforcer) produce and maintain each and every learned behavior. New contingencies establish the control of new stimuli over our behaviors, and therefore make us more sensitive and aware of our surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Selection by Consequences |url=http://www.bfsr.org/element1.html |publisher=Walden Fellowship, Inc. |year=1999 |accessdate=23 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716171113/http://www.bfsr.org/element1.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

===New environments===
New environments are geographical and/or virtual areas of potential change (receiving environments). New environments regulate, maintain, and set the micro-cultural boundaries for reinforcers (and punishers), and their antecedents. They include tools and stakeholders controlling the pace and content of instruction and, as a result, they regulate boundary of what the learner learns (e.g., school curriculum). New environments must contain some of the stakeholders' preferences and reinforcers to create lasting [[positive reinforcement]] practices for the learner.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

===Generativeness===
Generativeness describes the ability of the receiving environment to regulate novel responses, functions, values or response products derived from the original cusp response. For a behavior, it is the ability to recombine or merge into more complex units, or the ability to contact environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosch | first1 = S. | last2 = Fuqua | first2 = R.W. | year = 2001 | title = Behavioral cusps: a model for selecting target behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 123–125 | doi=10.1901/jaba.2001.34-123| pmc = 1284293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case example====
{{NPOV|reason=Seems partisan in favor of the pro-phonics camp|date=July 2015}}
A child learns [[phonetic reading]] and can recombine the 50 or so English phonemes into 50,000 words by recombining the individual sounds he has learned to read. The generative index for this act of learning the basic English phonemes is approximately 10,000 (where one new behavior results in a potential 10,000 applications).

====Case non-example====
{{NPOV|reason=Seems partisan in favor of the pro-phonics camp|date=July 2015}}
A child learns [[Look-say|sight reading]] for 50 words. When a new word is presented, the child learns by listening to a teacher and memorizes the words rather than using what he has previously learned, thus becoming able to read only 50 words using this method. Additionally, he is now dependent on someone for learning each new vocabulary word.

===Competition with archaic behaviors===
Behavior competition is the ability of cusp behaviors to displace previously established behaviors on a continuum of intensity and rate, across repertoires, and environments. Competing archaic behaviors occur on a corresponding continuum of severity.

===Effect on stakeholders===
Effect on others comes from the learner's behavior affecting the stakeholders who control reinforcers and punishers in a specific environment. It is important to identify these stakeholders' motivations and reinforcers in selecting potential cusps. Effect refers to the changes in values and behaviors of the stakeholder resulting from a cusp in the learner. The initial and gradually more complex behaviors that constituted the entry point for an important behavior change that, once initiated, so profoundly alters, displaces, or transforms one's behavioral repertoire that it renders preexisting behavioral repertoires obsolete. A behavioral cusp is an important behavior change that alters the probability of the learner's future repertoires and interactions with stakeholders' repertoires.

===Social validity===
[[Social validity]] is an indicator of social acceptability of a behavior and its consequences for the stakeholders representing the communities which the learner is accessing or will access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = I. | last2 = Baer | first2 = D. | year = 1991 | title = Social validity Assessment: Is current practice state of the art? | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 189–204 | doi=10.1901/jaba.1991.24-189| pmc = 1279564 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some seemingly insignificant changes in a stakeholder may dramatically affect the learner. All stakeholders (e.g., government officials, teachers, parents, and other interventionists) should agree to the goals, methods, and tools for the intervention and the norms from the local community suggest the boundaries of what should be learned.

==Applications==

===Life span/development guidelines===
The behavioral cusp has implications for the selection and sequencing of skills during the life span. While milestones are mainly concerned with the chronology of behaviors, the concept of behavioral cusp is concerned with the fitness of the behavior within a context or a [[receiving environment]]. As Rosales-Ruiz and Baer (1997) stated, "One child's cusp may be another child's waste of time." Thus, there is a great need for empirically-based guidelines in making decisions related to the initial selection of skills.

===Prediction and control of development over longer periods of time===
The applications of the concepts are related to the prediction, selection, and retention of successful and adaptive behaviors to the treatment of [[childhood autism]], [[Down syndrome]], and other [[developmental disabilities]] is humane and based on evidence from the field of [[behavior analysis]]. The first applications of the concept derive from a set of guidelines proposed by Bosch and Fuqua in ''The [[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]]''.

===Development of new technology===
A new technology and methodology, necessary to measure the effects of a small change over time, will reveal a strong dependence on the initial conditions selected by a cusp specialist ([[butterfly effect]]).

==Future research==
Future research will elucidate the nature and parameters of the criteria and the tools used in the selection and sequencing of skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bosch |first=S. |last2=Hixson |first2=M.D. |year=2004 |chapter=The final piece to a complete science of behavior: behavior development and behavioral cusps |title=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |pages=244–254 |url=http://www.baojournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hixson |first=M.D. |year=2004 |chapter=Behavioral cusps, basic behavioral repertoires, and cumulative-hierarchical learning |title=The Psychological Record |volume=54 |pages=387–403}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As importantly, the existing parameters (proposed by Rosales-Ruiz, Baer, Bosch, &amp; Fuqua) provides justifications for behavioral interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stokes | first1 = John V. | last2 = Cameron | first2 = Michael J. | last3 = Dorsey | first3 = Michael F. | last4 = Fleming | first4 = Elizabeth | year = 2004 | title = Task analysis, correspondence training, and general case instruction for teaching personal hygiene skills | url = | journal = Behavioral Interventions | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 121–135 | doi=10.1002/bin.153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = D.E. | last2 = Greer | first2 = D.R. | year = 2003 | title = Generalized imitation and the mand: introducing first instances of speech in young children with autism | url = | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 58–74 | doi=10.1016/s0891-4222(02)00167-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ala'i-Rosales, S.; Smith, G.J. &amp; Edelen-Smith, P.J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16032">'''Classwide Peer Tutoring''' ('''CWPT''') is a variation of [[peer-mediated instruction]] that has been used in elementary, middle school, and high school classrooms. In CWPT students form pairs and take turns in the roles of tutor and student. Students earn points for their teams by participating in the tutoring and the winning team is recognized. Researchers have investigated CWPT's effectiveness in several different academic areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/?q=instruction/classwide_peer_tutoring&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Classwide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) is a form of [[peer-mediated instruction]] where the teacher creates pairs of students that alternately fill the roles of tutor and student. The tutor asks questions, records points, and provides feedback on whether the student's response matches the correct response designated by the teacher. The student responds orally and/or in writing to the questions and practices the correct answer three times if he or she makes an error.&lt;ref name=Terry&gt;{{cite web|last=Terry|first=Barbara|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring|url=http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/~kucrl/cgi-bin/drupal/?q=instruction/classwide_peer_tutoring|work=University of Kansas Special Connections|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher supervises the tutoring and awards points for good tutoring.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; A classroom's student pairs are divided into two teams, and they earn points for their respective teams by answering questions correctly, correcting their incorrect answers, and tutoring appropriately.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenwood|first=Charles|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring|journal=Behavior and Social Issues|year=1997|volume=7|issue=1|page=52-57|doi=10.5210/bsi.v7i1.299}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of a week, the team that has earned the most points is recognized as the winning team.&lt;ref name="Best Evidence Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Program Overview: Classwide Peer Tutoring|url=http://www.bestevidence.org/overviews/C/classwide.htm|work=Best Evidence Encyclopedia|publisher=Johns Hopkins University School of Education|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CWPT has been used to help students learn [[spelling]], math facts, basic word reading, reading fluency, [[vocabulary]], and facts related to an area of study.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; There appear to be more published studies of CWPT with positive outcomes in the area of spelling than in other areas. The CWPT technique has been used with several different age levels: pre-school, elementary, middle school, and high school.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; CWPT was initially developed and researched in the early 1980s at the Juniper Gardens Children's Project at the [[University of Kansas]].&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network"&gt;{{cite web|title=Programs that Work: Classwide Peer Tutoring Program|url=http://www.promisingpractices.net/program.asp?programid=99|publisher=Promising Practices Network|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==
The developers of CWPT suggest that this technique provides students more opportunities to practice content or skills, encourages them to engage in [[active learning]], and lets them receive immediate feedback.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; CWPT is also thought to provide students with practice using [[social skills]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamps Barbetta Leonard &amp; Delquadri"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kamps|first=Debra|author2=Barbetta, Patricia |author3=Leonard, Betsy |author4= Delquadri, Joseph |title=Classwide Peer Tutoring: An Integration Strategy To Improve Reading Skills And Promote Peer Interactions Among Students With Autism And General Education Peers|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|year=1994|volume=27|page=49-61|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-49|pmc=1297776}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research findings ===
CWPT has been effective for teaching spelling to both students in [[curriculum|general education]] and students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ([[ADHD]]), mild [[intellectual disabilities]], and [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name="Chun &amp;

=== Evaluation as an evidence-based practice ===
==== What Works Clearinghouse rating ====
The [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[What Works Clearinghouse]] has evaluated CWPT for effectiveness in the areas of General Reading Achievement and [[English language learning and teaching|English Language Learning]] (ELL). These evaluations resulted in a "potentially positive" effectiveness rating in the area of General Reading Achievement for elementary school students, and no rating for ELL due to the fact that no existing studies met What Works Clearinghouse criteria for evaluation.&lt;ref name="WWC reading"&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Department of Education|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring Beginning Reading|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=81|work=What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WWC ELL"&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Department of Education|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring English Language Learners|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=83|work=What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Works Clearinghouse does not currently provide reports for CWPT's effectiveness in any other areas.

==== Promising Practices Network rating ====
Promising Practices Network considers CWPT a "Proven Program".&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network" /&gt; The website states that CWPT meets full criteria for a "Proven Program" by having research outcomes that fall in the category of the website's target areas, having at least one outcome that is changed by at least 20% or .25 [[standard deviation]]s, having at least one outcome with a statistically significant and meaningful [[effect size]], having studies that use comparison groups, having studies with sample sizes of 30 or more, and by having research findings publicly available.&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
A few studies have shown CWPT to have few advantages over more traditional methods of classroom instruction with middle or high school students, such as teacher-centered instruction or independent practice.&lt;ref name="Allsopp 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allsopp|first=David|title=Using classwide peer tutoring to teach beginning algebra problem-solving skills in heterogeneous classrooms.|journal=Remedial and Special Education|year=1997|volume=18|issue=6|page=367-379|doi=10.1177/074193259701800606}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman-Perrott 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowman-Perrott|first=Lisa|author2=Greenwood, Charles R |author3=Tapia, Yolanda |title=The efficacy of CWPT used in secondary alternative school classrooms with small teacher/pupil ratios and students with emotional and behavioral disorders.|journal=Education &amp; Treatment of Children|year=2007|volume=30|issue=3|page=65-87|doi=10.1353/etc.2007.0014}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also found that while CWPT may increase the positive social interactions of students with ADHD during the tutoring, it does not necessarily affect their social behavior in other settings.&lt;ref name="Plumer 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plumer|first=Pamela|author2=Stoner, Gary|title=The relative effects of classwide peer tutoring and peer coaching on the positive social behaviors of children with ADHD.|journal=Journal of Attention Disorders|year=2005|volume=9|issue=1|page=290-300|doi=10.1177/1087054705280796}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cobb Virtual Academy''' ('''CVA''') is an online education program created and provided by the [[Cobb County School District]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States. It is a separate entity from the [[Georgia Virtual School]], an initiative by the [[Georgia Department of Education]] to provide online learning to students in [[Public school (government funded)|public]] and [[private school]]s. Many students choose to take various courses provided by CVA to complete or add to their high school education.

Students are expected to do relatively the same amount of work as in any offline course. Preliminary meetings, finals, and [[End of Course Test]]s are all done in person. Most assignments simply require composing a text document or completing a downloaded worksheet and [[E-mail|emailing]] it to a teacher.

While somewhat expensive, one or two of these classes may be taken during each of the normal school years with limited seats for each. There are currently 45 different classes available.

As of August 2017, CodeSignal has reported that it had nearly 1 million developers using CodeSignal for Developers.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/news/450424234/CodeFights-offers-a-unique-tool-for-developer-recruiting|title=CodeFights offers a unique tool for developer recruiting|work=SearchSoftwareQuality|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 10th July 2018, [https://codesignal.com/ CodeFights] has been renamed to [https://codesignal.com/ CodeSignal] with additional features as per the company blog.

== History ==
CodeSignal was founded in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eilenezimmerman/2016/01/20/uber-hires-programmers-who-can-win-a-fight-with-their-robot/#7e22446c7912|title=Uber Hires Programmers Who Can Win A Fight With Their Robot|last=Zimmerman|first=Eilene|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simons"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-site-helps-outsiders-land-tech-jobs-1479232236|title=New Site Helps Outsiders Land Tech Jobs|last=Simons|first=John|date=2016-11-16|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Tigran Sloyan, Aram Shatakhtsyan, and Felix Desroches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eilenezimmerman/2016/01/20/uber-hires-programmers-who-can-win-a-fight-with-their-robot/#2c631d487912|title=Uber Hires Programmers Who Can Win A Fight With Their Robot|last=Zimmerman|first=Eilene|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for CodeSignal was developed from Sloyan and Shatakhtsyan’s experiences of participating in international coding and mathematics competitions including the International Olympiad in Informatics and Mathematics. Sloyan even used this concept of a game-based teaching platform for his Computer Science master’s thesis at MIT, but abandoned the idea to work in established Silicon Valley companies including Oracle, Google, and Premise (backed by Google Ventures).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/premise|title=Premise Data {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CodeSignal first launched with challenges only for JavaScript and were based on “code battles”, a 3-minute person versus person competition to determine who can more quickly and accurately debug existing code.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/codefights-thinks-competitive-programming-can-be-a-spectator-sport-2015-9?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=This startup thinks competitive programming could be more popular than college football|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before each game, players can either choose to race against the clock, or let CodeSignal automatically match them with other online players to complete the challenge head-to-head. Successful challengers level up and earn badges towards language fluency. Even though players are first presented with short challenges that take only a few minutes to solve, each challenge increases in difficulty and the amount of time given to solve the problem.

Soon, CodeSignal expanded to support Java, C++ and Python challenges. Today, CodeSignal supports 38 programming languages and has also expanded to include more types of challenges, interview practice, and access to companies with open software engineering positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/806782/a-startup-is-gaming-bias-in-tech-recruitment-by-organizing-coding-matches/|title=CodeFights aims to remove hiring bias in Silicon Valley with Code Arcade and competitions against coding bots — Quartz|last=Bhattacharya|first=Ananya|website=qz.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though CodeSignal launched as a platform to help users learn and improve their coding skills, CodeSignal has also taken on changing recruiting all together. CodeFight’s main goal is to help programmers get hired based on their skills, not their resume.

== CodeSignal for Developers ==
CodeSignal originally launched as an online community where developers can practice their skills through a series of Head-to-Head coding challenges,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/startups-are-making-the-rejection-letter-a-thing-of-the-past/|title=Startups are making the rejection letter a thing of the past – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which appealed to competitive programmers.&lt;ref name="uk.businessinsider.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/codefights-thinks-competitive-programming-can-be-a-spectator-sport-2015-9|title=This startup thinks competitive programming could be more popular than college football|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal was to help developers build their coding skills by solving and discussing programming challenges with other developers on the platform.&lt;ref name="Fast Company"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3057218/you-might-apply-for-your-next-job-by-playing-a-mobile-game|title=You Might Apply For Your Next Job By Playing A Mobile Game|date=2016-02-29|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first 2 years, the CodeSignal platform had 6 distinct game modes: Interview Practice, Company Bots, Arcade, Tournaments, Head-to-Head, and Challenges; all geared towards helping developers build skills and getting prepared for technical real-world jobs. In all of these modes, the CodeSignal system runs a user’s solution to a coding challenge against tests, and the solution is only accepted when all test cases are satisfied.&lt;ref name="Fast Company"/&gt; All CodeFight modes for developers are free of charge.

As of August 2017, CodeSignal has reported that it had nearly 1 million developers using CodeSignal for Developers.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Interview Practice ===
Interview Practice is the newest and most popular mode on CodeSignal for Developers.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/codefights-new-practice-mode-helps-developers-prepare-for-job-interviews/|title=CodeFights launches a new practice mode to help developers prepare for job interviews – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mode first launched in beta in February 2017, and then launched the expanded the version in June 2017.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt; The Interview Practice game mode is specifically targeted towards job seekers who are preparing for engineering technical interviews. Developers can use Interview Practice to solve real interview questions, master key computer science topics, and learn by reviewing solutions provided within the community.

=== Company Bots ===
Launched in November 2015, Company Bots&lt;ref name="Fast Company"/&gt; are curated challenges that simulate real-world problems that companies are facing. This type of assessment is based on the premise that solving on-the-job coding challenges can allow companies to better assess the skills of a potential candidate.

During a Company Bot challenge, participants are faced with multiple rounds of challenges of varying difficulty. Both the bot and the challenger are attempting to solve the coding challenge side by side. Each participant gains points based on speed and accuracy. After the participant submits their solution, it is evaluated and only accepted if it passes all the tests. Only after winning the Bot challenge, can the participant be provided with the opportunity to submit their information to the recruiter of the company running the Company Bot challenge.

CodeSignal launched Company Bots with a partnership with [[Uber]] to create Uberbot, a Uber-branded gaming challenge&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/05/uber-teams-with-codefights-to-create-uberbot-a-game-to-test-coding-skills-of-potential-hires/|title=Uber teams with CodeFights to create UberBot, a game to test coding skills of potential hires|date=2015-11-05|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; on CodeSignal that would help Uber find and evaluate the programming skills of candidates. Candidates who attempted the Uberbot coding game are challenged to solve real-world problems facing Uber’s engineering team, such as finding the most optimal route for a Uber ride, or the most efficient method of matching riders for an [[uberPOOL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eng.uber.com/uberbot/|title=Building the #UberBot on CodeFights for Uber Engineering {{!}} Uber Engineering Blog|date=2015-10-20|work=Uber Engineering Blog|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CodeSignal now has 15 company bots including bots from [[Asana (software)|Asana]],&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]],&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Quora]],&lt;ref name="uk.businessinsider.com"/&gt; [[Instacart]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/from-under-the-rug/how-competing-against-a-bot-could-land-you-a-developer-job.html|title=How Competing Against a ‘Bot’ Could Land You a Developer Job|website=www.itbusinessedge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SpaceX]], [[Thumbtack (website)|Thumbtack]],&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/codefights-has-a-new-service-to-help-companies-find-job-candidates-2017-10|title=This startup wants to help programmers get hired based on their coding skills rather than their résumés|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CodeSignal for Recruiters ==
In addition to being a learning tool for developers, CodeSignal Recruiter (previously known as CodeSignalR)  is also a skills-based recruiting platform that uses a data-driven approach to help companies improve their hiring process, find better qualified candidates, and make more objective hiring decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eilenezimmerman/2016/01/20/uber-hires-programmers-who-can-win-a-fight-with-their-robot/#2a36b1967912|title=Uber Hires Programmers Who Can Win A Fight With Their Robot|last=Zimmerman|first=Eilene|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt;

Launched in October 2017, CodeSignal Recruiter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/codefights-launches-codefightsr-to-deliver-data-driven-skills-based-recruiting-300543663.html|title=CodeFights Launches CodeFightsR To Deliver Data-Driven Skills-Based Recruiting|last=CodeFights|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the sourcing, testing, and interview platform for technical recruiters. Companies with a CodeSignal Recruiter account can contact developers within the CodeSignal community who have done well on challenges &lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; and have signalled that they are open to new jobs. Once contacted, recruiters can use CodeSignal to send out custom programming tests to candidates that include plagiarism checks, live recordings, timed assessments, all within a developer-focused IDE (integrated development environment).

CodeSignal Recruiter is also integrated with Applicant Tracking System (ATS) software including Greenhouse, Lever and SmartRecruiters, which allows recruiters to manage and sync candidate data between CodeSignal and their recruiting platform including send coding tests, evaluating results and managing candidate lifecycles.

Some of CodeFight’s Recruiter customers include [[Evernote]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/16/the-hiring-game/|title=The hiring game – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uber]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Thumbtack (website)|Thumbtack]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"/&gt; [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Asana (software)|Asana]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Ascend Communications|Ascend]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.codefights.com/codefights-customer-stories-ascend-io/|title=CodeFights Customer Stories: Ascend.io {{!}} CodeFights|date=2018-03-23|work=CodeFights|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.wizeline.com/ Wizeline]&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.codefights.com/customer-stories-wizeline/|title=CodeFights Customer Stories: Wizeline {{!}} CodeFights|date=2018-03-08|work=CodeFights|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quora]].&lt;ref name="uk.businessinsider.com"/&gt;

=== CodeSignal Coding Score ===
CodeSignal launched their rating system, called Coding Score, on July 10, 2018. The Coding Score is a measure of a developer's overall implementation and problem-solving ability. It is a predictor of how well a developer will perform in technical interviews. To get a initial Coding Score on CodeSignal, each developer has to solve at least 3 tasks on CodeSignal. To get a more accurate score, developers are asked to vary the difficulty of the tasks that they solve.

=== Testing&lt;ref name="The New Stack"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenewstack.io/helping-engineers-assess-their-skills/|title=CodeFights: A Platform to Test Coding Skills, Prepare for Interviews and Apply for Jobs - The New Stack|date=2017-05-09|work=The New Stack|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
CodeSignal Recruiter also has a testing feature that allows recruiters to send out technical assessments to their potential candidates. These tests can be customized to simulate real-world challenges that the candidate may face on the job, which has been reported to be a better measurement for competency than regular interview questions or theoretical programming tests. The testing suite also has a built in plagiarism checker that predicts the probability of plagiarism by comparing to other completed tests on the CodeSignal platform and solutions from known sites. During the on-boarding process CodeSignal works with customers to create custom tests so the online tests are calibrated with the interview process and job responsibilities.&lt;ref name="The New Stack"/&gt;

=== Interviewing ===
The CodeSignal Recruiter Interview feature allows recruiters to conduct online and in-person interviews in a shared coding environment that supports 38 programming languages. The interview environment allows for timed assessments, live recordings, and an extensive library of skills-based coding tasks. During each live interview, the hiring manager can watch and conduct a coding skills assessment using pre-defined coding tasks while also talking to the candidate over a live video stream. Each live interview is also recorded so that other hiring managers in the recruitment process can review and share the candidates live assessment.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/codefights-launches-interview-practice-to-help-coders-ace-technical-job-interviews-at-top-tech-companies-300407220.html|title=CodeFights Launches Interview Practice To Help Coders Ace Technical Job Interviews At Top Tech Companies|last=CodeFights|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
As of July 2017, CodeSignal has raised a total of $12.5 million in 2 rounds from 23 investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/codefights#/entity|title=CodeFights {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company raised an initial $2.5 million in seed funding in April 2015,&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/17/codefights-raises-10m-series-a-round-for-its-skills-based-recruiting-platform/|title=CodeFights raises $10M Series A round for its skills-based recruiting platform – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included investments by Felicis Ventures (Aydin Senkut), Sutter Hill Ventures (Mike Speiser), LiveRamp CEO Auren Hoffman, Google Shopping Express founder Tom Fallows, Twitter VP of Engineering Raffi Krikorian, [[Quora]] CEO [[Adam D'Angelo]] and [[GoDaddy]] VP of Engineering Marek Olszewski.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt; CodeSignal raised $10 million in November 2016. The Series A funding round was led by [[e.ventures]]. Other investors in that round included SV Angel, A Capital, Granatus Ventures,&lt;ref name="Simons20162"&gt;Simons, John.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38110">'''Comprehensive sex education (CSE)''' is a [[sex education]] instruction method based on-curriculum that aims to give students the knowledge, attitudes, skills and values to make appropriate and healthy choices in their sexual lives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: an evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The intention is that this understanding will prevent students from contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] in the future, including [[HIV]] and [[HPV]]. CSE is also designed with the intention of reducing teenage and unwanted pregnancies, as well as lowering rates of domestic and [[sexual violence]], thus contributing to a healthier society, both physically and mentally.&lt;ref name="Loeber 2010 169–176"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeber|first=O.|author2=Reuter, S. |author3=Apter, van der Doef |author4=Lazdane, Pinter |title=Aspects of sexuality education in Europe – definitions, differences and developments|journal=European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care|date=June 2010|volume=15|issue=3|pages=169–176|pmid=20465399|doi=10.3109/13625181003797280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehensive sex education ultimately promotes [[sexual abstinence]] as the safest sexual choice for young people. However, CSE curriculums and teachers are still committed to teaching students about topics connected to future sexual activity, such as [[age of consent]], [[safe sex]], [[Birth control|contraception]] such as: [[birth control]], [[abortion]], and use of [[condoms]].&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubenstein|first=Rachel|date=January 1, 2017|title=Sex Education: Funding Facts, Not Fear|url=http://p8888-ucelinks.cdlib.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/sfx_local?genre=article&amp;atitle=Sex%20Education%3A%20Funding%20Facts%2C%20Not%20Fear%20%5Bnotes%5D&amp;title=Health%20Matrix:%20Journal%20of%20Law-Medicine&amp;issn=0748383X&amp;isbn=&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=&amp;date=20170101&amp;aulast=Rubenstein,%20Rachel&amp;spage=525&amp;pages=&amp;sid=EBSCO:HeinOnline:hein.journals.hmax27.19#|journal=Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine.|volume=27|pages=525–553|via=MasterFILE Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This also includes discussions which promote safe behaviors, such as communicating with partners and seeking testing for sexually transmitted infections. Additionally, comprehensive sex education curricula may include discussions surrounding pregnancy outcomes such as parenting, adoption, and abortion.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; The most widely agreed benefit of using comprehensive sex education over [[abstinence-only sex education]] is that CSE acknowledges the student population will be sexually active in their future. By acknowledging this, CSE can encourage students to plan ahead to make the healthiest possible sexual decisions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education|title=Comprehensive sexuality education|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unfpa.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology of arming students to most successfully survive their future sexual experiences underlies the majority of topics within CSE, including condoms, contraception, and refusal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclunc.org/docs/executive_summary_-_2003_statewide_school_district_survey.pdf|title=Sex Education in California Public Schools: Are Students Learning What They Need to Know?|last=Burlingame|first=Julianne|date=August 2003|website=www.aclu.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of CSE ==
Studies have found that comprehensive sex education is more effective than receiving no instruction and/or those who receive abstinence-only instruction.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Acknowledging that people may engage in premarital sex rather than ignoring it (which abstinence-only is often criticized for) allows educators to give the students the necessary information to safely navigate their future sexual lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|title=Comprehensive Sex Education: Research and Results|date=2010-12-08|website=advocatesforyouth.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208154235/http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|archive-date=December 8, 2010|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

CSE advocates argue that promoting abstinence without accompanied information regarding safe sex practices is a disregard of reality, and is ultimately putting the student at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|title=Comprehensive Sex Education and Academic Success|date=2015-02-26|website=www.futureofsexed.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226100613/http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|archive-date=February 26, 2015|deadurl=yes|access-date=2016-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, programs funded under AEGP are reviewed for compliance with the 8 standards (listed below in "Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements), but are not screened for medical accuracy. Therefore, critics believe that students under these educational programs are put at a disadvantage because it prevents them from making informed choices about their sexual health. Additionally, under these AEGP programs, health educators have referred to those that engage in sex, especially females, as "dirty" and "used." They have also used phrases such as "stay like a new toothbrush, wrapped up and unused"  and "chewed-up gum" to teach abstinence. Under a CSE model, language would be more sensitive.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

There is clear evidence that CSE has a positive impact on sexual and reproductive health (SRH), notably in contributing to reducing [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]], HIV and [[unintended pregnancy]]. Sexuality education does not hasten sexual activity but has a positive impact on safer sexual behaviours and can delay sexual debut.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2009. ''International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education: An Evidence-informed approach for schools, teachers and health educators''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001832/183281e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review of school-based sexuality education programmes has demonstrated increased HIV knowledge, increased self-efficacy related to condom use and refusing sex, increased contraception and condom use, a reduced number of sexual partners and later initiation of first sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Fonner et al. 2014. ''School based sex education and HIV prevention in low and middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis''. PLoS ONE 9(3): e89692. Doi: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal&lt;/nowiki&gt;. pone.0089692&lt;/ref&gt; A Cochrane review of 41 randomized controlled trials in Europe, the United States, Nigeria and Mexico also confirmed that CSE prevents unintended adolescent pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Oringanje, C. et al. 2009. ''Interventions for preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents''. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt; CSE is very beneficial in regards to teen pregnancy because studies show that, teen pregnancy and childbearing have a significant negative impact on high school success and completion, as well as future job prospects.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; A study in Kenya, involving more than 6,000 students who had received sexuality education led to delayed sexual initiation, and increased condom use among those who were sexually active once these students reached secondary school compared to more than 6,000 students who did not receive sexuality education.&lt;ref&gt;Maticka-Tyndale, E. 2010. A multi-level model of condom use among male and female upper primary school students in Nyanza, Kenya. Soc Sci Med, Aug 5, Vol. 71, No. 3, pp. 616–25. Epub 2010, May 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; CSE also reduces the frequency of sex and the number of partners which in turn also reduces the rates of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

[[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]] and the [[African Union]] have recognized CSE’s impact on increasing condom use, voluntary HIV testing and reducing pregnancy among adolescent girls and have included comprehensive, age-appropriate sexuality education as one of the key recommendations to fast track the HIV response and end the AIDS epidemic among young women and girls in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;UNAIDS and the African Union. 2015. ''Empower Young Women and Adolescent Girls: Fast tracking the end of the AIDS epidemic in Africa''. Geneva, UNAIDS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As the field of sexuality education develops, there is increasing focus on addressing gender, power relations and human rights in order to improve the impact on SRH outcomes. Integrating content on gender and rights makes sexuality education even more effective.&lt;ref&gt;UNFPA. 2014a. ''Operational Guidance for Comprehensive Sexuality Education: A focus on human rights and gender''. New York, UNFPA. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/&lt;/nowiki&gt; les/pub-pdf/UNFPA%20Operational%20Guidance%20for%20 CSE%20-Final%20WEB%20Version.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A review of 22 curriculum- based sexuality education programmes found that 80 per cent of programmes that addressed gender or power relations were associated with a significant decrease in pregnancy, childbearing or STIs. These programmes were five times as effective as those programmes that did not address gender or power.&lt;ref&gt;Haberland, N.A. 2015.

''International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health'', Vol. 41, No. 1, pp. 31–42. https:// www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4103115.html&lt;/ref&gt; CSE empowers young people to reflect critically on their environment and behaviours, and promotes gender equality and equitable social norms, which are important contributing factors for improving health outcomes, including HIV infection rates. The impact of CSE also increases when delivered together with efforts to expand access to a full range of high- quality, youth-friendly services and commodities, particularly in relation to contraceptive choice.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2011a. ''School-Based Sexuality Education Programmes. A cost and cost-effectiveness analysis in six countries''.

A global review of evidence in the education sector also found that teaching sexuality education builds confidence,&lt;ref&gt;Unterhalter, E., North, A., Arnot, M., Lloyd, C., Moletsane, L., Murphy-Graham, E., Parkes, J. and Saito, M. 2014. ''Interventions to enhance girls’ education and gender equality''. Education Rigorous Literature Review.

CSE has a demonstrated impact on improving knowledge, self-esteem, changing attitudes, gender and social norms, and building self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Criticism of CSE ==

=== How comprehensive is CSE ===
While CSE implementation is on the rise in the United States, it remains difficult for state officials to regulate what is and is not taught in the classroom. This is due in large part to the undefinability of CSE; CSE has the potential to comprise such a wide range of sexual information, and over-all focus varies widely between curriculums.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educators have also accused CSE as fundamentally operating as a form of "abstinence-plus," due to the reality that CSE often involves minimal body related information and excessive promotions of abstinence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Ed for Caring Schools Creating an Ethics-Based Curriculum|last=Lamb|first=Sharon|publisher=Teachers College Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "So-called Comprehensive Sex Ed" says Sharon Lamb, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, "has been made less comprehensive as curricula are revised to meet current federal, state, and local requirements."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== LGBTQIA+ community not included CSE ====
The term "comprehensive" is also often misleading because some comprehensive programs do not show the holistic picture of human sexuality.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curvino|first=Melissa and Meghan Grizzle Fischer|date=April 21, 2015|title=Claiming Comprehensive Sex Education is a Right Does Not Make it So|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=16&amp;sid=e0097ff0-d647-4666-83a3-1229b73b3d13%40sessionmgr120|journal=The New Bioethics|volume=20|issue=1|pages=72–98|via=Taylor and Francis Online|pmid=24979877}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT|LGBTQIA+]] advocates have long been critical of the ways in which comprehensive sex education generally promotes marriage as the end goal for students. Even when curriculums claim to be inclusive of LGBT experiences, they often promote heteronormative lifestyles as "normal." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erevelles|first=Nirmala|date=2011|title=Coming Out Crip in Inclusive Education|url=|journal=Teachers College Record|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusion of LGBT identities and health topics is necessary for LGBTQIA+ students to feel safe and seen in their sex ed classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Risky Lessons|last=Fields|first=Jessica|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these students do not have access to or an interest in marriage they are practically erased from the CSE narrative. 

A cross sectional study done in New York City analyzed the sexual behaviors of high school girls. Studies found that, "high school girls who identified as LGBTQIA+ were more likely to report substance use such as: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth, ecstasy and prescription drugs. They also had higher rates of contemplating and/or attempting suicide."&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobel M.D|first=Chanelle et. al|date=August 2017|title=Description of Sexual Orientation and Sexual Behaviors among High School Girls in New York City|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/science/article/pii/S1083318817300980?via%3Dihub|journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology|volume=30|issue=4|pages=460–465|via=Elsevier ScienceDirect|pmid=28279826|doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2017.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that "the LGBTQIA+ youth accesses health information online five times more than the [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] population, and these rates are even higher for LGBTQIA+ youth that identify as a person of color which stems from the fact that they lack health resources. &lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manduley|first=Aida, et al|date=February 8, 2018|title=The role of social media in sex education: Dispatches from queer, trans, and racialized communities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/abs/10.1177/0959353517717751|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|volume=28|pages=152–170|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0959353517717751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, as of May 2018, only 12 states require discussion of sexual orientation and of these, only 9 states require that discussion of sexual orientation be inclusive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education|title=State Laws and Policies Regarding Sex and HIV Education|last=|first=|date=2018-05-01|website=|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, several states have passed legislation that bans teachers from discussing gay and transgender issues, such as sexual health and HIV/AIDS awareness, in a positive light.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Furthermore, three states require that teachers only portray LGBTQIA+ people in a negative light.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a Canada, a federal report showed that LGBTQIA+ community has less access to health services and faces more comprehensive health challenges compared to the general population. As a result of lack of support for the LGBTQIA+ population, the Comprehensive Health Education Workers (CHEW) Project emerged in October 2014. Their goal is to educate the LGBTQIA+ community  about topics such  sexual and gender identity, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), healthy social relationships, and depression. They do this though workshops, arts‐based projects, and one‐on‐one meetings.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lévesque|first=Michel|date=November 29, 2017|title=The Comprehensive Health Education Workers Project and Caring Professionals as Asset‐Builders|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/full/10.1002/nha3.20200|journal=New Horizons in Adult Education and Human Resource Development|volume=29|issue=4|pages=51–55|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/nha3.20200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Who's role is it to deliver sexual education ===
Many people regard health education as a moral or religious issue, and therefore should be taught not in schools.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; "Before the late 1800s, delivering sex education in the United States and Canada was primarily seen as a parent’s responsibility.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Today, programs under the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) begin comprehensive sex education in pre-kindergarten, which many people believe is not age appropriate.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Many of those in favor of abstinence only education, usually fear any type of sexual education that encourages sexual behavior at a young age.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Is it necessary ===
Although CSE is seen as the polar opposite of abstinence only education, some critics believe that they are very similar. They both aim at preventing STIs and teen pregnancy. The only way in which they differ is through their primary goal. Abstinence only education aims at reducing premarital sex while comprehensive sex education acknowledges that premarital sex may happen and therefore seeks to reduce the unintended consequences of premarital sex through education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Studies in developing counties surrounding sex education have also shown that comprehensive sex education is not needed. General education, such as literacy skills, was seen to delay sexual initiation and reduced the likelihood of pregnancy. Therefore, some people believe general education is of more importance.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== Federal funding for sexual education ==
Although there is no federal mandate that requires states to teach sexual education, there is federal funding available to assist with sexual education programs.&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malone|first=Patrick and Monica Rodriguez|date=Spring 2011|title=Comprehensive Sex Education vs. Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage Programs|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/23032415|journal=Human Rights|volume=38|pages=5-22|via=JSTOR Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) ===
Historically, funding for abstinence education has always been favored over CSE. In 1996, during Bill Clinton's presidency, legislation was passed to promote abstinence in education programs. Under Title V Section 510 of the Social Security Act, the Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP), was passed. AEGP has always been renewed before its expiration date, and each time funds gradually increase from fifty million dollars per year to seventy-five and as high as $6.75 million per state grant in 2015. The way the funds are disbursed are based on the proportion of low-income children in each state. So far, thirty-six states have been given AEGP funds.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

==== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements ====
Part of Section 510(b) of Title V of the Social Security Act, contains the "A-H guidelines," which are the eight criteria that programs must abide by order to be eligible to receive federal funding.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; They are as follows:

A. Has as its exclusive purpose teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;

B. Teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school-age children;

C. Teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;&lt;p&gt;D. Teaches that a mutually faithful, monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of sexual activity;&lt;/p&gt;E. Teaches that sexual activity outside the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;

F. Teaches that bearing children out of wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, and society;&lt;p&gt;G. Teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increase vulnerability to sexual advances; and&lt;/p&gt;H. Teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

In addition to abiding by these 8 conditions, AGEP compliant programs cannot discuss contraception, STIs, or methods for protecting against STIs, except only when describing failure rates.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP) ===
More recently legislation has pushed for funding that goes beyond abstinence only education.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; In 2010, President Obama introduced the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP),  which provides a total of $114.5 million annually to sex education programs that are "medically accurate and age-appropriate."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; TPP falls under a subsection of United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") which is overseen by the Office of Adolescent Health. Funding for TPP is dispersed if "they emulate specific evidence-based programs promulgated under TPP."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; 

=== California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act ===
In January 2016, the California Healthy Youth Act, amended the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act to include minority groups and expand health education. Before it authorized schools to provide comprehensive sex education and required that all materials are made accessible to students with a variety of needs. It also focused solely on marital relationships. It now mandates that schools provide comprehensive sex education and states that "materials cannot be biased and must be appropriate for students of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as well as those with disabilities and English language learners." Additionally, education must now include "instruction about forming healthy and respectful committed relationships," regardless if marital status. Furthermore, it is now required to have discussions about all FDA-approved contraceptive methods in preventing pregnancy, including the morning after pill.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

In conclusion now requires that all sex education programs promulgated in the state should&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

*normalize sexuality as part of human development;
*ensure people receive integrated, comprehensive, accurate, and unbiased sexual health and HIV prevention and  instruction; and
*provide pupils with the knowledge and skills to have healthy, positive, and safe relationships.

== CSE as a human right ==
Some critics state that young people’s access to CSE is grounded in internationally recognized [[human rights]], which require governments to guarantee the overall protection of health, well-being and dignity, as per the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration on Human Rights]], and specifically to guarantee the provision of unbiased, scientifically accurate sexuality education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002431/243106e.pdf|title=Emerging evidence, lessons and practice in comprehensive sexuality education: A global review 2015|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100139-0|location=|pages=14, 15, 25, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights are protected by internationally ratified treaties, and lack of access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) education remains a barrier to complying with the obligations to ensure the rights to life, health, non-discrimination and information, a view that has been supported by the Statements of the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) Committee, and the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The commitment of individual states to realizing these rights has been reaffirmed by the international community, in particular the [[Commission on Population and Development]] (CPD), which – in its resolutions 2009/12 and 2012/13 – called on governments to provide young people with comprehensive education on human sexuality, SRH and [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other analysis show that comprehensive sex education is not an international right nor a human right because it not clearly stated in either a treaty nor custom. By international law, states are required to provide access to information and education about reproductive health, but this does not require a sex education curriculum. It may take different forms such as mandating that local school districts create a system for providing information to students, or mandating that health clinics and practitioners dispense information to patients.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== CSE in curricula ==

=== CSE teaching methods ===
As CSE gains momentum and interest at international, regional and national levels, governments are increasingly putting in place measures to scale-up their delivery of some form of life skills-based sexuality education, as well as seeking guidance on best practice, particularly regarding placement within the school [[curriculum]]. Sexuality education may be delivered as a stand-alone subject or integrated across relevant subjects within the school curricula. These options have direct implications for implementation, including teacher training, the ease of evaluating and revising curricula, the likelihood of curricula being delivered, and the methods through which it is delivered.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Within countries, choices about implementing integrated or stand-alone sexuality education are typically linked to national policies and overall organization of the curricula. The evidence base on the effectiveness of stand-alone vs. integrated sexuality education programming is still limited. However, there are discernible differences for policy-makers to consider when deciding the position of CSE within the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As a stand-alone subject, sexuality education is set apart from the rest of the curriculum, whether on its own or within a broader stand-alone health and life skills curriculum. This makes it more vulnerable to potentially being sacrificed due to time and budget constraints, since school curricula are typically overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

However, a stand-alone curriculum also presents opportunities for specialized teacher training pathways, and the use of non-formal teaching methodologies that aim to build learners’ critical thinking skills. The pedagogical approaches promoted through sexuality education – such as learner-centred methodologies, development of skills and values, group learning and peer engagement – are increasingly being recognized as transformative approaches that impact on learning and education more widely. As a standalone subject, it is also significantly easier to monitor, which is crucial in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of programming, and revising curricula where it is not delivering the desired learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

When sexuality education is integrated or infused, it is mainstreamed across a number of subject areas, such as biology, social studies, home economics or religious studies. While this model may reduce pressure on an overcrowded curriculum, it is difficult to monitor or evaluate, and may limit teaching methodologies to traditional approaches.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== CSE terminology ===
Apart from the different teaching methods, termiology also differs. Abortion, homosexuality, abstinence have connotations and definitions that vary state. For example, the word "abstinence" may refer to disengaging from all forms of sexual activities until marriage or may refer to only disengaging from sexual intercourse. Furthermore, the degree of sexual activity that "abstinence" connotates is often unclear, because sexual behavior that is not sexual intercourse may or may not be included in its definition. As a result, students are left confused about what activities are risky and teachers do not know what they can and cannot teach.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

The term "comprehensive," is also falls on spectrum, therefore can be considered an umbrella term. CSE means something radical for some institutions while it can mean something moderate and even conservative for others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sex Ed Debates|last=Kendall|first=Nancy|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Chicago and London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), the guidelines for comprehensive sexuality education are as follows:&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;appropriate to the age, developmental level, and cultural background of students;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;respects the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;complements and augments the sexuality education children receive from their families, religious and community groups, and healthcare professionals;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches not only about abstinence, but also contraception, including emergency contraception and reproductive choice;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) issues and questions issues;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches anatomy, development, puberty, and relationships;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches all of the other issues one would expect to be covered in a traditional sexuality education class; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;should be science-based and medically accurate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Sexual education exemption ===
Just as teaching methods and curricula vary by state,  excusal from sex education also varies by state. States may have with an opt out or opt in produce. In some states, students can opt out of receiving sexual education without specifying a particular reason. In other states, students can only opt out for religious or moral reasons. In an opt-in provision, parents must actively agree to allow their children to receive sex education prior to the start of the sexual education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

== Sexual content in the media  ==
Since 1997, the amount of sexual content on TV has nearly doubled in the United States.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skull|first=Tracie Marie et. al|date=2014|title=A Media Literacy Education Approach to Teaching Adolescents Comprehensive Sexual Health Education|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1043483|journal=Journal of Media Literacy Education|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–14|via=ERIC|pmid=27081579|pmc=4828968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study done in 2008 showed that nearly 40% of popular music lyrics contained sexual references which were often sexually degrading. These lyrics were also often accompanied with mentions of other risk behaviors, such as substance use and violence. &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Teens (ages 13-15) in the United States, use entertainment media as their top source for education in regards to sexuality and sexual health. Additionally, a study found that 15-19 year olds in the U.S use media far more than parents or schools to obtain information about birth control.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Some studies have found that, "very few teen television shows mention any of the responsibilities or risks (e.g., using contraception, pregnancy, STIs) associated with sex and almost none of the shows with sexual content include precaution, prevention, or negative outcomes as the primary theme." &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Television shows 16 and Pregnant and its spin-off, Teen Mom, which first aired on MTV in 2009 received major disapproval from some parents as they thought the shows glamorized teen pregnancy and motherhood. However, 16 and Pregnant actually led to a 4.3 percent reduction in teen pregnancy, mostly as a result of increased contraceptive use.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; In contrast, other data shows that exposure to high levels of sexual content on the television causes adolescents to have twice the risk of becoming pregnant in the following 3 years, compared to those who were exposed to low levels.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

The film Mean Girls, directed by Mark Waters shed light on the state sex education in some parts of the United States. In the film the health instructor states, "At your age, you're going to have a lot of urges. You're going to want to take off your clothes and touch each other. But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia and die." This line is meant to be satirical, but it illustrates common flaws within sex education in the U.S. It depicts simplistic descriptions of sexual activity and implementation of fear without any legitimate basis.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

Comprehensive sex education is the main topic in the documentary ''[[The Education of Shelby Knox]]'' released in 2005 about [[Lubbock, Texas]], which has one of the highest [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] rates in the nation. The "solution" to which is a strict [[abstinence-only sex education]] curriculum in the public schools and a conservative preacher who urges kids to pledge abstinence until marriage.

In 2013, ''[[How to Lose Your Virginity]]'' was released, a documentary that questioned the effectiveness of the [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only sex education movement]] and observed how [[sexuality]] continues to define a young woman's morality and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/06/24/how-to-lose-your-virginity-an-interview-with-therese-shechter/|title=How to Lose Your Virginity: An Interview with Therese Shechter|last=Dove-Viebahn|first=Aviva|date=June 24, 2010|publisher=Ms. Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/5548592/losing-your-virginity-is-harder-than-you-think|title=Losing Your Virginity Is Harder Than You Think|last=Stein|first=Sadie|date=May 26, 2010|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning and necessity of virginity as a [[social construct]] is also examined through narration and interviews with notable sexuality experts, such as former Surgeon General [[Joycelyn Elders|Dr. Joycelyn Elders]], "Scarleteen"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarleteen.com/about_scarleteen|title=About Scarleteen|website=www.scarleteen.com|accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; creator and editor [[Heather Corinna]], historian [[Hanne Blank]], author [[Jessica Valenti]], and [[sex education|comprehensive sex education]] advocate [[Shelby Knox]].

Not only have films portrayed sex education, but so has [[social media]].  Platforms such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], [[Vine (service)|Vine]], and others are used as a tool to uplift the narratives of marginalized communities such as [[Person of color|persons of color]]  and LGBTQIA+ persons in hopes to "strengthen sexual health equity for all."&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

As a result of the mass amount of sex content in media, media literacy education (MLE) has emerged. It was created to address the influence of unhealthy media messages on risky health decisions, such as intention to use substances, body image issues, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; A study analyzed the effectiveness of a teacher-led MLE program, called Media Aware Sexual Health (MASH), which provides students with accurate health information and teaches them how to apply that information to critical analysis of media messages. This comprehensive sex education resulted in increased intentions to talk to a parent, partner and medical professional prior to sexual activity, and intentions for condom use.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Due to knowledge gaps in most sex education curricula for teens, free online resources like [[Sex, Etc.]] and teensource.org&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teensource.org/content/about-us|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=teensource.org|publisher=TeenSource|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been created to promote comprehensive, inclusive sex education for teenagers.

{{Redirect|Busing||Busing (disambiguation)}}
'''Desegregation busing''' in the United States (also known as '''forced busing''' or simply '''busing'''{{cn|date=February 2018}}) is the practice of assigning and [[student transport|transporting students to schools]] so as to redress prior [[racial segregation]] of schools, or to overcome the effects of residential segregation on local school demographics.

In 1954, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] landmark decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' declared racial segregation in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] unconstitutional. The process of integrating public schools met fierce resistance in the South where segregation laws took hold after the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction Era of the United States]]. In Northern and Western states, ''de facto'' segregation was the customary practice. Due to patterns of residential segregation, a principal tool for racial integration was the use of busing.&lt;ref name="Jost 345–372"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=Kenneth|title=School Desegregation|journal=CQ Researcher|date=April 23, 2004|volume=14|issue=15|pages=345–372}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1971 ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'' ruling, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal courts had the discretion to include busing as a desegregation tool to achieve racial balance. While the ''Swann'' decision addressed ''de jure'' segregation in the South, it failed to address ''de facto'' segregation which persisted elsewhere in the country. In Georgia, Governor [[Jimmy Carter]] saw that ''Swann'' was "clearly a one-sided decision; the Court is still talking about the South, the North is still going free".&lt;ref name=patterson/&gt; In the 1974 ''[[Milliken v. Bradley]]'' decision, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] placed an important limitation on ''Swann'' when they ruled that students could be bused across district lines only when evidence of ''de jure'' segregation across multiple school districts existed.

In the 1970s and 1980s, under federal court supervision, many school districts implemented mandatory busing plans within their district. A few of these plans are still in use today. An example of stiff resistance to desegregation busing was the [[Restore Our Alienated Rights]] movement in [[Boston]].

Since the 1980s, desegregation busing has been in decline. Even though school districts provided [[zero-fare]] [[bus]] transportation to and from students' assigned schools, those schools were in some cases many miles away from students' homes, which often presented problems to them and their families. In addition, many families were angry about having to send their children miles to another school in an unfamiliar neighborhood when there was an available school a short distance away. The movement of large numbers of white families to suburbs of large cities, so-called [[white flight]], reduced the effectiveness of the policy.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York,  New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= |pages= 252–264|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many whites who stayed moved their children into [[private school|private]] or [[parochial schools]]; these effects combined to make many urban school districts predominantly nonwhite, reducing any effectiveness mandatory busing may have had.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; In addition, school districts started using [[magnet school]]s, new school construction, and more detailed computer-generated information to refine their school assignment plans.

==History==

===Before World War II===
{{further|Black school}}

Prior to [[World War&amp;nbsp; II]], most public schools in the country were ''de jure'' or ''de facto'' segregated. All [[ Southern United States|Southern states]] had [[Jim Crow Laws|Jim Crow laws]] mandating racial segregation of schools. Northern states and some border states were primarily white (as of 1940, populations of Detroit and Chicago were more than 90% white) and, furthermore, existing black populations were concentrated in urban ghettos partly as the result of restrictive covenants.

===After World War II===
The origins of desegregation busing can be traced back to two major developments that occurred in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s.

====Black population shift====
Starting in 1940, the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] brought five million blacks from the agrarian South to the urban and manufacturing centers in Northern and Western cities to fill in the labor shortages during the industrial buildup of [[World War II]] and for better opportunities during the post-war economic boom. ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' (1948) allowed them to settle in formerly white neighborhoods, contributing to racial tension. Meanwhile, the post-war housing boom and the rise of [[suburbia]] allowed whites to migrate into the suburbs. By 1960, all major Northern and Western cities had sizable black populations (e.g., 23% in Chicago, 29% in Detroit, and 32% in Los Angeles). Blacks tended to be concentrated in [[inner cities]], whereas newer suburbs of most cities were almost exclusively white.

====Legal rulings====

At the same time, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Brown vs Board of Education]]'' (1954) overturned [[racial segregation]] laws for public schools that had been in place in a number of states since the late 19th century, and ruled that [[separate but equal]] schools were "inherently unequal". Although the ''Brown'' decision affirmed principles of equality and justice, it did not specify how its ruling would promote equality in education. [[Thurgood Marshall]] and the [[NAACP]] wanted a speedy process for desegregating the school districts, but the Court waited until the following year to make its recommendations. Reasons for delaying had to do with the changes in the Court and with Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] steering a careful course given the expected opposition from Southern states.  In May 1955, the Court ruled in ''[[Brown&amp;nbsp; II]]'' that the school districts desegregate "with all deliberate speed". Public school administrators had to begin the process of desegregating the schools through the development of policies that would promote racial mixing.  A backlash of resistance and violence ensued.  Even members of Congress refused to abide by the decision.  In 1956 over a hundred congressmen signed the [[Southern Manifesto]], promising to use all legal means to undermine and reverse the Court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Journal|last=Jost|first=K|title=School Desegregation|journal=CQ Researcher|date=April 23, 2004|volume=14|issue=15|pages=345–372.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The momentum continued with two additional Supreme Court decisions aimed at implementation.  In 1968, the Warren Court in ''[[Green v. County School Board of New Kent County]]'', rejected a freedom of choice plan.  The Court ordered the county to desegregate immediately and eliminate racial discrimination "root and branch".&lt;ref name=patterson/&gt; Then in 1971, the [[Burger Court]] in ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'' ruled that the school district must achieve racial balance even if it meant redrawing school boundaries and the use of busing as a legal tool.  The impact of ''Green'' and ''Swann'' served to end all remnants of ''de jure'' segregation in the South. However, the consequence of the ''Swann'' decision ushered in new forms of resistance in subsequent decades.  The decision failed to address ''de facto'' segregation.

Consequently, despite being found "inherently unequal" in ''Brown v. Board of Education'', by the late 1960s public schools remained ''de facto'' segregated in many cities because of demographic patterns, school district lines being intentionally drawn to segregate the schools racially, and, in some cases, due to conscious efforts to send black children to inferior schools.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan v. Hennigan 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for example, by 1969, more than nine of every ten black students in [[Nashville]] still attended all-black schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southernspaces.org/2009/walking-history-beginning-school-desegregation-nashville|title=Walking into History: The Beginning of School Desegregation in Nashville}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of such de facto segregation motivated early proponents of plans to engage in conscious "integration" of public schools, by busing schoolchildren to schools other than their neighborhood schools, with an objective to equalize racial imbalances. Proponents of such plans argued that with the schools integrated, minority students would have equal access to equipment, facilities, and resources that the cities' white students had, thus giving all students in the city equal educational opportunities.

A federal court found that in [[Boston]], schools were constructed and school district lines drawn intentionally to segregate the schools racially. In the early 1970s, a series of court decisions found that the racially imbalanced schools trampled the rights of minority students. As a remedy, courts ordered the [[racial integration]] of school districts within individual cities, sometimes requiring the racial composition of each individual school in the district to reflect the composition of the district as a whole. This was generally achieved by transporting children by [[school bus]] to a school in a different area of the district.

The judge who instituted the Detroit busing plan said that busing "is a considerably safer, more reliable, healthful and efficient means of getting children to school than either carpools or walking, and this is especially true for younger children".&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; He, therefore, included [[kindergarten]] children in the busing scheme: "Transportation of kindergarten children for upwards of forty-five minutes, one-way, does not appear unreasonable, harmful, or unsafe in any way."&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; The resultant Supreme Court case, ''[[Milliken v. Bradley]]'', imposed limits on busing.  The key issue was whether a district court could order a metropolitan-wide desegregation plan between urban Detroit and suburban school districts.  Busing would play a key role in the implementation phase. The Court essentially declared that federal courts did not have the authority to order inter-district desegregation unless it could be proven that suburban school districts intentionally mandated segregation policies.  The implication of the decision was that suburban school districts in the North were not affected by the principles established by ''Brown''. ''De facto'' segregation was allowed to persist in the North. The courts could order desegregation where segregation patterns existed, but only within municipalities, not suburban areas.  The lasting consequence of the ''Milliken'' decision is that it opened the door for whites to flee to the suburbs and not be concerned about compliance with mandatory integration policies.&lt;ref name=patterson/&gt;

With waning public support, the courts began relaxing judicial supervision of school districts during the 1990s and 2000s, calling for voluntary efforts to achieve racial balance. In the early 1990s, the [[Rehnquist Court]] ruled in three cases coming from [[Oklahoma City]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], and [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]] in Georgia that federal judges could ease their supervision of school districts "once legally enforced segregation had been eliminated to the extent practicable".&lt;ref name=jost&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=K.|title=School Desegregation|journal=CQ Researcher|date=April 23, 2004|volume=14|issue=15|pages=345–372}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these decisions, the Rehnquist Court opened the door for school districts throughout the country to get away from under judicial supervision once they had achieved unitary status.  [[Unitary Status]] meant that a school district had successfully eliminated segregation in dual school systems and thus was no longer bound to court-ordered desegregation policies.

Then in 2002, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision in ''[[Belk v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'' which declared that the school system had achieved desegregation status and that the method to achieve integration, like busing, was unnecessary. The refusal of the Court to hear the challenges to the lower court decision effectively overturned the earlier 1971 ''Swann'' ruling.

Finally, in 2007, the [[Roberts Court]] produced a contentious 5–4 ruling in ''[[Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No.&amp;nbsp;1]]'' (PICS). The decision prohibited the use of racial classifications in student assignment plans to maintain racial balance. Whereas the Brown case ruled that racial segregation violated the Constitution, now the use of racial classifications violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. However, Justice Kennedy's concurrence did hold that “avoiding racial isolation” and addressing “the problem of de facto resegregation in schooling” remain compelling state interests which can be addressed by narrowly tailored programs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/washington/29scotus.html|title=Justices Limit the Use of Race in School Plans for Integration|journal=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the minority, Justice Breyer said the "ruling contradicted previous decisions upholding race-conscious pupil assignments and would hamper local school boards' efforts to prevent 'resegregation' in individual schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=Kenneth|title=Racial Diversity in Public Schools|journal=CQ Researcher|year=2007|volume=17|issue=32|pages=745–767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil rights movement===

The struggle to desegregate the schools received impetus from the [[Civil Rights Movement]], whose goal was to dismantle legal segregation in all public places. The movement's efforts culminated in Congress passing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. Signed by President [[Lyndon Johnson]], the two laws signaled the end of discriminatory voting practices and segregation of public accommodations.  The importance of these two laws was the injection of both the [[legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] branches joining the judiciary to promote racial integration.  In addition, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorized the federal government to cut off funding if Southern school districts did not comply and also to bring lawsuits against school officials who resisted.&lt;ref name=patterson&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=James|title=''Brown v. Board of Education'': A Civil Rights Milestone and Its Troubled Legacy (Pivotal Moments in American History)|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|isbn=0-19-515632-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One argument against the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] that opponents of the proposed legislation found particularly compelling was that the bill would require forced busing to achieve certain [[racial quotas]] in schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Proponents of the bill, such as [[Emanuel Celler]] and [[Jacob Javits]], said that the bill would not authorize such measures. Leading sponsor Sen. [[Hubert Humphrey]] wrote two amendments specifically designed to outlaw busing.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Humphrey said "if the bill were to compel it, it would be a violation [of the Constitution], because it would be handling the matter on the basis of race and we would be transporting children because of race".&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; While Javits said any government official who sought to use the bill for busing purposes "would be making a fool of himself", two years later the [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] said that Southern school districts would be required to meet mathematical ratios of students by busing.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt;

===Sociological study===
Another catalyst for the development of busing was an influential [[sociological]] report on educational equality commissioned by the U.S. government in the 1960s. It was one of the largest studies in history, with more than 150,000 students in the sample. The result was a massive report of over 700 pages. That 1966 report—titled "Equality of Educational Opportunity" (or often simply called the "Coleman Report" after its author [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]])—contained many controversial findings.&lt;ref name="Kiviat"&gt;Kiviat, Barbara J. (2000) "[http://www.jhu.edu/~jhumag/0400web/18.html The Social Side of Schooling]", ''Johns Hopkins Magazine'', April 2000, accessed 30 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanushek"&gt;Hanushek, Eric A. (1998), "[http://newyorkfed.org/research/epr/98v04n1/9803hanu.pdf Conclusions and Controversies about the Effectiveness of School Resources]", ''Economic Policy Review'', Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 4(1): pp. 11-27, accessed 30 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One conclusion from the study was that, while black schools in the South were not significantly underfunded as compared to white schools, and while per-pupil funding did not contribute significantly to differences in educational outcomes, socially disadvantaged black children still benefited significantly from learning in mixed-race classrooms. Thus, it was argued that busing (as opposed to simply increasing funding to segregated schools) was necessary for achieving racial equality.

===Reaction===
====Before 2007====
The impact of the ''Brown v. Board of Education'' ruling was limited because whites and blacks tended to live in all-white or all-black communities. Initial integration in the South tended to be symbolic: for example, the integration of [[Clinton High School (Clinton, Tennessee)|Clinton High School]], the first public school in Tennessee to be integrated, amounted to the admission of twelve black students to a formerly all-white school.

"Forced busing" was a term used by many to describe the mandates that generally came from the courts. Court-ordered busing to achieve school desegregation was used mainly in large, ethnically segregated school systems, including [[Boston]], Massachusetts; [[Cleveland]] and [[Columbus, Ohio]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and [[San Francisco]], California; [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], Virginia; [[Detroit]], Michigan; and [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. From 1972 to 1980, despite busing, the percentage of blacks attending mostly-black schools barely changed, moving from 63.6 percent to 63.3 percent.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt;

In some southern states in the 1960s and 1970s, parents opposed to busing created new private schools. The schools, called [[segregation academies]], were sometimes organized with the support of the local [[White Citizen's Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Citizen's Council: Organized Resistance to the Second Reconstruction, 1954–1964| page = 301 | last = McMillen | first = Neil R. | publisher = [[University of Illinois Press]] | year = 1971 | place = Urbana | isbn = 0-252-00177-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1975–76 school year, the [[Louisville, Kentucky]] school district, which was not integrated due to whites largely moving to the suburbs, was forced to start a busing program.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; The first day, 1,000 protestors rallied against the busing, and a few days into the process, 8,000 to 10,000 whites from [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]], [[Kentucky]], many teenagers, rallied at the district's high schools and fought with police trying to break up the crowds.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Police cars were vandalized, 200 were arrested, and people were hurt in the melee, but despite further rallies being banned the next day by Louisville's mayor, demonstrators showed up to the schools the following day.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Kentucky Governor [[Julian Carroll]] sent 1,800 members of the [[Kentucky National Guard]] and stationed them on every bus.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; On September 26, 1975, 400 protestors held a rally at [[Southern High School (Kentucky)|Southern High School]], which was broken up by police [[tear gas]], followed by a rally of 8,000 the next day, who marched led by a woman in a [[wheelchair]] to prevent police reprisals while cameras were running.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Despite the protests, Louisville's busing program continued.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt;

====After 2007====
Civil rights advocates see the 2007 ruling of the Roberts court as the inevitable consequence of gradual court decisions dating back to the early 1970s to ease judicial supervision and limit important tools to achieve integrated schools. Even those school districts that voluntarily created race-conscious programs are under pressure to abandon these efforts as the white parents are refusing to participate in any pupil assignment programs. In some cases, white parents filed [[reverse discrimination]] lawsuits in court.  Wherever the courts have backed away from mandating school districts to implement desegregation plans, resegregation of Blacks and Latinos has increased dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Orfield, G. |author2=Lee, C. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Historic reversals, accelerating resegregation, and the need for new integration strategies|year=2007|publisher=Los Angeles: The Civil Rights Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, 44 percent of southern black students were attending majority-white schools.  In 2005, 27 percent of black students were attending majority white schools. By restricting the tools by which schools can address school segregation, many fear that the PICS decision will continue to accelerate this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brennancenter.org/legal-work/parents-involved-community-schools-v-seattle-school-district-no-1|title=Brennan Center for Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling reflects the culmination of the conservatives' central message on education that "race should be ignored, inequalities should be blamed on individuals and schools, and existing civil rights remedies should be dismantled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfield|first=G|title=Reviving the goal of an integrated society: A 21st century challenge|year=2009|publisher=Los Angeles: The Civil Rights Project|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 Congress passed the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB) which was promptly signed by President [[George W. Bush]]. The law put a premium on student testing, not integration, to measure academic progress.  Financial penalties were incurred on schools if students did not demonstrate adequate academic performance. While initially supported by Democrats, critics say, the law has failed to adequately address the achievement gap between whites and minorities and that there are problems with implementation and inflexible provisions.&lt;ref name="Jost 345–372"/&gt;

==Criticism==
In a [[Gallup poll]] taken in the early 1970s, very low percentages of whites (4 percent) and blacks (9 percent) supported busing outside of local neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; A 1978 study by the [[RAND Corporation]] set out to find why whites were opposed to busing and concluded that it was not because they held [[racism|racist]] attitudes, but because they believed it destroyed neighborhood schools and camaraderie and increased discipline problems.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; It is said that busing eroded the community pride and support that neighborhoods had for their local schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; After busing, 60 percent of Boston parents, both black and white, reported more discipline problems in schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]], [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]], and [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]] presidential elections, candidates opposed to busing were elected each time, and Congress voted repeatedly to end court-mandated busing.&lt;ref name="'70s 265"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 265|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics point out that children in the Northeast were often bused from integrated schools to less integrated schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; The percentage of Northeastern black children who attended a predominantly black school increased from 67 percent in 1968 to 80 percent in 1980 (a higher percentage than in 1954).&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt;

Busing is claimed to have accelerated a trend of middle-class relocation to the suburbs of metropolitan areas.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Many opponents of busing claimed the existence of "[[white flight]]" based on the court decisions to integrate schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Such stresses led white middle-class families in many communities to desert the public schools and create a network of private schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt;

Ultimately, many black leaders, from [[Wisconsin]] State Rep. [[Annette Polly Williams]], a Milwaukee Democrat, to [[Cleveland]] Mayor [[Michael R.

In 1978, a proponent of busing, Nancy St. John, studied 100 cases of urban busing from the North and did not find what she had been looking for;&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; she found no cases in which significant black academic improvement occurred, but many cases where race relations suffered due to busing, as those in forced-integrated schools had worse relations with those of the opposite race than those in non-integrated schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Researcher David Armour, also looking for hopeful signs, found that busing "heightens racial identity" and "reduces opportunities for actual contact between the races".&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt;
A 1992 study led by [[Harvard University]] Professor [[Gary Orfield]], who supports busing, found black and Hispanic students lacked "even modest overall improvement" as a result of court-ordered busing.&lt;ref name="Status of School Desegregation"&gt;{{cite book |title= Status of School Desegregation: The Next Generation|last= Orfield|first= Gary|authorlink= David Frum|author2=Franklin Monfort|year= 1992|publisher= National School Boards Association|location= Alexandria, VA|isbn= 0-88364-174-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, ''[[60 Minutes]]'' reported that some members of Congress, government, and the press who supported busing most vociferously sent their own children to private schools, including Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]], [[George McGovern]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], [[Phil Hart]], [[Ben Bradlee]], Senator [[Birch Bayh]], [[Tom Wicker]], [[Philip Geyelin]], and [[Donald M.

==Historical examples==

===Boston, Massachusetts===
{{Main article|Boston busing crisis}}
In 1965 Massachusetts passed into law the Racial Imbalance Act, which ordered school districts to desegregate or risk losing state educational funding. The first law of its kind in the nation, it was opposed by many in Boston, especially less-well-off white ethnic areas, such as the Irish-American neighborhoods of [[South Boston]] &amp; [[Charlestown, Boston]].&lt;ref name = "NYT-Fox-2012-01-29"&gt;

===Springfield, Massachusetts===
Unlike Boston, which experienced a large degree of racial violence following Judge [[Arthur Garrity]]'s decision to desegregate the city's public schools in 1974, Springfield quietly enacted its own desegregation busing plans. Although not as well-documented as Boston's crisis, Springfield's situation centered on the city's elementary schools. Much of the primary evidence for Springfield's busing plans stemmed from a March 1976 report by a committee for the Massachusetts Commission on Civil Rights (MCCR). According to the report, 30 of the city's 36 elementary schools were grouped into six separate districts during the 1974–75 school year, and each district contained at least one racially imbalanced school. The basic idea behind the "six-district" plan was to preserve a neighborhood feeling for school children while busing them locally to improve not only racial imbalances, but also educational opportunities in the school system.&lt;ref name=mccr&gt;Massachusetts Commission on Civil Rights, "[http://www.law.umaryland.edu/marshall/usccr/documents/cr1259.pdf The Six-District Plan: Integration of the Springfield, Mass., Elementary Schools]", ''University of Maryland Law School Library'', pp.1-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kansas City, Missouri===
{{See also|Missouri v. Jenkins}}
In 1985, a federal court took partial control of the [[Kansas City, Missouri School District]] (KCMSD). Since the district and the state had been found [[severally liable]] for the lack of integration, the state was responsible for making sure that money was available for the program. It was one of the most expensive desegregation efforts attempted and included busing, a magnet school program, and an extensive plan to improve the quality of [[inner city]] schools. The entire program was built on the premise that extremely good schools in the inner-city area combined with paid busing would be enough to achieve integration.

===Las Vegas, Nevada===
In May 1968, the [[Southern Nevada]] chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) filed a lawsuit against the [[Clark County School District]] (CCSD). The NAACP wanted the CCSD to acknowledge publicly, and likewise, act against the ''de facto'' segregation that existed in six elementary schools located on the city's Westside.&lt;ref name=ronan&gt;Matthew, Ronan, ''A History of the Las Vegas School Desegregation Case: Kelly et al. v. Clark County School District'' (Las Vegas: UNLV, 1998), pp. 28, 33, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; This area of Las Vegas had traditionally been a [[black neighborhood]]. Therefore, the CCSD did not see the need to desegregate the schools, as the cause of segregation appeared to result from factors outside of its immediate control.

The case initially entered the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada, but quickly found its way to the [[Nevada Supreme Court]]. According to [[Brown&amp;nbsp;II]], all school desegregation cases had to be heard at the federal level if they reached a state's highest court. As a result, the Las Vegas case, which became known as ''Kelly v. Clark County School District'', was eventually heard by the U.S. [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]]. On May 10, 1972, the Ninth Circuit handed down its decision in favor of the NAACP, which therefore required the CCSD to implement a plan for integration. The CCSD then instituted its ''Sixth Grade Center Plan'', which converted the Westside's six elementary schools into sixth-grade classrooms where nearly all of the school district's sixth graders (black and white alike) would be bused for the 1972–73 school year.&lt;ref name=ronan/&gt;

===Los Angeles, California===
In 1963, a lawsuit, ''Crawford v. Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles'',&lt;ref&gt;Crawford v. Board of Ed. of Los Angeles {{ussc|458|527|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; was filed to end segregation in the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]].  The [[California Supreme Court]] required the district to come up with a plan in 1977.  The board returned to court with what the court of appeal years later would describe as "one of if not the most drastic plan of mandatory student reassignment in the nation".&lt;ref&gt;''Crawford v. Board of Educ. of the City of Los Angeles'', 200 Cal. App. 3d 1397, 1402 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  A desegregation busing plan was developed, to be implemented in the 1978 school year.  Two suits to stop the enforced busing plan, both titled ''Bustop, Inc. v. Los Angeles Board of Education'', were filed by the group Bustop Inc., and were petitioned to the [[United States Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bustop, Inc. v. Los Angeles Bd. of Ed.'', {{ussc|439|1380|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The petitions to stop the busing plan were subsequently denied by [[Justice Rehnquist]] and [[Justice Powell]].  California Constitutional Proposition&amp;nbsp;1, which mandated that busing follow the [[Equal protection clause]] of the U.S. Constitution, passed in 1979 with 70 percent of the vote.  The ''Crawford v. Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles'' lawsuit was heard in the Supreme Court in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Ettinger, "[http://www.lacba.org/Files/LAL/Vol26No1/1302.pdf The Quest to DESEGREGATE Los Angeles Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228005530/http://www.lacba.org/Files/LAL/Vol26No1/1302.pdf |date=2008-02-28 }}", ''Los Angeles Lawyer'', March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court upheld the decision that Proposition&amp;nbsp;1 was constitutional, and that, therefore, mandatory busing was not permissible.

===Nashville, Tennessee===
In comparison with many other cities in the nation, [[Nashville]] was not a hotbed of racial violence or massive protest during the civil rights era. In fact, the city was a leader of school desegregation in the South, even housing a few small schools that were minimally integrated before the ''Brown v. Board of Education'' decision in 1954. Despite this initial breakthrough, however, full desegregation of the schools was a far cry from reality in Nashville in the mid-1950s, and thus 22 plaintiffs, including black student Robert Kelley, filed suit against the Nashville Board of Education in 1955.

The result of that lawsuit was what came to be known as the [["Nashville Plan"]], an attempt to integrate the public schools of Nashville (and later all of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] when the district was consolidated in 1963). The plan, beginning in 1957, involved the gradual integration of schools by working up through the grades each year starting in the fall of 1957 with first graders. Very few black children who had been zoned for white schools showed up at their assigned campus on the first day of school, and those who did met with angry mobs outside several city elementary schools. No white children assigned to black schools showed up to their assigned campuses.

After a decade of this gradual integration strategy, it became evident that the schools still lacked full integration. Many argued that [[Housing Segregation]] was the true culprit in the matter. In 1970 the ''Kelley'' case was reintroduced to the courts. Ruling on the case was Judge [[Leland Clure Morton]], who, after seeking advice from consultants from the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]], decided the following year that to correct the problem, forced busing of the children was to be mandated, among the many parts to a new plan that was finally decided on. This was a similar plan to that enacted in [[Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], the same year.

What followed were mixed emotions from both the black and white communities. Many whites did not want their children to share schools with black children, arguing that it would decrease the quality of their education. While a triumph for some, many blacks believed that the new plan would enforce the closure of neighborhood schools such as Pearl High School, which brought the community together. Parents from both sides did not like the plan because they had no control over where their children were going to be sent to school, a problem that many other cities had during the 1970s when busing was mandated across the country. Despite the judge's decision and the subsequent implementation of the new busing plan, the city stood divided.

As in many other cities across the country at this time, many white citizens took action against the desegregation laws. Organized protests against the busing plan began before the order was even official, led by future mayoral candidate Casey Jenkins. While some protested, many other white parents began pulling their children out of the public schools and enrolling them in the numerous private schools that began to spring up almost overnight in Nashville in the 1960s and 1970s. Many of these schools continued to be segregated through the 1970s. Other white parents moved outside of the city limits and eventually outside the Davidson County line so as not to be part of the Metropolitan District and thus not part of the busing plan.

In 1979 and 1980, the ''Kelley'' case was again brought back to the courts because of the busing plan's failure to fully integrate the [[Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools]] (MNPS). The plan was reexamined and reconfigured to include some concessions made by the school board and the Kelley plaintiffs and in 1983 the new plan, which still included busing, was introduced. However, problems with "[[white flight]]" and private schools continued to segregate MNPS to a certain degree, a problem that has never fully been solved.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Pride and J. David Woodard, ''The Burden of Busing: The Politics of Desegregation in Nashville, Tennessee'', University of Tennessee Press, Knoxville: 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pasadena, California===
In 1970 a [[United States district court|federal court]] ordered the desegregation of the public schools in [[Pasadena, California]]. At that time, the proportion of white students in those schools reflected the proportion of whites in the community, 54 percent and 53 percent, respectively. After the desegregation process began, large numbers of whites in the upper and middle classes who could afford it pulled their children from the integrated public school system and placed them into private schools instead. As a result, by 2004 Pasadena became home to 63 private schools, which educated one-third of all school-aged children in the city, and the proportion of white students in the public schools had fallen to 16 percent. In the meantime, the proportion of whites in the community has declined somewhat as well, to 37 percent in 2006. The superintendent of Pasadena's public schools characterized them as being to whites "like the bogey-man", and mounted policy changes, including a curtailment of busing, and a publicity drive to induce affluent whites to put their children back into public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penfamilies.org/www/pen/Files/LA%20Daily%20Journal%20Article%20on%20Pasadena%20School%20Reform.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616180135/http://www.penfamilies.org/www/pen/Files/LA%20Daily%20Journal%20Article%20on%20Pasadena%20School%20Reform.doc |archivedate=2007-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prince George's County, Maryland===
{{unreferenced section |date=October 2014}}
In 1974, [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]], Maryland, became the largest school district in the United States forced to adopt a busing plan. The county, a large suburban school district east of [[Washington, D.C.]], was over 80 percent white in population and in the public schools. In some county communities close to Washington, there was a higher concentration of black residents than in more outlying areas. Through a series of desegregation orders after the ''Brown'' decision, the county had a neighborhood-based system of school boundaries. However, the [[NAACP]] argued that housing patterns in the county still reflected the vestiges of segregation. Against the will of the Board of Education of Prince George's County, the federal court ordered that a school busing plan be set in place. A 1974 [[Gallup poll]] showed that 75 percent of county residents were against forced busing and that only 32 percent of blacks supported it.

The transition was very traumatic as the court ordered that the plan be administered with "all due haste". This happened during the middle of the school term, and students even in their senior year in high school were transferred to different schools to achieve racial balance. Many high school sports teams' seasons and other typical school activities were disrupted. Life in general for families in the county was disrupted by things such as the changes in daily times to get children ready and receive them after school, transportation logistics for extracurricular activities, and parental participation activities such as volunteer work in the schools and [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] meetings.

The federal case and the school busing order was officially ended in 2001, as the "remaining vestiges of segregation" had been erased to the court's satisfaction. Neighborhood-based school boundaries were restored. The Prince George's County Public Schools was ordered to pay the [[NAACP]] more than $2 million in closing attorney fees and is estimated to have paid the NAACP over $20 million over the course of the case.

===Richmond, Virginia===
In April 1971, in the case ''Bradley v. Richmond School Board'', Federal District Judge [[Robert R. Merhige,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], ordered an extensive citywide busing program in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], Virginia. When the massive busing program began in the fall of 1971, parents of all races complained about the long rides, hardships with transportation for extracurricular activities, and the separation of siblings when elementary schools at opposite sides of the city were "paired", (i.e., splitting lower and upper elementary grades into separate schools). The result was further white flight to private schools and to suburbs in the neighboring counties of [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico]] and [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield]] that were predominately white. In January 1972, Merhige ruled that students in Henrico and Chesterfield counties would have to be bused into the City of Richmond in order to decrease the high percentage of black students in Richmond's schools. This order was overturned by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 6, 1972, barring forced busing schemes that made students cross county/city boundaries. (Note: Since 1871, Virginia has had independent cities which are not politically located within counties, although some are completely surrounded geographically by a single county. This distinctive and unusual arrangement was pivotal in the Court of Appeals decision overturning Merhige's ruling). The percentage of white students in Richmond city schools declined from 45 to 21 percent between 1960 and 1975 and continued to decline over the next several decades. By 2010 white students accounted for less than 9 percent of student enrollment in Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richmond.com/news/latest-news/report-schools-segregation-by-race-income-worsening/article_a05050c1-9ea8-5ebd-b00a-239aab565e7f.html&lt;/ref&gt; This so-called "white flight" prevented Richmond schools from ever becoming truly integrated.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.vahistorical.org/civilrights/busing.htm School Busing - The Civil Rights Movement in Virginia]", Virginia Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt; A number of assignment plans were tried to address the non-racial concerns, and eventually, most elementary schools were "unpaired".

===Wilmington, Delaware===
In [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], Delaware, located in [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], segregated schools were required by law until 1954, when, due to ''[[Belton v. Gebhart]]'' (which was later rolled into ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' on appeal), the school system was forced to desegregate. As a result, the school districts in the Wilmington metropolitan area were split into eleven districts covering the metropolitan area (Alfred I. duPont, Alexis I. duPont, Claymont, Conrad, De La Warr, Marshallton-McKean, Mount Pleasant, New Castle-Gunning Bedford, Newark, Stanton, and Wilmington school districts). However, this reorganization did little to address the issue of segregation, since the Wilmington schools (Wilmington and De La Warr districts) remained predominantly black, while the suburban schools in the county outside the city limits remained predominantly white.

In 1976, the U.S. District Court, in ''[[Evans v. Buchanan]]'', ordered that the school districts of New Castle County all be combined into a single district governed by the New Castle County Board of Education.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel B. Hoff, "[http://www.iccjournal.biz/Scholarly_Articles/Hoff,%20S/DelawareEducationandDesegregation.htm Delaware's Constitution and Its Impact on Education]"&lt;/ref&gt; The District Court ordered the Board to implement a desegregation plan in which the students from the predominantly black Wilmington and De La Warr districts were required to attend school in the predominantly white suburb districts, while students from the predominantly white districts were required to attend school in Wilmington or De La Warr districts for three years (usually 4th through 6th grade). In many cases, this required students to be bused a considerable distance (12–18 miles in the [[Christina School District]]) because of the distance between Wilmington and some of the major communities of the suburban area (such as [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]]).

However, the process of handling an entire metropolitan area as a single school district resulted in a revision to the plan in 1981, in which the New Castle County schools were again divided into four separate districts ([[Brandywine School District|Brandywine]], [[Christina School District|Christina]], [[Colonial School District (Delaware)|Colonial]], and [[Red Clay School District|Red Clay]])[http://www.iccjournal.biz/Scholarly_Articles/Hoff,%20S/DelawareEducationandDesegregation.htm]. However, unlike the 1954 districts, each of these districts was racially balanced and encompassed inner city and suburban areas. Each of the districts continued a desegregation plan based upon busing.

The requirements for maintaining racial balance in the schools of each of the districts was ended by the District Court in 1994, but the process of busing students to and from the suburbs for schooling continued largely unchanged until 2001, when the Delaware state government passed House Bill 300, mandating that the districts convert to sending students to the schools closest to them, a process that continues {{As of|2007|lc=on}}. In the 1990s, Delaware schools would utilize the Choice program, which would allow children to apply to schools in other school districts based on space.

Wilmington High, which, many felt, was a victim of the busing order, closed in 1998 due to dropping enrollment. The campus would become home to [[Cab Calloway School of the Arts]], a magnet school focused on the arts that was established in 1992. It would also house [[Charter School of Wilmington]], which focuses on math and science, and opened up in 1996.

Delaware currently has some of the highest rates in the nation of children who attend private schools, magnet schools, and charter schools, due to the perceived weaknesses of the public school system.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

== Re-segregation ==
{{See also|Auto-segregation|White flight|School segregation in the United States}}
According to the Civil Rights Project at [[Harvard University]], the desegregation of U.S. public schools peaked in 1988; since then, schools have become more segregated because of changes in demographic residential patterns with continuing growth in suburbs and new communities. [[Jonathan Kozol]] has found that as of 2005, the proportion of black students at majority-white schools was at "a level lower than in any year since 1968".&lt;ref&gt;Kozol, J. [https://www.thenation.com/article/overcoming-apartheid/ "Overcoming Apartheid"], ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', December 19, 2005. Retrieved April 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Changing population patterns, with dramatically increased growth in the South and Southwest, decreases in old industrial cities, and much increased immigration of new ethnic groups, have altered school populations in many areas.

School districts continue to try various programs to improve student and school performance, including magnet schools and special programs related to the economic standing of families.  Omaha proposed incorporating some suburban districts within city limits to enlarge its school-system catchment area. It wanted to create a "one tax, one school" system that would also allow it to create magnet programs to increase diversity in now predominately white schools. [[Ernie Chambers|Ernest Chambers]], a 34-year-serving black state senator from [[North Omaha, Nebraska|North Omaha]], Nebraska, believed a different solution was needed. Some observers said that in practical terms, public schools in Omaha had been re-segregated since the end of busing in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, T. A. (2009-02-03) "African American Administration of Predominately Black Schools: Segregation or Emancipation in Omaha, Nebraska", Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Association for the Study of Black Life and History in Charlotte, NC.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Chambers offered an amendment to the Omaha school reform bill in the [[Nebraska State Legislature]] which would provide for creation of three school districts in Omaha according to current racial demographics: black, white, and Hispanic, with local community control of each district.  He believed this would give the black community the chance to control a district in which their children were the majority. Chambers' amendment was controversial. Opponents to the measure described it as "state-sponsored segregation".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/15/us/15omaha.html?_r=1 Law to Segregate Omaha Schools Divides Nebraska]", ''[[The New York Times]]''. April 15, 2006. Retrieved April 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of a 2003 Harvard study on re-segregation believe current trends in the South of white teachers leaving predominately black schools is an inevitable result of federal court decisions limiting former methods of civil rights-era protections, such as busing and affirmative action in school admissions. Teachers and principals cite other issues, such as economic and cultural barriers in schools with high rates of poverty, as well as teachers' choices to work closer to home or in higher-performing schools. In some areas black teachers are also leaving the profession, resulting in teacher shortages.&lt;ref&gt;Jonnson, P. (January 21, 2003) "[http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0121/p01s03-usgn.html White teachers flee black schools]", ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]''. Retrieved 4/12/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Education conservatives argue that any apparent separation of races is due to patterns of residential demographics not due to court decisions. They argue that the ''Brown'' decision has been achieved and that there is no segregation in the way that existed before the ruling. They further argue that employing race to impose desegregation policies discriminates and violates ''Brown''{{'}}s central warning of using racial preferences.&lt;ref name="Jost 345–372"/&gt;

The '''Doctor of Audiology''' (Au.D.) is a professional degree for an [[audiologist]].  The Au.D. program is designed to produce audiologists who are skilled in providing diagnostic, rehabilitative, and other services associated with hearing, balance, tinnitus management, and related [[Audiology|audiological]] fields. These individuals help patients with hearing problems primarily by diagnosing hearing loss and fitting hearing assistive devices.
There is an emphasis on the clinical learning experience, though most programs also have a research component.  As of 2007, the Au.D. has replaced Masters-level audiology programs as the entry-level degree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AuD Facts |url=http://www.audiology.org/education_research/education/students/Pages/audfacts.aspx |work=American Academy of Audiology |year=2014 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States.  Other countries, such as Canada, still offer the master's degree. In the United States, after an Au.D. is obtained, some states may require a license before practicing audiology clinically.  The majority of Au.D. programs include three years of didactic and clinical instruction and a one year externship, similar to a medical residency. A few schools offer accelerated three-year programs. Programs differ in their prerequisite requirements for admission, though broadly applicants must have some background in the natural and social sciences, mathematics, and humanities. While it may be helpful for applicants to have a background in the communication sciences, this is not generally required for admission to an Au.D. program.

== Education response ecosystem ==
Within the education sector, there is a diversity of actors and systems to address substance use. These  are elements of an effective education sector response which include
* A policy framework to prevent and address substance use among children and young people;
* National and/or subnational [[Curriculum|curricula]] (contents and methods for the delivery of those contents) including skills-based prevention education;
* Training and support for teachers, school health practitioners and other school staff to plan, develop and implement a comprehensive school-based intervention strategy;
* Evidence-based interventions related to curricula implemented in educational institutions;
* Evidence-based interventions related to the school environment implemented in educational institutions, including substance use policies in schools, as well as other evidence-based prevention interventions delivered in the context of educational institutions;
* School health services, providing both prevention and care and support for young people who use substances;
* Management, coordination and evaluation of the response in the education sector, including monitoring of prevalence of substance use among children and young people.

== Curricula ==
Substance use is one of several important social and health issues that society calls on the education sector to address through the curriculum, along with other behavioural prevention areas, for example, mental health, sexual health, nutrition and bullying. In a curriculum, substance use prevention education is usually and most appropriately accommodated in a health-related subject area (variously termed healthy active living, health and family living, health and physical education, personal and social skills education, health and career education, life-skills education, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many schools choose also to supplement or replace the standard life-skills or other health-related curriculum with a manualized programme, i.e., a programme standardized through the creation of manuals and protocols for those who implement it. This has been shown by research to be effective in preventing substance use later in life and/ or supporting resilient mental health or acquiring life or academic skills.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNODC. 2013. ''International Standards on Drug Use Prevention''. Vienna: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/prevention/prevention-&lt;/nowiki&gt; standards.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Curriculum aiming to prevent substance use before the typical age of first use within the school system is directed at children who are around 6–12 years old. The typical age of first use of any substance will vary according to the national or local situation. Prevention education curriculum during this period is centred on what is referred to as ‘skills-based health education’.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. 2003. ''Skills for Health. Skills-based health education including life skills: An important component of a Child- Friendly/Health-Promoting School''. Geneva: WHO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www&lt;/nowiki&gt;. who.int/school_youth_health/media/en/sch_skills4health_03. pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It aims to develop key personal and social skills such as those that support healthy emotional and social development during this period, and protect against later substance use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to protecting against later substance use, skills-based education has also been shown to have a positive effect on general problem behaviours, commitment to school, academic performance, self-esteem, mental well- being, self-management and other social skills (besides Australia, Canada, Europe and the United States, the evidence also originates from Africa, Latin America and India).&lt;ref&gt;Durlak, J.A., Weissberg, R.P., Dymnicki, A.B., Taylor, R.D. and Schellinger, K.B. 2011. The impact of enhancing students’ social and emotional learning: a meta-analysis of school-based universal interventions. ''Child Development'', Vol. 82, pp. 405–432.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foxcroft, D.R. and Tsertsvadze, A. 2011b. Universal multi- component prevention programs for alcohol misuse in young people. ''Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews'' (Online). Issue 9, Art No.: CD009307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Training and supporting educators and other personnel ==
Research has found that training increases the likelihood that a teacher will actually deliver skills-based prevention content, and do it in the way it was intended. Training can help teachers adapt programme methods to their own teaching styles and aptitudes, while retaining the core components of the programme.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller-Day, M., Pettigrew, J. and Hecht, M.L. 2013. How prevention curricula are taught under real-world conditions: Types of and reasons for teacher curriculum adaptations. ''Health Education'', Vol. 113, No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence-based responses at school level ==
At the school level, approaches to responding to substance use can be broken down into two categories: Universal prevention and selective and indicated prevention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Universal prevention ===
Universal prevention aims to prevent substance use in the school population at large. This approach aims to reduce risks across the school or target age/ year group by providing knowledge and skills that are protective towards substance use, or by changing school policies and environment in ways that prevent and reduce substance use among all students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Selective and indicated prevention ===
Selective and indicated prevention targets individuals or groups deemed at particular risk of initiating substance use or who are already involved in substance use behaviours. These approaches involve identifying at-risk individuals or groups and targeting prevention efforts towards them, or identifying those who are showing early signs of substance use and then intervening.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== School health services ==
[[School health and nutrition services|School health services]] are most commonly led by nurses, but doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, dentists, social workers and counsellors may also be involved. By virtue of their professional training, nurses are very well positioned to provide a central role with school-based health services and with substance use prevention. Their professional role permits them to:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Provide prevention education in school (e.g. concerning non-medical use of prescribed medicines by children and young people).
* Identify and safely manage a new situation in the community (e.g. an emerging substance use pattern).
* Help families and teachers recognize signs and symptoms of substance use, as well as risk factors related to use (such as anxiety, depression or attention deficit, for example) and help them also in supporting protective factors against substance use such as resilient mental health.
* Identify and meet substance use-related needs of individual students and help students or families locate resources, and assist them in finnding a route to specialist services.
* When trained, deliver brief interventions to students, an effective response to substance use (see Section 3.2.4) (Pirskanen et al., 2006).
* Identify and manage emergency situations (e.g. overdose) until relieved by emergency medical service personnel, and follow up with the health care provider.
* Provide advocacy in the community on issues of concern to the health of children and youth.
* Lead and train other school professionals or other school staff to be part of the prevention project and to deliver evidence-based content related to substance use within the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== National education sector policies on substance use prevention ==
At the national level, education sector involvement is most effective in the context of a long-term integrated substance use prevention and control system or strategy that targets various ages and levels of vulnerability through a full range of sectors. A majority of countries have national policies or strategies/ action plans concerned with tobacco and the reduction of supply and demand of drugs, and many have a separate alcohol policy or strategy. However, the trend is toward comprehensive and balanced policies or strategies that integrate the various substances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Current substance use control strategies increasingly understand substance use to be first and foremost a health issue that is best addressed through a range of demand reduction measures including: early intervention; treatment; [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]]; recovery and social reintegration measures; and measures to minimize the public health and social consequences of substance abuse.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;UNODC. 2014. E/CN.7/2014/7. Action taken by Member States to implement the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem. Report of the Executive Director. Available at &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www&lt;/nowiki&gt;. unodc.org/documents/commissions/CND/CND_Sessions/ CND_57/_E-CN7-2014-07/E-CN7-2014-7_V1389056_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; All of these functions, including prevention, can fall within the purview of a public health system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The national education sector derives a clear mandate to respond to substance use through policy language that typically calls the sector to take responsibility for promoting ‘health and safety’, ‘healthy lifestyles’ or ‘life- skills’ among students. For example, within the Eastern European and Central Asian region, most countries address the primary goal of substance use prevention by establishing education laws that oblige schools to build skills and foster a culture of healthy lifestyles and safe behaviour among children and young people.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2015b. Substance use prevention in educational settings in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Moscow: UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this context, national education sector substance use prevention policy has taken a number of forms, and can be categorized as follows:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Mandatory school substance policies ===
National substance policies may mandate school policies to prevent substance use and its health and social consequences within schools. This typically includes bans on substances (use, selling and advertising) on school premises or surrounding properties. School rules relating to substance use often include the behaviours of teachers and other adults, and policies regarding dealing with substance use-related incidents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Statutory health and substance use education ===
National education policies may enshrine the duty of schools to provide health and/or substance use- related education and training. Such training is often incorporated within other subject headings such as science or physical education, or in free-standing health or personal skills curricula. This often implies that prevention methodologies and contents are part of the mandatory teacher training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Provision of school health services ===
National policies may mandate the implementation of school health services. These services allow for the provision of an accessible range of health services including preventive, routine and acute health services for students. They may include a range of personnel, including school nurses, advisors and counsellors and mental health professionals. The services provided often contribute to preventive education, the development of school health and substance use policies, early identi cation and interventions and connections with the social and health sectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== National quality standards for school-based prevention efforts ===
School substance use prevention can be encouraged and guided by quality standards. They are increasingly available (e.g. European drug prevention quality standards;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/manuals/prevention-&lt;/nowiki&gt; standards&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian Standards for School-based Youth Substance Abuse Prevention),&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ccsa.ca/Eng/topics/Children-and-Youth/Drug-Prevention-&lt;/nowiki&gt; Standards/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and typically advocate for evidence-based programming, sound planning and design, comprehensive activity, monitoring, evaluation, professional development and sustainability. Quality standards help to support national policy initiatives and guide schools in meeting their mandate to promote health and prevent substance use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Monitoring of substance use among children and young people ===
Some countries participate in global or regional monitoring or conduct national- level monitoring of substance use prevalence among children and adolescents. This is not an education sector activity per se but it does indicate that the issue is a priority, providing a measure of endorsement and most importantly, guidance, for school prevention activity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== International frameworks to guide Education sector responses to substance abuse ==
A number of international statutes stipulate the responsibility of various sectors, including the education sector, to prevent and minimize harm from substance use among children and young people. Most relevant are the following:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== International policy initiatives that enshrine the right of children and young people to health and safety ===
* [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (1966);
* [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (1989);
* [[Education For All|Dakar Framework for Action – Education for All]] (2000), and [[Incheon declaration|Incheon Declaration – Education 2030]]: Towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all (2015);
* Declaration and Plan of Action ‘A World Fit for Children’ (2002);
* UN Global Monitoring Framework (2013).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Recent policy conventions focusing on the management of psychoactive substances and substance use call for broad action ===
* [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (2005); 
* Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem (2009); 
* WHO Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol (2010).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== UN International Drug Control Conventions that provide a framework for efforts to control the supply and demand for illicit drugs ===
* [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] (1961);
* The Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971);
* Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Recent initiatives that may inform and mandate an education sector response ===
* In the 2030 Development Agenda adopted in 2015, the UN Member States commit to strengthen prevention and treatment of substance abuse by 2030, in the sub goal 3.5.
* The [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] (CND) calls on ‘Member States to formulate and implement, where appropriate, a broad system of primary prevention and early intervention based on scientifoc evidence, such as the International Standards on Drug Use Prevention and other measures, including educational activities and interactive campaigns’.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The Outcome Document of the UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on drugs, organized in 2016, highlights a balanced health- and human rights-based approach to addressing the world drug problem, giving an additional mandate to drug prevention and treatment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An '''electronic performance support system''' (EPSS) is any computer software program or component that improves user performance.

EPSSs can help an organization to reduce the cost of training staff while increasing productivity and performance. They can [[Empowerment|empower]] employees to perform tasks with a minimum amount of external intervention or [[training]]. By using this type of system an employee, especially a new employee, will often not only be able to complete his or her work more quickly and accurately, but, as a secondary benefit, will also learn more about the job and the employer's business.

An EPSS is best considered when
*workers require knowledge to achieve individual performance in a business environment 
*skilled performers are spending a lot of time helping less skilled performers
*new workers must begin to perform immediately and training is impractical, unavailable or constrained
*employees need to be guided through a complex process or task that cannot be memorized.
These situations often occur when new systems (e.g. [[customer relationship management]], [[enterprise resource planning]]) are introduced, upgraded or consolidated, and in certain [[call centres]] when agents must perform using complex systems, processes or products.

==Components==
There are different views about the components and characteristics of EPSS. For example, from Barker and Banerji’s (1995) point of view, an EPSS has four functional levels, which should be brought together:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=DESIGNING ELECTRONIC PERFORMANCE SUPPORT SYSTEMS|author=Philip Barker and Ashok Banerji|journal= Innovations in Education and Training International, Special Edition on Electronic Performance Support Systems|pages=4-12|volume=32|issue=1|year=1995|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a746782853}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#the user interface shell (the human computer interface) and the database
#generic tools (help system, documentation, text retrieval system, intelligent agents, tutoring facility, simulation tools and communication resources)
#application-specific support tools
#a target application domain (schools, particular business settings, military, etc.).

== Advantages ==

#Reducing the complexity or number of steps required to perform a task
#Providing the performance information an employee needs to perform a task
#Providing a [[decision support system]] that enables an employee to identify the action that is appropriate for a particular set of conditions

== Definitions ==

In ''Electronic Performance Support Systems'', [[Gloria Gery]] defined EPSS as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electronic Performance Support Systems|year=1991|author=[[Gloria Gery]]|url=https://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Performance-Support-System-Gloria/dp/0961796812|isbn=978-0-9617968-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
an integrated electronic environment that is available to and easily &lt;br /&gt;
accessible by each employee and is structured to provide immediate, individualized &lt;br /&gt;
on-line access to the full range of information, software, guidance, advice and &lt;br /&gt;
assistance, data, images, tools, and assessment and monitoring systems to permit &lt;br /&gt;
[[job performance]] with minimal support and intervention by others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, in 1991, [[Barry Raybould]] gave a shorter definition:&lt;ref&gt;''An EPSS Case Study: Prime Computer'', Barry Raybould. 1991, Ariel PSS Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;a computer-based system that improves worker productivity by providing on-the-job access to integrated information, advice, and learning experiences.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From a business perspective, a former [[Nortel Networks]] executive, [[William Bezanson]] (2002) provided a definition linked to application usability and organizational results:&lt;ref name=bezanson&gt;''Performance Support Solutions: Achieving Goals Through Enabling User Performance''. William Bezanson, 2002, Trafford Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;A performance support system provides just-in-time, just enough training, information, tools, and help for users of a product or work environment, to enable optimum performance by those users when and where needed, thereby also enhancing the performance of the overall business.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== EPSS versus online help ==

An EPSS must be distinguished from a traditional [[online help]] system. Online help usually supports a single software application and is not necessarily focused on the entire range of job tasks (which may involve multiple applications), but just that specific software. With online help, cross-referencing is often not available and the information provided is limited and rarely combined with procedures or complex tasks. Perhaps most critically, on-line help cannot be customized to the user or the job task; in fact, the same software screen may require different inputs depending on the user and job task. Online help is also not [[Context-sensitive help|contextual]] to the user's current situation and requires users to search through for the solution to their problem. 

== EPSS versus e-learning simulations ==

EPSS must also be differentiated from [[e-learning]] [[simulation]]s that replay a series of steps on-demand within a software application. Simulations are more closely associated with on-demand training, not [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] support, because of the longer time considerations, complexity, and media restrictions for playing a simulation. An EPSS can be considered a part of the [[e-learning]] category, as it is on-demand learning, and notes that the EPSS modality fits more within the informal learning definition.

== EPSS versus knowledge management ==

In his book, Bezanson points out that "[[knowledge management]]" is the noun corresponding to the verb of "performance support".&lt;ref name=bezanson/&gt; The knowledge documented in the system plays a critical role in any EPSS system. This concept was originated by Raybould (1997)&lt;ref&gt;''The Five Phases of Migration from Training to Knowledge Management'', Barry Raybould,  CBT Solutions July/August 1997&lt;/ref&gt; who separates out the repository, delivery and infrastructure aspects of the EPSS from the knowledge base it contains. In fact, Bezanson emphasizes the advantage that an LMS ([[learning management system]]) will interface with the EPSS to supply the knowledge base, content-courseware, or other tracking capabilities that an EPSS may require if the LMS precedes the implementation of the EPSS.

== EPSS versus training ==

EPSS's role in the future of [[training]] and work have been noted by followers of the trend towards more [[informal learning]] systems driven by knowledge management systems.
[[Tony O'Driscoll]] (1999) summarizes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; As the pace of technological change speeds up, many jobs will require constant adaptation, because of new information and new task requirements. In this context, the distinction between learning and work will disappear. A trend toward integrating training with on-the-job activities will be a result. This trend will extend itself to the point that training, as a distinct function, will no longer be the primary learning vehicle for many types of jobs. Works will use on-the-job information systems instead.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To this day, analysts such as [[Forrester Research|Forrester]]'s [[Claire Schooley]] and [[Bersin &amp; Associates]]' Chris Howard write similarly themed articles based on their research in informal learning, technology and training.

{{Nihongo|'''''Fushūgaku'''''|不就学}} is a Japanese term meaning non-attendance of [[Education in Japan|school]].

== Characteristics ==
There are a number of reasons as to why these children do not go to school. There are many cases where they cannot understand the Japanese language. In other cases they may be able to understand both Japanese and their own [[Mother tongue|native language]], but their level of conversation is insufficient to participate in class lessons. Bullying by native Japanese students may also contribute to their choice not to attend school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan’s all too tentative opening to immigration|url=http://www.japanwatching.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=98:japans-all-too-tentative-opening-to-immigration&amp;catid=36:society&amp;Itemid=2|publisher=Japan Watching|accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the children have parents who both work to support the family, and the children end up being left at [[Latchkey kid|home alone]]. In these families, they spend time together late at night after their parents stop working. On their parents' day off, they go out late at night together (shopping, etc.) They pass their time at autonomous Japanese language classrooms that were built for the children of foreigners. These parents are usually [[blue-collar worker]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Other reasons are that the parents of ''fushugaku'' children want their children to go to a school where they would use their native language. However, such schools cost between 30,000 and 50,000 yen per month, so parents cannot afford to send their children.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4325">'''Geragogy''' is a theory which argues that [[Geriatrics|older adults]] are sufficiently different that they warrant a separate [[educational theory]]. The term "eldergogy" has also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeo|first=Gwen|date=1982|title='Eldergogy': A special approach to education for elders|url=|journal=Lifelong Learning: The Adult Years|issue=5(5)|pages=4-7|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have noted that "one should not expect from geragogy some comprehensive educational theory for older adult learners, but only an awareness of and sensitivity towards gerontological issues".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lifelong Learning in Later Life: a handbook on older adult learning|last=Findsen|first=Brian|last2=Formosa|first2=Marvin|publisher=Sense Publishers|year=2011|isbn=978-94-6091-649-6|location=Dordrecht|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Key distinctions between traditional [[pedagogy]] and geragogy include offering "opportunities for older adult learners to set the curriculum themselves and to learn through activities of personal relevance"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Pat|date=2016|title=Helping older people conquer digital tablets.|url=http://gerontechnology.info/index.php/journal/article/view/gt.2016.14.2.005.00|journal=Gerontechnology|issue=14(2)|pages=78-88|doi=10.4017/gt.2016.14.2.005.00|pmid=|access-date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as recognition of age-related issues which may affect learning, such as reduced [[Perception|sensory perception]], limited motor capabilities and changes in cognitive processes, especially [[memory]]. 

Collaborative [[peer learning]], as employed in the [[University of the Third Age]], is a common element within geragogic settings.

== Principles of geragogy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geragogy: A theory for teaching the elderly|last=John|first=Martha T.|publisher=The Haworth Press|year=1988|isbn=9780866567145|location=Binghampton, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

*[[File:Vuxenutbildning.jpg|thumb|Older people in a peer learning setting]]Learning should aim to provide skills and resources which maintain personal independence. Useful, practical outcomes must therefore be highlighted before a course of study begins, and any assigned tasks must have meaning for older adults. Enjoyment, curiosity, seeking information and desiring communication are typical routes into learning.
* Variety in teaching methods is required, rather than reliance on lengthy verbal presentations. A flexible, interdisciplinary approach which responds to the needs of the learners present is vital.
* Tutors should strive to maintain a clear focus on the topic, limiting the number of ideas presented. Irrelevant or overly distracting concepts should be avoided. 
* In place of discipline or rote-learning, tutors should stimulate engagement with warmth, positive comments, approval and encouragement. 
* Learners may take longer to complete tasks and assignments than younger people. They may also wish to return repeatedly to a task until they feel comfortable. Examples should be reinforced regularly and often, using differing contexts in order to give as many opportunities as possible for learners to grasp a concept.
* The past experiences of learners can be useful in grounding their understanding. Tutors should seek to review specific skills which allow each learner to be creative in their own way, building on their personal life experience. It is also important to review information that may have been learned in the past (such as at school) but has not been used for some time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6772">The '''Global Assessment Certificate''' program (also known as the '''GAC''', /ʤi: eI  si:/, jee-ay-see) is a university preparation and foundation studies program that provides students from mostly non-English-speaking backgrounds with academic knowledge and skills to prepare them for western-style postsecondary study. It is owned and developed by ACT Education Solutions, Ltd. (AES),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acteducationsolutions.com&lt;/ref&gt; an international subsidiary of [[ACT, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.act.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAC is recognized for admissions and credit transfer purposes by more than 90 universities around the globe, including The University of Iowa,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uiowa.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://international.admissions.uiowa.edu/future-students/global-assessment-certificate-program&lt;/ref&gt; LIU Post,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liu.edu/CWPost/Admissions/International/Undergraduate/Start.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Idaho,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uidaho.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uidaho.edu/registrar/transfer/gac&lt;/ref&gt; Oklahoma State University,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.okstate.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://union.okstate.edu/iss/Documents/InternationalUndergraduateApplication.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Oregon University &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sou.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sou.edu//international/students/gac.html&lt;/ref&gt; (in the United States), Griffith University, &lt;ref&gt;https://www.griffith.edu.au/international&lt;/ref&gt; University Technology Sydney, &lt;ref&gt;https://www.uts.edu.au/international&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.griffith.edu.au/college/admissions/academic-entry-requirements&lt;/ref&gt; Bond,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bond.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bond.edu.au/degrees-and-courses/application-enrolment/application/undergraduate/secondary-school-equivalence/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; La Trobe,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latrobe.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latrobemelbourne.edu.au/enrol-today/admissions-requirements&lt;/ref&gt; and RMIT &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rmit.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse/Study%20at%20RMIT%2FInternational%2FEntry%20requirements%2FEnglish%20equivalency%20information/&lt;/ref&gt; (in Australia) for admissions purposes and is considered an alternative or addition to Year 12 for international students.

The GAC is licensed to teaching centers (known as ‘Approved Teaching Centers’ or ATCs&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acteducationsolutions.com/en/aesl/atc.html&lt;/ref&gt;). The program is monitored and moderated by AES staff based at the organization’s regional offices in Shanghai, Jakarta and Singapore.&lt;ref name="media"&gt;http://media.act.org/documents/aes-act-brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is not currently accredited.
==GAC course structure==

The GAC can be delivered full-time or part-time as a concurrent co-curriculum with the [[high school]] curriculum. The minimum requirements for delivery of the program are 720 hours of face-to-face instruction and 360 hours of independent study, half of which must be supervised. The program is continuously assessed and all assessments are moderated by ACT Education Solutions. 

'''Level I'''

Six mandatory modules with a total of 240 hours of face-to-face study, plus 120 hours independent study. Includes academic English, study skills, [[mathematics]], computing, and communication skills.

'''Level II'''

Two mandatory academic English modules, plus four of six specialization modules across the areas of business, computing, mathematics, science, psychology and social science. Electives in IELTS or TOEFL preparation are available.

'''Level III'''

Two mandatory academic English modules plus four of six specialization modules across the areas of business, computing, mathematics, science, psychology and social science. ACT Test preparation is also available.

==GAC GPA scale==

The GAC Grade Point Average (GPA) scale is based on a four-point scale with a passing grade of 55% (GPA 0.6). Grading criteria for each assessment are clearly stipulated in documentation provided to Approved Teaching Centers (ATCs) and teachers and directors of studies are trained by ACT Education Solutions, Limited's academic staff in the correct application of the grading criteria. All grades are finalized by ACT Education Solutions, Limited's academic staff prior to posting on ACT Education Solutions, Limited's secure online database, iTAP. Higher education institutions can verify GAC graduates' certificates and transcripts through the iTAP database.

'''Greenhouse Sports''' aims to develop social, thinking, emotional and physical skills for young people in London’s communities through sports programmes delivered by coaches.

Greenhouse Sports (originally Greenhouse Schools Project and then later Greenhouse Charity) was founded in 2002 when Chief Executive and founder, Michael de Giorgio, set up a multisports pilot to give young people on a local housing estate something positive to do in the school holidays. In 2004 the organisation then moved their programmes full-time into schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18057">'''Group cognition''' is a social, largely linguistic phenomenon whereby a group of people produce a sequence of utterances that performs a cognitive act. That is, if a similar sequence was uttered or thought by an individual it would be considered an act of cognition or thinking. The group can be a small group, such as 3-5 people talking together or working together online. The group can also be a larger collective, such as a classroom of students or a global community contributing asynchronously to an extended discourse on a problem or topic or to a knowledge repository like Wikipedia. The theory of group cognition is a [[postcognitivism]] philosophy, which considers a larger unit of analysis than an individual mind as a producer of cognitive activities such as creative problem solving.

== Concepts of Group Cognition ==

'''Group cognition''' refers to an analytic viewpoint that looks beyond individual cognition to include the interaction of individuals with other people, with artifacts and with cultural resources as producing cognitive products through their interaction. Accordingly, cognition or thinking can be analyzed in a number of ways:

•	An individual thinks and speaks. The thought takes place in the individual’s mind (inside the head) and can be expressed in the (external) world through speech, gesture, writing, artifacts. This has been a '''traditional cognition''' view since Descartes.&lt;ref name=Descartes /&gt;

•	A small group of people collaborates, usually through spoken or written communication, and produces utterances or other products that cannot be attributed to any one of the group members by themselves. The individuals may build on each other’s ideas (transaction).&lt;ref name=Wegner /&gt; Also, there may be group processes or features of the group interaction, which themselves contribute to the '''small-group cognition'''.&lt;ref name=Stahl2006 /&gt;

•	One or more people may interact with various kinds of artifacts, such as software applications&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, G. (2016) ''Constructing Dynamic Triangles Together: The Development of Mathematical Group Cognition''.

=== Small-Group Cognition ===

Small groups of people can engage in activities such as mathematical problem solving and can accomplish intellectual achievements. These accomplishments often proceed by means of interactions in which ideas emerge from the discourse between multiple perspectives and cannot be credited to any one person. An utterance by one person is elicited by and responds to the previous discussion and group context in ways that would otherwise not have arisen, and the utterance is structured so as to elicit specific kinds of responses from other participants. Through a sequence of complexly and subtly interwoven interactions, cognitive results are achieved. The meaning of what was said is determined at the group level of the interactions, and is not in general attributable primarily to the expression of pre-existing mental representations of the individual participants.

Of course, small-group cognition relies on the ability of the participating individuals to interpret and understand the group meaning. But even this individual understanding is fundamentally situated in, and emerges from, the interactions of the group, which are structured so as to coordinate these understandings. The philosophy of group cognition does not deny individual cognition, but calls for a re-thinking of the ontology, epistemology and methodology for exploring mind.

Social psychologists, sociologists and organizational theorist have occasionally referred to group cognition. However, these disciplines have generally rejected the notion for fear of conjuring up images of trans-personal "metaphysical" phenomena. Sociologists emphasized the negative possibilities of "[[group think]]" or "[[mass psychology]]", whereby members of a group are persuaded by peer pressure to forsake their own individual rationality. Psychology is focused on the individual as the unit of analysis. Twentieth century psychology reacts against popularized readings of earlier idealist philosophy and tends to reduce social phenomena to individual psychology or rational calculations of self-interest of individuals.

===Other Forms of Group Cognition===

== Analyzing Online Group Cognition ==

Online interactions, if carefully planned for, can provide ideal data for research on group cognition. If the interaction takes place through text and persistent drawings, logs can preserve an excellent detailed record of virtually everything that took place across the network. Thus, one can analyze everything that was available to the participants and shared by them. In contrast to video analysis, there is no need to worry about camera angles, lighting, transcriptions, interview protocols, coding reliability, etc. to produce an accurate and useful record.

The data can be analyzed for evidence of the accomplishment of problem solving and other tasks (group cognition) through collaborative interaction within the online group. This can be achieved through close analysis of how groups of participants co-construct shared meanings and sustain joint activities through the sequentiality and relatedness of their situated contributions and their social participation. Of course, there are many questions that cannot be addressed this way, such as what goes on in individual heads and what is remembered by specific participants years later. But these issues are beyond the scope of a group-cognition research agenda. The group accomplishments have been largely ignored in previous educational research, but may constitute what is unique to computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and most promising for the future of computer support for building collaborative knowledge.

== Research and Analysis ==

=== The [[Virtual Math Teams]] (VMT) Research Project ===
The [[Virtual Math Teams]] (VMT) research project was directed by [[Gerry Stahl]] from 2003-2014. It is continuing at the Math Forum as part of NCTM. The VMT project is a prototypical example of [[Computer-supported collaborative learning]] research.

The VMT research group at [[Drexel University]] and the Math Forum has developed a methodology for chat analysis that is tuned to the exploration of small-group cognition in a chat environment. This approach is inspired by ethnomethodologically-informed [[conversation analysis]], but the domain differs in multiple significant ways from that of most conversation analysis: Chat is online so neither the participants nor their production of utterances is visible; interactions are text-based so they lack intonation, personality, accent; the topics are math problem solving, rather than socializing; the participants are primarily teenage students engaged in learning, not adult domain experts; the groups are usually 3 to 5 instead of dyads; the participants generally do not know each other or know much about each other; etc.

The VMT Project's analysis looks closely, line-by-line, at how chat postings build upon each other sequentially; how they respond to previous postings and elicit future ones; how they establish the social order of the group interaction; how they repair problems of co-construction of shared group meanings; how they construct, reference, remember and name resources that they use in their [[meaning-making]]. Analysis considers the context within which interactions occur, building up understanding of types of interaction through which targeted hypotheses can be explored in quasi-experimental investigations, ethnographic observation or structured interviews.

The aim of the VMT Project is to understand students interactions, for example: How students approach a given problem and make use of the [[affordances]] of their technology? How do different technical details change or mediate the interactions and the methods that students develop? Such understanding can guide the design of [[Computer-supported collaborative learning|CSCL]] systems to support effective networked learning.

==The Small-Group Unit of Analysis==

Small-group cognition focuses on the small group as the unit of analysis. In this, it contrasts with theories that are oriented to larger units like [[communities of practice]] as well as to the individual person. In this sense, the theory of small-group cognition complements theories like [[distributed cognition]] and [[cultural-historical activity theory]] as well as individual cultural psychology. Small-group cognition theory proposes that small groups are the "engines of knowledge building." The knowing that groups build up in manifold forms is what becomes internalized by their members as individual learning and externalized in their communities as certifiable knowledge. In this sense, the small-group phenomena underlie much of what takes place at the larger scale.

The Russian psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]]&lt;ref name=Vygotsky /&gt; argued that higher-level human cognition is not a biological given aptitude. Rather, individual cognition is developed gradually through social interaction. Various adult intellectual abilities are results of internalization processes through which interpersonal interactions are transformed. For instance, speech begins with talk among people in small groups and dyads. Gradually, young children around the age of four transform speech with others into self-talk, and later into silent speech. The flow of silent speech evolves into the thought of the individual. Such a view reverses the perspective of reductionist psychology and argues for a developmental priority of group cognition. In this sense, the small-group phenomena underlie much of what takes place at the individual scale.

== Writings on Group Cognition ==

=== Writings on Small-Group Cognition ===

•	Stahl&lt;ref name=Stahl2006 /&gt; discusses the potential of computer and network technology to promote group cognition. It reflects on the methodology for analyzing group cognition and provides some analyzed examples of small group cognitive interaction. The author coined the term ''group cognition'' while writing this book. The term had rarely been used before. The motivation for the VMT research project emerges from the previous CSCW and CSCL studies reported in this book.

•	Stahl&lt;ref name=Stahl2009 /&gt; presents 28 chapters analyzing various aspects of the study of group cognition as conducted by the [[Virtual Math Teams]] Project. Chapters are written by the editor, [[Gerry Stahl]], and other members of the VMT research team, visiting researchers who worked on the project and international colleagues. The VMT project was designed specifically to study group cognition in small teams of students discussing mathematics online. A scientific methodology for designing experiments, collecting data, analyzing logs and developing theory is discussed in the book. A number of case studies of excerpts from logs are included. Several chapters discuss larger implications and philosophic issues.

•	Stahl&lt;ref name=Stahl2013 /&gt; discusses the potential of computer and network technology to promote group cognition. It reflects on the design-based research methodology for analyzing group cognition and provides some analyzed examples of small group cognitive interaction. It includes philosophic, technical, historical, mathematical and pedagogical considerations—providing a multi-faceted view of the VMT research project.

•	 Stahl&lt;ref name=Stahl2015 /&gt; is a monograph analyzing the work of a group of three students as they become introduced to dynamic mathematics during eight hour-long online sessions using VMT with GeoGebra. The monograph documents the team's development of mathematical group cognition. Introductory chapters motivate the study and discuss its case-study method. Concluding chapters reflect on the group-cognitive development and its implications for re-design of the math curriculum.

•	Stahl&lt;ref name=Stahl2014 /&gt; presents a philosophical argument for the concept of small-group cognition.

[[File:Project Physics Text cover.jpg|thumb|''Project Physics'', cover, main text]]
'''Harvard Project Physics''', also called '''Project Physics''', was a national [[curriculum development]] project to create a [[secondary school]] [[physics education]] program in the United States during the [[Cold War]] era. 

==History==
The project was active from 1962 to 1972, and produced the ''Project Physics'' series of texts, which were used in physics classrooms in the 1970s and 1980s. The project was centered at [[Harvard University]], but drew from schools and educators from across the country. The directors of this project were: [[F. James Rutherford]], project coordinator (and after completion of the project, professor of [[science education]] at [[New York University]]); [[Gerald Holton]], professor of physics and of the [[history of science]] at Harvard University; and [[Fletcher Watson|Fletcher G. Watson]], professor of science education at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]].

==Course materials==
Project Physics course work was broken into six main subject areas, organized into separate books each called a "Project Physics Text and Handbook" or "Student Guide":&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/projectphysicscollection Project Physics Collection at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

#Concepts of Motion
#Motion in the Heavens
#The Triumph of Mechanics
#Light and Electromagnetism
#Models of the Atom 
#The Nucleus

The books presented the material from a historical perspective, with aspects of human interest wrapped into the text. The intent was to build a sophisticated conceptual understanding of physics, while not over-simplifying the curriculum. Frequent references to historical works where concepts were first discovered and debated highlighted the drive to make physics a fundamental search for understanding of the universe.&lt;ref name="AOTS"&gt;{{cite web|title=High School Reform Projects: Physics|url=http://artofteachingscience.org/mos/5.2.html|website=artofteachingscience.org|accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The course materials also included readers, tests, and other teaching aids. The course readers allowed students to further explore a topic, and lab exercises enabled students to verify that their understanding was confirmed by experimental outcomes. Special lab equipment, brief film loops, films, and a teacher's guide were also developed.&lt;ref name="AOTS" /&gt; The texts and all other aids are now available for free on the Project Physics Collection web site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8408">The '''History of early childhood care and education''' (ECCE) refers to the development of care and education of children between birth and eight years old throughout history. ECCE has a global scope, and caring for and educating young children has always been an integral part of human societies. Arrangements for fulfilling these societal roles have evolved over time and remain varied across cultures, often reflecting [[family]] and [[community]] structures as well as the social and economic roles of women and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001477/147794e.pdf|title=EFA Global Monitoring Report 2007: Strong Foundations - Early Childhood Care and Education|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, such arrangements have largely been informal, involving family, household and community members.

State-led expansion of ECCE services first emerged in the [[Russian Federation]] in the early twentieth century as part of the [[Socialism|socialist]] project to foster equal participation of women and men in production and in public life, and to publicly provide education from the youngest possible age.&lt;ref&gt;Taratukhina, M.

Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; [[France]] was another early starter having integrated [[Preschool|pre-school]] into its education system as early as 1886 and expanded its provision in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In real terms, the significant expansion of ECCE services began in the 1960s with the considerable growth in women's participation in the [[Labour Market|labour market]] and extensive developments in child and family policies in Europe and the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== ECCE development in 1990s ==
The 1990s opened a new page in the history of the development of ECCE catalysed mainly by the rapid and successive ratification of the 1989 [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC). By its explicit mention of 'the child' – meaning every human being under the age of eighteen or majority – the CRC reinforced the 1960 [[UNESCO]] [[Convention and Recommendation against Discrimination in Education]] which should have covered young children in any case. With its moral force and near universal ratification, the CRC formally recognized children as holders of rights to survival and development, to be heard and to participate in decisions affecting them in accordance with their evolving capacities with their best interests and non-discrimination as overarching principles. While the CRC in Article 18 also recognizes the primary role of parents and legal guardians in the upbringing and development of children, it obliges States Parties to help them carry out these duties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The second boost to the development of ECCE was the adoption of the World Declaration on [[Education For All|Education for All]] (EFA) in March 1990 in [[Jomtien Beach|Jomtien, Thailand]]. Reflecting General Comment 7, the Jomtien Declaration explicitly stated that 'learning begins at birth', and called for 'early childhood care and initial education' (Article 5). This novel recognition of ECCE as an integral part of basic education featured again in the major goals adopted at the 1990 UN World Summit for Children. Ten years later, in 2000, this expanded vision of basic education was rearmed in the Dakar Framework for Action on EFA, adopted at the World Education Forum as the first of the six EFA goals: 'Expanding and improving comprehensive ECCE especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children'. Regrettably, unlike other EFA goals, this was stated as a broad and aspirational goal without numerical targets or clear benchmarks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== ECCE Development in the 21st century ==
ECCE was further reinforced by the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), albeit only partially. Adopted at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000, two of the MDGs had direct relevance to early childhood development: (i) improving [[maternal health]], with the targets of reducing the [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]] rates by three-quarters and providing universal access to [[reproductive health]] (MDG4), and (ii) reducing the [[Child mortality|under-five mortality]] rate by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015 (MDG5). Thus, the child and maternal health aspects of ECCE became part and parcel of a global 'effort to meet the needs of the [[Poverty threshold|world's poorest]]' while childcare and early education aspects were left out.

In recent decades, ECCE has further received attention from diverse stakeholders including research communities, [[civil society]] and [[intergovernmental organization]]s which furthered understanding of its holistic and multisectoral nature. Research continues to document the multifaceted development benefits of ECCE for health, education, social and [[emotional well-being]], [[social equity]] and cohesion, the economy, employment and earnings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Hyper-interactive teaching technology''' or '''H-ITT''' is a form of technology used primarily to interact between the [[student]]s and [[teacher]]s.  Students generally are given an H-ITT [[transmitter]], which is similar to a [[remote control]], which allows them to answer questions in [[Voting|poll]] or [[quiz]] form.

It also means that the interaction between the teacher, the students and among the students is very high. The term is frequently used to denote a constant conversation among the students themselves, and learning with each other, which is not usually the case in a conventional teaching medium.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12277">'''Hypoventilation training''' is a physical training method in which periods of exercise with reduced [[breathing frequency]] are interspersed with periods with normal [[breathing]]. The hypoventilation technique consists of short breath holdings and can be performed in different types of exercise: [[running]], [[cycling]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[Road skating|skating]], etc.

Generally, there are two ways to carry out hypoventilation: at high [[lung volume]] or at low [[lung volume]]. At high lung volume, breath holdings are performed with the [[lung]]s full of air ([[inhalation]] then breath hold). Conversely, during hypoventilation at low lung volume, breath holdings are performed with the lung half full of air. To do so, one has to first [[Exhalation|exhale]] normally, without forcing, then hold one’s breath. This is called the exhale-hold technique.

The scientific studies have shown that only hypoventilation at low [[lung volume]] could lead to both a significant decrease in [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) concentrations in the body and an increase in [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which are indispensable for the method to be effective.&lt;ref name="muscle oxygenation"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00421-010-1512-9 |title=Exercise with hypoventilation induces lower muscle oxygenation and higher blood lactate concentration: Role of hypoxia and hypercapnia |year=2010 |last1=Woorons |first1=Xavier |last2=Bourdillon |first2=Nicolas |last3=Vandewalle |first3=Henri |last4=Lamberto |first4=Christine |last5=Mollard |first5=Pascal |last6=Richalet |first6=Jean-Paul |last7=Pichon |first7=Aurélien |journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=367–77 |pmid=20503056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swimming"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.resp.2013.08.022 |title=Swimmers can train in hypoxia at sea level through voluntary hypoventilation |year=2014 |last1=Woorons |first1=Xavier |last2=Gamelin |first2=François-Xavier |last3=Lamberto |first3=Christine |last4=Pichon |first4=Aurélien |last5=Richalet |first5=Jean Paul |journal=Respiratory Physiology &amp; Neurobiology |volume=190 |pages=33–9 |pmid=24012989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first known form of hypoventilation occurred in the 1950s during training of the [[runners]] of [[Eastern Europe]] and former [[USSR]].&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Woorons, "[http://www.hypoventilation-training.com/Activity.html Hypoventilation training, push your limits!]", Arpeh, 2014, p. 21 ({{ISBN|978-2-9546040-1-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous athletes to have used this method is [[Emil Zátopek]], the [[Czechs|Czech]] long-distance runner, 4 times [[Olympic gold medalist]] and former holder of 18 world records. Zátopek, who was a precursor in training, regularly used to run by holding his breath in order to harden his training and simulate the conditions of competition. However, at that time, the effects of hypoventilation training were completely unknown and the method was applied very empirically.

At the beginning of the 1970s, American [[swimming (sport)|swim]] [[coach (sport)|coach]] [[James Counsilman]] used a new training technique which involved taking a limited number of [[inhalation]]s while swimming laps in a pool. The effect of this kind of training was determined to decrease the body’s [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] content and simulate [[altitude training]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Counsilman |first1=J. |title=Hypoxic training and other methods of training evaluated |journal=Swim Tech |year=1975 |volume=12 |pages=19–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the method's efficacy, hypoventilation became a common training method for many swimmers.

It is especially from the 1980s that the scientific studies on exercise with reduced [[breathing frequency]] began to be published. While the method advocated by Counsilman attracted a following in some runners and [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] coaches, the results of the studies contradicted the hypotheses put forward by the World of Sport. They showed that this training method did not decrease body [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentrations and provoked only a [[hypercapnia|hypercapnic]] effect, i.e. an increase in [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holmer |first1=I |last2=Gullstrand |first2=L |title=Physiological responses to swimming with controlled frequency of breathing |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports |year=1980 |volume=2 |pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1249/00005768-198021000-00005 |title=Respiratory and heart rate responses to tethered controlled frequency breathing swimming |year=1980 |last1=Dicker |first1=Scott G. |last2=Lofthus |first2=Geraldine K. |last3=Thornton |first3=Norton W. |last4=Bkooks |first4=George A. |journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise |volume=12 |pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the effectiveness and legitimacy of hypoventilation training were strongly challenged.

Since the middle of the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], a series of studies has been conducted by French [[researchers]] of Paris 13 University to propose a new approach to hypoventilation training. Dr Xavier Woorons and his team hypothesized that if breath holdings were carried out with the [[lung]]s half-full of air, rather than full of air as performed so far, it would be possible to significantly reduce body oxygenation. The results that were published confirmed the hypotheses. They demonstrated that through hypoventilation at low [[lung volume]], that is the exhale-hold technique, it was possible, without leaving [[sea level]], to decrease [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentrations in the [[blood]] and in the [[muscle]]s at levels corresponding to altitudes above 2000 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.resp.2007.02.017 |title=Prolonged expiration down to residual volume leads to severe arterial hypoxemia in athletes during submaximal exercise |year=2007 |last1=Woorons |first1=Xavier |last2=Mollard |first2=Pascal |last3=Pichon |first3=Aurélien |last4=Duvallet |first4=Alain |last5=Richalet |first5=Jean-Paul |last6=Lamberto |first6=Christine |journal=Respiratory Physiology &amp; Neurobiology |volume=158 |pages=75–82 |pmid=17434347 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiological effects ==
When exercise is being performed, if the exhale-hold technique is properly applied, a decrease in [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentrations and an increase in [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentrations occur in the [[lung]]s, the [[blood]] and the [[muscle]]s.&lt;ref name="muscle oxygenation" /&gt; The combined effect of [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] and [[hypercapnia]] act as a strong [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] whose main consequence is to increase [[lactic acid]] and [[hydrogen]] ions production, and therefore to provoke a strong [[acidosis]] in the body. Thus, during exercise with hypoventilation, the [[blood]] and [[muscle]] [[acid-base homeostasis]] is highly disturbed. The studies have also reported an increase in all [[heart]] activity when hypoventilation is carried out in terrestrial sports. [[Cardiac output]], [[heart rate]], [[stroke volume]] and sympathetic modulation to the heart are greater when exercise with hypoventilation is performed in [[running]] or [[cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1055/s-0031-1271788 |title=Cardiovascular Responses During Hypoventilation at Exercise |year=2011 |last1=Woorons |first1=X. |last2=Bourdillon |first2=N. |last3=Lamberto |first3=C. |last4=Vandewalle |first4=H. |last5=Richalet |first5=J.-P. |last6=Mollard |first6=P. |last7=Pichon |first7=A. |journal=International Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=438–45 |pmid=21563023}}&lt;/ref&gt; A slightly higher [[blood pressure]] has also been recorded. In [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] on the other hand, no significant change in the [[heart]] activity has been found.&lt;ref name="swimming" /&gt;

After several weeks of hypoventilation training, physiological adaptations occur that delay the onset of [[acidosis]] during a maximal exertion test. The studies have shown that at a given workload, [[pH]] and [[blood]] [[bicarbonate]] concentrations were higher, whereas [[lactic acid|lactate]] concentrations had a tendency to decrease. The reduction in [[acidosis]] would be due to an improvement in buffer capacity at the [[muscle]] level. However, no change advantageous to aerobic [[metabolism]] has been found. [[Maximal oxygen uptake]] (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max), the number of [[red blood cells]] and the anaerobic threshold were not modified after hypoventilation training.

== Benefits of the method ==
By delaying [[acidosis]], hypoventilation training would also delay the onset of [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and would therefore improve performance during strenuous exertions of short to moderate durations. After several weeks of hypoventilation training, performance gains between 1 and 4% have been reported in [[running]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.resp.2007.09.010 |title=Effects of a 4-week training with voluntary hypoventilation carried out at low pulmonary volumes |year=2008 |last1=Woorons |first1=Xavier |last2=Mollard |first2=Pascal |last3=Pichon |first3=Aurélien |last4=Duvallet |first4=Alain |last5=Richalet |first5=Jean-Paul |last6=Lamberto |first6=Christine |journal=Respiratory Physiology &amp; Neurobiology |volume=160 |issue=2 |pages=123–30 |pmid=18160351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HV: l'altitude à p'tit prix! |year=2010 |url=http://apps.ysf-fsj.ca/virtualcwsf/projectdetails.php?switchlanguage=en&amp;id=2436}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[swimming (sport)|swimming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/sms.12140 |title=Controlled-frequency breath swimming improves swimming performance and running economy |year=2013 |last1=Lavin |first1=K.

Another advantage of hypoventilation training is to stimulate the anaerobic [[metabolism]] without using high exercise intensities, which are more traumatizing for the [[Human musculoskeletal system|locomotor system]] and therefore increase the risk of injuries. Athletes who return progressively to their sporting activity after being injured, and who therefore have to protect their [[muscle]]s, [[joint]]s or [[tendon]]s, could train at low or moderate intensity with hypoventilation.

== Disadvantages of the method ==
Hypoventilation training is physically demanding. This method is intended for highly motivated athletes, who do not have pulmonary or cardiovascular issues and whose primary objective is performance. Furthermore, exercising with hypoventilation can provoke [[headache]]s if the breath holdings are maintained too long or repeated over a too long period of time. Finally, this training method does not seem to be beneficial for [[endurance sport]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The number of Indian students studying abroad rapidly increased by 163% between 1999 and 2006 to reach 145,539 as compared to slower growth of 25% between 2006 and 2013 to reach 181,872, according an analysis of UNESCO data. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choudaha|first=Rahul|date=March 2017|title=Three waves of international student mobility (1999-2020)|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4RmnCsexL7ZckFpR1FXVFFQZ2M/view|journal=Studies in Higher Education|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1080/03075079.2017.1293872|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Students of Indian origin are [[Student migration|traveling]] in higher numbers than ever before to pursue [[higher education]] abroad. Nearly 85% of internationally mobile Indian students head for five countries—the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}—but China and Germany are both emerging destinations for Indian students heading abroad, though the numbers heading for Germany are still relatively small. In 2006, of the 123,000 studying outside India, 76,500 chose the US, followed by the UK; in 2001 India overtook China as the source of the largest number of foreign students in the United States.

== Students from India in the United States of America ==
The number of students studying in the US rose 94,563 to 103,260 in 2010–11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807081043/http://newdelhi.usembassy.gov/pr112509a.html|url=http://newdelhi.usembassy.gov/pr112509a.html|title=Press Releases 2009: U.S. Welcomes Indian Students, Prepares for PM Singh| date=18 November 2009 |archivedate=7 August 2011|publisher=Embassy of the United States New Delhi, India|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the students choose either the east coast or the mid-west as their destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Chennai/TN_applicants_to_US_opt_for_IT_Official/articleshow/3112393.cms|title=TN applicants to US opt for IT: Official - Times of India|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 India overtook China as the source of the largest number of foreign students in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2007/08/05/india-america-students-oped-cz_aaw_0813students.html "More Indians studying abroad"] ''Forbes'', 2007-08-05.&lt;/ref&gt; "In the US alone, nearly 45% of international students are either Chinese or Indians. That's almost half the market. Canada seems to be headed that way too. In 2010, the percentage share for China plus India was 30%.

== Students from India in the United Kingdom ==
The number of Indian students studying in the UK nearly doubled between 1999 and 2009,&lt;ref name="Guardian Staff and Agencies"&gt;{{cite news | work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/sep/24/internationalstudents-students|title = Twice as many foreign students at UK universities|  date = 24 September 2009 |accessdate=15 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; when 19,205 Indian students were studying at UK institutions.&lt;ref name="The Sunday Times"&gt;{{cite news | work=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)]]|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/100530/Education/ed12.html |title = Why students prefer to study in UK Colleges or Universities |  date = 30 May 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2010|05}}, half of all Indian students in the UK were studying at the [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate level]].&lt;ref name="The Independent"&gt;{{cite news | work=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/postgraduate/postgraduate-study/how-life-should-be-made-better-for-overseas-students-1971831.html |title = How Life Should be Made Better for Overseas Students |  date = 13 May 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010 | location=London | first=Harriet | last=Swain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Students from India in Australia ==
After peaking in 2009, the number of Indian students studying in Australia fell following racial attacks; by 2015 the number had risen to exceed the 2009 number.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; During 2013-14, 34,100 Australian visas were issued to Indian students, a rise of 38% as compared to the previous year.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Students from India in Germany ==
As of 2014-15, there are approximately 11000 Indian students studying in Germany, comprising 4.9% of international students in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iie.org/Services/Project-Atlas/Germany/International-Students-In-Germany#.WKn1nFeVuk0|title=Project Atlas|website=www.iie.org|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers are rising. German universities have started offering several master's programs in English, attracting Indian students.

==Other major destinations==
Nearly 85% of internationally mobile Indian students head for five countries: the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, but in addition to Germany, China, Ukraine, Russia and Georgia are some emerging destination for Indian students heading abroad.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Romania and Ukraine has also emerged as a destination for Indian students of medicine as the education system is regulated under the [[European Union]] and is of a higher quality than in the countries of the former USSR quality is relatively better compared to Ex-USSR, China, and the Philippines.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Many Indian students are also opting for higher education in the Netherlands because of the high quality of education, availability of more than 2,000 courses taught completely in English, and access to the European Union including career opportunities after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;B.

'''Inventive spelling''' (sometimes ''invented spelling'')  is the use of [[Convention (norm)|unconventional]] [[spelling]]s of words.

Conventional written English is not [[Phonemic orthography|phonetic]] (that is, it is not written as it sounds, due to the [[English orthography#History|history of its spelling]], which led to outdated, unintuitive, misleading or arbitrary spelling conventions and spellings of individual words) unlike, for example, [[German language|German]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]], where letters have relatively fixed associated sounds, so that the written text is a fair representation of the spoken words.

== Overview ==
[[English orthography|English spelling]] is not intuitive and must be learned.  There have been numerous proposals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wyrdplay.org/reform1.html|title=English Spelling Reform|author1=Alan Beale |author2=Paul Stought |author3=Bob Boden |publisher=Wyrdplay org|accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to rationalize written English, notably by 
* [[Noah Webster]] in the early 19th century (which is why the [[Webster's Dictionary]] used in the USA varies from the British [[Oxford English Dictionary]]) 
* Sir [[Isaac Pitman]], inventor of [[Pitman shorthand]] about 1838, which uses symbols to represent sounds, and words are, for the most part, written as they are spoken
* Dr. [[John R. Malone]] invented [[Unifon]] in the mid-1950s 
* Sir [[James Pitman]] (the grandson of Sir Isaac) in the early 1960s developed the [[Initial Teaching Alphabet]]
* Jaber Jabbour in 2012 proposed [[SaypU]], an abbreviated version of the International Phonetic Alphabet adapted for tourism and safety notices, which uses only part of the [[Latin alphabet]]

==In education==
Inventive spelling for children may be encouraged or discouraged by teachers and parents who may believe that expression is more important than accurate orthography or conversely that a failure to correct may lead to difficulty in communicating more complex ideas in later life.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Inventive spelling programs may also be known as "words their way" in some schools' curricula.&lt;ref name="Amazon-7770856"&gt;{{cite book |title=Words Their Way: Word Study for Phonics, Vocabulary, and Spelling Instruction |isbn=978-0-13-223968-4 |date=May 21, 2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=4  |first1=Donald R. |last1=Bear |first2=Marcia |last2=Invernizzi |first3=Shane |last3=Templeton |first4=Francine |last4=Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate over inventive or invented spelling ===
Samuel Orton pioneered the study of learning disabilities, such as [[dyslexia]]. where the subject is apt to confound the letter-order of words. He and  his assistant [[Anna Gillingham]], an educator and psychologist, evolved the [[Orton-Gillingham]] Approach to reading instruction which is language-based, multi-sensory, structured, sequential, cumulative, cognitive, and flexible. The Academy of Orton-Gillingham Practitioners and Educators (AOEPE) lists about a dozen schools currently committed to this controversial method, which has evolved since about 1935.

More recently, [[Uta Frith]], a developmental psychologist at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College, London, has published work concerning spelling difficulties and dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frith, Uta |title=Cognitive Processes in Spelling |publisher=Academic Press |location=London, UK |year=1983|isbn=0-12-268662-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyslexia, whether linked to complex spelling or not, may offer considerable potential for human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dyslexic Advantage: Unlocking the Hidden Potential of the Dyslexic Brain|author=Brock L. Eide M.D. M.A. |publisher=Penguin USA/Plume|year=2011|isbn=978-0-452-29792-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gift of Dyslexia|publisher=Penguin USA/Perigee|year=1999|isbn=978-0-399-53566-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning theory===

Whether an individual accepts or rejects inventive spelling is a feature of that individual's [[epistemology|theory of learning]]. The debate is closely linked with the debate over [[whole language]] [[literacy]] instruction and [[phonics]] instruction.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

====Theories of supporters====
Those who favor inventive spelling tend to believe in [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], a theoretical perspective on learning (an [[epistemology]]) grounded in [[postmodernism]] and [[holism]].  Constructivists believe that knowledge is created by individuals in a social context.  Because knowledge is cultural, there are no right answers.  In terms of inventive spelling, constructivists are likely to believe that the child is inventing spellings in accord with his or her understanding of language and print.  These spellings are neither right nor wrong; they reflect the child's development as a speller.

====Theories of detractors====
Those who oppose inventive spelling tend to be [[positivism|positivists]] or [[postpositivism|post-positivists]]. Positivists believe that there are correct answers that we can discover based upon [[empirical]] observation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} They would argue that encouraging inventive spelling is not helpful because there are correct ways to spell that children should learn.

Post-positivists believe that while we cannot know truth completely – our own biases and perspectives prevent that – we can ''approximate'' truth.  Post-positivists might agree with constructivists that an inventive spelling does reflect a child's development but might also argue that there are socially accepted spellings and that children should know these well. This side of the debate was explored further in the book and short film "The deliberate [[dumbing down]] of America".{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}
&lt;!-- This section and possibly this entire article uses weasel words and is in dire need of citations. --&gt;

====State of the debate====
Advocates of inventive spelling focus on creativity when children are first learning to spell and write, feel this preserves self-esteem, and thus, feel creativity in spelling is most important.&lt;ref&gt;Brügelmann, H./ Brinkmann, E. (2012): Supporting individual routes to literacy: Developing concepts and skills before school  by using print in meaningful contexts. Download: https://www.academia.edu/4274843/Supporting_individual_routes_to_literacy_Developing_concepts_and_skills_before_school_by_using_print_in_meaningful_contexts; Ferreiro, E./ Teberosky, A. (1982): Literacy before schooling. Heinemann: Portsmouth/ London (span. 1979); McGee, L.M., &amp; Richgels, D. J. (2012): Literacy's beginnings: Supporting young readers and writers. Pearson/ Allyn and Bacon: Boston et al. (6th ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Opponents counter that creativity is a distraction when learning spelling for the first time, and that children ought to be taught accurate spelling as soon as possible so as not to have incorrect spellings become a habit and delay the learning of accurate spelling.  The overwhelming view from parents {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} is that children learn to spell more quickly and accurately if accurate spelling is the focus instead of creativity when learning words.  Accuracy as the focus in spelling is the manner used in conventional teaching methods and was effectively universal prior to the implementation of 1970s school reform involving whole word literacy and "new math". &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Instruction===

====Inventive spelling instruction====
Pedagogical concepts &lt;ref&gt;e.g. by Brügelmann, H. (1986). ''Discovering print – a process approach to initial reading and writing in West Germany''. In: The Reading Teacher, Vol. 40, No. 3, 294–298; McGee, L. M./ Richgels, D. J. (2000). ''Literacy's beginnings: Supporting young readers and writers.'' Boston: Allyn and Bacon (3rd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  are based on research studies of early literacy, e.g. by  Emilia Ferreiro &amp; Ana Teberosky, Maryann Manning and others.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreiro, E./ Teberosky, A. (1982). ''Literacy before schooling''. Portsmouth/ London: Heinemann (span. 1979); Henderson, E. H./ Beers, J. W. (eds.) (1980). ''Developmental and cognitive aspects of learning to spell: A reflection of word knowledge''. Newark, Del.:  International Reading Association;  Clarke, L.K. (1988). ''Invented vs. traditional spelling in first graders' writings: Effects on learning to spell and read''. In: Research in the Teaching of English, Vol. 22, No. 3 (October), 281–309.&lt;/ref&gt; Children are encouraged to learn to read by writing in a meaningful context, e.g. by writing letters to others. To write a word they have to decompose its spoken form into sounds and then to translate them into letters, e.g. ''k'', ''a'', ''t'' for the [[phonemes]] /k/, /æ/, and /t/. Empirical studies &lt;ref&gt;Brügelmann, H. (1999). ''From invention to convention. Children's different routes to literacy. How to teach reading and writing by construction vs. instruction.'' In: Nunes, T. (ed.) (1999). ''Learning to read: An integrated view from research and practice.'' Dordrecht et al.: Kluwer(315–342); Richgels, D.J. (2001). ''Invented spelling, phonemic awareness, and reading and writing instruction.'' In: Neuman, S. B./ Dickinson, D. (eds.) (2001). ''Handbook on Research in Early Literacy for the 21st Century.'' New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; show that later orthographic development is fostered rather than hindered by these invented spellings - as long as children from the beginning are confronted with "book spellings", too.

To use [[SIL International]]'s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/ www.sil.org]&lt;/ref&gt; inventive spelling program, there are several instructional principles, as follows: 
* At first, the teachers should accept all of the student's writing as meaningful writing. As students gain more experience, they begin to learn the correct spellings of words and use these spellings in their writings.
* Let the students write freely and independently.
* Ask students to read what they have written.
* Read the text, or repeat the story as if you are reading it.
* Ignore spelling and [[grammar]] errors, unless the students ask to be corrected.
* Rewrite the text if students want you to.
* Help the students to create their own word lists as they write or edit so they can find out the proper spellings.

One aspect of inventive spelling rarely discussed by its advocates is the toll it takes on teachers' time.  Recent studies suggest that to be effective a spelling teacher also must correctly guess what words children meant to use when they invent spellings. The possible deductions are numerous and potentially complicated.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

====Instruction for conventional spelling====

[[Writing]] and [[Reading (process)|reading]] are complex cognitive processes of encoding and decoding symbols, of which spelling forms only part.  [[Flashcard|"Look and say"]] form an image of a word without spelling.  [[Spelling#Methods used to teach and learn spelling|Spelling training]] may require children to write out lists of words repeatedly, or engage in competitive [[spelling bee]] tests. Such methods of instruction do not tend to improve students' understanding of the relationship between spelling and pronunciation on any words except those prescribed.

Instruction that emphasizes conventional spelling focuses on the [[phonics]] patterns and rules in English which are anyway intrinsically weak because of the complexity of the [[history of the English language]].  For example, children can be taught that when they hear the {{IPA|/k/}} sound at the end of a one-[[syllable]] word where a [[phonics|short vowel]] precedes the sound, the {{IPA|/k/}} sound will be spelled ''ck'' (as in ''stack'', ''wreck'', ''stick'', ''rock'', and ''stuck'').  A similar pattern holds for the {{IPA|/dʒ/}} sound spelled ''dge'' (as in ''badge'', ''wedge'', ''bridge'', ''lodge'', and ''budge'') and the {{IPA|/tʃ/}} sound spelling ''tch''.

The same is also applicable for the process of learning acronyms. It is acceptable to use the inventive spelling of GBOL or ''Jeebol'' which can in turn be written as ''Jeeball''.

Once children learn these phonics patterns, they can apply them to words.  When children make errors, the teacher does not merely tell them they are wrong; the teacher, to the extent possible, returns the child's attention to the relevant rule or pattern.

There are also [[sight word]]s that do not follow patterns; children need to memorize conventional spellings for these words, such as ''who''.

==Benefits and costs==

===Benefits===

Whether teachers encourage children to use inventive spellings or not, analyzing them has several key advantages:
* Children's invented spellings help teachers understand what students know and do not know about the phonetic structure of the language.
* Sophisticated spelling, even if it is not conventional, may indicate strong [[phonological awareness]].
* Examining invented spellings may help researchers understand the development of phonological awareness and understanding of [[sound-symbol correspondence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcrr.org/Curriculum/.../Arndt_IDA2009_StudentsasSpellers.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/winter0506/Moats.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

For those teachers who emphasize constructivist, inventive spellings, there are further advantages:
* Children who are allowed to spell inventively may learn an earlier appreciation for [[writing]].
* Children who spell inventively may be more creative in their writing because they focus less on form. They may also use more complicated and precise words that occur in their oral vocabulary but that they do not yet know how to spell, helping them communicate their ideas more fully.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kappanmagazine.org/content/92/7/57.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

The above two suppositions on the benefits of inventive spelling have not been empirically verified and are not generally accepted by neurolinguists, who study the natural learning process of spoken language and have recently determined that reading and spelling are not "hard-wired", natural processes.

===Costs===
Permitting or encouraging children to spell inventively has some costs.
* According to some research, children may learn to spell correctly faster if they are taught to do so in a direct and systematic way.
* Encouraging inventive spelling may delay children's conventional spelling development.
* Early excitement about writing may give way to later frustration when students feel a lack of confidence about their misspellings.
* Some students like to spell things correctly and may resist attempts to get them to spell inventively.
* Practising bad spelling habits ingrains them and makes them difficult to overcome, while spelling correctly from the beginning eliminates this problem.

'''Lecturer''' is an [[List of academic ranks|academic rank]] within many universities, though the meaning of the term varies somewhat from country to country. It generally denotes an academic expert who is hired to teach on a full- or part-time basis. They may also conduct research.

==United Kingdom==
{{further|Academic ranks in the United Kingdom}}

In the UK, the term lecturer is ambiguous and covers several academic ranks. The key distinction is between permanent/open-ended or temporary/fixed-term lectureships.

A permanent lecturer in UK universities usually holds an open-ended position that covers teaching, research, and administrative responsibilities. Permanent lectureships are tenure-track or tenured positions that are equivalent to an assistant or associate professorship in North America. After a number of years, a lecturer may be promoted based on his or her research record to become a [[senior lecturer]]. This position is below [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] and [[professor]].

Research lecturers (where they are permanent appointments) are the equivalent in rank of lecturers and senior lecturers, but reflect a research-intensive orientation. Research lecturers are common in fields such as medicine, engineering, and biological and physical sciences.

In contrast, fixed-term or temporary lecturers are appointed for specific short-term teaching needs. These positions are often non-renewable and are common post-doctoral appointments. In North American terms, a fixed-term lecturer can hold an equivalent rank to assistant professor without tenure. Typically, longer contracts denote greater seniority or higher rank. Teaching fellows may also sometimes be referred to as lecturers—for example, [[Exeter]] named some of that group as education and scholarship lecturers (E &amp; S) to recognise the contribution of teaching, and elevate the titles of teaching fellows to lecturers. Some universities also refer to graduate students or others, who undertake ad-hoc teaching for a department [[sessional lecturer]]s. Like adjunct professors and sessional lecturers in North America, these non-permanent teaching staff are often very poorly paid (as little as £6000 p.a. in 2011-12).  These varying uses of the term lecturer cause confusion for non-UK academics.

As a proportion of UK academic staff, the proportion of permanent lectureships has fallen considerably. This is one reason why permanent lectureships are usually secured only after several years of post-doctoral experience. Data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency show that in 2013-14, 36 per cent of full- and part-time academic staff were on fixed-term contracts, down from 45 per cent a decade earlier. Over the same period, the proportion of academic staff on permanent contracts rose from 55 per cent to 64 per cent. Others were on contracts classed as “atypical”.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Else|first1=Holly|title=Zero Points: the persistence of temporary measures|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/content/few-crumbs-of-comfort-in-a-temporary-lecturers-day|accessdate=22 January 2016|publisher=Times Higher Education|date=4 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201032540/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/content/few-crumbs-of-comfort-in-a-temporary-lecturers-day|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical use===
Historically in the UK, promotion to a senior lectureship reflected prowess in teaching or administration rather than research, and the position was much less likely to lead direct to promotion to professor.&lt;ref&gt;University of London, Academic Promotion to Senior Lecturer, Reader, and Professor, Accessed 5 June 2011, [http://www.london.ac.uk/4293.html#c7160]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, promotion to senior lecturer nowadays is based on research achievements (for research-intensive universities), and is an integral part of the promotion path to a full chair. Promotion to reader is sometimes still necessary before promotion to a full chair; however, some universities no longer make appointments at the level of reader (for instance, the University of Leeds and the University of Oxford). Senior lecturers and readers are sometimes paid on the same salary scale, although readers are recognized as more senior. Readers in pre-1992 universities are generally considered at least the equivalent, in terms of status, of (full) professors in post-1992 universities.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Many academics consider it more prestigious to have been a reader in a pre-1992 university than a professor in a post-1992 university.{{who|date=November 2017}}

Many open-ended lecturers in the UK have a [[doctorate]] (50.1% in 2009-2010) and often have [[Postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral research]] experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/the-rise-and-rise-of-phds-as-standard/415203.article |title=The rise and rise of PhDs as standard|work=Times Higher Education | publisher=www.timeshighereducation.co.uk |accessdate=2011-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In almost all fields, a doctorate is a prerequisite, although historically this was not the case. Some academic positions could have been held on the basis of research merit alone, without a higher degree.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[David Fowler (mathematician)|David Fowler]] retired as a Senior Lecturer in Mathematics at Warwick in 1990 without having obtained a doctorate. See [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/david-fowler-549972.html "Obituary: David Fowler"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314083904/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/david-fowler-549972.html |date=14 March 2011 }}, ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current uses===
The [[new universities (United Kingdom)|new universities]] (that is universities that were until 1992 termed [[Institute of technology|polytechnics]]) have a slightly different ranking naming scheme from the older universities. Many pre-1992 universities use the grades: Lecturer (A), Lecturer (B), Senior Lecturer, Reader, Professor. Meanwhile, post-1992 grades are normally: Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Principal Lecturer (management-focused) or Reader (research-focused), Professor. Much confusion surrounds the differing use of the "Senior Lecturer" title. A Senior Lecturer in a post-1992 university is equivalent to a Lecturer (B) in a pre-1992 university, whereas a Senior Lecturer in a pre-1992 university is most often equivalent to a Principal Lecturer in a post-1992 university.&lt;ref name=Webb&gt;Graham Webb, ''Making the Most of Appraisal: Career and Professional Development Planning for Lecturers,'' Routledge, 1994, p. 30, {{ISBN|0-7494-1256-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Times Higher Education, the [[University of Warwick]] decided in 2006 "to break away from hundreds of years of academic tradition, renaming lecturers 'assistant professors', senior lecturers and readers 'associate professors' while still calling professors 'professors'. The radical move will horrify those who believe the "professor" title should be reserved for an academic elite."&lt;ref&gt;Lee Elliot Major, "[https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/get-the-drinks-its-professor-all-round/202229.article Get the drinks. It's professor all round]", ''Times Higher Education'', 31 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nottingham has a mixture of the standard UK system, and the system at Warwick, with both lecturers and assistant professors. At Reading, job advertisements and academic staff web pages use the title associate professor, but the ordinances of the university make no reference to these titles. They address only procedures for conferring the traditional UK academic ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/web/FILES/Calendar/New_Section_F_2010.pdf | title=Section XI Election and Appointment to Professorships or Readerships or Senior Lecturerships | work=Ordinances of the University of Reading (2010-11) | accessdate=18 December 2011 | pages=23–25 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416221602/http://www.reading.ac.uk/web/FILES/Calendar/New_Section_F_2010.pdf | archivedate=16 April 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure and permanent lectureships{{anchor|Tenure}}===
Since the Conservatives' 1988 Education Reform Act, the ironclad tenure that used to exist in the UK has given way to a less secure form of tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/memories-of-jobs-for-life/104896.article?storyCode=104896&amp;sectioncode=26|title = Memories of jobs for life|work = Times Higher Education (THE)|last = Court|first = Stephen|date = 5 December 1997|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160201042445/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/memories-of-jobs-for-life/104896.article?storyCode=104896&amp;sectioncode=26|archivedate = 1 February 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, university vice-chancellors can make individual faculty members redundant for poor performance or institute departmental redundancies, but in practice, this is rare. The most noted use of this policy happened in 2012 at [[Queen Mary University of London]] where lecturers on permanent contracts were fired. The institutions now has a stated policy of firing and replacing under-performing ''teaching'' staff members. This policy is complicated by the 2008 ''[[Ball v Aberdeen]]'' tribunal decision, the distinction between teaching and research faculty is blurring- with implications for who can and cannot be made redundant at UK universities, and under what conditions.

Despite this recent erosion of tenure in the UK, it is still practiced in most universities. Permanent contracts use the word "tenure" for lecturers who are "reappointed to the retiring age". This is equivalent to a US tenure decision—references are sought from world-leading academics and tenure and promotions committees meet to decide "tenure" cases. There is normally no title elevation in such instances—tenure and title are independent.

==Comparison==
The table presents a broad overview of the traditional main systems, but there are universities which use a combination of those systems or other titles. Note that some universities in Commonwealth countries have adopted the American system in place of the Commonwealth system.

==United States==
{{further|Academic ranks in the United States}}
As different US academic institutions use the term lecturer in various ways, there is sometimes confusion. On a generic level, the term broadly denotes ''one who teaches at a university but is not eligible for tenure and has no research obligations''. At non-research colleges, the latter distinction is less meaningful, making the absence of tenure the main difference between lecturers and other academic faculty. Unlike the adjective adjunct (which can modify most academic titles, from professor to lecturer to instructor, etc. and refers to part-time status), the title of lecturer at most schools does ''not'' address the issue of full-time vs. part-time status.

Lecturers are almost always required to have at least a master's degree and quite often have earned doctorates. (For example, at [[Columbia University]] in New York, the title of lecturer actually requires a doctorate or its professional equivalent; they also use the term for "instructors in specialized programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/vpaa/handbook/instruction.html|title=Officers of Instruction|author=|date=|website=www.columbia.edu|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Sometimes the title is used as an equivalent-alternative to [[Teacher|instructor]], but schools that use both titles tend to provide relatively more advancement potential (e.g. multiple ranks of progression, at least some of which entail faculty voting privileges or faculty committee service) to their lecturers.&lt;ref name="lsa.umich.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/pite/static%20files/lec34.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313194335/http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/pite/static%20files/lec34.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major research universities are more frequently hiring full-time lecturers, whose responsibilities tend to focus primarily in undergraduate education, especially for introductory/survey courses. In addition to the reason of higher-ranking faculty tending to prefer higher-level courses, part of the reason is also cost-savings, as non-tenure-track faculty tend to have lower salaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://hr.umich.edu/hrris/reports/docs/FSA_2011-2012.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a lecturer is part-time, there is little practical distinction in the position from an [[adjunct professor]]/instructor/etc., since all non-tenure-track faculty by definition are not on the tenure-track. However, for full-time lecturers (or those regularly salaried above some stated level, such as half-time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regents.umich.edu/bylaws/bylaws05a.html|title=Chapter V. The Faculties and Academic Staff - Regents of the University of Michigan|author=|date=|website=www.regents.umich.edu|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502114737/http://www.regents.umich.edu/bylaws/bylaws05a.html|archivedate=2 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;), many institutions now incorporate the role quite formally—managing it with performance reviews, promotional tracks, administrative service responsibilities, and many faculty privileges (e.g. voting, use of resources, etc.).&lt;ref name="lsa.umich.edu"/&gt;

An emerging alternative to using full-time lecturers at research institutions is to create a parallel professorship track that is focused on teaching. It may offer tenure, and typically has a title series such as teaching professor. (This is analogous to the ''research-only'' faculty tracks at some universities, which typically have title series such as research professor/scientist/scholar.)  A related concept—at least in professional fields—is the [[clinical professor]] or professor of practice, which in addition to a teaching focus (vs. research), also tend to have a practical/professional/skills oriented focus (vs. theory and scholarship, etc.).

In some institutions, the position of lecturer, especially "distinguished lecturer", may also refer to a position somewhat similar to ''emeritus professor'' or a temporary post used for visiting academics of considerable prominence—e.g. a famous writer may serve for a term or a year, for instance. When confusion arose about President [[Barack Obama]]'s status on the law faculty at the [[University of Chicago]], the institution stated that although his title was "senior lecturer", the university considered him to be a "professor" and further noted that it uses that title for notable people, such as federal judges and politicians, who are deemed of high prestige but lack the time to commit to a traditional tenure-track position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/was_barack_obama_really_a_constitutional_law.html "Was Barack Obama really a constitutional law lecturer?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617230454/http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/was_barack_obama_really_a_constitutional_law.html |date=17 June 2008 }}, Fact Check&lt;/ref&gt;  While other universities instead use the term "senior" as simply a matter of rank or promotion, all such references to lecturers of any rank are consistent with the normal U.S. practice of using ''lower-case-p'' "professor" as a common noun for anyone who teaches college, as well as a ''pre-nominal'' title of address (e.g. "Professor Smith") without necessarily referring to ''job'' title or position ''rank'' (e.g. "John Smith, Assistant/Associate/Full Professor of X").

==Australia==
{{further|Academic ranks (Australia and New Zealand)}}

In Australia, the term lecturer may be used informally to refer to anyone who conducts lectures at a university or elsewhere, but formally refers to a specific academic rank. The academic ranks in Australia are similar to those in the UK, with the rank of associate professor roughly equivalent to reader in UK universities. The academic levels in Australia are (in ascending academic level): A) associate lecturer, (B) lecturer, (C) senior lecturer, (D) associate professor, and (E) professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/Australia.aspx|title=Australia, Academic Career Structure|author=|date=|website=eui.eu|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628005947/http://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/Australia.aspx|archivedate=28 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
{{further|Academic ranks in India}}

In India, one can appear for interviews for a post of a lecturer after passing the competitive exam of [[National Eligibility Test]] conducted by the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]].

The position is equivalent to assistant professor in the US system. The term is not universally applied, with some universities preferring the lecturer/reader /professor titles, while others work with the assistant professor/associate professor/professor title.

As such, most lecturers' position can be considered tenure track.

In many states of India, the term lecturer or Post Graduate Teacher (PGT)&lt;ref name="kvs"&gt;{{cite web|title=KENDRIYA VIDYALAYA SANGATHAN|url=http://kvsangathan.nic.in/FAQ/recruitmentrulesfooter.htm|website=kvsangathan.nic.in|accessdate=27 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509234607/http://kvsangathan.nic.in/FAQ/recruitmentrulesfooter.htm|archivedate=9 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also used for the intermediate college teachers.&lt;ref name="lect"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alam |first1=Shah Manzoor |title=Urban Growth Theories and Settlement Systems of India|date=2011|publisher=Concept Publishing Company |isbn=9788180697395|page=xii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2E-XejrqHt0C&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=lecturer+intermediate+college#v=onepage&amp;q=lecturer%20intermediate%20college&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intermediate colleges or Junior Colleges are equivalent to [[Higher Secondary Examination|higher secondary]] schools.

==Other countries==
{{further|List of academic ranks}}

In other countries, usage varies. In [[Israel]], the term has a meaning in academia similar to that in the UK.

In [[France]], the title ''maître de conférences'' ("lecture master") is a permanent position that covers research and teaching (and usually administrative responsibilities). It is the lower of the two permanent faculty ranks (the other being ''professeur des universités'' or "university professor").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006064492|title=Décret n°84-431 du 6 juin 1984 fixant les dispositions statutaires communes applicables aux enseignants-chercheurs et portant statut particulier du corps des professeurs des universités et du corps des maîtres de conférences|last=|first=|date=|website=legifrance.gouv.fr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of ''lecteur'' is used for teachers of foreign languages with no research responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Décret n°87-754 du 14 septembre 1987 relatif au recrutement de lecteurs de langue étrangère et de maîtres de langue étrangère dans les établissements publics d'enseignement supérieur relevant du ministre chargé de l'enseignement supérieur|date=September 14, 1987|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000867627|volume=|pages=|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In German-speaking countries, the term ''lektor'' historically denoted a teaching position below a professor, primarily responsible for delivering and organizing lectures. The contemporary equivalent is ''dozent'' or . Nowadays, the German term ''lektor'' exists only in philology or modern-language departments at German-speaking universities for positions that primarily involve teaching a foreign language.  The equivalent rank within the German university system is something like ''Juniorprofessor'', ''Dozent'', ''Hochschuldozent'', ''Juniordozent'', ''Akademischer Rat'' or ''-Oberrat'',  ''Lehrkraft für besondere Aufgaben'', and the like.

In [[Poland]], the related term ''lektor'' is used for a teaching-only position, generally for teaching foreign languages.

In [[Norway]], a ''lektor'', University Lektor and University College Lektor are academic ranks at universities and university colleges in Norway. The requirements for such position is a combination of relevant degree on master level (five years master or bachelor plus two years master) or higher, research experience, teaching experience and pedagogic education and training. The rank is similar to Lecturer in Great Britain.
The Rank is also an academic rank which enables a teacher to lecture at [[Ungdomsskole]] (secondary school) on specialized fields and [[Videregående skole]] (high school) level. All teacher students in Norway are now required to reach a master's degree in order to be able to teach at all levels up to universities and university colleges. 
 
In [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]], a ''lektor'' or ''universitetslektor'' is an academic rank similar to that of senior lecturer in Great Britain and associate professor in USA. The ''lektor'' holds the position below professor in rank.

In [[Singapore]], a Lecturer at the [[National University of Singapore]] is a full-time and renewable position that include both the opportunities for research funding and for promotion to Associate Professor on the [[Educator Track]]. It is equivalent to [[Teaching Assistant Professor]] at a US university.

In [[South Korea]], the term ''gangsa'' is the literal translation of "part-time lecturer". A gangsa is usually part-time, paid by the number of hours of teaching. No research or administrative obligation is attached. In most disciplines, gangsa is regarded as a first step in one's academic career. In Korea, the tenure position started from "full-time lecturer". The tenure track positions in South Korea are "full-time lecturer (JunImGangSa)", "assistant professor (JoKyoSu)", "associate professor (BuKyosu)", and "professor (KyoSu)". Therefore, "full-time lecturer" is the same position as "assistant professor" in other countries, including the USA.

In the Netherlands, a "lector" used to be equivalent to the rank of associate professor at universities. Nowadays, it is the highest rank at so-called "applied universities" (i.e., school providing higher vocational/professional training to their students). At regular universities, this rank does not exist anymore.

'''''Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong''''' is a 1995 book by [[James W. Loewen]], a  sociologist. It critically examines twelve popular American [[high school]] history textbooks and concludes that the textbook authors propagate false, [[Eurocentric]] and [[mythology|mythologized]] views of [[History of the United States|American history]]. In addition to his critique of the dominant historical themes presented in high school textbooks, Loewen presents themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. A revised hardcover edition was released on April 1, 2008.

==Themes==
In ''Lies My Teacher Told Me'',  Loewen criticizes modern American high school history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people  and events such as [[Christopher Columbus]], the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their "bland" and simplistic style. He proposes that when [[History of the United States|American history]] textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of [[hero]]es, they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past. In other words, the history-as-myth method teaches students that America's greatest days have already passed. Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students, especially groups excluded from the positive histories.&lt;ref&gt;Loewen, James. [http://www.ushistory.org/us/historians/loewen.asp Interview by ushistory.org]. 12 May 2000. Web. 21 Aug 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">A '''literate environment''' may include written materials ([[newspapers]], [[books]] and [[posters]]), electronic and broadcast [[Mass media|media]] (radios and TVs) and information and communications technology ([[phones]], [[computers]] and [[Internet]] access), which encourage literacy acquisition, a reading culture, improved literacy retention and access to information.

Literate environments can be found in both public and private spheres, including home, school, workplace, local community and the nation as a whole. Developing rich literate environments therefore includes [[Language policy|language policies]], book publishing, media, and access to information and reading materials.

A rich literate environment is essential for encouraging individuals to become literate and sustain and integrate their newly acquired skills in their everyday lives. The social and cultural environments in which people live and work can be characterized as being either more or less supportive of the acquisition and practice of literacy. In certain developing country contexts, the lack of written material in whatever form is a serious constraint on the practice of literacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/education/GMR2006/full/chapt10_eng.pdf The EFA Global Monitoring Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have studied the development of infants through various topics and have found support for both maturation and environmentalism. Two of the most commonly studied topics are: i) infant crawling and ii) infant language learning. Psychologists have found evidence supporting both the maturation theory and environmentalism theory when investigating each of these topics.

== Infant crawling ==
[[File:Ten_m3-Regulates-Eye-Specific-Patterning-in-the-Mammalian-Visual-Pathway-and-Is-Required-for-pbio.0050241.sv001.ogv|thumb|This video clip shows a visual cliff made for rats. The checkered material is the shallow area. The area not containing the checkered material is the deep area. Rats crossing this boundary experience the illusion of a drop in height.]]
One of the most common apparatus used by psychologists to study infant crawling is the [[visual cliff]]. This cliff was first used with different types of animals as well as infants to measure depth perception''.'' &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walk|first=Richard D.|last2=Gibson|first2=Eleanor J.|title=A comparative and analytical study of visual depth perception.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0093827|journal=Psychological Monographs: General and Applied|language=en|volume=75|issue=15|pages=1–44|doi=10.1037/h0093827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organisms are placed on a raised glass board. Under the glass, material is placed to give the effect of a floor on one side of the apparatus. On the other side, the material is taken away to give the effect of a drop, and a deep side''.'' &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When infants are placed on this apparatus, psychologists can study whether or not these infants, or other animals, have gained the skills needed to understand that the visual drop is dangerous, or if they still cross the drop point.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If young infants can avoid the experimental drop while crawling, researchers can assume that the aversion to cliffs is innately learned, not learned through crawling experience or teaching.

=== Arguments for maturation ===
In one study, it was found that the age an infant begins crawling, and not the crawling experience of an infant, determined whether they would cross or avoid the visual cliff. The infants with a later crawling start date avoided the cliff significantly more than infants with an earlier crawling start date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=John|last2=Radar|first2=Nancy|date=|title=Crawling-Onset Age Predicts Visual Cliff Avoidance in Infants|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|volume=7|pages=382-287|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations indicate that there is a biological time clock that is intuitively teaching infants about depth avoidance, rather than crawling experience teaching them about avoidance. These conclusions are consistent with maturation theory. In another study, psychologists found that the crawling experience negatively affected infants who could not yet walk and were placed in walkers on the virtual cliff. In this study too, the age when crawling began was a better indicator of whether the infant would avoid the cliff rather than his or her crawling experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rader|first=Nancy|last2=Bansano|first2=Mary|last3=Richards|first3=John E.|date=|title=On the Nature of the Visual-Cliff-Avoidance Response in Human Infants|url=|journal=Child Development|volume=51|pages=61–68|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lends evidence to the theory of maturation and innate age related steps in development, rather than external factors.

=== Arguments for environmentalism ===
Studies using a real water visual cliff found that infants with greater crawling experience had an easier time avoiding the cliff than those with less experience. A water cliff is a visual cliff with water in the deep end of the apparatus, and can measure an infant's potential perception of danger, as well as sensitivity to water''.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burnay|first=Carolina|last2=Cordovil|first2=Rita|date=2016-09-01|title=Crawling Experience Predicts Avoidance of Real Cliffs and Water Cliffs: Insights from a New Paradigm|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/infa.12134/abstract|journal=Infancy|language=en|volume=21|issue=5|pages=677–684|doi=10.1111/infa.12134|issn=1532-7078}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicating that crawling experience was a greater indicator of avoidance align with the environmentalism theory in that infants learn through experiences with their environment. Additionally, researchers have also observed that infants who have learnt avoidance through crawling carried this avoidance over to when they start walking, rather than having to relearn these skills. '''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witherington|first=David C.|last2=Campos|first2=Joseph J.|last3=Anderson|first3=David I.|last4=Lejeune|first4=Laure|last5=Seah|first5=Eileen|date=2005-05-01|title=Avoidance of Heights on the Visual Cliff in Newly Walking Infants|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15327078in0703_4/abstract|journal=Infancy|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=285–298|doi=10.1207/s15327078in0703_4|issn=1532-7078}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' These carryover effects indicate that infants are learning and processing through interactions with their environment and can apply their learnings to other new situations.

=== Mixed results ===
It has also been observed that a mother's emotions, seen through facial expression, can sometimes regulate an infant's behavior. Infants were placed on a visual cliff with a clear drop, and were able to see their mothers' facial expressions. When the mothers expressed fear, fewer infants crossed the cliff, indicating that the mothers' expressions had an effect on their behavior, supporting the environmentalism theory. However, when infants were placed on a visual cliff with a hidden drop, many infants crossed regardless of their mothers' facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorce|first=James F.|last2=Emde|first2=Robert N.|last3=Campos|first3=Joseph J.|last4=Klinnert|first4=Mary D.|title=Maternal emotional signaling: Its effect on the visual cliff behavior of 1-year-olds.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.21.1.195|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=195–200|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.21.1.195}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lends credence to the maturation theory; infants innately understand crawling and do not take cues from their surroundings.

== Language learning ==
While specific alphabets, grammar, and sounds might differ in different regions of the world, language is a universal form of communication within all societies, with all infants learning how to speak early in their lives. However, there has been much debate on how children acquire their language skills. More specifically, psychologists have argued about whether the skills of learning a language are innate within all humans, consistent with the maturation theory, or are learned through societal teaching practices, consistent with the theory of environmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila|date=|title=Maturational determinants of language growth|url=|journal=Cognition|volume=10|pages=102–114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCartney|first=Kathleen|date=|title=Effect of Quality of Day Care Environment on Children's Language Development|url=|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=20|pages=244–260|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments for maturation ===
Infants are usually thought to be quick language learners, as people believe that children have implicit abilities to learn languages, whereas adults learning a language must use explicit instruction to obtain proficiency. However, it was found that if given explicit instructions, both children and adults learn new languages effectively. This finding endorse the reasoning that children have inherent abilities to learn languages that are not influenced by the environment. However, these inherent abilities to learn languages can be developed into even stronger skills with help from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lichtman|first=Karen|date=2016|title=Age and learning environment: Are children implicit second language learners?*|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-child-language/article/age-and-learning-environment-are-children-implicit-second-language-learners/457C069A5339D656788E7E8D217B2A3A|journal=Journal of Child Language|language=en|volume=43|issue=3|pages=707–730|doi=10.1017/S0305000915000598|issn=0305-0009|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments for environmentalism ===
One way to examine the potential effect of the environment on the language abilities of children is to study the effects of day care environments on language learning skills. If young children spend a significant portion of their formative years in day care, and if the environment influences their ability to learn language, then there should be a correlation between the quality of day care and language abilities. Psychologists studying this relationship found that the quality of day cares, as well as the language skills of the day care providers are large predictors of children's' language ability. Children in higher quality day care locations had much stronger language abilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This evidence strongly supports the environmental theory that argues factors in a child's environment affect their development and language abilities. Additionally, the longer an infant or child experiences better care during their formative years, the stronger its language skills will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Weilin|last2=Farkas|first2=George|last3=Duncan|first3=Greg|last4=Burchinal|first4=Margaret|last5=Vandell|first5=Deborah Lowe|date=|title=Timing of High-Quality Child Care and Cognitive, Language, and Preacademic Development|url=|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=49|pages=1440–1451|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parent's responsiveness to children can also help facilitate language and vocabulary growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tamis-LeMonda|first=Catherine S.|last2=Kuchirko|first2=Yana|last3=Song|first3=Lulu|date=|title=Why is infant language learning facilitated by parental responsiveness?|url=|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=23|pages=121–126|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Environmentalism and behavioral interventions ====
In children with language development problems and behavioral disorders, parent behavioral interventions and speech therapy interventions have also been shown to significantly improve language development in young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tempel|first=Ashley B.|last2=Wagner|first2=Stephanie M.|last3=McNeil|first3=Cheryl B.|title=Parent-child interaction therapy and language facilitation: The role of parent-training on language development.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0100241|journal=The Journal of Speech and Language Pathology – Applied Behavior Analysis|language=en|volume=3|issue=2-3|pages=216–232|doi=10.1037/h0100241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parental influence can change and dictate young children language skills, an improvement that would not be seen from just internal maturation factors alone.

'''May Lucretia Shepard Cheney''' (May 11, 1862 – April 22, 1942) was born during the Civil War in Garden Grove, Iowa, and was named after the month in which she was born, and her maternal grandmother who influenced her childhood. May's early school attendance was in her hometown. She attended high schools in Oakland and Chico, California before enrolling at [[University of California, Berkeley|UCB]] in 1879. With her widowed mother, she settled at ''2020 Hearst Avenue'' (then ''College Way''), in a house with a watermill in the rear yard.&lt;ref name=BH&gt;{{cite web| url=http://berkeleyheritage.com/berkeley_landmarks/cheney.html| title=U.C. offers the American Turgenev’s house for one dollar| work=[[Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residing in the same house was [[Lemuel Warren Cheney]] (1858–1921), a law student.&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;

The following year, the Shepards moved to 2316 Allston Way, across the street from the campus. Before long, Cheney had moved there too. The Shepards’ last address before May’s graduation in 1883 was Club House No. 4 on the university grounds, again shared by Cheney, now a journalist. In addition to their shared living quarters, May and Lemuel had a common interest in literature. Both belonged to the Neolaean Literary Society, of which May was vice-president.&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucb/studentpubs.html| title=Berkeley: Student Publications| work=[[University of California, Berkeley Libraries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 1883, during her senior year, she married Cheney, the Bachelor of Letters degree was granted to her in December of that year. They left for Europe, where he served as [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] correspondent for the [[San Francisco Chronicle]]. Their first son, Charles Henry Cheney, was born in Rome in February 1884. Upon their return she and her husband had a house built close to UCB, on College Avenue in [[Lodi, California|Lodi]].&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;

In 1886, when she was 24 years old, May founded Cheney’s Pacific Coast Bureau of Education in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. It was the first commercial teacher placement agency west of the Rockies, and her husband participated in its management. She decided that UCB owed some obligation to the graduates unable to find proper positions. The English universities had appointment secretaries. Harvard University had a similar official. UCB, she thought, should likewise give such a service to students. After she convinced UCB President [[Martin Kellogg]], her plan was accepted. She opened the UCB placement service in the president's office in South Hall on January 1, 1898, and continued to serve as the university’s Appointment Secretary for 40 years, placing countless university graduates as high-school teachers throughout the state.&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;

The Cheneys raised four sons, three of whom survived to adulthood. The eldest, Charles Henry Cheney (1884–1943), earned the first architectural degree awarded by UC before continuing his studies in Paris, eventually becoming a notable city planner and zoning expert. His son, Warren DeWitt Cheney (1907-1979), was a well-known sculptor and art teacher who took up psychology in midlife, founding the Transactional Analysis Journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.invaluable.com/artist/cheney-warren-dewitt-e1e1hbp3gx| title=Warren Dewitt Cheney (1907-1979)| work=Invaluable.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheldon Warren Cheney]] (1886–1980), entered his father’s real estate business before moving to Detroit, where he became a notable author and art critic. In 1916 he founded [[Theatre Arts Magazine]]. Marshall Chipman Cheney (1888–1972) became a physician. He did his residency at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]] before returning to Berkeley, where he practiced near the campus and at Cowell Memorial Hospital. He lived with his widowed mother at 2241 College Avenue until 1940.&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;

At the end of 1939, May Cheney sold her two campus houses to the university, and the family soon moved to 116 Tunnel Road. The two Cheney houses on campus were designated City of Berkeley Landmarks in 1990. Built in 1885, 2241 College Avenue is the second oldest surviving structure in the Berkeley Property Tract.

May L. Cheney was the founder of the National Association of Appointment Secretaries (NAAS) now known as the [[American College Personnel Association]].&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In choosing a permanent home we seek that place above all others which promises abundance of life, stimulus, interests that postpone as long as possible the inevitable apathy of old age. Where do we find this precious boon more abundantly than in Berkeley?&lt;ref&gt;May L. Cheney, ''Berkeley Reporter'', December 1906&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cheney unhurt in campus shooting==
On August 4, 1919, Cheney was shot at by Roger Sprague, a chemistry assistant who was despondent at not being recommended for further advancement. She escaped unhurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SU19190805.2.6| title=Refused Position, Man Attempts Life Of Two Professors| work=[[The Sacramento Union]], Volume 209, Number 36 (Sacramento, California)| date=5 August 1919| page=1| accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mixed-sex education''', also known as '''mixed-gender education''', '''co-education''' or '''coeducation''' (abbreviated to '''co-ed''' or '''coed'''), is a system of [[education]] where males and females are educated together. Whereas [[single-sex education]] was more common up to the 19th century, mixed-sex education has since become standard in many cultures, particularly in Western countries. Single-sex education, however, remains prevalent in many Muslim countries. The relative merits of both systems have been the subject of debate.

The world's oldest co-educational day and boarding school is [[Dollar Academy]], a junior and senior school for males and females from ages 5 to 18 in Scotland, United Kingdom. From its opening in 1818 the school admitted both boys and girls of the parish of Dollar and the surrounding area. The school continues in existence to the present day with around 1,250 pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dollaracademy.org.uk/about-dollar |title=About Dollar |website=Dollar Academy |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first co-educational college to be founded was [[Oberlin Collegiate Institute]] in Oberlin, Ohio. It opened on December 3, 1833, with 44 students, including 29 men and 15 women. Fully equal status for women did not arrive until 1837, and the first three women to graduate with bachelor's degrees did so in 1840.&lt;ref name="new.oberlin.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://new.oberlin.edu/about/history.dot|title=History {{!}} About Oberlin {{!}} Oberlin College|website=Oberlin College and Conservatory|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late 20th century, many institutions of higher learning that had been exclusively for people of one sex had become coeducational.

==History==
In early civilizations, people were educated informally: primarily within the household. As time progressed, education became more structured and formal. Women often had very few rights when education started to become a more important aspect of civilization. Efforts of the ancient Greek and Chinese societies focused primarily on the education of males. In ancient Rome, the availability of education was gradually extended to women, but they were taught separately from men. The early Christians and medieval Europeans continued this trend, and single-sex schools for the privileged classes prevailed through the Reformation period.

In the 16th century, at the [[Council of Trent]], the Roman Catholic church reinforced the establishment of free elementary schools for children of all classes. The concept of universal elementary education, regardless of sex, had been created.&lt;ref&gt;"Coeducation." (n.d.): Funk &amp; Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia. Web. 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Reformation, coeducation was introduced in western Europe, when certain Protestant groups urged that boys and girls should be taught to read the Bible. The practice became very popular in northern England, Scotland, and colonial New England, where young children, both male and female, attended [[dame school]]s. In the late 18th century, girls gradually were admitted to town schools. The [[Society of Friends]] in England, as well as in the United States, pioneered coeducation as they did universal education, and in Quaker settlements in the British colonies, boys and girls commonly attended school together. The new free public elementary, or [[common schools]], which after the [[American Revolution]] supplanted church institutions, were almost always coeducational, and by 1900 most public high schools were coeducational as well.&lt;ref&gt;"coeducation". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.  Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coeducation grew much more widely accepted. In Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union, the education of girls and boys in the same classes became an approved practice.

==Australia==
In Australia there is a trend towards increased coeducational schooling with new coeducational schools opening, few new single sex schools opening and existing single sex schools combining or opening their doors to the opposite gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guest|first1=Murray|title=The Single Sex v Coeducation Debate and the Experience of Schools that Change Status|url=http://www.as.edu.au/content/uploads/2015/02/Final-Coeducation_Research_Paper_Feb_2015.pdf|publisher=The Armidale School|accessdate=2 January 2017|location=Armidale, NSW|format=pdf|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
The first mixed-sex institution of higher learning in [[China]] was the [[Nanjing Higher Normal Institute]], which was renamed [[National Central University]] and [[Nanjing University]]. For millennia in China, public schools, especially public higher learning schools, were for men. Generally only schools established by zongzu (宗族, gens) were for both male and female students. Some schools such as [[Li Zhi (Ming Dynasty)|Li Zhi]]'s school in [[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Yuan Mei]]'s school in [[Qing Dynasty]] enrolled both male and female students. In the 1910s women's universities were established such as [[Ginling Women's University]] and Peking Girls' Higher Normal School, but there were no coeducation in higher learning schools.

[[Tao Xingzhi]], the Chinese advocator of mixed-sex education, proposed ''The Audit Law for Women Students'' (規定女子旁聽法案) at the meeting of Nanjing Higher Normal School held on December seventh, 1919. He also proposed that the university recruit female students. The idea was supported by the president [[Guo Bingwen]], academic director [[Liu Boming (philosopher)|Liu Boming]], and such famous professors as [[Lu Zhiwei]] and Yang Xingfo, but opposed by many famous men of the time. The meeting passed the law and decided to recruit women students next year. Nanjing Higher Normal School enrolled eight Chinese female students in 1920. In the same year [[Peking University]] also began to allow women students to audit classes. One of the most notable female students of that time was [[Jianxiong Wu]].

In 1949, the [[People's Republic of China]] was founded. The Chinese government has provided more equal opportunities for education since then,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and all schools and universities have become mixed-sex. In recent years, however, many female and/or single-sex schools have again emerged for special vocational training needs but equal rights for education still apply to all citizens.

In China Muslim [[Hui people|Hui]] and Muslim [[Salar people|Salars]] are against coeducation, due to Islam,{{clarify|date=December 2017}} [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]s are the only Muslims in China that do not mind coeducation and practice it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qRSOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202 |title=China's universities, 1895-1995: a century of cultural conflict|author=Ruth Hayhoe|year=1996|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=|page=202|isbn=0-8153-1859-6|pages=|accessdate= 29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==

Admission to the [[Sorbonne]] was opened to girls in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vUql-4-eW6QC&amp;pg=PA35 La mixité dans l'éducation: enjeux passés et présents]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[baccalaureat]] became gender-blind in 1924, giving equal chances to all girls in applying to any universities. Mixed-sex education became mandatory for primary schools in 1957 and for all universities in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ettajdid.org/spip.php?article138 |title=Réflexions sur la mixité scolaire en France |publisher=Ettajdid.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Paul's Co-educational College]] was the first mixed-sex [[high school|secondary school]] in [[Hong Kong]]. It was founded in 1915 as St. Paul's Girls' College. At the end of [[World War II]] it was temporarily merged with [[St. Paul's College, Hong Kong|St. Paul's College]], which is a boys' school. When classes at the campus of St. Paul's College were resumed, it continued to be mixed, and changed to its present name. Some others renowned mixed-sex secondary schools in town include Hong Kong Pui Ching Middle School, [[Queen Elizabeth School, Hong Kong|Queen Elizabeth School]] and [[Tsuen Wan Government Secondary School]]. Most of the Hong Kong primary and secondary schools are mixed-sex educations, include government public schools, charter schools and private schools.

{{Further|Education in Pakistan|List of colleges in Pakistan|List of universities in Pakistan}}
[[Pakistan]] is one of the many [[Muslim]] countries where most [[school]]s, [[college]]s and [[University|universities]] are single gender although some universities, colleges and schools are [[coeducational]]. In schools that offer O levels and A levels, co-education is quite prevalent. After the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, most universities were coeducational by name but the proportion of women was less than 5%. After the [[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Islamization]] policies in early 1980s the government established [[Women's college]]s and [[Women's university|Women's universities]] to promote education among women who were hesitant of studying in mixed-sex environment. Today, however, most universities and a large number of schools in urban areas are co-educational.

[[File:Education_in_England.jpg|thumb]]
In the United Kingdom the official term is ''mixed'',&lt;ref&gt;{{UK SI | year=2007 | number=2324 | url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;searchDay=15&amp;searchMonth=9&amp;searchYear=2007&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;text=mixed+sex&amp;extent=E%2bW%2bS%2bN.I.&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=3399271&amp;ActiveTextDocId=3399271&amp;filesize=51744 | title=The Education (School Performance Information) (England) Regulations 2007}}, Schedule 6, regulation 11, clause 5(b).&lt;/ref&gt; and today most [[school]]s are mixed.
A number of Quaker co-educational boarding schools were established before the 19th century.
The Scottish [[Dollar Academy]] was the first mixed-sex day and boarding school in the UK. Founded in 1818, it is the oldest mixed-sex educational institution in the world still in existence. In England the first non-Quaker mixed-sex public boarding school was [[Bedales School]], founded in 1893 by [[John Haden Badley]] and becoming mixed in 1898.  Many previously [[single-sex school]]s have begun to accept both sexes in the past few decades: for example, [[Clifton College]] began to accept girls in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Skelton, ed. ''Whatever happens to little women?: gender and primary schooling'' (London:. Open University Press, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher-education institutions===

{{further |University of Oxford#Women's education| University of Cambridge#Women's education}}

The first higher-education institution in the United Kingdom to allow women and men to enter on equal terms, and hence be admitted to academic degrees, was the [[University of Bristol]] (then established as [[University College, Bristol]]) in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

Given their dual role as both boarding house and educational establishment, individual colleges at Oxford and Cambridge remained segregated for much longer. The first Oxford college to house both men and women was the graduate-only [[Nuffield College]] in 1937; the first five undergraduate colleges (Brasenose, Hertford, Jesus, [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's]] and Wadham) became mixed in 1974. The first mixed Cambridge college was the graduate-only [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin]] from its foundation in 1964. [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill]], [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare]] and [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]] Colleges were the first previously all-male colleges of the University of Cambridge to admit female [[undergraduate]]s in 1972. [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene]] was the last all-male college to become mixed in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,3604,976477,00.html | title = Obituary –  Professor Sir Bernard Williams| work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 8 May 2009 | date = 13 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last single-sex (all-women's) college in Oxford, [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]], became mixed as of [[Michaelmas term]] 2008; however some [[Permanent Private Hall]]s still exist which are open only to men. Three colleges remain single-sex (women-only) at Cambridge: [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|Murray Edwards (New Hall)]], [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]] and [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish]].

{{Further|List of mixed-sex colleges and universities in the United States|Women's colleges in the United States}}

The oldest extant mixed-sex institute of higher education in the United States is [[Oberlin College]] in [[Oberlin, Ohio]], which was established in 1833.  Mixed-sex classes were admitted to the preparatory department at Oberlin in 1833 and the college department in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = One Hundred Years Toward Suffrage | url = http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/naw/nawstime.html | accessdate = 26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Indiana&gt;{{cite web | last = Jones | first = Christine | title = Indiana University: The Transition to Coeduation | url = http://www.indiana.edu/~iuspa/journal/editions/2002/Jones.pdf | accessdate = 11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first four women to receive bachelor's degrees in the United States earned them at Oberlin in 1841.  Later, in 1862, the first black woman to receive a bachelor's degree ([[Mary Jane Patterson]]) also earned it from Oberlin College.  Beginning in 1844, [[Hillsdale College]] became the next college to admit mixed-sex classes to four-year degree programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hillsdale College –  History &amp; Misson | url = http://www.hillsdale.edu/about/history.asp | accessdate = 15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Iowa]] became the first coeducational [[Public university|public]] or state university in the United States in 1855,&lt;ref name=Roch&gt;{{cite web | first = A.J. | last = May | title = University of Rochester History | url = http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=2319 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for much of the next century, public universities, and [[Land-grant university|land grant universities]] in particular, would lead the way in mixed-sex higher education.  There were also many private coeducational universities founded in the 19th century, especially west of the Mississippi River.  East of the Mississippi, [[Wheaton College (Illinois)]] graduated its first female student in 1862,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://a2z.my.wheaton.edu/wheaton-firsts|title=Wheaton "Firsts" - Wheaton History A to Z|website=a2z.my.wheaton.edu|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Cornell University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gradschool.cornell.edu/index.php?p=36|title=Our History|accessdate= 21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Michigan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_at_Michigan.htm|title=Dangerous Experiment}}&lt;/ref&gt; each admitted their first female students in 1870.

Around the same time, [[Single-sex education|single-sex]] women's colleges were also appearing.  According to Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra: "[[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]]s were founded during the mid- and late-19th century in response to a need for advanced education for women at a time when they were not admitted to most institutions of higher education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html|title=Women's Colleges in the United States: History, Issues, and Challenges|accessdate=14 October 2006 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428110902/http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html |archivedate=28 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable examples include the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] colleges, of which [[Vassar College]] is now coeducational and [[Radcliffe College]] has merged with [[Harvard University]].  Other notable women's colleges that have become coeducational include [[Wheaton College (Massachusetts)|Wheaton College]] in Massachusetts, [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College]] in [[Ohio]], [[Skidmore College]], [[Wells College]], and [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in New York state, [[Pitzer College]] in California, [[Goucher College]] in Maryland and [[Connecticut College]].

By 1900 the Briton [[Frederic Harrison]] said after visiting the United States that "The whole educational machinery of America ... open to women must be at least twentyfold greater than with us, and it is rapidly advancing to meet that of men both in numbers and quality".&lt;ref name="stead1901"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/americanizationo01stea#page/384/mode/2up | title=The Americanization of the World | publisher=Horace Markley | author=Stead, W. T. | year=1901 | pages=385–386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where most of the history of coeducation in this period is a list of those moving toward the accommodation of both men and women at one campus, the state of Florida was an exception. In 1905, the Buckman Act was one of consolidation in governance and funding but separation in race and gender, with the campus that became what is now [[Florida State University]] designated to serve white females during this era, the campus that became what is now the [[University of Florida]] serving white males, and coeducation stipulated only for the campus serving black students at the site of what is now [[Florida A &amp; M]]. Florida did not return to coeducation at UF and FSU until after World War II, prompted by the drastically increased demands placed on the higher education system by veterans studying via GI Bill programs following World War II. The Buckman arrangements officially ended with new legislation guidelines passed in 1947.

===Primary and secondary schools===
Several early [[Primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s in the United States were single-sex.  Examples include [[Collegiate School (New York)|Collegiate School]], a boys' school operating in New York by 1638 (which remains a single-sex institution); and [[Boston Latin School]], founded in 1635 (which didn't became coeducational until 1972).

Nonetheless, mixed-sex education existed at the lower levels in the U.S. long before it extended to colleges.  For example, in 1787, the predecessor to [[Franklin and Marshall College]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], opened as a mixed-sex secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones Achieved by the Women of F&amp;M |url=http://www.fandm.edu/x22560 |accessdate=27 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106111903/http://www.fandm.edu/x22560 |archivedate=6 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=F&amp;M: 40 Years of Coeducation |url=http://www.fandm.edu/40yearsofcoed |accessdate=27 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105040810/http://www.fandm.edu/40yearsofcoed |archivedate=5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first enrollment class consisted of 78 male and 36 female students.  Among the latter was [[Rebecca Gratz]], the first [[Jewish]] female college student in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  However, the school soon began having financial problems and it reopened as an all-male institution.  [[Westford Academy]] in [[Westford, Massachusetts]] has operated as mixed-sex secondary school since its founding in 1792, making it the oldest continuously operating coed school in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/westford/archive/x2136193253 |title=History of Westford Academy |last=Simmons |first=Carrie |date=7 September 2007 |work=Westford Eagle |accessdate=24 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520013124/http://www.wickedlocal.com/westford/archive/x2136193253 |archivedate=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest continuously operating coed boarding school in the United States is Cushing Academy, founded in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cushing.org/page/about/cushing-history |title=History of Cushing Academy |date=1 January 2016 |work=Cushing News |accessdate=27 Jul 2018 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colleges===
A minister and a missionary founded Oberlin in 1833. Reverent.  John Shipherd (minister) and Philo P. Stewart (missionary), became  friends while spending the summer of 1832 together in nearby Elyria. They  discovered a mutual disenchantment with what they saw as the lack of strong  Christian principles among the settlers of the American West. They decided to  establish a college and a colony based on their religious beliefs, "where they would train teachers and other Christian leaders for the  boundless most desolate fields in the West".&lt;ref name="new.oberlin.edu"/&gt;

The college and community succeeded on progressive causes and social justice. Oberlin's earliest graduates were women and African Americans. While Oberlin was co-educational from its founding in 1833, the college regularly admitted African American students beginning in 1835, after trustee and abolitionist, Reverent. Shipherd, cast the deciding vote to allow them entry. Women were not admitted to the baccalaureate program, which granted bachelor's degrees, until 1837. Prior to that, they received diplomas from what was called the Ladies Course. The college admitted its first group of women in 1837: Caroline Mary Rudd, Elizabeth Prall, Mary Hosford, and Mary Fletcher Kellogg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4860900/Single-Sex_Education_VS_Co-Education|title=Single-Sex Education VS Co-Education|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early success and achievement of women at [[Oberlin College]] persuaded many early women's rights leaders that coeducation would soon be accepted throughout the country. However, for quite a while, women sometimes suffered uncivil behavior from their male classmates. The prejudice of some male professors proved more unsettling. Many professors had disapproved of the admission of women into their classes, citing studies that stated that women were physically incapable of higher education, and some professors found it difficult to acknowledge women's presence once they were admitted.&lt;ref name="beatl.barnard.columbia" /&gt; Even today, some books, studies, and other arguments claim that women and men learn very differently from each other because of their brain differences. One of these books is ''Boys and Girls Learn Differently!'' by Michael Gurian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurian|first=Michael|title=Boys and Girls Learn Differently!|year=2001|publisher=Jossey-Bass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, 70% of American colleges were coeducational, although the state of Florida was a notable exception, moving toward greater separation of education at state schools as mandated by the Buckman Act in 1905 and only returning fully to coeducation in the system redesign prompted by the end of World War II.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In the late 20th century, many institutions of higher learning that had been exclusively for people of one sex became coeducational.

===Co-education fraternities===
{{main|List of social fraternities and sororities #Coeducational fraternities}}
A number of Greek-letter student societies have either been established (locally or nationally) or expanded as co-ed fraternities.

==="Coed" as slang===
In American colloquial language, "coed" or "co-ed" is used to refer to a mixed school.
The word is also often used to describe a situation in which both sexes are integrated in any form (e.g., "The team is coed"). As a noun, the word "coed" is used to refer to a female student in a mixed gender school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coed |title=Coed - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The noun use is considered sexist and unprofessional by those who argue that it implies that including women somehow transforms what is "normal" (male-only "education") into something different ("coeducation"):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YQiDjNTQnoC&amp;q=coed#v=snippet&amp;q=cornell&amp;f=false |author=Lowe, Margaret A.|title=Looking Good: College Women and Body Image, 1875-1930|location=|page=63 |publisher=Johns Hopkins UP |year=2003 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writingasjoe.blogspot.com/2006/09/dont-ever-call-my-daughter-coed.html |title=Don't Ever Call My Daughter a Coed|publisher=Writing as Jo(e)|date=2006-09-30  |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; technically both male and female students at a coeducational institution should be considered "coeds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KY_XiQa5PhMC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=%22coed+is%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv7sqhvKXTAhXm24MKHZTzAxcQ6AEIVDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22coed%20is%22&amp;f=false|author=Miller, Casey, and Kate Smith.|title=The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing |publisher=Lippincott &amp; Crowell |date=2000 |accessdate=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous professional organizations require that the gender-neutral term "student" be used instead of "coed" or, when gender is relevant to the context, that the term "female student" be substituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?page=nonsexist |title=Guidelines for Non-Sexist Use of Language|publisher=Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association (Vol. 59, Number 3, pp. 471-482) |date=February 1986 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cab-acr.ca/english/social/codes/guidelines_nonsexist.pdf |title=Guidelines for Non-Sexist Language |publisher=Canadian Association of Broadcasters |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/positions/statements/genderfairuseoflang |title=Guidelines for Gender-Fair Use of Language |publisher=National Council of Teachers of English |date=June 2008 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0cnr5SaMm8C&amp;pg=PA407&amp;lpg=PA407&amp;dq=coed+sexist+language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EzFPbEvECe&amp;sig=z-wrAiYTVvW8wEIoTglQOFVCU0o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rMl3UoGJBeKM2QW4koH4Aw&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=coed%20sexist%20language&amp;f=false |author1=Wilson, Kevin |author2=Jennifer Wauson |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Table 2.32: Biased Words and Their Alternatives.|work=The AMA Handbook of Business Writing.|location=|page=407|publisher=American Management Association |year=2010 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage guides make no exception for any use of the noun to distinguish a female student at a coeducational institution from a student at a women-only institution: they do not even mention such use, possibly because such uses are comparatively rare and because the term cannot be distanced from its unacceptable uses.

==Effects of coeducation==
{{blockquote|If the sexes were educated together, we should have the healthy, moral and intellectual stimulus of sex ever quickening and refining all the faculties, without the undue excitement of senses that results from novelty in the present system of isolation.|[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]]&lt;ref name="beatl.barnard.columbia"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Rosalind |title=The History Of Coeducation in America |url=http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/learn/documents/coeducation.htm |accessdate=24 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222003458/http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/learn/documents/coeducation.htm |archivedate=22 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For years, a question many educators, parents, and researchers have been asking is whether or not it is academically beneficial to teach boys and girls together or separately at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guest|first1=Murray|title=Analysis and Research into Co-education in Australia and the UK|url=http://www.as.edu.au/content/uploads/2015/02/Final-Coeducation_Research_Paper_Feb_2015.pdf|publisher=The Armidale School|accessdate=2 January 2017|location=Armidale, NSW|format=pdf|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that coeducation has primarily social benefits, allowing males and females of all ages to become more prepared for real-world situations, whereas a student that is only familiar with a single-sex setting could be less prepared, nervous, or uneasy.

However, certain authors argue that at certain ages, students may be more distracted by the opposite sex in a coeducational setting.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} This distraction may affect how often a student is willing to raise his or her hand in class and urge students to be less focused on the lesson. Girls may have lower, more traditional aspirations and may choose occupations that tend to be more traditional in nature as opposed to science-related occupations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2013/oct/30/co-educational-schools-bad-for-girls|first=Belinda|last=Palmar|title=Co-educational schools are bad for girls|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 October 2013|accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to advocates of coeducation, without classmates of the opposite sex, students have social issues that may impact adolescent development. They argue that the absence of the opposite sex creates an unrealistic environment not duplicated in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/why-single-sex-schools-are-bad-for-your-health-if-youre-a-boy-1831636.html|first=Richard|last=Garner|title=Why single-sex schools are bad for your health (if you're a boy)|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=1 December 2009|accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies show that in classes that are separated by gender, male and female students work and learn on the same level as their peers, the stereotypical mentality of the teacher is removed, and girls are likely to have more confidence in the classroom than they would in a coeducational class.&lt;ref&gt;Mael, F.

'''Open Course Library''' ('''OCL''') is an effort by the [[Washington (state)|State of Washington]] to identify and make available digitally, to community and technical college instructors and students across that state, free textbooks, interactive assignments, and videos. Instructional materials can be "a smorgasbord of teaching modules and exercises developed by other open-learning projects. . . Interactive-learning Web sites and even instructional videos on YouTube . . ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=State of Washington to Offer Online Materials, Instead of Textbooks, for 2-Year Colleges | author=Overland, Martha Ann | journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=January 14, 2011 | volume=57 | issue=19 | pages=A12–A13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, OCL is not an OER publishing project, although it did contribute to the development of some widely used resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sparc.arl.org/blog/back-facts-washingtons-open-course-library | title=Back to Facts: Washington's Open Course Library | date=18 February 2014 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Allen, Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://opencourselibrary.org/success-stories/ | title=Open Course Library: Success Stories | accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goals include: lowering textbook costs for students, providing new resources for faculty to use in their courses; and fully engaging in the global OER or open educational resources discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/case-study-2-open-course-library-washington-state-colleges | title=Case Study 2: The Open Course Library of the Washington State Colleges | publisher=EDUCAUSE | date=2 May 2012 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Caswell, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was funded by matching grants of $750,000 from the [[Bill And Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] and the Washington State legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=State of Washington to Offer Online Materials as Texts; Money-saving effort at 2-year colleges faces vexing problems | work=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=9 January 2011 | author=Overland, Martha Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009-2010 the affected Washington State student body totaled 470,000 and was increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/case-study-2-open-course-library-washington-state-colleges | title=Case Study 2: The Open Course Library of the Washington State Colleges | publisher=EDUCAUSE | date=2 May 2012 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Caswell, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the materials made available are [[open educational resources]] or OERs.

It emerged from a two-year discussion that ultimately produced a [http://www.sbctc.edu/docs/strategicplan/strategic_technology_plan.pdf Strategic Technology Plan].  The plan outlines a unified vision known as [http://opencourselibrary.wikispaces.com/file/view/Washington+State+Student+Completion+Initiative+final+7-17-09.pdf Washington Student Completion Initiative].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20828 | title=The Open Course Library Project -- Creative Commons | publisher=Creative Commons | date=4 March 2010 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Park, Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process and organizational structure==

OCL participants were selected from a grant proposal competition.  The process, which led to production of the materials, was open and several preliminary Town Meetings were used employing Eluminate Live.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}  All participants were welcome.  The meetings are [http://opencourselibrary.wikispaces.com/Town+Hall+Meetings archived]. Topics for discussion included interactions with publishers, content presentation, copyright policies, and various [[Creative Commons|Creative Commons licenses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20828 | title=The Open Course Library Project -- Creative Commons | publisher=Creative Commons | date=4 March 2010 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Park, Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful applicants received $15,000 to complete a course redesign.  Librarians, instructional designers and institutional researchers were also asked to apply.  Like faculty, these successful applicants also received grants of $15,000.  Each winning faculty member or team designed a ready-to-use digital course module. Teams were composed of community college instructors, librarians, and web-designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Open Course Library: Using Open Educational Resources to Improve Community College Access | publisher=Doctoral Dissertation, Washington State University | author=Goodwin, Mary Ann Lund | year=2011 | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2011 the first 42 courses created were released.  The use of OCL materials is not mandated for Washington's community colleges and technical schools.  Faculty course designers, however, are asked to adopt what they have designed.  There were over 25,000 visits from 125 countries over the first four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=State of Washington to Offer Materials as Texts: Money-saving effort at 2-year colleges faces vexing problems | work=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=9 January 2011 | author=Oberland, Martha Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, there have been challenges: good material is not always available online for adoption  and sometimes the best materials (for instance translations of primary sources published in foreign languages) are not available free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=State of Washington to Offer Online Materials, Instead of Textbooks, for 2-Year Colleges | author=Overland, Martha Ann | journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=14 January 2011 | volume=57 | issue=19 | pages=A12–A13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resource availability==
Courses are made accessible using the WashingtonOnline learning system.  Externally, OCL partners with the [[Saylor Foundation]], the [[OpenStax CNX|Connexions Consortium]], and the Open Courseware Consortium.  The Saylor site can be used access course content by self-learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/case-study-2-open-course-library-washington-state-colleges | title=Case Study 2: The Open Course Library of the Washington State Colleges | publisher=EDUCAUSE | date=2 May 2012 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Caswell, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open Course Library and Open Educational Resources==

A goal of the project requires instructors to become aware of the o[[Open educational resources|pen educational resources]] (OERs) that are already available.  A complementary  goal is to share their content and adaptation by contributing to a global effort.  Both directly and indirectly, Cable Green, the project's then director, observed that it has resulted in the building of networks with like-minded individuals and institutions irrespective of geography.  An interest was also expressed in gauging use of materials and modules for the tenure and advancement of participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20828 | title=The Open Course Library Project -- Creative Commons | publisher=EDUCAUSE | date=4 March 2010 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Caswell, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for the effort==

A 2009 ''New York Times'' article reported that college students spend between $700 and $1,000 annually on textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/education/edlife/01spending-t.html?_r=0 Bookstores and Beyond] | work=The New York Times | date=1 November 2009 | author=Lewin, Tamar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full-time tuition in the Washington system is approximately $3,000 annually, with textbooks costing approximately $1,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://education-portal.com/articles/Tom_Caswell_and_the_Open_Course_Library_Making_Education_Truly_Accessible.html | title=Tom Caswell and the Open Course Library: Making Education Truly Accessible | work=Education Insider News Blog | date=24 May 2011 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Redd, Stacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community college tuition is lower than at most traditional four year institutions, and, therefore, textbook costs may be proportionally higher. Any number of digital copies of a free textbook can be made for the price of one.  Print-on demand copies generally cost under $10. Representative [[Reuven Carlyle]] (D-Seattle, Washington House of Representatives) estimates that because of OCL community college students saved over $1.25 million in textbook costs during the 2011-2012 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Legislative Taxes Aim at $9 Billion Textbook Industry | work=States News Service | date=5 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  OCL seeks to contribute to the creation of better courses and to reduce costs for students.  In this way it seeks to respond positively to the "completion" concerns outlined in the state's tipping point research report  of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20828 | title=The Open Course Library Project -- Creative Commons | publisher=Creative Commons | date=4 March 2010 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Park, Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June 2010 the Washington State Board for Community &amp; Technical Colleges (SBCTC) approved a state-level open licensing policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/case-study-2-open-course-library-washington-state-colleges | title=Case Study 2: The Open Course Library of the Washington State Colleges | publisher=EDUCAUSE | date=2 May 2012 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Caswell, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All digital works created using grant funds administered by SBCTC must now carry a [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons Attribution-only (CC BY)]] license.

Nicole Allen, a textbook advocate for the national Student Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) commended the state for putting its money where its mouth is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2013373872_textbooks08m.html | title=Washington's 2-year colleges out to beat the high cost of textbooks | work=The Seattle Times | date=7 November 2010 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Long, Katherine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness assessment==

The results are reported  in [http://www.studentpirgs.org/sites/student/files/resources/PIRG%20OCL.pdf Affordable Textbooks for Washington Students: An Updated Cost Analysis of the Open Course Library (2013)],&lt;ref name="http://www.studentpirgs.org/sites/student/files/resources/PIRG%20OCL.pdf"&gt;{{cite web | title=Affordable Textbooks For Washington's Students: An Updated Cost Analysis of the Open Course Library | publisher=Student Public Interest Research Groups | year=2013 | author=Allen, Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt; an update of [http://www.studentpirgs.org/sites/student/files/resources/Affordable-Textbooks-For-Washingtons-Students.pdf Affordable Textbooks for Washington's Students: A Cost Analysis of the Open Course Library (2011)].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.studentpirgs.org/sites/student/files/resources/Affordable-Textbooks-For-Washingtons-Students.pdf | title=Affordable Textbooks For Washington's Students: A Cost Analysis of the Open Course Library | publisher=Student Public Interest Research Groups | author=Allen, Nicole | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter reported on the first phase of courses in October 2011.  In April 2013 the State Board announced the completion of all 81 courses and the updated report was released.  The report concluded:
* OCL has saved students $5,500,000 since inception.
* OCL materials cost 90% less than previously used materials.  The average OCL material costs $12, replacing the average priced $135 traditional item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Updated Cost Analysis of Open Course Library | work=Student PIRGs | date=30 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Students taking OCL courses save on average $96 per course.
* Student savings are more than three times  the original $1,800,000 invested.
* Two examples: By switching over to OCL material two community colleges have saved students $197,395 and $162,848 respectively. 
* Future Savings: A 2011 analysis projects savings as much as $41.6 if materials are adopted by all 410,000 enrolled students.

On the other hand, in January 2014 [[Chronicle of higher education|''The Chronicle of Higher Ed]]ucation'' ''reported that the effort to make free or low cost materials available in 42 courses was making little progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/open-course-library-sees-little-use-in-washingtons-community-colleges/50017 Open Course Library Sees Little Use in Washington Community Colleges] | work=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=31 January 2014 | author=Biemiller, Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a survey of community-college stores, with responses from 25 campuses, only nine said that any materials had been used in 17 of the 42 courses.  Only 2,386 of the 98,130 students enrolled in these courses, in 75 of the eligible 2,722 sections, used the materials. In 16 of the 75 sections students paid nothing; in the other 59 sections the average cost was $25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/open-course-library-sees-little-use-in-washingtons-community-colleges/50017 | title=Open Course Library Sees Little Use in Washington's Community Colleges | author=Biemiller, Lawrence | journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=13 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers reported the work of OnCampus Research, an arm of the National Association of College Stores,  which in fall 2013 sent a [http://www.nacs.org/Portals/NACS/Uploaded_Documents/PDF/Research/OCLresults2014.pdf survey] to 34 campus stores in the Washington Community and Technical College system.  The survey focused on the first 42, or phase one, courses.  It showed, according to the director of OnCampus Research, "that the recommendation of specific free or lower-priced course materials for popular courses did not equate to significant use of these materials by faculty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Use of Free or Low-Cost Materials Slow to Catch On | work=Education Letter | date=12 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Marty Brown, executive director of the Washington State Board of Community and Technical Colleges, took exception in a ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' piece he explained: "The study analyzes the use of OCL materials based on adoption information from campus bookstores. This methodology provides an incomplete picture, as bookstores are not always aware when faculty members assign free, digital resources. Therefore, the study's findings do not justify its conclusion that OCL has resulted in "insignificant" savings to students. The Student PIRGs estimates the OCL has saved students more than $5.5-million, more than triple the original investment. We believe this is very significant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bookstores' Study Mischaracterizes Washington State Open-Text Effort [letter] | work=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=6 February 2014 | author=Brown, Marty}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SPARC referred to the same presumed misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sparc.arl.org/blog/back-facts-washingtons-open-course-library | title=Back to Facts: Washington's Open Course Library | work=SPARC | date=18 February 2014 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Allen, Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reviewer states that OCL is best at "presenting introductory college course material in a condensed, simple manner via Google  docs or presentations."  It is noted, however, that the materials are not highly refined.  Further observing that "there's something to be said about grabbing an algebra quiz or those French vocabulary words quickly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://opensource.com/education/13/7/open-course-library-review | title=Open Course Library's best resource: introductory college course materials | work=OpenSource.com | date=11 July 2012 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Fox, Carolyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; A doctoral dissertation focused specifically on the project concludes in its abstract: ". . . that while faculty may be motivated to adopt new innovations like OER, for some, the time it takes to identify and integrate OER into courses presents a significant barrier to adoption." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Open Course Library: Using Open Educational Resources to Improve Community College Access -- Abstract | publisher=Doctoral dissertation, Washington State University | author=Goodwin, Mary Ann Lund | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long-term impact==

Washington State communities have integrated OCL into educational efforts in innovative ways.  For instance, [[Bellevue College]], Washington, the state's largest community college,  with help with a grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]], purchased 500 inexpensive netbook laptops in November 2011 for its students to rent for $35 per quarter to "download and read Internet material."  The anticipation was that the machines would also be used with OCL material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Textbooks? So Last Century, Rent a Netbook Instead | work=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=9 January 2011 | author=Overland, Martha Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its initiation, OCL is credited with inspiring open textbook initiatives by the legislatures of California (2012), British Columbia (2012) and actions by the legislatures of Illinois, Minnesota, and Virginia all similar to California's.  North Dakota proposed a resolution asking faculty and college administrations to support the use of open textbooks. Further, the [http://www.doleta.gov/taaccct/ Trade Adjustment Community College and Career Training grants program] requires that all material created using federal funds be available to the public through an open license.  Materials produced through this vehicle will be added to the OCL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.studentpirgs.org/sites/student/files/resources/PIRG%20OCL.pdf | title=Affordable Textbooks for Washington's College Students: An Updated Cost Analysis of the Open Course Library | publisher=Student Public Interest Research Groups | date=30 April 2013 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Allen, Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saylor Foundation will create modular versions of the courses.  Project Kaleidoscope intends to modify OCL materials to meet the needs of California's community college students.  The department of education in São Paulo Brazil plans Portuguese translations of the courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.studentpirgs.org/sites/student/files/resources/PIRG%20OCL.pdf | title=Affordable Textbooks for Washington's College Students: An Updated Cost Analysis of the Open Course Library | publisher=Student Public Interest Research Groups | date=30 April 2013 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Allen, Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7544">'''Phenomenography''' is a [[qualitative research]] [[methodology]], within the [[Paradigm|interpretivist paradigm]], that investigates the qualitatively different ways in which people experience something or think about something.&lt;ref name="Marton1986"&gt;Marton, F. (1986). Phenomenography - A research approach investigating different understandings of reality. ''Journal of Thought'', 21(2), 28-49.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an approach to educational research which appeared in publications in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Marton1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marton1981"&gt;Marton, F. (1981). Phenomenography - describing conceptions of the world around us. ''Instructional Science'', 10(1981), 177-200.&lt;/ref&gt; It initially emerged from an [[empirical]] rather than a theoretical or philosophical basis.&lt;ref name="Akerlind2005"&gt;Åkerlind, G. (2005). Variation and commonality in phenomenographic research methods. ''Higher  Education Research &amp; Development'', 24(4), 321-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

While being an established methodological approach in education for several decades, phenomenography has now been applied rather extensively in a range of diverse disciplines such as environmental management, computer programming, workplace competence, and internationalization practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teeter|first=Preston|last2=Sandberg|first2=Jorgen|date=2016|title=Constraining or Enabling Green Capability Development?

==Overview==
Phenomenography's [[Ontology|ontological]] assumptions are [[Subjectivism|subjectivist]]: the world exists and different people construct it in different ways and from a non-dualist viewpoint (viz., there is only one world, one that is ours, and one that people experience in many different ways).&lt;ref name="Bowden2005"&gt;Bowden, J. (2005). Reflections on the phenomenographic research process. In ''Doing Developmental Phenomenography'', J. Bowden &amp; P. Green (Eds). Qualitative Research Methods Series. Melbourne, Victoria: RMIT University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MartonBooth1997"&gt;Marton, F., &amp; Booth, S. (1997). ''Learning and Awareness''. New Jersey: Lawerence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenography's research object has the character of knowledge; therefore its ontological assumptions are also [[Epistemology|epistemological]] assumptions.&lt;ref name="Svensson1997"&gt;Svensson, L. (1997). Theoretical foundations of phenomenography. ''Higher Education Research &amp; Development'', 16(2): 159-171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uljens1996"&gt;Uljens, M. (1996). On the philosophical foundation of phenomenography. In G. Dall'Alba &amp; B. Hasselgren (Ed.), ''Reflections on Phenomenography'' (pp. 105–130). Goteborg: Acta Universitatis Gothenburgensis.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its emphasis is on description. Its data collection methods typically include close interviews with a small, purposive sample of subjects, with the researcher "working toward an articulation of the interviewee’s reflections on experience that is as complete as possible".&lt;ref name="MartonBooth1997" /&gt; Description is important because our knowledge of the world is a matter of meaning and of the qualitative similarities and differences in meaning as it is experienced by different people.&lt;ref name="Svensson1997" /&gt;

A phenomenographic data analysis sorts perceptions which emerge from the data collected into specific "categories of description."&lt;ref name="Marton1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marton1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Akerlind2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uljens1996" /&gt; The set of these categories is sometimes referred to as an "outcome space."  These categories (and the underlying structure) become the phenomenographic essence of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Uljens1996" /&gt; They are the primary outcomes and are the most important result of phenomenographic research.&lt;ref name="Marton1986"/&gt; Phenomenographic categories are logically related to one another, typically by way of hierarchically inclusive relationships,&lt;ref name="Marton1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MartonBooth1997" /&gt; although linear and branched relationships can also occur.&lt;ref name="Akerlind2005" /&gt; That which varies between different categories of description is known as the "dimensions of variation."

The process of phenomenographic analysis is strongly [[iterative]] and comparative. It involves continual sorting and resorting of data and ongoing comparisons between the data and the developing categories of description, as well as between the categories themselves.&lt;ref name="Akerlind2005"/&gt;

A phenomenographic analysis seeks a "description, analysis, and understanding of . . . experiences".&lt;ref name="Marton1981" /&gt; The focus is on variation: variation in both the perceptions of the phenomenon, as experienced by the actor, and in the "ways of seeing something" as experienced and described by the researcher.&lt;ref name="Pang1999"&gt;Pang, M. (1999). ''Two faces of variation: On continuity in the phenomenographic movement''. Paper presented at the 8th Biennial Conference of the European Association for Research in Learning and Instruction, Goteborg, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is described as phenomenography's "theory of variation."&lt;ref name="Pang1999" /&gt; Phenomenography allows researchers to use their own experiences as data for phenomenographic analysis;&lt;ref name="Uljens1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saljo1996"&gt;Säljö, R. (1996). Minding action - conceiving of the world versus participating in cultural practices. In Dall'Alba &amp; Hasselgren (Eds.), ''Reflections on phenomenography - towards a methodology?'' Goteborg: Acta Universitatis Gothoburgensis.&lt;/ref&gt; it aims for a collective analysis of individual experiences.&lt;ref name="Akerlind2005"/&gt;

==Emphasis on description==

Phenomenographic studies usually involve contextual groups of people and data collection involves individual description of understanding, often through interview. Analysis is whole group orientated since all data is analysed together with the aim of identifying possible conceptions of experience related to the phenomenon under investigation, rather than individual experiences.  There is emphasis on detailed analysis of description which follows from an assumption that conceptions are formed from both the results of human action and from the conditions for it. Clarification of understanding and experience depends upon the meaning of the conceptions themselves.&lt;ref name="Svensson1997" /&gt; The object of phenomenographic study is not the [[phenomenon]] per se but the relationship between the actors and the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Bowden2005" /&gt;

==Distinguished from phenomenology==

Phenomenography is not [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Phenomenographers, on the other hand, adopt an empirical orientation and they investigate the experiences of others.&lt;ref name="MartonBooth1997"/&gt;  The focus of interpretive phenomenology is upon the essence of the phenomenon, whereas the focus of phenomenography is upon the essence of the experiences and the subsequent perceptions of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Hitchcock2006"&gt;Hitchcock, L. (2006): ''Methodology in computing education: a focus on experiences''. Proceedings of the 19th Annual NACCQ Conference, 7–10 July 2006, Wellington New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities''' ('''PAASCU''') is a private, voluntary, non-profit and non-stock corporation which was registered with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] of the Philippines. It is a service organization which accredits academic programs which meet commonly accepted standards of quality education.

PAASCU is an accrediting body composed of different private educational institutions that stamp other private schools with a quality standard attained with regard to their programs.

==History==
PAASCU was established in November 5, 1957 as a private, voluntary, non-profit and non-stock corporation. The Bureau of Education and Culture (now [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]]) formally endorsed PAASCU as an accrediting agency in November 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paascu.org.ph/home2012/?page_id=8|title=What is PAASCU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 the [[Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines]] was established and one of its three founding members is PAASCU.

In 1991 the [[International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education]] (INQAAHE) was established and one of its founding members is the PAASCU. The INQAAHE is an international association of over 200 organizations that are active in theory and practice of quality assurance higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inqaahe.org/main/about-inqaahe|title=About INQAAHE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAASCU is also one of the founding member of the Asia-Pacific Quality Network (APQN). The APQN has been established with the purpose of satisfying the needs of quality assurance agencies in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apqn.org|title=About APQN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accredited Programs by PAASCU==
These are the following programs that are accredited by PAASCU:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paascu.org.ph/home2012/?page_id=65|title=Programs Accredited by PAASCU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1794">The '''Philosophy of mathematics education''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] area of study and research based on the intersection of the fields of [[mathematics education]] and the [[philosophy of mathematics]], the latter being understood in an inclusive sense to include multidisciplinary theorizing about mathematics incorporating philosophical, sociological, anthropological, semiotic, historical, ethnomathematical, etc., perspectives. 

Some of the central questions addressed by this sub-field are:
*What is mathematics?, and what accounts have philosophers and other theorists given of it?
*How does mathematics relate to society? 
*What are the aims of teaching and learning mathematics?
*What fundamental assumptions underlie the learning and teaching mathematics? 
*How do philosophies of mathematics link with mathematics teaching and learning? 
*What is the status of mathematics education as knowledge field?

For further details see 'What is the philosophy of mathematics education?' by [[Paul Ernest]].

There is a dedicated ''[[Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal]]'' freely available on the web.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2750">The '''Qingdao Declaration''' is a document that provides [[Member states of the United Nations|UN Member States]] with policy recommendations for harnessing the power of ICT to address current educational challenges, and to ensure equitable quality education and lifelong opportunities for all. It was the key output of the International Conference on ICT and Post-2015 Education, which took place 23–25 May 2015 in [[Qingdao]], People's Republic of China. The conference was organized by UNESCO, the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese National Commission for UNESCO.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002430/243076e.pdf|title=Leveraging information and communication technologies to achieve the Post-2015 Education goal: report of the International Conference on ICT and Post-2015 Education|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Endorsement ==

'''Service-learning''' is an educational approach that combines learning objectives with community service in order to provide a pragmatic, progressive learning experience while meeting societal needs.

Service-learning involves students in service projects to apply classroom learning for local agencies that exist to effect positive change in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knapp |first=Timothy D. |author2=Bradley J. Fisher|title=The Effectiveness of Service-Learning: It's not always what you think|journal=Journal of Experiential Education|year=2010|volume=33|issue=3|pages=208–224|doi=10.5193/JEE33.3.208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Youth Leadership Council]] defines service learning as "a philosophy, pedagogy, and model for community development that is used as an instructional strategy to meet learning goals and/or content standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=K–12 Service-Learning Standards for Quality Practice|publisher=National Youth Leadership Council|url=http://www.nylc.org/sites/nylc.org/files/files/Standards_Oct2009-web.pdf|accessdate=November 11, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111201324/http://www.nylc.org/sites/nylc.org/files/files/Standards_Oct2009-web.pdf|archivedate=November 11, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Barbara Jacoby defines service-learning as "a form of experiential education in which students engage in activities that address human and community needs together with structured opportunities for reflection designed to achieve desired learning outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacoby|first1=Barbara|title=Service-Learning in Higher Education: Concepts and Practices|date=1996|isbn=978-0787902919|publisher=Jossey-Bass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==
As defined by Robert Sigmon, 1994:
* Service-LEARNING: Learning goals primary; service outcomes secondary.
* SERVICE-Learning: Service outcomes primary; learning goals secondary.
* service learning: Service and learning goals completely separate.
* SERVICE-LEARNING: Service and learning goals of equal weight and each enhances the other for all participants.

===Examples of service-learning typologies===

'''Service-learning''', as defined by Robert Sigmon, "occurs when there is a balance between learning goals and service outcomes."&lt;ref name=Furco&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furco|first1=Andrew|title="Service-Learning": A Balanced Approach to Experiential Education|journal=The INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL for GLOBAL and DEVELOPMENT EDUCATION RESEARCH|date=October 2011|issue=0|pages=71–76|url=http://educacio-cp89.webjoomla.es/wp-content/uploads/03-Furco-1-English.pdf|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}} As follows, there are various methods of hands-on learning that fall into this category, these include:
* [[Volunteering|Volunteerism]]: Volunteerism is acts of service performed out of free will without expectation of recompense and is generally altruistic in nature; the main beneficiaries (at least in a visible sense) are generally those served by the student.
* [[Community service|Community Service]]: Community service is quite similar to volunteerism, the main difference being that it is said to "involve more structure and student commitment than do volunteer programs."&lt;ref name=Furco/&gt;{{rp|74}}
* [[Internship]]: Internships can provide students with experience in various fields of work; however, unlike volunteerism and community service, students gain a more measurable benefit from this aspect of service learning.
* Field Education: Field education, like internships, is generally more materially beneficial to the student. Field education involves programs that, "provide students with co‐curricular service opportunities that are related, but not fully integrated, with their formal academic studies."&lt;ref name=Furco/&gt;{{rp|75}}

The purpose of service learning is, in essence, to, "equally benefit the provider and the recipient of the service as well as to ensure equal focus on both the service being provided and the learning that is occurring." Volunteerism, community service, internships, and field education all exemplify, in some way or another, the core value of service learning, as all of them benefit the student as well as the one they served to an equal degree, the only difference being how material the benefit is. These methods also tend to focus on ensuring that the student not only serves, but learns something, whether it is interpersonal skills, work experience in their future field,&lt;ref name=Furco/&gt; or a change in how they view themselves and others.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eyler|first1=Janet|last2=Giles Jr.|first2=Dwight E.|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning|date=23 April 1999|publisher=Jossey-Bass|edition=1st|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=978-0-470-90746-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

==History==
In ''Service-learning: History, Theory, and Issues'', Bruce W. Speck and Sherry Lee Hoppe say that [[John Dewey|John Dewey's]] writings on the active nature of understanding and the benefits of and conditions for participatory democracy "provide an early theoretical foundation for a pedagogy in which students cooperatively engage actual social problems". In ''Building partnerships for service-learning'', Barbara Jacoby writes that Service-learning "is based on the work of researchers and theorists on learning, including [[John Dewey]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Kurt Lewin]], [[Donald Schon]], and [[David Kolb]], who believe that we learn through combinations of action and reflection."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url =https://www.nl.edu/media/nlu/downloadable/studentservices/civicengagement/chapter-1.pdf | title =Service-Learning Faculty Manual | last1 =Lukenchuk | first1 =Antonina | last2 =Jagla | first2 =Virginia | last3 =Eigel | first3 =Matthew | publisher =National Louis University | access-date =November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 Robert Sigmon called for a more precise definition in ''Service-Learning: Three Principles'', in which he said the term, which was relatively new, was being used to describe a number of different volunteer actions and experiential education programs.&lt;ref name=Sigmon1979&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sigmon | first = Robert | date = Spring 1979 | title = Service-Learning: Three Principles | url = http://critical.tamucc.edu/~wiki/uploads/AWebb/sl3p.pdf | language = English | journal = Synergist | pages = 9–11 | access-date = November 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sigmon wrote that, in the late 1960s, the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) popularized a service-learning internship model, that defined service-learning as "the integration of the accomplishment of a public task with conscious educational growth."&lt;ref name=Sigmon1979/&gt;{{rp|9}}

===In American education===
In 1992 Maryland adopted statewide service-learning requirements for high school graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduation Requirements|url=http://archives.marylandpublicschools.org/msde/programs/servicelearning/docs/requirements.htm|website=Maryland Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same year, the District of Columbia also adopted such requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DCPS Community Service Guide 2011–2012|url=http://cfo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dcps/publication/attachments/DCPS%20Community%20Service%20Guide%20SY11-12%20FINAL.pdf|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other states have allowed credit toward graduation for service-learning/community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ecs.force.com/mbdata/mbquest3RTE?Rep=SL1301 | title =High School Graduation Requirement or Credit toward Graduation — Service-Learning/Community Service | date =January 2014 | publisher =Education Commission of the States (ECS) | access-date =November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning==
Janet Eyler outlines the different ways student learn through service-learning in the book ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?''.  First, there is interpersonal learning, in which students re-evaluate personal values and motivations by channeling a passionate interest to service-learning projects, as well as build a connection and commitment to the community.  The second form is academic material that is taught through practical application and reflective instruction, so that it may be practiced outside classrooms and test-taking. Janet Eyler explains, "it is the product of continuous challenge to old conceptions and reflection on new ways to organize information and use the new material."  Thirdly is cognitive development where students are challenged to use critical thinking and problem-solving skills in a context that provides additional information and experience for student evaluation, because service-learning deals with numerous problems in complex situations.  The fourth form is transformation within the students, which "is about thinking about things in a new way and moving in new direction—creating a new picture without relying on the old lines."  Finally, service-learning focuses on effective citizenship and behavioral issues, and this helps the students better understand social issues relevant to their own community.  Learning in all these ways makes service-learning effective to those serving as well as those being served, for "learning begins with the impact of service-learning on the personal and interpersonal development of the students."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

According to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, there are numerous benefits to the service-learning approach. It provides experiential learning that connects personal and interpersonal development with cognitive and academic advancement,  providing opportunities for personal connections and ultimately transformation. Those serving may encounter certain social problems for the first time, thus transforming their view on the world. Beyond that, students may be transformed in the way of developing better problem-solving skills to address those problems about which they now know. A service-learning experience may be the catalyst in the life of a student to dive into the complexities of the social issues they have encountered and to seek to develop innovative solutions.

Service learning combines both [[experiential learning]] and [[community service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Perez, Shivaun|title=Assessing Service Learning Using Pragmatic Principles of Education: A Texas Charter School Case Study|year=2000|journal=Applied Research Projects|series=Paper 76|publisher=Texas State University|url=http://ecommons.txstate.edu/arp/76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for students to receive college credit for service-learning courses, a substantial amount of academic learning needs to accompany the service.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}} Janet Eyler outlines several impacts of learning that she believes evolves from service-learning. The first impact is Personal Connections.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} When a person is passionate about a certain topic or cause, they will more likely want to make a difference by trying to mend the area with which they are passionate about.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} Lifelong learners develop from students who are personally connected with their passion. Secondly, the usefulness of service-learning, according to Eyler, can impact a student for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|15–16}} Eyler points that learning the material for a test or exam in a classroom is one thing, but actually pulling that knowledge out and using it in new circumstances or in problems that arise in everyday life is another thing. Students have the chance to practice what they learn in the classroom by encountering life problems and have a chance to develop skill in how to develop solutions for the problems they face. The development of learning is the third impact that Eyler explains.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}} She writes that much of the knowledge that students have is not self-consumed, but rather developed from training obtained from the classroom and from daily life. Any thought or active development attained during service is more liable to impact the student, and the students' surroundings.  The fourth impact that Eyler explains is the transformational aspect of service-learning.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|17–18}} Students who participate in service are can be likely to develop different ways of thinking and approaching life. It may be a service-learning course that impacts the students' frame of thinking, while transforming the community as well. Finally, the fifth impact of learning is finding citizenship in our communities.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|18–19}} While the students are serving and impacting the community, they are very likely to find their role in society. Students can realize that they can make a difference and do have a part in their community. This realization can lead to citizenship, and active and acknowledged place in community. These five by-products of learning, as Janet Eyler outlines, are important to the progression of learning in service-learning.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|14–19}}

=== Factors ===
According to Eyler and Giles Jr., who conducted nationwide studies on service-learning, factors which influence its impact on students include placement quality, duration, and reflection.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|54–56}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Placement quality ====
According to Eyler and Giles, "''Placement quality'' refers to the extent that students in their community placements are challenged, are active rather than observers, do a variety of tasks, feel that they are making a positive contribution, have important levels of responsibility, and receive input and appreciation from supervisors in the field."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|33}} According to their research, placement quality has measurable effects on such things as "personal development outcomes," "increased leadership and communication skill," and connection to community, faculty, and other students.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|54–56}}

==== Duration ====
In ''The Importance of Program Quality in Service-Learning,'' Eyler and Giles state: "a program or a sequence of experiences needs to be of a long enough duration to have a developmental impact."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Importance of Program Quality in Service-Learning|last=Eyler|first=Janet|last2=Giles Jr.|first2=Dwight|work=Service-Learning: Applications From the Research|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Waterman|editor-first=Alan S.|location=New York, NY|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is expanded upon by Alexander W. Astin and Linda J. Sax. In their opinion, "the amount of time devoted to providing service carries additional benefits beyond those benefits associated with the type of service performed, especially in the areas of civic responsibility and life skill development."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Astin|first=Alexander W.|last2=Sax|first2=Linda J.|date=1998|title=How Undergraduates are Affected by Service Participation|url=|journal=Journal of College Student Development|pages=260|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But how much time is enough? According to J. Beth Mabry, "students should spend at least fifteen to nineteen hours in their service activities to have adequate exposure to the people and issues their service addresses."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mabry|first=J. Beth|date=1998|title=Pedagogical Variations in Service-Learning and Student Outcomes|url=|journal=Michigan Journal of Community Service-Learning|page=41|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reflection ====
An essential feature of service-learning programs, reflection is a period of critical thinking performed by the student. For many advocates of the pedagogy, reflection may symbolize the learning that occurs in the student. Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles provide an example of this opinion in their book, ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' when they state: "learning occurs through a cycle of action and reflection, not simply through being able to recount what has been learned through reading and lecture."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt; Also, the National Service Learning Clearinghouse considers reflection to be a "core component" of service-learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.servicelearning.org/instant_info/fact_sheets/he_facts/he_reflection |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114232334/http://www.servicelearning.org/instant_info/fact_sheets/he_facts/he_reflection/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 14, 2007 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 22, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some higher education programs require a reflection component in their service-learning classes. The University of Minnesota is one such institution that includes required reflection activities with its service learning classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servicelearning.umn.edu/info/reflection.html|title=Reflection in service-learning classes|publisher=Center for Community-Engaged Learning|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflection may be done individually or as a group activity. Wartburg College in Indiana published a list of reflection activity suggestions on their website. These included various types of journaling, brainstorming as a group, using quotes, writing essays and papers, structured class discussions, and class presentations among other ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Service-Learning Reflection Activities | publisher=Wartburg College | accessdate=June 2, 2016 | author=Robin R. Jones | url=http://www.wartburg.edu/cce/cce/assessment%20and%20reflection/SL-Reflection%20Activities.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905080645/http://www.wartburg.edu/cce/cce/assessment%20and%20reflection/SL-Reflection%20Activities.pdf | archivedate=September 5, 2012 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective service-learning programs also include required written reflection. Not only does writing permanently record a student's service-learning experience, but it also provides a helpful tool for continued reflection long after the program has been completed. Written reflection assignments also require students to stop, think, and articulate their learning. This evaluation is of incredible value to students.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|171–177}}

==Service==
High quality placements are a key to the success of a service-learning program. This requires the service learning establishment to have a broad network of connections within the community. Students need to have a positive connection with the establishment they're serving in order to maximize their learning.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?|last1=Eyler|first1=Janet|last2=Giles|first2=Dwight E.|year=2007|location=San Francisco, CA|publisher=Jossey-Bass|last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|167–170}}

Diversity is also a component of a successful service-learning program. By working with people of different ethnicities, lifestyles, and socioeconomic statuses, a student's learning and tolerance will increase. By serving in a diverse [[learning environment]], student are more likely to reduce stereotypes and increase their cultural appreciation. This can help a student learn how to more effectively serve a broader array of people.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|177–178}}

The Service in Service Learning takes knowledge outside the classroom into the real world with real people and situations.&amp;nbsp; In his book ''Banker to the Poor: Micro-lending and the Battle Against World Poverty'', Muhammad Yunus states that "If a university is a repository for knowledge, then some of this knowledge should spill over to the neighboring community. A university must not be an island where academics reach out to higher and higher levels of knowledge without sharing any of their findings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Banker to The Poor|last=Yunus|first=Muhammad|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2007|isbn=1-58648-198-3|location=United States of America|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Service brings community together as a whole, towards a common goal or purpose. Service is about what is for someone else. The action of service in and among the community, provides chances for sociocultural norms and prejudices to be removed. While some have questioned the positive effect and collective interest of the ''service'' side of service-learning, among those who perform the services, it has been made known that many would say otherwise.

==Effects==
Based upon various studies, students who participate in service-learning courses or projects seem to encounter a multitude of benefits. The book ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' discusses the effects of service learning on students, as well service learning in general.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;

===Effects on the student===

In addition to interpersonal skills students have also reported developing personal leadership skills.&lt;ref name="UCLA - Service-Learning"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alexander W. Astin|author2=Lori J. Vogelgesang|author3=Elaine K. Ikeda|author4=Jennifer A. Yee|title=How Service Learning Affects Students|url=http://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1145&amp;context=slcehighered|website=Digital Commons|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another benefit seen is that it can also develop a sense of meaning and purpose in their academics.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt; 

Though one might not immediately think of serving others as affecting oneself, studies have found that "coming into contact with people whose life experiences and assumptions about the world are different calls one's own world into question."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|34}} Not only does the service experience move one to examine his own life, but it also allows him to produce a better version of himself. In their book, ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles Jr. identify five key personal growth outcomes of service-learning: self-knowledge, spiritual growth, the reward of helping others, career benefits and careers in service, and changes in personal efficacy.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|35–39}} As one goes out into the community with the intent of reaching out to those within it, this broader social context causes one to see himself more clearly.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

Being involved in the educational process of service-learning also strengthens one's critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which is vital to facing modern-day dilemmas. This will transform a person's prior way of thinking, for critical thinking stimulates people to question assumptions and to "color outside the lines". According to Eyler and Giles Jr., "Transformative thinking is about thinking about things in a new way and moving in new directions—creating a new picture without relying on the old lines".&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

It is in this way that service-learning motivates individuals to become better citizens of their communities. Many of those interested in reforming higher education have found that this experiential pedagogy helps to "cultivate civic and social responsibility as part of education for citizenship".&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|12}} As individuals acquire knowledge about serving those around them, they can apply that knowledge to community problems, thus being able to make a greater difference in the world. People who realize their responsibility to their community will naturally develop into more productive members of society. 

Service-learning begins in the heart and mind of the individual; he must understand himself before he can attempt to understand others. This will prompt him to develop personal connections with those whom he is serving, for it is within community involvement where one's own understanding and knowledge are transformed.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|19}}

Researchers have found that these personal and interpersonal gains from engaging in service-learning classes where higher when the programs were of better quality. The biggest predictor of increased learning in communication skills was the high placement quality that the students were put into, allowing them to develop and "hone" their skills.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;

Many experience interpersonal development through the service learning process. According to ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'', among the students in their survey, "40 percent reported that learning to work with others was among the most important things they learned from service-learning, and 81 percent indicated that it was the most or very important." Learning to work with others is crucial for job placement in our world today. Another effect this has on the students is that they are more apt to learn how to lead. By working with others, the students are given opportunities to be more responsible and take initiative. Service-learning also encourages connection within the community. Truly, many learned how to listen to the voice of their communities. Not only that, but it helps form friendships and find other like-minded individuals who are involved with service learning. Above all it helps students to feel as though they are making a difference and matter to their communities. It was also found that quantity and quality of reflective discussion was linked to the outcome of feeling a closeness among the community and other students. An even more powerful outcome was the creation of a bond between a student and faculty member. In most classroom settings there's little room for a deep relationship between the student and teacher, while in service-learning often student and teacher will work alongside each other and develop a more lasting bond. As stated in ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'', "Service participants in their assessment of Learn and Serve America were more likely than their peers to spend at least an hour a week interacting with a faculty member." Service-learning has a tremendous impact on students and how they learn, but also how they interact with others.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|45–52}}

===Diversity awareness===

Service-learning offers an opportunity for students to experience different cultures, which in turn reduces many negative and unnecessary stereotypes derived by inexperienced students. The appreciation of different cultures in service-learning happens because of the interaction that often occurs while completing a service. A survey on students who participated in service-learning finds that, "63 percent reported interacting with those receiving services at least fairly often, 60 percent reported frequent interaction with other volunteers, 51 percent felt that professionals at the placement site often took an interest in them, and 57 percent reported that they had frequent chances to work with people from ethnic groups other than their own."&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

One of the goals of service-learning is positive interactions.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

People often only distinguish the differences between other cultures and communities and their own. These perceived differences often influence the decisions made when interacting with people of other cultures. Service-learning provides the opportunity for students to not only appreciate other cultures, but to appreciate their shared humanity.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|31}}

==Effects on community partners==
Service learning programs have developed rapidly within the last 30 years. From 1995–1997, 458 universities received grants from the Corporation for National Service's Learn and Serve Higher Education (LASHE) which enabled 3,000 new service-learning courses to be developed to the benefit of more than 60 students per course.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;

Much of the research on the effects of service-learning is focused on what students learn through their service to the community; fewer studies have been conducted on the impact of service-learning on the communities where the students serve.&lt;ref name=Tryon&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tryon|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Stoecker|first2=Randy|title=The Unheard Voices: Community Organizations and Service-Learning|journal=Journal of Higher Education Outreach and Engagement|date=September 2008|volume=12|issue=3|url=http://openjournals.libs.uga.edu/index.php/jheoe/article/view/99/87|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}}  Several studies that have been done on this topic measure the impact of service-learning on the community organizations with which college students volunteer, seeking to understand the organizations' perspectives on service-learning.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|48}}&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandy|first1=Marie|last2=Holland|first2=Barbara A.|title=Different Worlds and Common Ground: Community Partner Perspectives on Campus-Community Partnerships|journal=Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning|date=Fall 2006|volume=13|issue=1|pages=30–43|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mjcsl/3239521.0013.103/--different-worlds-and-common-ground-community-partner?view=image|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}}&lt;ref name="Vernon 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon|first1=Andrea|last2=Ward|first2=Kelly|title=Campus and Community Partnerships: Assessing Impacts and Strengthening Connections|journal=Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning|date=1999|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mjcsl/3239521.0006.103/--campus-and-community-partnerships-assessing-impacts?view=image|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

One positive impact of service-learning on these organizations is the presence of more volunteers, which enables the organizations to accomplish more&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|35–36}} and to serve more clients.&lt;ref name=Perla&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barrientos|first1=Perla|title=Community Service Learning and its Impact on Community Agencies: An Assessment Study|url=http://www.sfsu.edu/~icce/downloads/pdf/CSL%20Report%20for%20Publishing_3-25-10.pdf|website=www.sfsu.edu|publisher=San Francisco State University|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}  Students can use specific skills they possess to benefit the organization,&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|49}} and can be a source of new ideas, energy, and enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="Vernon 2014" /&gt;{{rp|33}} Through partnering with a college or university, the organization can gain access to new knowledge and opportunities to connect with other organizations that have partnered with the same school.&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|36}}

==In Native American communities==
Service-learning has been applied across a host of cultural settings, including numerous Native American communities. Guffey (1997) notes credible service learning begins with tribal ways of knowing and value systems, which is to say that outsiders should not impose service learning projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED416179|title=Learning with the Community: Concepts and Models for Service-Learning in Teacher Education. AAHE's Series on Service-Learning in the Disciplines.|author1=Erickson, Joseph A.|author2=Anderson, Jeffrey B.|date=30 November 1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, tribal communities should devise projects that reflect needs unique to the community being served. This parallels Matthew Fletcher's (2010) assertion that tribes, and other historically marginalized communities, should unique develop educational programs, as opposed to merely adopting Westernized forms of education. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/American-Indian-Education-Counternarratives-Struggle/dp/0415957354|title=American Indian Education: Counternarratives in Racism, Struggle, and the Law|first=search|last=results|date=30 May 2008|publisher=Routledge|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, service learning provides a pedagogical framework for tribes to address community needs. One such example is provided by Sykes, Pendley, and Deacon (2017) who provide a qualitative case study of a tribally-initiated service learning project embedded within a partnership at a research university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/journals/index.php/ijcre/article/view/5334|title=Transformative learning, tribal membership and cultural restoration: A case study of an embedded Native American service-learning project at a research university|first1=Brent E.|last1=Sykes|first2=Joy|last2=Pendley|first3=Zermarie|last3=Deacon|date=22 June 2017|publisher=|journal=Gateways: International Journal of Community Research and Engagement|volume=10|pages=204–28|via=epress.lib.uts.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case is unique in that it recounts how service learning students (who were also tribal members) came to collectively understand their responsibilities of citizenship through service. Moreover, tribal elders came to appreciate the importance of young citizens in maintaining and growing tribal culture. Thus, service learning can also be a means to explore cultural identity.

==Critiques==
There are numerous critiques of service-learning. In 1979, Robert Sigmon acknowledged criticisms that called service-learning, "a utopian vision" and "too demanding and impractical". He called for research into outcomes related to service-learning.&lt;ref name=Sigmon1979/&gt;{{rp|11}} Towson University Professor John Egger, writing in the Spring 2008 issue of the journal ''Academic Questions'', argued that service learning does not really teach useful skills or develop cultural knowledge. Instead, Egger maintained, service learning mainly involves the inculcation of communitarian political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ncsce.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/NoToServiceLearning_000.pdf|first=John|last=Egger|title= No Service to Learning: 'Service-Learning' Reappraised|journal=Academic Questions|volume=21|pages=183–194|year=2008|doi=10.1007/s12129-008-9057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulane Professor [[Carl L. Bankston]] III has described his own university's policy of mandating service learning as the imposition of intellectual conformity by the university administration on both students and faculty. According to Bankston, by identifying specific types of civic engagement as worthy community service, the university was prescribing social and political perspectives. He argued that this was inconsistent with the idea that individuals in a pluralistic society should choose their own civic commitments and that it was contrary to the ideal of the university as a site for the pursuit of truth through the free exchange of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popecenter.org/commentaries/article.html?id=2537|author=[[Carl L. Bankston]] III|title=Modern Orthodoxies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these organizations face challenges in working with the students.  Communication with faculty is often inconsistent, so organizations do not always understand their roles and the roles of the faculty in students' service projects.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|55–56}}  Some organizations' representatives stated that faculty assigned students projects that were not allowed in their organization.&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|37}}  Often the demographics of students do not match well with the demographics of the clients they serve, which can make it difficult for the students to relate to the clients&lt;ref name=Perla/&gt;{{rp|11}} or create an uncomfortable situation for the clients.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|54–55}}  The academic calendar students follow tends not to work well with the organizations' schedules, since students' volunteering schedules are interrupted for holiday breaks, finals, and other activities.&lt;ref name="Vernon 2014" /&gt;{{rp|33}} Also, the small number of hours students are required to spend volunteering can cause problems for organizations and their clients.  Some organizations require more hours for volunteer training than students are required to volunteer,&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|39}} and making a personal connection with clients only to break it off soon after can be more hurtful than helpful.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|52}}

Representatives of community organizations where service-learning students volunteer expressed interest in working with colleges and universities to change service-learning programs so that they work more smoothly for the organizations. Their suggestions included establishing more consistent communication between faculty and organizations, creating longer-term partnerships between colleges and community organizations, and ensuring that the students and their projects are matched well with the organizations they serve.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|56–57}}&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|34, 37, 40}}

In ''Downsizing Democracy: How America Sidelined Its Citizens and Privatized Its Public'', Matthew A. Crenson and Benjamin Ginsberg question whether service-learning is contributing to privatizing or downsizing citizenship practices. Responding to this, Christopher Koliba wrote that education providers may have the opportunity to change this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Koliba | first= Christopher

=== Comprehensive Action Plan for Service Learning (CAPSL) ===
* CAPSL Identifies four constituencies on which a program for service learning needs to focus its principal activities: institution, faculty, students, and community.
* CAPSL also identifies a sequence of activities (Planning; awareness; prototype; resources; expansion; recognition; monitoring; evaluation; research; institutionalization) to be pursued for each of the four constituencies(institution, faculty, students and community).
* CAPSL provides a heuristic for guiding the development of a service learning program in higher education.
* Advantages of CAPSL: it is general enough that the execution of each cell can be tailored to local conditions.
* Disadvantages of CAPSL: it is not possible to detail how each step can be successfully accomplished to take the sequence of activities from the whole CAPSL model and apply it to any cell in the matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robert|first=G. Bringle|author2=Julie A.

===Engineering education===
{{Main article|Service-learning in engineering education}}

Many engineering faculty members believe the educational solution lies in taking a more constructivist approach, where students construct knowledge and connections between nodes of knowledge as opposed to passively absorbing knowledge.  Educators see service learning as a way to both implement a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] in [[Engineers Without Borders|engineering education]] as well as match the teaching styles to the learning styles of typical engineering students.  As a result, many engineering schools have begun to integrate service learning into their curricula and there is now a journal dedicated to service learning in engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Journal for Service Learning in Engineering]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious aspects===
In ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'', Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles Jr. wrote, "Although fewer students chose spiritual growth as an important outcome of service-learning—20 percent selecting it as among the most important things they learned and 46 percent selecting it as very or most important—it was important to many students...Some saw service as a definite opportunity to fulfill their religious commitment."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|36, 37}}

Service-learning has both a service and a learning component. Eyler and Giles Jr. in ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' apply the term service-learning "to programs where the two foci are in balance, and study and action are explicitly integrated.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

Eyler and Giles Jr. have found that service-learning students, upon reflecting on their experience, find reward in helping others&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|55}} and in developing close personal relationships.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|56}} The second focus in the term ''service-learning'', that of ''learning'', is defined by R. L. Atkinson as "a relatively permanent change in behavior that results from practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=So What Is Learning?|url=http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/whatlearn.htm|website=What Is Learning?|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ''service'' and ''learning'' components stressed by Eyler and Giles, author David Bornstein references motivation in service. In ''How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas'', he states: "The key difference [between highly successful and average entrepreneurs has] more to do with the quality of their motivation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Service learning is about taking the student out of the classroom and placing them in an environment where they can make a difference while also learning. Service learning strengthens not just the community that is being helped but the person who is giving their time and effort to their cause, which benefits them socially, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. For many service learning is simply tending to basic human needs: food, water, clothes, and housing. Some organizations, such as The Salvation Army, also seek to attend to the spiritual side of service learning. They used the motto "soup, soap, and salvation"&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Andrzej Diniejko, [http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/salvation-army-founded "The Origin and Early Development of the Salvation Army in Victorian England"], "The Victorian Web", 11 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to show what they wanted to do with their ministry. "The Salvation Army sees no conflict between spiritual and social ministry. It seeks to serve people so as to satisfy both the spiritual and social dimensions of their needs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/salvationarmy_1.shtml "Salvation Army"], BBC, 2009-07-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable people==
One contributor to the study of service learning is [[Alexander Astin]]. Astin, the Allan M. Cartter Distinguished Professor of Higher Education Emeritus and founding director of both Cooperative Institutional Research Program and Higher Education Research Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alexander Astin |url=https://gseis.ucla.edu/media/AlexanderAstinCV.pdf?x63302 |website=Curriculum Vitae |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, formed a Theory of Involvement. This theory explains how student involvement in co-curricular activities positively affects college outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alexander Astin's Theory of Involvement |url=https://studentdevelopmenttheory.weebly.com/astin.html |website=Student Development Theory |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a 1998 study of college seniors, Astin demonstrated that service greatly improves critical thinking skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eyler |first1=Janet |last2=Giles |first2=Dwight E., Jr. |title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning? |date=1999 |publisher=Jossey-Bass Publishers |location=San Francisco |isbn=0-7879-4483-1 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nadinne I.

Other skills, such as courage, forgiveness, and stewarding the earth, must be learned elsewhere. Therefore, she recommends service learning and community engagement, which “offer learning with and from wise people, who teach by example.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TEDxPioneerValley - Nadinne Cruz - Education on Fire.mov |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycbQwCb2Gl8 |website=YouTube |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Furco]], Associate Vice President for Public Engagement at the University of Minnesota and a professor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Faculty &amp; Instructors |url=http://www.cehd.umn.edu/olpd/people/afurco/ |website=University of Minnesota |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has contributed a variety of literature to service learning, including two books: Service-Learning: The Essence of the Pedagogy and Service-Learning Through a Multidisciplinary Lens, which he co-authored with S.

'''Shared reading''' is an instructional approach in which the teacher explicitly models the strategies and skills of proficient [[Reading (process)|readers]].

In Brenda Parkes' text, [[Read It Again!]], a guide for teachers to do shared reading in the classroom, the first chapter asks, What is Shared Reading? She then answers the question by writing, " Shared reading is a collaborative learning activity, based on research by Don Holdaway (1979), that emulates and builds from the child's experience with bedtime stories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkes|first1=Brenda|title=Read it Again!: Revisiting Shared Reading|date=2000|publisher=Stenhouse Publishers|isbn=157110304X|page=1 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Hsrbi5qD4MQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early childhood classrooms, shared reading typically involves a teacher and a large group of children sitting closely together to read and reread carefully selected enlarged texts. Shared reading can also be done effectively with smaller groups.

With this instructional technique, students have an opportunity to gradually assume more responsibility for the reading as their skill level and confidence increase. Shared reading also provides a safe learning environment for students to practice the reading behaviours of proficient readers with the support of teacher and peers. Shared reading may focus on needs indicated in assessment data and required by grade level curriculum expectations. The text is always chosen by the teacher and must be visible to the students.

==Description==

Traditionally, shared reading has used paper-based materials.  However, recently a number of electronic resources have been developed.  One such resource is an online resource called Mimic Books.  This resource has been specifically designed to be used on interactive whiteboards for shared reading lessons. The benefits of this resource is that it replicates the look and appearance of a real big book but on the interactive whiteboard making it clearly visible to children. By increasing the amount of shared-reading in the home, parents are able to help children with their development of a larger knowledge base for understanding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=M|title=Proust and the squid: The story and science of reading the brain|date=2005|publisher=Harper|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The main purpose of shared reading is to provide children with an enjoyable experience, introduce them to a variety of authors, illustrators and types of texts to entice them to become a reader. The second and equally as important purpose is to teach children the reading process and teach systematically and explicitly how to be readers and writers themselves. (Parkes, 2000).  Through shared reading, children learn to track print and connect print to speech (Clay, 2000). By increasing the amount of shared-reading in the home, parents are able to help children with their development of a larger knowledge base for understanding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=M|title=Proust and the squid: The story and science of reading the brain|date=2005|publisher=Harper|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specification for texts==
When selecting texts for reading, teachers typically look for text that is appropriate for the [[reading level]] of the students, that is also cross-curricular and relevant in its nature.  The text should be of an appropriate length for study and be adequately complex.  The text should also have an impact.

==Method==
In primary grades, the teacher reads while the children are encouraged to read along. The more familiar the text, the more the teachers asks of the students in terms of reading, talking and answering questions about the reading. In upper grades, the teacher reads the text aloud after stating a focus, and then re-reads the text, asking questions specific to the focus of choice (and may ask students to join). The focus may include things like: analysis, predictions, drawing inferences, [[grammar]] and [[punctuation]], [[vocabulary]] development, questioning, literacy elements, [[critical thinking]], phrasing, fluency, intonation, character and plot Development.

According to Morrow (2009), shared reading usually begins with a teacher reading from a Big Book so that everyone can see the text. Stories that have predictable plots are best because students can participate early on in the shared reading experience.  During the first reading, students should simply listen to the story. The teacher might use a pointer to demonstrate directionality in text and one-to-one correspondence. As the text is read multiple times, students should begin to participate by chanting, making predictions, providing key words that are important in the story or participating in echo reading. Morrow (2009) also suggests to tape-record shared book readings and make it available for students to listen to at another time. "This activity provides a familiar and fluent model for reading with good phrasing and intonation for children to emulate" (Morrow, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;199).

'''Social Networking Pedagogy''' is a [[philosophy of education]] described by curriculum theorists [[Thomas Patrick Huston]] and [http://education.indiana.edu/Default.aspx?TabId=16364 Hallie DeCatherine Jones]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} as a form of learner-driven [[participatory culture]] where the user’s experience is reciprocal, consisting of a range of input and output experiences mediated by [[Social_network|social networking]] technologies.  The range of individual and unique differentiated user experiences form a composite impression on the individual which functions as an [[Epistemology|epistemic form]] of how we come to know and experience the world and its social, cultural, political and economic realities.     

In educational settings, social networking pedagogical approaches place [[Social_network|social networking]] technologies at their core, thus presenting expansive opportunities for education to extend the [[curriculum]] beyond the traditional walls of educational institutions by reaching into the daily-lived experiences of individuals. The [[Archive|archival]] features and lack of [[Temporality|temporal]] constraints associated with Internet technologies sustain continually changing currents that educators can connect to [[Student_voice|student-driven]] interests by engaging them with [[Trending_topic#Trends|trending topics]].  Through Social Network Pedagogy, educators can develop a teaching [[Praxis_(process)|praxis]] where the classroom and social space blend and individuals’ creative contributions are acknowledged for their cultural value.  

[http://education.indiana.edu/Default.aspx?TabId=16364 Jones]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [[Thomas_Patrick_Huston|Huston]] began theorizing the development of Social Networking Pedagogy during their tenure as doctoral students at the [[Indiana University School of Education]] where they were colleagues in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120507204235/http://education.indiana.edu/Default.aspx?alias=education.indiana.edu%2Fedci Department of Curriculum and Instruction].  They point to the fields of [[cultural studies]] and [[critical pedagogy]], especially the contributions of [http://davidtrend.net/ David Trend] with his book [https://books.google.com/books/about/Cultural_Pedagogy.html?id=B5kYZvntIEwC Cultural Pedagogy" Art, Education, Politics] and critical theorist [[Henry Giroux]].

{{no sources|date= May 2017}}
Many people with severe physical or cognitive impairment use one or more switches to access computers. A switch is an [[assistive technology]] device that replaces the need to use a [[computer keyboard]] or a [[mouse (computing)|mouse]].

==Types of switch==
[[Image:Access device.JPG|thumb|right|An example of a single switch]]
[[Image:IMG 0096 Foot Switch.JPG|thumb|right|A foot switch]]

Switches come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on the action used to activate them (such as [[sip-and-puff|sip-puff]], pushing, pulling, pressing, blinking or squeezing). Switches also vary in their colour and aesthetics. For push or press switches, the amount of force required to operate them varies or in some cases can be adjusted. Some switches may only require a touch (not even a press), some may be designed to be kicked. 
A switch can be operated by almost any body part that is able to produce consistent and voluntary movement..

==Connecting a switch==
A switch cannot be plugged directly into a computer. Instead a Switch Interface is required to bridge the gap between the switch and the computer's [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[serial port|serial]], or [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] port.

==What can be accomplished with a switch==
Switches can be suitable for people with cognitive difficulties, developmental delays and physical limitations. In the simplest use they are a clear and simple way to demonstrate action/reaction often referred to as cause and effect. In the more complex use they could be the means to control mobility or interact with the environment.
There are a variety of motivating switch activities that can be used to assess and develop a person's understanding of choice and timing.

Switches can be linked to a variety of devices, for example: [[Augmentative and Alternative Communication]] devices, switch adapted toys, switch interfaces for computer access, SMART Technology, sensory room equipment and [[environmental control device]]s

==Switch types==
The smallest amount of interaction that can be provided with a switch is binary switch input, as holding down the switch for a certain amount of time may be impossible for a [[Sip-and-puff|sip and puff]] device or painful for someone with arthritis. 
Some users will prefer to use one switch, others will prefer to use two and sometimes more. For users who are using their switches to access simple activities an additional switch brings about an option of choice. It also allows two users to work collaboratively or to play against each other.

Considering multiple switch access is important for users accessing more advanced activities through [[switch access scanning]]. This is usually determined by their physical capabilities. A single switch requires less physical control and is usually less tiring to access but it reduces scanning options and usually leads to a slower rate of input. Single-switch scanning also requires much greater concentration. Two-switch scanning enables a range of scanning options, including row-and-column and overscan. These can greatly increase input rates and can make using a computer or electronic assistive device far more comfortable and efficient.

{{Refimprove|date=October 2017}}

'''Synchronous conferencing''' is the formal term used in [[computing]], in particular in [[computer-mediated communication]], [[Computer-supported collaboration|collaboration]] and [[Web-based training|learning]], to describe technologies informally known as [[online chat]]. It is sometimes extended to include [[video conferencing|audio/video conferencing]] or [[instant messaging]] systems that provide a [[text-based]] [[multi-user]] chat function. The word ''synchronous'' is used to qualify the conferencing as [[Real-time communications|real-time]], as distinct from a system such as [[e-mail]], where messages are left and answered later.

Synchronous conferencing protocols include:

* [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] (Internet Relay Chat)
* [[Protocol for Synchronous Conferencing|PSYC]] (Protocol for Synchronous Conferencing)
* [[SILC (protocol)|SILC]] (Secure Internet Live Conferencing protocol)
* [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)
* [[SIMPLE (instant messaging protocol)]] (Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions)

== Types ==
According to the type of media used, synchronous conferencing can be divided into&lt;ref name="ref 01"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=Michael M|last2=Cheon|first2=Jongpil|title=The Value of Using Synchronous Conferencing for Instruction and Students|journal=Journal of Interactive Online Learning|url=http://anitacrawley.net/Articles/Grant%202007%20value%20and%20effectiveness%20of%20wc.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''audio conferencing:''' only audio is used 
* '''video conferencing:''' Both audio (voice) and video and picture are used. 

According to the number of access point used, synchronous conferencing can be divided into 
* '''point-to-point:''' Only two computers are connected end to end.
* '''multi-point:''' Two or more than two computers are connected together.

== Synchronous vs asynchronous conferencing ==
Both synchronous and [[asynchronous conferencing]] are [[online conferencing]] where the participants can interact while being physically located at different places in the world. Asynchronous conferencing allows the students to access the learning material at their convenience while synchronous conferencing requires that all participants including the instructor and the students be online at the time of conference. &lt;ref name="ref 01"/&gt;

While synchronous conferencing enables real time interaction of the participants, asynchronous conferencing allows participants to post messages and others can respond to it at any convenient time. Sometimes a combination of both synchronous and asynchronous conferencing is used. Both the methods give a permanent record of the conference. &lt;ref name="Ref 02"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is online conferencing?|url=http://www.online-conference.net/what.htm|website=Online Conferencing|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Some of the methods used in synchronous conferencing are:
* '''Chat (text only)''': Multiple participants can be logged into the conference and can interactively share resources and ideas. There is also option to save the chat and archive it for later review. 
* '''Voice (telephone or voice-over IP)''': This is a conference call between the instructor and the participating students where they can speak through built-in microphone or a headset. 
* '''[[Video conferencing]]''': This may or may not require the participants to have their webcams running. Usually, a video conference involves a live feed from a classroom or elsewhere or a content.
* '''[[Web conferencing]]''': This includes Webinar (Web-based seminar) as well. Unlike in video conferencing, participants of a web conferencing can access a wider variety of media elements. Web conferences are comparatively more interactive and usually incorporate chat sessions as well.
* '''[[Internet radio]]/[[podcasts]]''': The instructors makes the audio file available in the Internet which is archived and the students subscribed to the podcast can download it.
* '''[[Virtual worlds]]''': In this set up, students can meet in virtual world and speak with each other through headsets and VoIP. 	This can make the learning more productive and engaging when the students are able to navigate the worlds and operate in their avatar.

== Critical factors for effective implementation ==

There are four critical factors identified for implementing synchronous conferencing for effective instruction to the students&lt;ref name="ref 01"/&gt;
* Video and audio quality which depends on technical factors like higher bandwidth and processing capabilities of the system.
* Training time which depends on the familiarity and proficiency of the instructors and the students with the technology.
* Teaching strategies which depends on the adaptability of the instructors with the new methods, preparing appropriate and effective training materials and motivating students.
* Direct meeting of the instructor and the students.

== Synchronous conferencing in higher education ==
Synchronous conferencing in education helps in the delivery of content through digital media. Since this is a real-time teaching, it also brings the benefits of face-to-face teaching in distance learning. Many higher education institutions offer well-designed quality e-learning opportunities. 
Some of the advantages of synchronous conferencing in education are: &lt;ref name="Ref 04"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Ref 07"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ferriter|first1=Bill|title=Using videoconferencing to connect your class to the world|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/pages/6559|website=Learn NC|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Helps the students to connect with not only their own teachers and peers but also with recognized experts in the field regardless of the geographical distance and different time zones. 
* Provides opportunities to both the teachers and the students to expand their knowledge outside the classrooms. 
* Helps students who are home-bound or limited mobility to connect with their classrooms and participate in learning.
* Helps the faculties to conduct classes when they are not able to come to classes due to an emergency.
* Supports real-time collaboration, interaction and immediate feedback
* Encourage students to learn together and in turn develop cultural understanding
* Personalized learning experience for the students
* Real-time discussion opportunities for students promoting student engagement
* Active interaction can lead to an associated community of like-minded students
* Saves travel expenses and time

== Implementation of educational technology ==
The tools for implementing synchronous conferencing depends on the type of educational problem addressed. This is in turn decides the method of synchronous conferencing to be used and the tool to be used in the learning context. The tool selected addresses the problem of improving the learning outcomes which cannot be solved with an asynchronous environment. There are many tools and platforms available for synchronous conferencing.&lt;ref name="Ref 04"/&gt;
* Smartphone applications
* Web conferencing tools
* Video conferencing tools
* Video and hangout platforms
* Shared whiteboards
The selection of tools and platforms also depend on the group size which depends on the activity for the course design.

== Effective teaching strategies ==
To make synchronous conferencing effective and engaging, appropriate teaching strategies are important and plays a very important role in making the learning successful. Some of these are &lt;ref name="Ref 06"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=Tena B.|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Kelly|last3=Neill|first3=Jason K.|title=Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education: Effective Online Course Design to Assist Students’ Success|journal=MERLOT Journal of Online Learning and Teaching|date=March 2015|volume=11|issue=1|url=http://jolt.merlot.org/vol11no1/Crews_0315.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Design and development of appropriate online learning environment
* Constructing effective instructional strategies
* Ensure student engagement during learning
* Effective communication with the students.
* Encouraging active learning among the students by relating learning with past experiences
* Flexibility in teaching methods
* Provide continuous and prompt feedback for assessing and improvement
* Develop a sense of community and cooperation among the learners
* Include planned open-ended and critical thought provoking questions to the students to support knowledge construction.
* Provide very rich learning experience by optimising the conferencing software resources.
* Provide clear guidelines for the participating students.
* Moderate the conference through advance planning and preparation. 
* Emphasizing and adhering to time allotted

== Limitations ==
Some limitations for synchronous conferencing in learning are:&lt;ref name="Ref 04"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ozden|first1=Sule|title=Student Perceptions of Web-conferencing in Hybrid Classes|url=http://udel.edu/~shule/new/ActionResearchPaper.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Ref 05"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Lynn|last2=Fyvie|first2=Barb|last3=Koritko|first3=Brenda|title=Best practices in synchronous conferencing moderation|journal=The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning|date=June 2006|volume=7|issue=1|url=http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/308/483|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disjointed discussions, not connected in time
* Lack of effective moderation and/or clear guidelines for learners
* Difficulty in collaborating online projects
* Lack of proper communication with the instructor and students.
* Technical issues may arise if not analysed and planned in advance
* Lack of familiarity with the tools
* Limited time to complete the learning activity and to incorporate interactions of the learners
* Requires a set date and time for the classes
* In case of text-based chats, typing may be slower for some students
* Students unsure of when to interrupt or ask questions
* Both the host and the participants need to undergo basic training for the successful conferencing

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12083">'''Wolff-Michael Roth''' (Born June 28, 1953, Heidelberg) is a [[learning sciences|learning scientist]] at the [[University of Victoria]] conducting research on how people across the life span know and learn mathematics and science. He has contributed to numerous fields of research: learning science in [[learning communities]], coteaching, authentic school [[science education]], cultural-historical [[activity theory]], social studies of science, [[gesture]] studies, [[qualitative research]] methods, [[embodied cognition]], [[situated cognition]], and the role of language in learning science and mathematics.

==Career==
Roth received a master's degree of physics&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, K., Hink, W., &amp; Roth, W.-M. (1980). Stopping power for H+ in Be (20-120 keV). ''Nuclear Instruments and Methods, 173'', 357-362.&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[University of Wuerzburg]] and completed a doctorate in the College of Science and Technology at the [[University of Southern Mississippi]] ([[Hattiesburg]], [[Mississippi]]) with concentrations in cognition, statistics, and physical chemistry. He began to establish himself as a researcher while teaching at [[Appleby College]] ([[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]], [[Ontario]]). There, he did the research for what became one of the first research articles on the social construction of knowledge in science classrooms: "The social construction of scientific concepts or The concept map as conscription device and tool for social thinking in high school science."&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M., &amp; Roychoudhury, A. (1992). The social construction of scientific concepts or The concept map as conscription device and tool for social thinking in high school science. ''Science Education, 76'', 531-557.&lt;/ref&gt; There he also conducted the work that would lead to ''Authentic School Science'',&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (1995). ''Authentic school science: Knowing and learning in open-inquiry science laboratories''. Dordrecht, Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; in which he provides evidence for how high school students learn science when provided with opportunities to frame their own research questions, which they then answer by designing and conducting experiments. They write up their results, which they have to be able to defend within their [[learning community]]. In 1992, he joined [[Simon Fraser University]] ([[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]]), where he was mainly responsible for teaching statistics in the Faculty of Education. In his research, he initially focused on learning in science classrooms, but soon expanded his work to learning mathematics and science among future teachers, research scientists, and designers of computer software. In 1997, he was appointed ''Lansdowne Professor of Applied Cognitive Science'' at the [[University of Victoria]]. There he further expanded his research on the learning of mathematics and science, for example, on the use of graphs in scientific research and in technical professions.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2003). ''Toward an anthropology of graphing: Semiotic and activity-theoretic perspectives''. Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main Contributions==
Although he worked within a neo-Piagetian (information processing oriented) paradigm during his doctoral research, using statistical methods, his subsequent work was initially based in school science classrooms and later extended to mathematics and science in fish hatcheries,&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2005). Mathematical inscriptions and the reflexive elaboration of understanding: An ethnography of graphing and numeracy in a fish hatchery. ''Mathematical Thinking and Learning, 7'', 75-109.&lt;/ref&gt; environmental activism,&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, L., &amp; Roth, W.-M. (2006). Learning and teaching as emergent features of informal settings: An ethnographic study in an environmental action group. ''Science Education, 90'', 1028-1049.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, S., &amp; Roth, W.-M. (2001). How ditch and drain become a healthy creek: Representations, translations and agency during the re/design of a watershed.

Those who get hurt aren't always being heard: Scientist-resident interactions over community water. ''Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, 29'' (2), 153-183.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphing as Social Practice===
Psychologist tend to theorize graphing, as all other forms of representing activity, as a faculty of the mind. Based on his ethnographic studies of mathematics among scientists, Roth proposes to view graphing as a social practice that humans learn ''in relation with others''; the relation ''is'' what we subsequently attribute to the mind. Because graphing is a ''social'' fact, it can be studied using anthropological methods, which is precisely what Roth proposes in ''Towards an Anthropology of Graphing''&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2003). ''Toward an anthropology of graphing: Semiotic and activity-theoretic perspectives''. Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a comprehensive review of the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M., &amp; McGinn, M. K. (1998). Inscriptions: a social practice approach to "representations." ''Review of Educational Research, 68'', 35-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gesture Studies===
[[Gesture]]s constitute an integral aspect of knowing and learning. Arising from his studies of learning in high school science laboratories and hands-on elementary school activities, Roth showed how students' scientific knowledge arises from what initially are simply manipulative movements and hand movements to explore and learn about the natural world. These movements later become symbolic movements, that is, gestures, which encode the earliest forms of knowing that can be observed prior to verbal forms.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M., &amp; Lawless, D. (2002). Signs, deixis, and the emergence of scientific explanations. Semiotica, 138, 95-130.&lt;/ref&gt; In the main review journal of educational research he published a summary of the work in psychology, anthropology, and linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2002). Gestures: Their role in teaching and learning. ''Review of Educational Research, 71'', 365-392.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coteaching===
Whereas in many professions, practitioner learn while working with others, teachers have to figure out much of their knowledge on their own. Using it initially as a form of staff development, Roth, subsequently working with Ken Tobin, developed coteaching as a form learning to teach while teaching. Together they published ''At the Elbow of Another'',&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M., &amp; Tobin, K. (2002). ''At the elbow of another: Learning to teach by coteaching''. New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; in which they lay out the foundation of this approach. In this model, supervision and evaluation of teaching and research on teaching have to be conducted by teaching together with the resident teachers.

===Cultural-Historical Activity Theory===
Roth has contributed to this field especially by theorizing school-related processes in terms of a version of this theory that was popularized in the Center for Activity Theory and Developmental Work Research. He proposed a fourth generation of this theory, which takes into account emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2007). Emotion at work: A contribution to third-generation cultural historical activity theory. Mind, Culture and Activity, 14, 40-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Yew Jin Lee, he wrote a review of the literature on this "neglected legacy" of the work of [[Vygotsky|Lev S. Vygotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M., &amp; Lee, Y. J. (2007). "Vygotsky's neglected legacy": Cultural-historical activity theory. Review of Educational Research, 77, 186-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowing in the Flesh===
Most recently, Roth has been working on questions of [[embodied cognition]], which is in fact a misnomer, for all cognition inherently is embodied.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets-Johnstone, M. (2009). The corporeal turn: An interdisciplinary reader. Exeter, England: Imprint Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the French philosophers [[Maine de Biran]] and [[Michel Henry]] he conceives of the emergence of signification from the auto-affection of the flesh. All perception, all knowing, all communication therefore arises from forms of movement. In a number of publications, he develops this way of understanding knowing with data from geometry in second-grade classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, W.-M. (2011). ''Geometry as objective science in elementary classrooms: Mathematics in the flesh''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20561">'''Writing about Writing (WAW)''', is a method or theory of teaching composition which puts emphasis on reading and writing about writing in the writing course, and reimagines [[first-year composition]] as an "introduction to writing studies." This is not to say WAW only teaches a first-year writing course as if it were an introduction to a writing major, but rather it advocates merging the ''how'' of writing with its practice. An introduction course to a writing major has both a different audience and purpose than a first-year composition course framed in WAW. The development of WAW is largely credited to Elizabeth Wardle and Douglas Downs after the publication of their 2007 article "Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions."

==History==
Composition is not widely recognized as its own discipline. Composition instructors strive to teach students how to become better writers. As public perception often shapes public policy, this uninformed view of composition as a legitimate field of study has contributed to a lack of funding and emphasis on composition classes in academia.&lt;ref name= Carter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Shannon|title=Writing about Writing in Basic Writing: A Teacher/Researcher/Activist Narrative|journal=Basic Writing e-journal|origyear=2009|year=2010|volume=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions"===
In 2007, Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle published an article titled "Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions" in which they propose a reform of first-year composition instruction based on the results of a test course they developed.  This course sought "to improve students' understanding of writing, [[rhetoric]], language, and literacy" and promoted a view of reading and writing as scholarly inquiry, encouraging "more realistic conceptions of writing."  &lt;ref name= DownsWardle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downs|first=Douglas|author2=Elizabeth Wardle |title=Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions: (Re)Envisioning 'First Year Composition' as 'Introduction to Writing Studies']|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2007|volume=58|issue=4|pages=552–584}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article is considered to be revolutionary by other scholars in the field, and it's frequently cited by those who have continued the work in the WAW movement.

In the article, Downs and Wardle deny the existence of a universal educated discourse, which conflicts with first-year composition goals of preparing students to write across the curriculum. Downs and Wardle write that teaching students how to write across the curriculum supports the idea that "writing is not a real subject, that writing courses do not require expert instructors, and that rhetoric and composition are not genuine research areas or legitimate intellectual pursuits."&lt;ref name= DownsWardle /&gt;

The article goes on to outline the course they designed that is centered more on teaching the students about "writing studies", rather than how to write in college. The authors discuss readers, research assignments, reflective assignments and presentation assignments before going on to report case-studies of two students who took Downs' and Wardle's WAW-centered first-year composition course. While these were different types of students who had different learning outcomes, both stories illustrate the flexible nature of WAW and how this type of course can be tailored towards individual student needs. The authors discuss several benefits they observed of using WAW to teach first-year composition, but also indicate the presence of challenges associated with teaching this kind of course, and address both these challenges as well as critiques they received from colleagues.

The authors conclude that an implementation of WAW-centered classes in first-year composition professionalizes writing instruction, and raises awareness about writing studies as a legitimate discipline. Downs and Wardle write "rather than purporting to teach students 'academic writing' and claiming to prepare them for writing in their disciplines, the course teaches students what we as a field have learned about writing as an object of study."&lt;ref name= DownsWardle /&gt; Essentially, the aim of a WAW course is to demonstrate how writing works.

==="Continuing the Dialogue"===
After its publication, the article caused a stir in academia and received a lot of response from the community, prompting a follow-up article by Wardle in 2008 titled "Continuing the Dialogue: Follow-up Comments on 'Teaching about Writing, Righting
Misconceptions.'" In it, Wardle addresses responders who commented that she and Downs put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field by explaining that first-year composition should not hold more value than other branches within their field, but it is of importance and merits scholarly inquiry. She reaffirms their main point as being "that we should reconceive the nature of FYC goals and focus on the content knowledge we have as a field from which students can benefit."&lt;ref name= follow&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wardle|first=Elizabeth|title=Continuing the Dialogue: Follow-up Comments on 'Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2008|volume=60|issue=1|pages=175–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to write, "Let me be as clear as possible: Doug and I are arguing that composition instructors should refuse to separate knowledge about writing from practice in writing and some instruction on how to complete the writing tasks at hand."&lt;ref name=follow /&gt; Another misconception she addresses is misconstruing a first-year writing WAW approach as being the same as an introductory course to a writing ''major'' and dismisses the claims that a WAW approach is put in place to recruit writing majors. The differences between these two courses, she explains, are both audience and purpose. Downs and Wardle expanded have produced an accompanying textbook, ''Writing about Writing: A College Reader'', which was published in 2011.

==Benefits==
In "Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions," Downs and Wardle discuss several benefits they found WAW affords students including:&lt;ref name=DownsWardle /&gt;
*an increased self-awareness about writing
*improved reading abilities
*improved confidence as a student
*raised awareness of research writing as conversation

WAW asks students to read about writing and various processes, which allows them to identify what works for them. By reading articles that a composition studies student might read, the first-year composition student is able to gain further insight into the ongoing conversation centered around writing. In her article "Writing about Writing in [[Basic writing|Basic Writing]]," Shannon Carter explains "a writing-about-writing approach foregrounds research in writing and related studies by asking students to read and discuss key research in the discipline and contribute to the scholarly conversation themselves." &lt;ref name=Carter /&gt; She explains that having students immerse themselves in this type of scholarship will not only improve their writing but their understanding of writing as an academic discipline will increase as well, which in turn contributes to changing the public perception that writing is only something that is a piece of other disciplines.

Many instructors who use WAW are also benefited in that they themselves are able to learn more about composition studies along with their class, promoting parallel learning. In an article titled "Seeing is Believing: Writing Studies with 'Basic Writing' Students," Charlton reports that some see value in teaching first-year composition from a cultural studies approach because not only does this allow for composition instructors to teach what they love, but the types of reading promote critical thinking and analysis—two goals many first-year composition courses have. Also, the article reports on several instructors incorporating graduate level writing-studies readings into their first-year writing courses with much success. Charlton writes, "Students were engaged and were developing research questions and projects that rivaled my on senior-level composition theory class, both in terms of complexity and overall quality of finished products."&lt;ref name= Jonikka&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charlton|first=Jonkka|title=Seeing is Believing: Writing Studies with 'Basic Writing' Students|journal=Basic Writing Online|origyear=2009|year=2012|volume=8/9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and responses==
As WAW is a relatively recent movement and is still in its early stages of development, proponents don't always agree on how WAW should be applied to the classroom. Carter points out instructors only account for a small portion of the composition community, and therefore disagreement is common and "often in fundamental ways." &lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;

In his response to Downs and Wardle's "Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions," Joshua P. Kutney argues that providing students with an awareness of writing through WAW won't necessarily transfer to their writing performance. He compares WAW to students who take courses that raise their awareness of social problems. While students gain a greater sense of these issues through these courses, rarely do they display behavioral changes in regards to these issues.

Kutney also argues that an increased awareness of writing studies may result in students becoming more comfortable with validating their insufficiencies as a writer because they now recognize the difficulties expert writers have, and not because they now comprehend "the nuances of the composing process." He goes on to say that while Downs and Wardle discuss WAW as allowing students to see academic writing as engaging in an ongoing conversation, this knowledge might overwhelm the student and cause them to avoid engaging in the conversation altogether. Kutney writes, "While First-Year Composition may not do much to develop the writing abilities of students, Downs and Wardle offer no reason to think that Introduction to Writing Studies, a course that does not purport to teach writing, will do more." &lt;ref name= Kutney&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kutney|first=Joshua P.|title=Will Writing Awareness Transfer to Writing Performance? Response to Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle, 'Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2007|volume=59|issue=10|pages=276–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their response to Downs and Wardle, Miles et al. claim a WAW approach seems like it serves as an introduction to a writing major, which would not be beneficial to first-year students. They take issue with Downs and Wardle's "dismissal of the importance of teaching situated procedural knowledge",&lt;ref name=Miles&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miles|first=Libby|title=Interchanges: Commenting on Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle's 'Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2008|volume=59|issue=3|pages=503–511|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably the rhetorical situation. Miles et al. claim the only rhetorical situation a WAW course exposes its students to is that of scholarly research. They also argue that Downs and Wardle put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field of writing studies, seeing it as the predominant branch of the field. They also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to give voice to the students in their case study who didn't benefit from the WAW approach and that only those who did are highlighted. Another main criticism they have is WAW's reliance on one modality of research writing while they argue that their "research and scholarship is an interesting hybrid of several modalities at once."&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt;

Downs published a response to Miles et al. in which he expresses displeasure at the arguments the authors laid out:&lt;blockquote&gt; My first reaction to Miles et al.'s response to "FYC as Intro to Writing Studies" is about as magnanimous as their response itself – that is, not remotely. This disappoints me, because I do maintain the ideal of scholarship wherein a constructive dialectic stretches, shapes, and builds ideas rather than merely tearing them down. I confess my first instinct is to tear down Miles et al.'s response as they attempt to tear down the construct we forwarded. (Earning the condemnation of an entire department is bracing-and ironic when the scholarship of some of the signatories – for me, Schwegler and Shamoon – planted seeds of ideas they find unworkable.&lt;ref name=Downs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downs|first=Douglas|title=Response to Miles et al.|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2008|volume=60|issue=1|pages=175–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He writes Miles et al. "seem to address us as if we are sitting at the kids' table at Thanksgiving dinner." His main contentions are:&lt;ref name=Downs /&gt;
*Miles et al. seem only to respond to arguments Downs and Wardle didn't make rather than focusing on the ones they did.
*There is a major difference between the type of course he and Wardle advocate from first-year writing and a course that serves as in introduction to a writing major.
*Miles et al. grossly misinterpreted the types of readings that are purposed to be involved in WAW, as they are not all of an academic nature and nowhere in Downs' and Wardle's article do they say that it is.
*In regards to the criticism that first-year writing students will have a difficult time comprehending readings that are also taught to graduate students, Downs states that it's an "admirable goal" of writing programs to support this kind of learning, and cutting first-year students off from this type of learning is "unnecessarily limiting."
He concludes by writing "I am grateful not only for the opportunity to respond, but to have something to respond to. And I wonder how differently our students might understand writing if they had similar opportunities."&lt;ref name=Downs /&gt;

A response to Downs' response to Miles et al. by Slomp and Sargent doesn't reject Downs and Wardle's ideas in the same way Miles et al. does, but calls for more research on the WAW method. The authors also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to position themselves into an ongoing conversation in the same way they advocate for in WAW. Slomp and Sargent say that Downs and Wardle paint themselves to be "lone pioneers" in this venture, but in the 1990s Wendy Bishop supported the use of writing as the main subject in the writing classroom. They also reference [[Peter Elbow]] as being someone who touched on similar ideas to WAW long before Downs and Wardle published "Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slomp|first=David H.|author2=M. Elizabeth Sargent |title=Responses to Responses: Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle's 'Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2009|volume=60|issue=1|pages=171–175|url=http://www.ncte.org/library/NCTEFiles/Resources/Journals/CCC/0603-feb09/CCC0603ResponseTeaching.pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon Carter, while a proponent of WAW, describes how it isn't always accessible to other instructors or policy makers. She describes how WAW can be "off-putting" to others, and the scholarship on the subject cannot be relied on in making changes to composition curriculum. She explains that while WAW can be effective for some, it is simply one way to approach teaching composition and won't work with everyone's teaching style.&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;

As previously mentioned, many believe that because the readings are written by professionals for professionals, undergraduates will not be able to easily understand the concepts, which will negatively affect engagement with the course. Some even question Downs and Wardle's motives, and see WAW as a ploy in "recruiting" more students to become majors in the field.&lt;ref name= Jonikka /&gt;

==''Writing about Writing: A College Reader''==
Published in 2011, Downs and Wardle's book is described as "encouraging students to draw on what they know in order to contribute to ongoing conversations about writing and literacy." &lt;ref name=Bedford&gt;Bedford St. Martin's, [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/Catalog/product/writingaboutwriting-firstedition-wardle/ Writing about Writing] 10 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the preface for the instructors, Downs and Wardle describes their frustration with composition courses that are based around themes that have nothing to do with writing. They list several reasons as to why WAW is a "smart choice" in terms of an approach to teaching first-year composition:&lt;ref name=WAW&gt;{{cite book|last=Downs|first=Douglas|author2=Elizabeth Wardle |title=Writing about Writing: A College Reader|year=2011|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53493-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*WAW engages students in a relevant subject
*WAW engages students' own area of expertise
*WAW helps students transfer what they learn
*WAW has been extensively class tested—and it works.

The book addresses several questions geared towards helping the student understand multiple components of writing: Why study writing? How do readers read and writers write?  How do you write? How have you become the readers and writer you are today? How do communities shape writing? How do you make yourself heard as college writer? A mixture of selected readings from both scholars, authors, and students are provided, as well as various activities and discussion questions associated with the readings.&lt;ref name=WAW /&gt;

===Reception===

The book is praised for its accessibility and forward thinking. For instance, David R. Russell from Iowa State University called the book "a milestone in composition textbooks." &lt;ref name=Bedford /&gt; Russell is known for his work in [[Writing Across the Curriculum]] and activity theory.

Its publisher's website describes it by saying "Throughout the book, friendly explanations and [[scaffolded]] questions help students connect to readings and — even more important — develop knowledge about writing they can use at work, in their everyday lives, and in college." &lt;ref name=Bedford /&gt;
