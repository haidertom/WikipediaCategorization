'''Abstract''' and '''concrete''' are classifications that denote whether the [[object (philosophy)|object]] that a term describes has physical [[referent|referents]]. Abstract objects have no physical referents, whereas concrete objects do. They are most commonly used in [[philosophy]] and [[semantics]]. Abstract objects are sometimes called '''''abstracta''''' (sing. '''''abstractum''''') and [[concrete object]]s are sometimes called ''[[wikt:concreta|concreta]]'' (sing. ''concretum''). An  abstract object is an [[object (philosophy)|object]] that does not exist at any particular time or place, but rather exists as a [[Type (metaphysics)|type]] of thing—i.e., an [[idea]], or [[abstraction]].&lt;ref name="A Glossary of Literary Terms"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUEtEa9nUWQC&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 September 2012|isbn=0495898023|author1=Abrams|first1=Meyer Howard|last2=Harpham|first2=Geoffrey Galt|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''abstract object'' is said to have been coined by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=D. M.|title=Sketch for a systematic metaphysics|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199655915|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of abstract objects is called [[abstract object theory]].

The [[type–token distinction]] identifies physical objects that are tokens of a particular type of thing.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Philip (2012) "The Philosophy of Phonology" in ''Philosophy of Linguistics'' (ed. Kemp, Fernando, Asher), Elsevier, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;  The "type" of which it is a part is in itself an abstract object. The abstract-concrete distinction is often introduced and initially understood in terms of paradigmatic examples of objects of each kind:

Abstract objects have often garnered the interest of philosophers because they raise problems for popular theories. In [[ontology]], abstract objects are considered problematic for [[physicalism]] and some forms of [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]]. Historically, the most important ontological dispute about abstract objects has been the [[problem of universals]]. In [[epistemology]], abstract objects are considered problematic for [[empiricism]]. If abstracta lack causal powers or spatial location, how do we know about them? It is hard to say how they can affect our sensory experiences, and yet we seem to agree on a wide range of claims about them. 

Some, such as [[Edward Zalta]] and arguably, [[Plato]] in his [[Theory of Forms]], have held that abstract objects constitute the defining subject matter of [[metaphysics]] or philosophical inquiry more broadly. To the extent that philosophy is independent of empirical research, and to the extent that empirical questions do not inform questions about abstracta, philosophy would seem especially suited to answering these latter questions. 

In modern philosophy, the distinction between abstract and concrete was explored by [[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason|KrV]]'' A51/B75–6. See also: Edward Willatt, ''Kant, Deleuze and Architectonics'', Continuum, 2010 p. 17: "Kant argues that cognition can only come about as a result of the union of the abstract work of the understanding and the concrete input of sensation."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel: ''[[The Science of Logic]]'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 609. See also: Richard Dien Winfield, ''Hegel's Science of Logic: A Critical Rethinking in Thirty Lectures'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2012, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]] said that abstract objects, such as numbers, were members of a '''third realm''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottlob Frege]], "Der Gedanke. Eine logische Untersuchung," in: ''Beiträge zur Philosophie des deutschen Idealismus'' 1 (1918/19), pp. 58–77; esp. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Popper's three worlds]].&lt;/ref&gt; different from the external world or from internal [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Gideon|title=Abstract Objects|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=1 January 2017|date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Abstract objects and causality===
Another popular proposal for drawing the abstract-concrete distinction contends that an object is abstract if it lacks any [[causality|causal]] powers. A causal power has the ability to affect something causally. Thus, the empty set is abstract because it cannot act on other objects. One problem for this view is that it is not clear exactly what it is to have a causal power. For a more detailed exploration of the abstract-concrete distinction, follow the link below to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=abstract-objects |title=Abstract Objects |last=Rosen |first=Gideon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concrete and abstract thinking==
[[Jean Piaget]] uses the terms "concrete" and "formal" to describe the different types of learning.  Concrete thinking involves facts and descriptions about everyday, tangible objects, while abstract ([[Formal Operational#Formal operational stage|formal operational]]) thinking involves a mental process.

==Quasi-abstract entities==
Recently, there has been some philosophical interest in the development of a third category of objects known as the quasi-abstract. Quasi-abstract objects have drawn particular attention in the area of [[social ontology]] and [[documentality]]. Some argue that the over-adherence to the platonist duality of the concrete and the abstract has led to a large category of social objects having been overlooked or rejected as nonexisting because they exhibit characteristics that the traditional duality between concrete and abstract regards as incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;B. Smith (2008), "Searle and De Soto: The New Ontology of the Social World." In ''The Mystery of Capital and the Construction of Social Reality''. Open Court.&lt;/ref&gt; Specially, the ability to have temporal location, but not spatial location, and have causal agency (if only by acting through representatives).&lt;ref&gt;E. H.

H. Robinson (2014), "A Documentary Theory of States and Their Existence as Quasi-Abstract Entities," ''Geopolitics'' '''19''' (3), pp. 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30561">'''Bateman's principle''', in [[evolutionary biology]], is that in most species, variability in [[reproductive success]] (or reproductive variance) is greater in males than in females. It was first proposed by [[Angus John Bateman]] (1919–1996), an English geneticist. Bateman suggested that, since males are capable of producing millions of sperm cells with little effort, while females invest much higher levels of energy in order to nurture a relatively small number of eggs, the female plays a significantly larger role in their offspring's reproductive success. Bateman’s paradigm thus views females as the limiting factor of parental investment, over which males will compete in order to [[copulate]] successfully.

Although Bateman's principle served as a cornerstone for the study of [[sexual selection]] for many decades, it has recently been subject to criticism. Attempts to reproduce Bateman's experiments in 2012 and 2013 were unable to support his conclusions. Some scientists have criticized Bateman's experimental and statistical methods, or pointed out conflicting evidence, while others have defended the veracity of the principle and cited evidence in support of it.

== Description ==
Typically it is the [[female]]s who have a relatively larger investment in producing each offspring. Bateman attributed the origin of the unequal investment to the differences in the production of gametes: sperm are cheaper than eggs. A single [[male]] can easily fertilize all females' eggs; she will not produce more offspring by mating with more than one male.  A male is capable of fathering more offspring if he mates with several females.  By and large, a male's potential reproductive success is limited by the number of females he mates with, whereas a female's potential reproductive success is limited by how many eggs she can produce. According to Bateman's principle, this results in [[sexual selection]], in which males compete with each other, and females become choosy in which males to mate with. Thus, as a result of being [[anisogamy|anisogamous]], males are fundamentally promiscuous, and females are fundamentally selective.

== History ==
Bateman initially published his review in 1948. He was a botanist, contributing to the literature of sexual selection only once in his lifetime. Bateman initially saw his study on Drosophila to be a test of Charles Darwin’s doctrine of sexual selection. He saw Darwin’s theory of natural selection not as flawed, but as incomplete. He felt that if he were to provide a concrete demonstration of how sexual selection played a role in the reproductive success of certain species, he could explain the gap between Darwin’s ideas and sexual dimorphism.

Although it is common to confuse Bateman's ideas with those of later scientists, his principle can be expressed in three simple statements. The first is that male reproductive success increases with the number of mates they attempt to copulate with, while female reproductive success does not. The second is that male reproductive success will show greater variance than female. The third is that sexual selection will have a greater effect on the sex with greater variance in reproductive success.

== Bateman's study ==
Throughout his research, Bateman conducted experiments using fruit flies in order to observe their copulation and sexual behavior. A total of six series of experiments were conducted with the fruit fly ''Drosophila melanogaster'', using three to five individuals of each sex. Each trial ran for three or four days. Some ran to completion without the transfer of the Drosophila from one environment (bottle) to another. In the others, Bateman transferred the flies and their eggs to a new bottle every day. Bateman also varied the age of the flies depending on the experiment, with an age gap between one and six days total. He never watched the flies' copulations. The flies used were from several inbred strains, which meant they could be identified by their specific inbred strain. Therefore, he inferred the number of involved mates based on the number of offspring that were later found to have mutations from both a male and a female. The difficulty that arose was that if a female Drosophila had copulated with five males and only one larva survived, Bateman would not be able to account for the other four copulations.

Analysis of the data collected in sets one through four showed that the males' reproductive success, estimated as the number of sired offspring, increased at a steady rate until a total of three mates were reached. It is important to note that Bateman kept the sex ratio of males to females completely even throughout his trials. But after surpassing three mates, male reproductive success began to fall. Female reproductive success also increased with number of mates, but much more gradually than that of the males. The second series of data collected in sets five and six illustrated a dramatically different outcome. Male reproductive success increased at a steady and steep rate, never dropping. Female reproductive success, on the other hand, plateaued after a single mate. Bateman focused mainly on the second series of data when discussing his results. His main conclusion was that the reproductive success of females does not increase with an influx of mates, as one fit mate was enough to successfully complete fertilization. This is often referred to as Bateman’s Gradient.

== Replication of Bateman's experiments ==
Throughout 2012 and 2013, Gowaty, Kim, and Anderson took it upon themselves to repeat Bateman's experiment in its entirety. While reproducing his tests, the same fly strains and mutations were used in order to maintain the same methodology. However, one of the 11 strains that Bateman used had gone extinct, and was thus replaced. (Tang-Martinez 2012)

Gowaty, Kim, and Anderson found that upon combining certain strains with one another, the offspring were unable to survive to adulthood. (Gowaty, Kim, &amp; Anderson 2012) Thus, Bateman’s numbers regarding the number of individuals not having mated was higher than the actual number. Likewise, his estimate of those that mated with one or more mates was too low. This was valid for both the males and females of this species.

Gowaty desired to further explore the reasoning behind the premature death of the Drosophila. She began doing so by running monogamy trials between different strains of flies and found that 25% of the offspring died due to becoming double mutants. (Gowaty 2013) Bateman thought his work fit within the lines of Mendel’s laws of genetics, while Gowaty proved otherwise. The 1948 experiments inferred reproductive success based on the number of adults living by the end of the trial. In reality, many factors were left out of the equation when calculating reproductive success as a function of the number of mates, which had the ability to completely dislodge the accuracy behind Bateman's results. Gowaty was not able to confirm Bateman's conclusions and found no evidence for sexual selection in the experiment. (Gowaty 2013; Tang-Martinez 2012)&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2017"/&gt;

== Related experiments ==
Nevertheless, some modern experiments between the relationship of number of mates and the reproductive success of males and females support Bateman's principle. Julie Collet conducted an experiment with a population of red jungle fowl. A total of thirteen replicate groups of three males and four females were monitored for ten days. In this experiment, the sex ratio was biased toward females. A male's reproductive success was calculated using the proportion of embryos fathered to the total number of embryos produced by all the females he mated with. The total sexual selection opportunity was calculated using the following formula.

The ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;represents the variance in RS, while the{{clarify|date=December 2016}} is the square mean of reproductive success of members of one sex in a group.

In 2013, Fritzsche and Arnqvist tested Bateman's principle by estimating sexual selection between males and females in four seed beetles. They used a unique experimental design that showed sexual selection to be greater in males than in females. In contrast, sexual selection was also shown to be stronger for females in role-reversed species. They suggested that the Bateman gradient is typically the most accurate and informative measure of sexual selection between different sexes and species (Fritzsche, K. &amp; Arnqvist, G).{{full|date=June 2018}}

== Modern criticism ==
More than 60 years later, Bateman's principle has received considerable attention. Sutherland argued that males' higher variance in reproductive success may result from random mating and coincidence. Hubbell and Johnson suggested that variance in reproductive success can be greatly influenced by the time and allocations of mating. In 2005, Gowaty and Hubbell suggested that mating tendencies are subject to change depending on certain strategies. They argued that there are cases in which males can be more selective than females, whereas Bateman suggested that his paradigm would be “almost universal” among sexually reproducing species. Critics proposed that females might be more subject to sexual selection than males, but not in all circumstances.&lt;ref name="Newcomer"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newcomer|first=Scott D.|last2=Zeh|first2=Jeanne A.|last3=Zeh|first3=David W.|date=1999-08-31|title=Genetic benefits enhance the reproductive success of polyandrous females|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/96/18/10236|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=96|issue=18|pages=10236–10241|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.18.10236|issn=0027-8424|pmid=10468592|pmc=17872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental and statistical criticisms followed. Until approximately a decade ago, critics of Bateman’s model focused on his experimental design. In recent years, they have shifted attention to the actual experimental and statistical calculations Bateman published throughout his trials. Birkhead wrote a 2000 review arguing that since Bateman’s experiments lasted only three to four days, the female fruit fly, ''Drosophila melanogaster'', may not have needed to mate repeatedly, as it can store sperm for up to four days; if Bateman had used a species in which females had to copulate more often to fertilize their eggs, the results might have been different. Snyder and Gowaty conducted the first in-depth analysis of the data in Bateman’s 1948 paper. They found sampling biases, mathematical errors, and selective presentation of data.&lt;ref name="Snyder2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snyder |first1=Brian F. |last2=Gowaty |first2=Patricia Adair |title=A Reappraisal of Bateman's Classic Study of Intrasexual Selection |journal=Evolution |date=November 2007 |volume=61 |issue=11 |pages=2457–2468 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00212.x|pmid=17725639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 review by [[Zuleyma Tang-Martinez|Zuleyma Tang-Martínez]] concluded that various empirical and theoretical studies, especially Gowaty's reproduction of Bateman's original experiment, pose a major challenge to Bateman's conclusions, and that Bateman's principle should be considered an unproven hypothesis in need of further reexamination.&lt;ref name="Tang-Martinez"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tang-Martinez|first1=Zuleyma|title=Repetition of Bateman challenges the paradigm|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=6 July 2012|volume=109|issue=29|pages=11476–11477|doi=10.1073/pnas.1209394109|pmid=22773808|pmc=3406825}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tang-Martínez, "modern data simply don't support most of Bateman's and [[Robert Trivers|Trivers']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s predictions and assumptions."&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2017"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tang-Martinez |first1=Zuleyma |title=Data Should Smash the Biological Myth of Promiscuous Males and Sexually Coy Females |url=http://theconversation.com/data-should-smash-the-biological-myth-of-promiscuous-males-and-sexually-coy-females-59665 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=4 June 2018 |language=en |date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 review confirmed Darwinian sex roles across the animal kingdom, concluding that "sexual selection, as captured by standard Bateman metrics, is indeed stronger in males than in females and that it is evolutionarily tied to sex biases in parental care and sexual dimorphism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/2/e1500983|title=Darwinian sex roles confirmed across the animal kingdom|first1=Tim|last1=Janicke|first2=Ines K.|last2=Häderer|first3=Marc J.|last3=Lajeunesse|first4=Nils|last4=Anthes|date=1 February 2016|journal=Science Advances|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e1500983|accessdate=17 April 2018|via=advances.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1500983|pmid=26933680|pmc=4758741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One error source that have been shown to give an illusion of greater differential in reproductive success in males than in females genetically is that chromosome effects cause a greater percentage of mutations to be lethal before even reaching sexual maturity in males than in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gowaty | first=P. A. | last2=Kim | first2=Y.-K. | last3=Anderson | first3=W. W. | title=No evidence of sexual selection in a repetition of Bateman's classic study of Drosophila melanogaster | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=109 | issue=29 | date=11 June 2012 | issn=0027-8424 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1207851109 | pmid=22689966 | pmc=3406809 | pages=11740–11745 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/06/06/1207851109.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption that any differential in reproductive success between males and females among the individuals that do reach sexual maturity must be due to sexual selection in the current population is also subject to criticism, such as the possibility of remnants of sexually selected traits in a previous species from which a new species have evolved can be negatively selected due to costs in nutrients and weakened immune systems and that such negative selection would cause a higher difference in reproductive success in males than in females even without any still ongoing sexual selection. Since lower degrees of selection during times of stable environment allows genetic variation to build up by random mutations and allow some individuals in a population to survive environmental change while strong constant selection offsets the effect and increases the risk of the entire population dying out during catastrophic environmental change due to less genetic variation, constant loss of genetic variation caused by sexual selection have been suggested as a factor contributing to higher [[extinction]] rates in more sexually dimorphic species besides the nutrient, immunity and other costs of the ornaments themselves. While the ornament cost risk would only be removed when the ornaments have been eliminated by selection, the genetic variation model predicts that the species ability to survive would improve significantly even at an early stage of reduction of sexual dimorphism due to other adaptive mutations arising and surviving due to minimal selection during times of stable environment while the genes causing sexually dimorphic anatomy have only in small part been affected by the mutations. Applied to human evolution, this model can explain why early [[Homo sapiens]] display a significantly increased adaptability to environmental change already at its early divergence from [[Homo erectus]] that had a high muscular sexual dimorphism, as well as why human anatomy through the history of Homo sapiens show a diversification during times of stable climate and a selective loss of the more robust male forms during environmental change that does not recover during later stability, continuing through the loss of many robust characteristics in regional bottlenecks as recent as the end of the Ice Age and the time around the [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]]. It also explains genetic evidence of human genetic diversity increasing during stable environmental periods and being reduced during bottlenecks related to changes in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Anthes | first=Nils | last2=Häderer | first2=Ines K. | last3=Michiels | first3=Nico K. | last4=Janicke | first4=Tim | editor-last=Schielzeth | editor-first=Holger | title=Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines | journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution | volume=8 | issue=8 | date=20 December 2016 | issn=2041-210X | doi=10.1111/2041-210x.12707 | pages=918–931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Zuk | first=Marlene | last2=Garcia-Gonzalez | first2=Francisco | last3=Herberstein | first3=Marie Elisabeth | last4=Simmons | first4=Leigh W. | title=Model Systems, Taxonomic Bias, and Sexual Selection: Beyond Drosophila | journal=Annual Review of Entomology | volume=59 | issue=1 | date=7 January 2014 | issn=0066-4170 | doi=10.1146/annurev-ento-011613-162014 | pmid=24160422 | pages=321–338 | hdl=10261/90632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicting evidence ==
Recently, DNA testing has permitted more detailed investigation of mating behavior in numerous species. The results, in many cases, have been cited as evidence against Bateman's principle.&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tang-Martínez | first=Zuleyma | title=Rethinking Bateman's Principles: Challenging Persistent Myths of Sexually Reluctant Females and Promiscuous Males | journal=The Journal of Sex Research | volume=53 | issue=4–5 | date=13 April 2016 | issn=0022-4499 | doi=10.1080/00224499.2016.1150938 | pmid=27074147 | pages=532–559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, most bird species were believed to be sexually monogamous.

== Incompatibility with other sex difference claims ==
There are a number of claims about sex differences in humans said by [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] to be well supported that are not logically predicted by Bateman's principle. One example that have been pointed out is [[language]] ability that is said to be more developed in women than in men. It is argued that language, being a [[origin of language|derived human trait]], is not predicted by a model that assumes males to be more selected than females to be present to a higher degree in women than in men but the opposite. The objection about a trade-off between [[spatial ability]] and language is found lacking due to the existence of animals that outperform humans on spatial tasks such as [[bird of prey|birds of prey]] and [[bat]]s while having much smaller and more rapidly maturing brains than humans, while [[great ape language]] is limited and ungrammatical at best despite great apes being much closer to humans in brain capacity than bats or birds of prey are, showing that the system requirements for spatial ability are much lower than those for language and therefore not a serious trade-off for them. The generalization of Bateman's principle to societies lacking modern [[birth control]] is also argued to be incompatible with such generalization of the "nuns more successful at [[celibacy]] than monks" clause of the female [[erotic plasticity]] model, as absence of modern contraceptives would mean that absence of reproduction for many men required that many men had no sexual relationships with women while male sexual exclusivity to a particular gender, if present, would have precluded same-sex relationships as a form of non-celibacy for men who could not find a female mate as well. It is also mentioned that the evolutionary psychologists themselves claim that women are sexually picky due to an evolutionary history without modern contraception, while it is pointed out that the notion of celibacy being impossible for men in general with only a small number of individual exceptions is incompatible with the notion of evolution making celibacy inevitable for a significant percentage of men.&lt;ref&gt;PD Lorch, L Bussière, DT Gwynne (2008) "Quantifying the potential for sexual dimorphism using upper limits on Bateman gradients"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M Ah-King, I Ahnesjö - Evolutionary biology (2013) "The “sex role” concept: an overview and evaluation"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex-role reversed species ==
The most well-known exceptions to Bateman's principle are the existence of sex-role reversed species such as pipefish ([[seahorse]]s), [[phalarope]]s and [[Jacanidae|jacana]]s in which the males perform the majority of the parental care, and are cryptic while the females are highly ornamented and territorially aggressive ({{Harvcolnb|Emlen|Oring|1977}}; {{Harvcolnb|Knowlton|1982}}; {{Harvcolnb|Berglund|Widemo|Rosenqvist|2005}}). 

In these species, however, the typical fundamental sex differences are reversed: females have a faster reproductive rate than males (and thus greater reproductive variance), and males have greater assurance of genetic parentage than do females {{Harv|Flinn|2004}}. Consequently, reversals in sex roles and reproductive variance are consistent with Bateman's principle, and with Robert Trivers's [[parental investment]] theory.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}
The '''Boehm system''' is a system of [[key (instrument)|keywork]] for the [[flute]], created by [[inventor]] and [[flautist]] [[Theobald Boehm]] between 1831 and 1847.  

Prior to the development of the Boehm system, flutes were most commonly made of wood, with an inverse conical [[bore (wind instruments)|bore]], eight keys, and [[tone hole]]s (the openings where the fingers are placed to produce specific notes) that were small in size, and thus easily covered by the fingertips.  Boehm's work was inspired by an 1831 concert in London, given by soloist [[Charles Nicholson (flautist)|Charles Nicholson]] who, with his father in the 1820s, had introduced a flute constructed with larger tone holes than were used in previous designs.  This large-holed instrument could produce greater volume of sound than other flutes, and Boehm set out to produce his own large-holed design.

In addition to large holes, Boehm provided his flute with "full venting", meaning that all keys were normally open (previously, several keys were normally closed, and opened only when the key was operated).  Boehm also wanted to locate tone holes at acoustically optimal points on the body of the instrument, rather than locations conveniently covered by the player's fingers.  To achieve these goals, Boehm adapted a system of axle-mounted keys with a series of "open rings" (called ''brille'', German for "eyeglasses", as they resembled the type of eyeglass frames common during the 19th century) that were fitted around other tone holes, such that the closure of one tone hole by a finger would also close a key placed over a second hole.

In 1832 Boehm introduced a new conical-bore flute, which achieved a fair degree of success.  Boehm, however, continued to look for ways to improve the instrument.  Finding that an increased volume of air produced a stronger and clearer tone, he replaced the conical bore with a cylindrical bore, finding that a parabolic contraction of the bore near the [[embouchure]] hole improved the instrument's [[Register (music)|low register]].  He also found that optimal tone was produced when the tone holes were too large to be covered by the fingertips, and he developed a system of finger plates to cover the holes.  These new flutes were at first made of [[silver]], although Boehm later produced wooden versions.  

The cylindrical Boehm flute was introduced in 1847, with the instrument gradually being adopted almost universally by professional and amateur players in Europe and around the world during the second half of the 19th century. The instrument was adopted for the performance of orchestral and chamber music, opera and theater, wind ensembles (e.g., military and civic bands), and most other music which might be loosely described as relating to "[[Western classical music]]" (including, for example, [[jazz]]). Many further refinements have been made, and countless design variations are common among flutes today (the "offset G" key, addition of the low B foot, etc.) The concepts of the Boehm system have been applied across the range of flutes available, including [[piccolo]]s, [[alto flute]]s, [[bass flute]]s, and so on, as well as other wind instruments. The material of the instrument may vary (many piccolos are made of wood, some very large flutes are wooden or even made of [[PVC]]).

The [[flute]] is perhaps the oldest musical instrument, other than the human voice itself. There are very many flutes, both traversely blown and end-blown "[[fipple]]" flutes, currently produced which are not built on the Boehm model.

The fingering system for the [[saxophone]] closely resembles the Boehm system. A key system inspired by Boehm's for the [[clarinet]] family is also known as the "[[Boehm system (clarinet)|Boehm system]]", although it was developed by [[Hyacinthe Klosé]] and not Boehm himself.  The Boehm system was also adapted for a small number of [[flageolet]]s. Boehm did work on a system for the [[bassoon]], and Boehm-inspired [[oboe]]s have been made, but non-Boehm systems remain predominant for these instruments. The [[Albert system]] is another key system for the clarinet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9379">{{Immanuel Kant}}

In [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s philosophy, a '''category''' ({{lang-de|Categorie}} in the [[Critique of Pure Reason|original]] or ''Kategorie'' in [[modern German]]) is a pure concept of the [[#The table of judgments|understanding]] (''Verstand''). A Kantian category is a characteristic of the appearance of any object in general, before it has been experienced. Kant wrote that "They are concepts of an object in general…."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', B129, (''Sie sind Begriffe von einem Gegenstande überhaupt'')&lt;/ref&gt; Kant also wrote that, "…pure cоncepts [Categories] of the undеrstanding which apply to objects of [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]] in general…."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 79 (''reine Verstandesbegriffe, welche a priori auf Gegenstände der Anschauung überhaupt gehen'')&lt;/ref&gt; Such a category is not a classificatory division, as the word is commonly used. It is, instead, the condition of the [[Epistemic possibility|possibility]] of objects in general,&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 139&lt;/ref&gt; that is, objects as such, any and all objects, not specific objects in particular.

== Meaning of "category" ==

The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:κατηγορία|κατηγορία]], ''katēgoria'', meaning "that which can be said, predicated, or publicly declared and asserted, about something." A category is an attribute, property, quality, or characteristic that can be predicated of a thing. "…I remark concerning the categories…that their logical employment consists in their use as predicates of objects."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[Jakob Sigismund Beck|Beck]] to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], June 20, 1797&lt;/ref&gt; Kant called them "ontological predicates."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Judgement]]'', Introduction, V&lt;/ref&gt;

A category is that which can be said of everything in general, that is, of anything that is an object. [[J.S. Mill|John Stuart Mill]] wrote: "The Categories, or Predicaments &amp;mdash; the former a Greek word, the latter its literal translation in the Latin language &amp;mdash; were believed to be an enumeration  of all things capable of being named, an enumeration by the ''summa genera'' (highest kind), i.e., the most extensive classes into which things could be distributed, which, therefore, were so many highest Predicates, one or other of which was supposed capable of being affirmed with truth of every nameable thing whatsoever."&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart, ''[[A System of Logic]]'', I, 3, §1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] had claimed that the following ten predicates or categories could be asserted of anything in general: substance, quantity, quality, relation, action, affection (passivity), place, time (date), position, and state. These are supposed to be the qualities or attributes that can be affirmed of each and every thing in experience. Any particular object that exists in thought must have been able to have the Categories attributed to it as possible predicates because the Categories are the properties, qualities, or characteristics of any possible object in general. The Categories of Aristotle and Kant are the general properties that belong to all things without expressing the peculiar nature of any particular thing. Kant appreciated Aristotle's effort, but said that his table was imperfect because " … as he had no guiding principle, he merely picked them up as they occurred to him..."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The Categories do not provide knowledge of individual, particular objects. Any object, however, must have Categories as its characteristics if it is to be an object of experience. It is presupposed or assumed that anything that is a specific object must possess Categories as its properties because Categories are predicates of an object in general. An object in general does not have all of the Categories as predicates at one time.  For example, a general object cannot have the qualitative Categories of reality and negation at the same time. Similarly, an object in general cannot have both unity and plurality as quantitative predicates at once. The Categories of Modality exclude each other. Therefore, a general object cannot simultaneously have the Categories of possibility/impossibility and existence/non&amp;ndash;existence as qualities.

Since the Categories are a list of that which can be said of every object, they are related only to human language. In making a verbal statement about an object, a speaker makes a judgment. A general object, that is, every object, has attributes that are contained in Kant's list of Categories. In a judgment, or verbal statement, the Categories are the predicates that can be asserted of every object and all objects.

==The table of judgments&lt;!--'Understanding (Kant)' redirects here--&gt;==
Kant believed that the ability of the human '''understanding'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (German: ''Verstand'', Greek: ''[[dianoia]]'' "διάνοια", Latin: ''[[ratio]]'') to think about and know an object is the same as the making of a spoken or written judgment about an object. According to him, "Our ability to judge is equivalent to our ability to think."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 80&lt;/ref&gt;
A judgment is the thought that a thing is known to have a certain quality or attribute. For example, the sentence "The rose is red" is a judgment. Kant created a table of the forms of such judgments as they relate to all objects in general.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 71&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Table of Judgements

This table of judgments was used by Kant as a model for the table of categories. Taken together, these twelvefold tables constitute the formal structure for Kant's [[Kantian architectonics|architectonic]] conception of his philosophical system.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, "The Architectonic Form of Kant's Copernican Logic", ''Metaphilosophy'' 17:4 (October 1986), pp.266-288; revised and reprinted as Chapter III of Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1 ''Kant's System of Perspectives'']: ''An architectonic interpretation of the Critical philosophy'' (Lanham: University Press of America, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schemata==
Categories are entirely different from the appearances of objects. According to Kant, in order to relate to specific phenomena, categories must be "applied" through [[time]]. The way that this is done is called a [[Schema (Kant)|schema]].

==Criticism==
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], in his [[Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy|criticism of the Kantian philosophy]], found many errors{{Examples|date=September 2018}} in Kant's use of the Categories of Quality, Quantity, Relation, and Modality. Schopenhauer also noted that in accordance with Kant's claim, non-human animals would not be able to know objects. Animals would only know impressions on their [[sense organ]]s, which Kant mistakenly{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} calls [[perception]].

'''Conceptual art''', sometimes simply called '''conceptualism''', is [[art]] in which the [[concept]](s) or [[idea]](s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], technical, and material concerns. Some works of conceptual art, sometimes called [[Installation art|installations]], may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302213039/http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|title=Wall Drawing 811 – Sol LeWitt|archivedate=2 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was fundamental to American artist [[Sol LeWitt]]'s definition of Conceptual art, one of the first to appear in print:

{{quotation|In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sol LeWitt]] "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art", ''Artforum'', June 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tony Godfrey, author of ''Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas)'' (1998), asserts that conceptual art questions the nature of art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas) |author=Godrey, Tony |year=1988 |isbn= 978-0-7148-3388-0 |publisher=London: Phaidon Press Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notion that [[Joseph Kosuth]] elevated to a definition of art itself in his seminal, early manifesto of conceptual art, ''Art after Philosophy'' (1969). The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]'s vision of Modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as [[Art &amp; Language]], [[Joseph Kosuth]] (who became the american editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]), and [[Lawrence Weiner]] began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see [[Conceptual art#Language and/as art|below]]). One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of [[physical art|material objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kosuth, ''Art After Philosophy'' (1969). Reprinted in Peter Osborne, ''Conceptual Art: Themes and Movements'', Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art &amp; Language, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]: Introduction (1969). Reprinted in Osborne (2002) p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Burn, Mel Ramsden: "Notes On Analysis" (1970). Reprinted in Osborne (2003), p. 237. E.g. "The outcome of much of the 'conceptual' work of the past two years has been to carefully clear the air of objects."&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], "conceptual art" came to denote all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211013930/http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turnerprize/history/issue_conceptual.htm ''Turner prize history: Conceptual art'' Tate gallery] tate.org.uk. Accessed August 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It could be said that one of the reasons why the term "conceptual art" has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself. As the artist [[Mel Bochner]] suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet "conceptual", it is not always entirely clear what "concept" refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with "intention". Thus, in describing or defining a [[work of art]] as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as "conceptual" with an artist's "intention".

==History==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]],'' 1917. Photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]
[[File:Art-LanguageV3No1-1974.jpg|thumb|[[Art &amp; Language]], ''[[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]'' Vol.3 Nr.1, 1974]]
The French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the [[readymade]]s, for instance. The most famous of Duchamp's readymades was ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym "R.Mutt", and submitted for inclusion in the annual, un-juried exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York (which rejected it).&lt;ref&gt;
Tony Godfrey, Conceptual Art, London: 1998. p. 28
&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object (such as a urinal) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art, nor is it unique or hand-crafted. Duchamp's relevance and theoretical importance for future "conceptualists" was later acknowledged by US artist [[Joseph Kosuth]] in his 1969 essay, ''Art after Philosophy'', when he wrote: "All art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in nature) because art only exists conceptually".

In 1956 the founder of [[Lettrism]], [[Isidore Isou]], developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. This concept, also called ''Art esthapériste'' (or "infinite-aesthetics"), derived from the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually. The current incarnation ({{as of | 2013}}) of the Isouian movement, Excoördism, self-defines as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

In 1961 the term "concept art", coined by the artist [[Henry Flynt]] in his article bearing the term as its title, appeared in a proto-[[Fluxus]] publication ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henryflynt.org/aesthetics/conart.html|title=Essay: Concept Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, it assumed a different meaning when employed by [[Joseph Kosuth]] and by the English [[Art and Language]] group, who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry, that began in [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] in 1969, into the artist's social , philosophical and psychological status. By the mid-1970s they had produced publications, indices, performances, texts and paintings to this end. In 1970 ''Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects'', the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition, took place at the [[New York Cultural Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html Artlex.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516162830/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html |date=2013-05-16 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==The critique of formalism and of the commodification of art==
Conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] as then articulated by the influential [[New York City|New York]] [[art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]]. According to Greenberg [[Modern art]] followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential, [[formalism (art)|formal]] nature of each medium. Those elements that ran counter to this nature were to be reduced. The task of painting, for example, was to define precisely what kind of object a painting truly is: what makes it a painting and nothing else. As it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied, such things as [[figurative art|figuration]], 3-D [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting, and ought to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that conceptual art continued this "dematerialization" of art by removing the need for objects altogether,&lt;ref&gt;
Lucy Lippard &amp; John Chandler, "The Dematerialization of Art", ''Art International'' 12:2, February 1968. Reprinted in Osborne (2002), p. 218
&lt;/ref&gt;
while others, including many of the artists themselves, saw conceptual art as a radical break with Greenberg's kind of formalist Modernism. Later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical, as well as a distaste for illusion. However, by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that Greenberg's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
Conceptual art also reacted against the [[commodification]] of art; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art market as the owner and distributor of art. [[Lawrence Weiner]] said: "Once you know about a work of mine you own it. There's no way I can climb inside somebody's head and remove it." Many conceptual artists' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it, e.g. photographs, written texts or displayed objects, which some might argue are not in themselves the art. It is sometimes (as in the work of [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], [[Yoko Ono]], and Weiner himself) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work, but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact. This reveals an explicit preference for the "art" side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and [[craft]], where art, unlike craft, takes place within and engages historical discourse: for example, Ono's "written instructions" make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time.

==Language and/as art==
Language was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s. Although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel, only in the 1960s did the artists [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Edward Ruscha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |title=Ed Ruscha and Photography |author= |date=March 1 – June 1, 2008 |work= |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181852/http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |archive-date=31 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], and [[Art &amp; Language]] begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means. Where previously language was presented as one kind of visual element alongside others, and subordinate to an overarching [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] (e.g. [[Synthetic Cubism]]), the conceptual artists used language in place of brush and canvas, and allowed it to signify in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rorimer, ''New Art in the Sixties and Seventies'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001; p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Of Lawrence Weiner's works Anne Rorimer writes, "The thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed, while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial, yet separate, roles."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"&gt;Rorimer, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art, a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy]], and [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[post-structuralism|post structuralist]] [[Continental philosophy]] during the middle of the twentieth century. This [[linguistic turn]] "reinforced and legitimized" the direction the conceptual artists took.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, Conceptual Art: Themes and movements, Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne (2002), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is ''post-conceptual''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in [[Como]] on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).

The American art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] points to the example of [[Roy Ascott]] who "powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology, exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories." Ascott, the British artist most closely associated with [[cybernetic art]] in England, was not included in Cybernetic Serendipity because his use of [[cybernetic]]s was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology. Conversely, although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy, "The Construction of Change" (1964), was quoted on the dedication page (to Sol Lewitt) of [[Lucy R. Lippard]]'s seminal ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972'', Ascott's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in Britain has received scant recognition, perhaps (and ironically) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology. Another vital intersection was explored in Ascott's use of the thesaurus in 1963 [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_shanken.html], which drew an explicit parallel between the taxonomic qualities of verbal and visual languages – a concept would be taken up in Joseph Kosuth's ''Second Investigation, Proposition 1'' (1968) and Mel Ramsden's ''Elements of an Incomplete Map'' (1968).

==Conceptual art and artistic skill==
[[Image:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|300px|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]]. 1973]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By adopting language as their exclusive medium, Weiner, Barry, Wilson, Kosuth and Art &amp; Language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An important difference between conceptual art and more "traditional" forms of art-making goes to the question of artistic skill. Although skill in the handling of traditional media often plays little role in conceptual art, it is difficult to argue that no skill is required to make conceptual works, or that skill is always absent from them. [[John Baldessari]], for instance, has presented realist pictures that he commissioned professional sign-writers to paint; and many conceptual performance artists (e.g. [[Stelarc]], [[Marina Abramović]]) are technically accomplished performers and skilled manipulators of their own bodies. It is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional, modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Contemporary influence==
The first wave of the "conceptual art" movement extended from approximately 1967 to 1978. Early "concept" artists like [[Henry Flynt]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], and [[Ray Johnson]] influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual art. Conceptual artists like [[Dan Graham]], [[Hans Haacke]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]] have proven very influential on subsequent artists, and well known contemporary artists such as [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]] or [[Tracey Emin]] are sometimes labeled "second- or third-generation" conceptualists, or "[[post-conceptual]]" artists.

Many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement have been taken up by contemporary artists. While they may or may not term themselves "conceptual artists", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art|electronic]]/[[digital art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptual Art – The Art Story|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-conceptual-art.htm|website=theartstory.org|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1917 : ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], described in an article in ''[[The Independent]]'' as the invention of conceptual art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hensher |first=Philip |title=The loo that shook the world: Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabi |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-and-architecture/features/the-loo-that-shook-the-world-duchamp-man-ray-picabi-784384.html |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' (''Extra'') |date=2008-02-20 |pages=2–5 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1953 : [[Robert Rauschenberg]] creates ''[[Erased De Kooning Drawing]]'', a drawing by [[Willem de Kooning]] which Rauschenberg erased. It raised many questions about the fundamental nature of art, challenging the viewer to consider whether erasing another artist's work could be a creative act, as well as whether the work was only "art" because the famous Rauschenberg had done it.
* 1955 : Rhea Sue Sanders creates her first text pieces of the series ''pièces de complices'', combining visual art with poetry and philosophy, and introducing the concept of complicity: the viewer must accomplish the art in her/his imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Bénédicte Demelas: Des mythes et des réalitées de l'avant-garde française. Presses universitaires de Rennes, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1956 : [[Isidore Isou]] introduces the concept of infinitesimal art in ''Introduction à une esthétique imaginaire'' (''Introduction to Imaginary Aesthetics'').
* 1957: [[Yves Klein]], ''Aerostatic Sculpture (Paris)''. This was composed of 1001 blue balloons released into the sky from [[Galerie Iris Clert]] to promote his ''Proposition Monochrome; Blue Epoch'' exhibition. Klein also exhibited 'One Minute Fire Painting' which was a blue panel into which 16 firecrackers were set. For his next major exhibition, ''The Void'' in 1958, Klein declared that his paintings were now invisible and to prove it he exhibited an empty room.
* 1958: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Das Theater ist auf der Straße''/''The theater is on the street''. The first [[Happening]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-morsbroich.de/index.php?id=vorschau&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_mbausstellungen_pi1%5Bexhibition%5D=40&amp;ftu=17c0865f7589ebcedf2cba1501860715|title=Vorschau – Museum Morsbroich|author=ChewingTheSun|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1960: [[Yves Klein]]'s action called ''A Leap Into The Void'', in which he attempts to fly by leaping out of a window. He stated: "The painter has only to create one masterpiece, himself, constantly."
* 1960: The artist Stanley Brouwn declares that all the shoe shops in Amsterdam constitute an exhibition of his work.
* 1961: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Cityrama'', in Cologne was the first Happening in Germany.
* 1961: [[Robert Rauschenberg]] sent a telegram to the [[Galerie Iris Clert]] which said: 'This is a portrait of [[Iris Clert]] if I say so.' as his contribution to an exhibition of portraits.
* 1961: [[Piero Manzoni]] exhibited ''[[Artist's Shit]]'', tins purportedly containing his own [[feces]] (although since the work would be destroyed if opened, no one has been able to say for sure). He put the tins on sale for their own weight in gold. He also sold his own breath (enclosed in balloons) as ''[[Corpo d'aria|Bodies of Air]]'', and signed people's bodies, thus declaring them to be living works of art either for all time or for specified periods. (This depended on how much they are prepared to pay). [[Marcel Broodthaers]] and [[Primo Levi]] are amongst the designated 'artworks'.
* 1962: Artist Barrie Bates rebrands himself as [[Billy Apple]], erasing his original identity to continue his exploration of everyday life and commerce as art. By this stage, many of his works are fabricated by third parties.&lt;ref name="Byrt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrt|first=Anthony|title=Brand, new|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/brand-new/|work=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1962: [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]]'s ''Iron Curtain'' work. This consists of a barricade of oil barrels in a narrow Paris street which caused a large traffic jam. The artwork was not the barricade itself but the resulting traffic jam.
* 1962: [[Yves Klein]] presents ''[[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle|Immaterial Pictorial Sensitivity]]'' in various ceremonies on the banks of the Seine. He offers to sell his own 'pictorial sensitivity' (whatever that was, he did not define it) in exchange for gold leaf. In these ceremonies the purchaser gave Klein the gold leaf in return for a certificate. Since Klein's sensitivity was immaterial, the purchaser was then required to burn the certificate whilst Klein threw half the gold leaf into the Seine. (There were seven purchasers.)
* 1962: [[Piero Manzoni]] created ''The Base of the World'', thereby exhibiting the entire planet as his artwork.
* 1962: FLUXUS Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik in [[Wiesbaden]] with, [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Nam June Paik]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus at 50''. Stefan Fricke, Alexander Klar, Sarah Maske, Kerber Verlag, 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-86678-700-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1963: [[George Brecht]]'s collection of Event-Scores, ''[[Water Yam (artist's multiple)|Water Yam]]'', is published as the first ''Fluxkit'' by [[George Maciunas]]. 
* 1963: Festum Fluxorum Fluxus in [[Düsseldorf]] with [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Ben Patterson]], [[Emmett Williams]] and others.
* 1963: [[Henry Flynt]]s article ''Concept Art'' is published in ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''; a collection of artworks and concepts by artists and musicians that was published by [[Jackson Mac Low]] and [[La Monte Young]] (ed.). ''An Anthology of Chance Operations'' documented the development of [[Dick Higgins]] vision of [[intermedia]] art in the context of the ideas of [[John Cage]] and became an early [[Fluxus]] masterpiece. Flynt's "concept art" devolved from his idea of "cognitive nihilism" and from his insights about the vulnerabilities of logic and mathematics.
* 1964: [[Yoko Ono]] publishes ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings]]''. An example of Heuristic art, or a series of instructions for how to obtain an aesthetic experience.
* 1965: [[Art &amp; Language]] founder Michael Baldwin ''Mirror Piece''. Instead of paintings, the work is showing a variable number of mirrors that challenge both the visitor and [[Clement Greenberg]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tate|title=Art &amp; Language – Conceptual Art, Mirrors and Selfies {{!}} TateShots|date=2016-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-klDfurJM5Y|accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1965: A complex conceptual art piece by [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] called ''Still and Chew''. He invites art students to protest against the values of [[Clement Greenberg]]'s ''Art and Culture'', much praised and taught at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London, where Latham taught part-time. Pages of Greenberg's book (borrowed from the college library) are chewed by the students, dissolved in acid and the resulting solution returned to the library bottled and labelled. Latham was then fired from his part-time position.
* 1965: with ''Show V, immaterial sculpture'' the Dutch artist [[Marinus Boezem]] introduced Conceptual Art in the Netherlands. In the show various air doors are placed where people can walk through them. People have the sensory experience of warmth, air. Three invisible air doors, which arise as currents of cold and warm are blown into the room, are indicated in the space with bundles of arrows and lines. The articulation of the space which arises is the result of invisible processes which influence the conduct of persons in that space, and who are included in the system as co-performers.
* [[Joseph Kosuth]] dates the concept of ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'' in the year 1965. The presentation of the work consists of a chair, its photo and a blow up of a definition of the word "chair". Kosuth has chosen the definition from a dictionary. Four versions with different definitions are known.
* 1966: Conceived in 1966 ''The Air Conditioning Show'' of [[Art &amp; Language]] is published as an article in 1967 in the November issue of ''Arts Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/air-conditioning-show-air-show-frameworks-1966-67-al0481|title=Air-Conditioning Show / Air Show / Frameworks 1966–67|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1966: [[N.E. Thing Co.]] Ltd. (Iain and Ingrid Baxter of Vancouver) exhibited ''Bagged Place'' the contents of a four-room apartment wrapped in plastic bags. The same year they registered as a corporation and subsequently organized their practice along corporate models, one of the first international examples of the "aesthetic of administration".
* 1967: [[Mel Ramsden]] first ''100% Abstract Paintings''. The painting shows a list of chemical components that constitute the substance of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/exhibition-art-language-uncompleted/1/exhibitions/expo|title=ART &amp; LANGUAGE UNCOMPLETED|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1967: [[Sol LeWitt]]'s ''Paragraphs on Conceptual Art'' were published by the American art journal ''[[Artforum]]''. The ''Paragraphs'' mark the progression from Minimal to Conceptual Art.
* 1968: Michael Baldwin, [[Terry Atkinson]], [[David Bainbridge]] and [[Harold Hurrell]] found [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/culture/stories/2003/04/art-and-language.shtml|title=BBC – Coventry and Warwickshire Culture – Art and Language|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1968: [[Lawrence Weiner]] relinquishes the physical making of his work and formulates his "Declaration of Intent", one of the most important conceptual art statements following LeWitt's "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art." The declaration, which underscores his subsequent practice reads: "1. The artist may construct the piece. 2. The piece may be fabricated. 3. The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership."
* Friedrich Heubach launches the magazine ''Interfunktionen'' in Cologne, Germany, a publication that excelled in artists' projects. It originally showed a Fluxus influence, but later moved toward Conceptual art.
* 1969: The first generation of New York [[alternative exhibition space]]s are established, including [[Billy Apple]]'s APPLE, Robert Newman's Gain Ground, where [[Vito Acconci]] produced many important early works, and 112 Greene Street.&lt;ref name="Byrt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terroni|first=Christelle|title=The Rise and Fall of Alternative Spaces|url=http://www.booksandideas.net/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Alternative.html|work=books&amp;ideas.net|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1969: [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]]'s ''Telepathic Piece'' at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, of which he said 'During the exhibition I will try to communicate telepathically a work of art, the nature of which is a series of thoughts that are not applicable to language or image'.
* 1969: The first issue of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] is published in May. It is subtitled as ''The Journal of conceptual art'' and edited by Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin and Harold Hurrell. [[Art &amp; Language]] are the editors of this first number, and by the second number and until 1972, [[Joseph Kosuth]] will join and become the american editor.
* 1969: [[Vito Acconci]] creates ''Following Piece'', in which he follows randomly selected members of the public until they disappear into a private space. The piece is presented as photographs.
* The English journal ''Studio International'' published [[Joseph Kosuth]]´s article "Art after Philosophy" in three parts (October–December). It became the most discussed article on "Conceptual Art".
* 1970: [[Ian Burn]], [[Mel Ramsden]] and [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]] join [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;
* 1970: Painter [[John Baldessari]] exhibits a film in which he sets a series of erudite statements by Sol LeWitt on the subject of conceptual art to popular tunes like "Camptown Races" and "Some Enchanted Evening".
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] exhibits a series of photographs which were taken every two minutes whilst driving along a road for 24 minutes.
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] asks museum visitors to write down 'one authentic secret'. The resulting 1800 documents are compiled into a book which, by some accounts, makes for very repetitive reading as most secrets are similar.
* 1971: [[Hans Haacke]]'s ''Real Time Social System''. This piece of [[systems art]] detailed the real estate holdings of the third largest landowners in New York City. The properties were mostly in Harlem and the [[Lower East Side]], were decrepit and poorly maintained, and represented the largest concentration of real estate in those areas under the control of a single group. The captions gave various financial details about the buildings, including recent sales between companies owned or controlled by the same family. The Guggenheim museum cancelled the exhibition, stating that the overt political implications of the work constituted "an alien substance that had entered the art museum organism". There is no evidence to suggest that the trustees of the Guggenheim were linked financially to the family which was the subject of the work.
* 1972: [[Art &amp; Language|The Art &amp; Language Institute]] exhibits ''Index 01'' at the [[Documenta 5]], an installation indexing text-works by [[Art &amp; Language]] and text-works from [[Art &amp; Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]. 
* 1972: [[Antonio Caro]] exhibits in the National Art Salon (Museo Nacional, Bogotá, Colombia) his work: ''Aquinocabeelarte'' (Art does not fit here), where each of the letters is a separate poster, and under each letter is written the name of some victim of state repression.
* 1972: [[Fred Forest]] buys an area of blank space in the newspaper ''Le Monde'' and invites readers to fill it with their own works of art.
* [[General Idea]] launch ''File'' magazine in Toronto. The magazine functioned as something of an extended, collaborative artwork.
* 1973: [[Jacek Tylicki]] lays out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.
* 1974: [[Cadillac Ranch]] near [[Amarillo]], Texas.
* 1975–76: Three issues of the journal ''The Fox'' were published by [[Art &amp; Language]] in New York by. The editor was [[Joseph Kosuth]]. ''The Fox'' became an important platform for the American members of [[Art &amp; Language]]. Karl Beveridge, Ian Burn, [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], Andrew Menard, Mel Ramsden and Terry Smith wrote articles which thematized the context of contemporary art. These articles exemplify the development of an institutional critique within the inner circle of Conceptual Art. The criticism of the art world integrates social, political and economic reasons.
* 1976: facing internal problems, members of [[Art &amp; Language]] separate. The destiny of the name [[Art &amp; Language]] remaining in Michael Baldwin, Mel Ramsden and Charles Harrison hands.
* 1977: [[Walter De Maria]]'s ''Vertical Earth Kilometer'' in [[Kassel]], Germany. This was a one kilometer brass rod which was sunk into the earth so that nothing remained visible except a few centimeters. Despite its size, therefore, this work exists mostly in the viewer's mind.
* 1977: [[John Fekner]] creates hundreds of environmental and conceptual outdoor works consisting of stenciled words, symbols, dates and icons spray painted in New York, Sweden, Canada, England and Germany.
* 1986: [[Art &amp; Language]] are nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].
* 1989: [[Christopher Williams (American artist)|Christopher Williams]]' ''Angola to Vietnam'' is first exhibited. The work consists of a series of black-and-white photographs of glass botanical specimens from the [[Botanical Museum]] at [[Harvard University]], chosen according to a list of the thirty-six countries in which political disappearances were known to have taken place during the year 1985.
* 1990: [[Ashley Bickerton]] and [[Ronald Jones (Interdisciplinarian)|Ronald Jones]] included in "Mind Over Matter: Concept and Object" exhibition of ”third generation Conceptual artists” at the Whitney Museum of American Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDA113CF93AA25753C1A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Brenson | title=Review/Art; In the Arena of the Mind, at the Whitney | date=19 October 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1991: [[Ronald Jones (Interdisciplinarian)|Ronald Jones]] exhibits objects and text, art, history and science rooted in grim political reality at [[Metro Pictures Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Roberta.

Retrieved 8 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1991: [[Charles Saatchi]] funds Damien Hirst and the next year in the [[Saatchi Gallery]] exhibits his ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'', a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine.

* 1993: [[Matthieu Laurette]] established his artistic birth certificate by taking part in a French TV game called ''Tournez manège'' (The Dating Game) where the female presenter asked him who he was, to which he replied: 'A multimedia artist'. Laurette had sent out invitations to an art audience to view the show on TV from their home, turning his staging of the artist into a performed reality.

Conceptual combination is an important concept in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].

==Mechanism==

The mechanism by which conceptual combination occurs is debatable, both on cognitive and neurological levels. As such, multiple models have been developed or applied to better define how the process occurs.&lt;ref name ="lynott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Connell | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = The effect of prosody on conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 1107–1123 | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01119.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive===

Cognitive models attempt to functionally outline the mental computation involved in conceptual combination. 
  
====Constraint Theory====

Constraint theory stipulates that the concept that results from an attempt at conceptual combination is controlled by three constraints known as diagnosticity, plausibility and informativeness. ''Diagnosticity'' refers to the a complex concept's possession of the defining properties of its component simple concepts. Because such properties are diagnostic of the component concepts, at least some of them should be diagnostic of the higher-order representations constructed from those concepts. ''Plausibility'' refers to consistency with existing knowledge and prior experience. It is based on the assumption that a complex concept should be reasonably relevant to the context in which it is used. This assumption makes the most sense in a practical, linguistic context, particularly when a speaker is catering to the understanding of the listener. ''Informativeness'' is the property of having more meaning or properties than any individual component. If a complex concept were not distinguishable from any given component, it would be identical to that component. Because nothing can logically be both a component of something and the totality of something simultaneously, a complex concept must at least be the sum of its parts. Many argue that the interaction among component concepts should allow a complex concept to be greater than that sum.  If multiple possible ways to structure or interpret a complex concept exist, the one which best satisfies or most satisfies these constraints is the one which will be used. The paradigm upon which constraint theory is based is computational, and therefore views the mind as a processor which operates on the basis of standard problem-solving protocols (i.e. [[algorithms]] and [[heuristics]]).&lt;ref name = ck2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costello | first1 = F. J. | last2 = Keane | first2 = M. T. | year = 2000 | title = Efficient creativity: Constraint-guided conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 299–349 | doi = 10.1016/S0364-0213(00)00020-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spreading Activation====

The [[spreading activation]] model is a model in [[connectionism|connectionist]] theory sometimes designed to represent how concepts are activated in relation to one another. Though it is typically applied to information search processes like recognition, [[brainstorming]], and recall, it can be used to explain how concepts are combined as well as connected.&lt;ref name="bd1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balota | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Duchek | first2 = J. M. | year = 1988 | title = Age-related differences in lexical access, spreading activation, and simple pronunciation | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 84–93 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.3.1.84 | pmid = 3268246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spreading activation models represent memory and knowledge as a network of interlinked concepts. Every concept manifests as a node within this network, with related nodes/concepts linked to one another with connections. Concepts that are more strongly associated with one another either in terms of content or an individual's past experience are correspondingly more strongly linked.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;

When one concept is employed in [[working memory]], the corresponding node is also activated. This activation spreads through the node's links, making it easier to activate nodes to which the activated node is connected. This spreading activation stimulates the linked nodes, pressuring them to activate to an extent proportional to the strength of the connection between the stimulating node and the stimulated node. If sufficient net stimulation is accrued through a stimulated node's links, it will also activate. Thus, being connected to an activated node makes it easier for an inactive node to become active as well; concepts become more readily accessed when individuals are stimulated with related concepts first. This increase in ease of access is known as "priming.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;"

Spreading activation models tend to imply that processing concepts occurs in series; that is, each concept is processed one-at-a-time, one after the other. As such, individuals tend to combine concepts more readily, easily, and quickly if they are more closely linked within the network of concepts. This implication, however, has caused spreading activation to come under a great deal of criticism, particularly with respect to how the concept is employed in feature theories.

====Feature-Based Theories====

The features and properties of complex concepts are generally assumed to be derived from the simple concepts that compose them. One popularly discussed model involves a two-stage serial process. In the initial stage, features from each of the component simple concepts are retrieved from memory through spreading activation. This allows a complex concept to accrue features with existing relationships with its component simple concepts. During this stage, the basic definition of what the complex concept is and/or means is generates. In the second stage, knowledge and reasoning are employed upon the features accrued in the previous stage to generate further features.&lt;ref name="spring"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Springer | first1 = K. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = G. L. | year = 1992 | title = Feature availability in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 111–117 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1992.tb00008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one might reason that the complex concept "white jacket," if worn in a blizzard, would make one difficult to see; it would follow that one should ascribe the property of "good for winter camouflage," despite the fact that this property is not closely attached to the component concepts "white" nor "jacket." This stage is especially useful when properties of complex concepts contradict those of their component concepts, such as the different colours of milk and chocolate milk.

This model, however, has come under criticism due to its inconsistency with empirical studies. If conceptual combination employed serial  spreading activation, for instance, it should take longer to verify the properties of complex concepts, as they necessarily possess more concepts than their component simple concepts. Research has nonetheless shown that it takes less time to confirm complex concepts' properties than their components and about equal time to reject false properties for both. This occurred even when the properties of the complex concept contradicted those of the simple concepts. Likewise, when experiment participants are exposed to a set of features first, and then asked to verify whether or not they correspond to simple or complex concepts, the participants tend to provide correct verification answers for the complex concepts more quickly.&lt;ref name=spring /&gt;

===Neurological===

The neurological basis of conceptual combination has received considerably less attention than its cognitive basis.&lt;ref name = "bo2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Osherson | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Evidence for conceptual combination in the left anterior temporal lobe | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 1847–1852 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, research has revealed several specific brain regions that are intimately involved if not entirely responsible for neural processing involved in conceptual combination.&lt;ref name=bo2011 /&gt;

Of particular relevance is the left anterior [[temporal lobe]]. Studies have previously demonstrated an additive effect for stimulation in this subsection of neural cortex tissue. When experiment participants were verbally presented with certain simple concepts, the processing of the information causes electrical stimulation in the region. When the same participants were verbally presented with a single complex concept formed from the combination of the aforementioned simple concepts, the stimulation recorded was equivalent to the sum of the stimulation that resulted from each individual component simple concept. In other words, the stimulation caused by a complex concept is equivalent to the total stimulation caused by its component concepts. More recent data contradicts those results by indicating a multiplicative effect in which the activation caused by a complex concept is the product of the activation levels caused by its component concepts, rather than the sum.&lt;ref name = bo2011 /&gt;

Further support for the role of the left anterior temporal lobe has been previously established through neuropsychological studies. [[Semantic dementia]] is a disorder in which conceptual manipulation, including conceptual combination, is hindered. These indicate that the neural damage associated with semantic dementia occurs within this brain region. Unfortunately, neuropsychological studies that attempt to replicate this pattern have failed, leading uncertainty as to whether initial results were valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahon | first1 = B. Z. | last2 = Caramazza | first2 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Concepts and categories: A cognitive neuropsychological perspective | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 27–51 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163532 | pmid=18767921 | pmc=2908258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

As [[language]] is the means by which concepts are communicated and expressed, the processed involved in linguistic expression and interpretation are heavily intertwined with combined concepts. Many theories of concept combination mechanisms, including constraint theory&lt;ref name=ck2000 /&gt; were developed within the context of language, and therefore make more sense when applied in a linguistic context. Study into the linguistic aspects of concept combination as has generally been focused on the interpretation mechanism.

===Lexical Concepts===

A concept that can be expressed using a single word is called a ''lexical concept.'' A lexical concept is usually treated as a basic concept, although it can just as easily be a complex concept.

Two lexical concepts are often used together as phrases to represent a combined concept of greater specificity. This is most readily seen in the use of [[adjective]]s to modify [[noun]]s and the use of [[adverb]]s to modify [[verb]]s and adjectives. Consider, for example, phrases such as "burnt toast," "eat roughly," and "readily loved." Multiple noun lexical concepts can also be used together in order to represent combined concepts.  Through this process, a limited pool of nouns can be used to produce an exponentially larger pool of phrases such as "sound wave," "video game," and "sleeping pill."&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, G. L. &amp; Myers, T. F. (1988). Concept combination and the characterization of lexical concepts. In W. Hüllen, &amp; R. Schulze (Eds.), (pp. 292-302) Niemeyer. {{DOI|10.1515/9783111355191.292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===

In addition to constraint theory, there are two principal theories surrounding the mechanism by which noun-noun combinations are [[semantics|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Tagalakis | first2 = G. | last3 = Keane | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Conceptual Combination with PUNC | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence Review | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 353–374 | doi = 10.1007/s10462-004-5219-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these is ''dual-process theory.'' Dual-process theory proposed that there are two means by which people interpreted noun-noun phrases. ''Relational interpretation'' attempts to establish a relationship between the nouns and interprets the combined phrase in terms of that relationship. For example, one might relationally interpret the phrase "snake mouse" to refer to a mouse meant to be eaten by snakes, as the two concepts have a predatory relationship. ''Property interpretation'' identifies properties associated with the first noun and then applies them onto the second noun. In this case the phrase "snake mouse" might be interpreted as a mouse with poisonous fangs or an elongated body.&lt;ref name= wiz1998&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wisniewski | first1 = E. J. | year = 1998 | title = Property instantiation in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 1330–1347 | doi = 10.3758/BF03201205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second principal theory is known as the ''Competition in Relations among Nominals'' theory. It states that the assumed modification effect of a noun on its partner in a novel noun-noun combination is the one which it has been seen to employ most often in the past. For example, "chocolate cat" is usually interpreted as "a cat made of chocolate" rather than "a chocolate-eating cat" simply because the "made of" modifier is heavily conditioned to be associated with "chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;Gagne, C. L. (2002). The competition-among-relations-in-nominals theory of conceptual combination: Implications for stimulus class formation and class expansion. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 78 (3), 551-65. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/214835280&lt;/ref&gt;"

Explanations of linguistic expression of complex concepts have been linked to [[spreading activation]] models. When an individual identifies a lexical concept through vision or hearing, the corresponding node in that individual's cognitive network is said to activate. This makes it easier for lexical concepts linked to the activated concept to be comprehended, as they are primed. This is consistent with current empirical data, which shows that when individuals are interpreting sentences, they process the linguistic content more quickly when several related words follow one another. In turn, it becomes easier for people to combine these related concepts together and understand them as a relationship, rather than two distinct entities.&lt;ref name="ews2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elvevåg | first1 = B. | last2 = Wisniewski | first2 = E. | last3 = Storms | first3 = G. | year = 2010 | title = Conceptual combination and language in schizophrenia | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 120 | issue = 1–3| pages = 238–239 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2010.04.006 | pmid=20452747 | pmc=2900465}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the example, "John spread butter on a bagel." In this sentence, the lexical concepts "spread," "butter," and "bagel" are associated with one another and easy to combine into a mental representation of a breakfast scenario. Conversely, consider the example, "John baked a computer." Because "baked" and "computer" are not related lexical concepts, it takes more effort and time to build a mental representation of this unusual scenario.

However, spreading activation models of conceptual combination have been criticized in light of how humans have been observed to combined languages. Those who claim that the theory provides an insufficient account of linguistic conceptual combination refer to the ability of humans to readily understand lexical concept combinations with seemingly no apparent connection with one another. One example of this would be the sentence "John saw an elephant cloud." "Elephant" and "cloud" do not shared a close association, but it takes little effort to comprehend that the term "elephant cloud" refers to a cloud shaped like an elephant. This has led some to conclude that the combination of lexical concepts does not wholly rely on the simultaneous activation of linked lexical concepts alone. Rather, they claim that the process involves the use of existing nodes to generate entirely new concepts independent of their parent concepts.&lt;ref name="ews2010"/&gt;

====Social Context====

Although many theories of  novel noun-noun combination interpretation ignore the effect of social environment, some theorists have attempted to account for any contingencies social context may cause.

When lexical concept combinations are interpreted without the influence of social context, the interpretation carried out is termed ''sense generation.'' This includes all processes that would normally occur excepting those dependent on a conversation partner. The ''generation hypothesis'' accordingly states that the interpretation mechanism of a noun-noun combination is essentially the same regardless of context. This does not rule out the possibility that social context can affect sense generation in some way, but it does assert that the basic structure of the process is unaffected. As seen above, debate as to what sense generation entails and how many sub-processes into which it should be divided is a contentious matter in cognitive science.&lt;ref name="vlw"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Middleton | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Rawson | first2 = K. A. | last3 = Wisniewski | first3 = E. J. | year = 2011 | title = How do we process novel conceptual combinations in context? | url = | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 807–822 | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2010.520414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[anaphor]] resolution hypothesis'' instead asserts that before sense generation occurs, interpreters first search their memory of recent communication to see if the combination refers to something previously discussed. This process is termed ''anaphor resolution'.' If a referent is identified, interpretation occurs without sense generation in light of that referent. Even if an explicit referent does not exist, anaphor resolution can help facilitate sense generation by providing more information that might hint at the combination's intended meaning.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

The ''dual-process hypothesis'' not to be confused with dual-process theory, states that sense generation and anaphor resolution occur in parallel. Both processes begin to work once the noun-noun combination is presented. Proponents of this hypothesis disagree as to how the interpretation is eventually resolves. Some believe that whichever process reaches a conclusion first provides the answer. Others believe that both provide continuous input to a third, mediating process that eventually makes a decision based on input from both.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

==Creativity==

[[Creativity]] necessitates the employment of existing concepts in novel ways, and therefore requires conceptual combination. Surprisingly, this contribution seems to be limited. Conceptual combination is a significant contributor to [[convergent thinking]], but not [[divergent thinking]]. For example, practice with generating new concepts through combination does not improve brainstorming. It does, however, assist in devising creative problem solving methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohn | first1 = N. W. | last2 = Paulus | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Korde | first3 = R. M. | year = 2011 | title = Conceptual combinations and subsequent creativity | url = | journal = Creativity Research Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1080/10400419.2011.595659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational applications==

The psychological community's growing understanding of how concepts are manipulated has allowed educators to teach new concepts more effectively. Tools that are developed based on conceptual combination theory attempt to teach individual tasks, and then challenge students to exercise them together in order to promote both base subject skills and the critical thinking needed to apply them simultaneously to [[problem solving|solve new problems]]. Máder &amp; Vajda, for instance, developed a three-dimensional grid with cells of adjustable height which has been successfully used in numerous activities capable of improving the effectiveness of high school [[mathematics education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Máder | first1 = A. | last2 = Vajda | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Elementary approaches to the teaching of the combinatorial problem of rectangular islands | url = | journal = International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 267–281 | doi = 10.1007/s10758-010-9171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''disquotational principle''' is a philosophical [[theorem]]{{Citation needed|reason=What/where is the proof?|date=January 2018}} which holds that a rational speaker will accept "''p''" if and only if he or she believes ''p''. The quotes indicate that the statement ''p'' [[use–mention distinction|is being treated as a sentence, and not as a proposition]]. This principle is presupposed by claims that hold that [[First-order_logic#Equality_and_its_axioms|substitution]] fails in certain [[intension]]al contexts.

==Overview==
Consider the following argument:
:(1) Sally accepts the assertion that "[[Cicero]] was a famous [[orator]]" while dissenting from the assertion that "Tully was a famous [[orator]]".
:(2) Cicero is Tully
:Therefore, (3) Sally believes that Tully was a famous orator.

To derive (3), we have to assume that when Sally accepts that "Cicero was a famous orator", she believes that Cicero was a famous orator. Then we can exchange Cicero for Tully, and derive (3). [[Bertrand Russell]] thought that this demonstrated the failure of substitutivity of identicals in [[intension]]al contexts.

In "A Puzzle about Belief,"&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. "A Puzzle about Belief." First appeared in, ''Meaning and Use''. ed., A. Margalit. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1979. pp. 239–283&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Kripke]] argues that the application of the disquotational theorem can yield a paradox on its own, without appeal to the substitution principle, and that this may show that the problem lies with the former, and not the latter. There are various formulations of this argument.

Suppose that, Pierre, a Frenchman, comes to believe that (1) "''Londres est jolie''" (London is pretty), without ever having visited the city. Later in life, Pierre ends up living in London. He finds no French speakers there (he does not speak English yet), and everyone refers to the city as "London," not ''Londres''. He finds this city decidedly unattractive, for the neighborhood he decides to live in is decidedly unattractive. Over time, he learns English, and formulates the belief that (2) "''London is not pretty''". Pierre never realizes that London is the English word for ''Londres''. Now with the disquotational principle, we can deduce from (1) that Pierre believes the proposition that ''Londres est jolie''. With a weak principle of translation (e.g., "a proposition in language A is the same as a semantically identical proposition in language B" [note that a proposition is not the same as a sentence]), we can now deduce that Pierre believes that London is pretty. But we can also deduce from (2) and the disquotational principle that Pierre believes that London is not pretty. These deductions can be made ''even though Pierre has made no logical blunders in forming his beliefs''. Without the disquotational principle, this contradiction could not be derived, because we would not be able to assume that (1) and (2) meant anything in particular.

This paradox can also be derived without appeal to another language. Suppose that Pierre assents to the proposition that "[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] had musical talent", perhaps having heard that this man was a famous pianist. With the disquotational principle, we can deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had musical talent. Now suppose that Pierre overhears a friend discussing the political exploits of a certain statesman, [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]], without knowing that the two Paderewskis are the same man. Pierre's background tells him that statesmen are generally not very gifted in music, and this leads him to the belief that Paderewski had no musical talent. The disquotation principle allows us to deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had no musical talent. Using this principle, we have now deduced that Pierre believes that Paderewski had musical talent, and does not believe that Paderewski had musical talent, ''even though Pierre's beliefs were formed logically''.

{{English grammar}}
A '''double negative''' is a grammatical construction occurring when two forms of [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]] are used in the same sentence. '''Multiple negation''' is the more general term referring to the occurrence of more than one negative in a [[clause]]. In some languages, double negatives cancel one another and produce an affirmative; in other languages, doubled negatives intensify the negation. Languages where multiple negatives affirm each other are said to have '''negative concord''' or '''emphatic negation'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wouden|first1=Ton van der|title=Negative Contexts: Collocation, Polarity and Multiple Negation|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134773336|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d72GAgAAQBAJ&amp;&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and some  dialects of [[English language|English]], such as [[African-American Vernacular English]], are examples of negative-concord languages,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} while [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]] do not have negative concord. It is cross-linguistically observed that negative-concord languages are more common than those without.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Languages without negative concord typically have [[negative polarity]] items that are used in place of additional negatives when another negating word already occurs.  Examples are "ever", "anything" and "anyone" in the sentence "I haven't ever owed anything to anyone" (cf. "I have&lt;u&gt;''n't''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;''never''&lt;/u&gt; owed &lt;u&gt;''nothing''&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;''no one''&lt;/u&gt;" in negative-concord dialects of English, and "&lt;u&gt;''Nunca''&lt;/u&gt; devi &lt;u&gt;''nada''&lt;/u&gt; a &lt;u&gt;''ninguém''&lt;/u&gt;" in Portuguese, lit. "Never have I owed nothing to no one", or "&lt;u&gt;''Non''&lt;/u&gt; ho &lt;u&gt;''mai''&lt;/u&gt; dovuto &lt;u&gt;''nulla''&lt;/u&gt; a &lt;u&gt;''nessuno''&lt;/u&gt;" in Italian).  Note that negative polarity can be triggered not only by direct negatives such as "not" or "never", but also by words such as "doubt" or "hardly" ("I doubt he has ever owed anything to anyone" or "He has hardly ever owed anything to anyone").

Stylistically, in English, double negatives can sometimes be used for affirmation (e.g. "I'm not feeling not good"), an  [[understatement]] of the positive ("I'm feeling good").  The rhetorical term for this is [[litotes]].

When two negatives are used in one independent clause, in standard English the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative:{{rp|see the Robert Lowth citation below}} this is known as [[litotes]]. However, depending on how such a sentence is constructed, in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence. For this reason, it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one's speech is lost. A double negative intensifier does not necessarily require the prescribed steps, and can easily be ascertained by the mood or intonation of the speaker.
* ''There isn't no other way.''

vs.
* ''There isn't no other way!''

These two sentences would be different in how they are communicated by speech. Any assumption would be correct, and the first sentence can be just as right or wrong in intensifying a negative as it is in cancelling it out; thereby rendering the sentence's meaning ambiguous. Since there is no adverb or verb to support the latter negative, the usage here is ambiguous and lies totally on the context behind the sentence. In light of punctuation, the second sentence can be viewed as the intensifier; and the former being a statement thus an admonishment.
&lt;!-- The following is a clever anecdote but not directly relevant --&gt;
&lt;!-- The context-dependent nature of this rhetorical device in English is illustrated in a well-known linguistic anecdote. Oxford philosopher of language [[J. L. Austin]] gave a lecture in which he noted that there are many languages wherein a double negative makes a positive, but none in which a double positive makes a negative.  From the audience, Columbia philosopher [[Sidney Morgenbesser]] replied, "Yeah, yeah."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001314.html|title=IF P, SO WHY NOT Q?|work=Language Log|author=[[Mark Liberman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

In [[standard written English|Standard English]], two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive. This rule was observed as early as 1762, when Bishop [[Robert Lowth]] wrote ''A Short Introduction to English Grammar with Critical Notes''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last = Fromkin|first = Victoria |author2=Rodman, Robert |author3=Hyams, Nina|title = An Introduction to Language, Seventh Edition|publisher = Heinle|year = 2002|page = 15|isbn = 0-15-508481-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, "I do not disagree" could mean "I certainly agree",  "I agree", "I sort of agree", "I don't understand your point of view", "I have no opinion", and so on; it is a form of "[[weasel word]]s". Further statements are necessary to resolve which particular meaning was intended.

This is opposed to the single negative "I do not agree", which typically means "I disagree". However,  the statement "I do not completely disagree" is a similar double negative to "I do not disagree" but needs little or no clarification.

With the meaning "I completely agree", Lowth would have been referring to [[litotes]] wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out. However, the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work, which could also imply he wanted either usage of double negatives abolished. Because of this ambiguity, double negatives are frequently employed when making [[back-handed compliments]]. The phrase "Mr. Jones was not incompetent." will seldom mean "Mr. Jones was very competent" since the speaker would have found a more flattering way to say so. Instead, some kind of problem is implied, though Mr. Jones possesses basic competence at his tasks.

===Two or more negatives resolving to a negative===
[[File:friar-canterbury-tales.jpg|thumb|right|The Friar from the [[Ellesmere Chaucer|Ellesmere Manuscript]] of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]’s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'']]
Discussing English grammar, the term "double negative" is often&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition. Op. cit. [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/double+negative Merriam-Webster Online]. Accessed 29 Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; though not universally&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/double+negative The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language], 4th ed. Houghton Mifflin Co, 2009. Accessed 29 Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/double-negative |title=double negative |work=Memidex/WordNet Dictionary |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied to the [[Standard English|non-standard]] use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation.

Double negatives are usually associated with regional and ethnical dialects such as [[Southern American English]], [[African American Vernacular English]], and various British regional dialects. Indeed, they were used in [[Middle English]]. Historically, [[Chaucer]] made extensive use of double, triple, and even quadruple negatives in his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. About the Friar, he writes "Ther nas no man no wher so vertuous" ("There never was no man nowhere so virtuous"). About the Knight, "He nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde / In all his lyf unto no maner wight" ("He never yet no vileness didn't say / In all his life to no manner of man").

Following the [[battle of Marston Moor]], [[Oliver Cromwell]] quoted his nephew's dying words in a letter to the boy's father [[Valentine Walton]]: "A little after, he said one thing lay upon his spirit. I asked him what it was. He told me it was that God had not suffered him to be no more the executioner of His enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Cromwell Lord Protector'', at 129, Primus, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-917657-90-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=088_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=God+had+not+suffered+him&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IL07T6XbOqG90AG75pmqCw&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=God%20had%20not%20suffered%20him&amp;f=false John Forster], ''Statesmen of the Commonwealth of England with a Treatise on the Popular Progress in English History'', pp. 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this particular letter has often been reprinted, it is frequently changed to read "not ... to be any more" instead.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Whereas some double negatives may resolve to a positive, in some dialects others resolve to intensify the negative clause within a sentence. For example:
* ''I didn't go nowhere today.
* ''I'm not hungry no more.
* ''You don't know nothing.
* ''There was never no more laziness at work than before.

In contrast, some double negatives become positives:
* ''I didn't '''not''' go to the park today.
* ''We can't '''not''' go to sleep!

The key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives. If a verb is present between the two, the latter negative becomes an intensifier which does not negate the former.  In the first example, the verb ''to go'' separates the two negatives; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb.  Indeed, the word 'nowhere' is thus being used as an [[adverb]] and does not negate the argument of the sentence. One interesting thing to note is that double negatives such as ''I don't want to know no more'' contrasts with Romance languages such as French in ''Je ne veux pas savoir.'' &lt;ref&gt;See the article regarding Romance languages explaining this form of double negation.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception is when the second negative is stressed, as in ''I'm not doing {{em|nothing}}; I'm thinking.''  A sentence can otherwise usually only become positive through consecutive uses of negatives, such as those prescribed in the later examples, where a clause is void of a verb and lacks an adverb to intensify it.  Two of them also use emphasis to make the meaning clearer. The last example is a popular example of a double negative that resolves to a positive. This is because the verb 'to doubt' has no intensifier which effectively resolves a sentence to a positive. Had we added an adverb thus:
* ''I have no doubt never this sentence is false.''

Then what happens is that the verb ''to doubt'' becomes intensified, which indeed deduces that the sentence is indeed false since nothing was resolved to a positive. The same applies to the third example, where the adverb 'more' merges with the prefix ''no-'' to become a negative word, which when combined with the sentence's former negative only acts as an intensifier to the verb ''hungry''. Where people think that the sentence ''I'm not hungry no more'' resolves to a positive is where the latter negative ''no'' becomes an adjective which only describes its suffix counterpart ''more'' which effectively becomes a noun, instead of an adverb. This is a valid argument since adjectives do indeed describe the nature of a noun; yet some fail to take into account that the phrase ''no more'' is only an adverb and simply serves as an intensifier. Another argument used to support the position double negatives aren't acceptable is a mathematical analogy: negating a negative number results in a positive one; e.g., {{nowrap|1=− −2 = +2}}; therefore, it is argued, ''I did not go nowhere'' resolves to ''I went somewhere''.

Other forms of double negatives, which are popular to this day and do strictly enhance the negative rather than destroying it, are described thus:

:''I'm not entirely familiar with [[Nihilism]] nor [[Existentialism]].''

Philosophies aside, this form of double negative is still in use whereby the use of 'nor' enhances the negative clause by emphasizing what isn't to be. Opponents of double negatives would have preferred ''I'm not entirely familiar with [[Nihilism]] or [[Existentialism]]''; however this renders the sentence somewhat empty of the negative clause being advanced in the sentence. This form of double negative along with others described are standard ways of intensifying as well as enhancing a negative. The use of 'nor' to emphasise the negative clause is still popular today, and has been popular in the past through works of Shakespeare and Milton:

:''Nor did they not perceive the evil plight''
:''In which they were'' ~ [[John Milton]] - [[Paradise Lost]]

:''I never was, nor never will be'' ~ [[William Shakespeare]] - [[Richard III]]

To the common reader the negatives herein do not cancel each other out but simply emphasizes the negative clause.

Up to the 18th century, double negatives were used to emphasize negation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.american.edu/cas/tesol/resources/upload/Kirby_Philippa.pdf Philippa Kirby], ''Double and Multiple Negatives, p. 2''&lt;/ref&gt; "Prescriptive grammarians" recorded and codified a shift away from the double negative in the 1700s. Double negatives continue to be spoken by those of Vernacular English, such as those of Appalachian English and African American Vernacular English.&lt;ref&gt;''p. 4''&lt;/ref&gt; To such speakers, they view double negatives as emphasizing the negative rather than cancelling out the negatives. Researchers have studied African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and trace its origins back to colonial English.&lt;ref&gt;''p. 5''&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that double negatives were present in colonial English, and thus presumably English as a whole, and were acceptable at that time. English after the 18th century was changed to become more logical and double negatives became seen as canceling each other as in mathematics. The use of double negatives became associated with being uneducated and illogical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/02/grammar-myths-3/], ''Oxford Dictionaries Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Essay towards a practical English Grammar'' of 1711, [[James Greenwood (grammarian)|James Greenwood]] first recorded the rule: "Two Negatives, or two Adverbs of Denying do in English affirm".{{sfn|Kallel|2011|p=131}}  [[Robert Lowth]] stated in his grammar textbook ''A Short Introduction to English Grammar'' (1762) that "two negatives in English destroy one another, or are equivalent to an affirmative".{{sfn|Kallel|2011|p=131}}  Grammarians have assumed that Latin was the model for Lowth and other early grammarians in prescribing against negative concord, as Latin does not feature it.  Data indicates, however, that negative concord had already fallen into disuse in Standard English by the time of Lowth's grammar, and no evidence exists that the loss was driven by prescriptivism, which was well established by the time it appeared.{{sfn|Kallel|2011|pp=130–131}}

===In film and television===
[[file:I wont not use no double negatives.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Bart Simpson]] attempting his exercise of double negatives in the [[Simpsons]] episode [[Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder]]]]
Double negatives have been employed in various films and television shows. In the film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the [[chimney sweep]] Bert employs a double negative when he says, "If you don't want to go nowhere..." Another is used by the bandits in the "[[stinking badges|Stinking Badges]]" scene of [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'': "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges!".

More recently, the British television show ''[[EastEnders]]'' has received some publicity over the [[Estuary English|Estuary]] accent of character [[Dot Branning]], who speaks with double and triple negatives ("I ain't never heard of no licence.").{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. In the [[Harry Enfield]] sketch "Mr Cholmondley-Warner's Guide to the Working-Class", a stereotypical Cockney employs a septuple-negative: "Inside toilet? I ain't never not heard of one of them nor I ain't nor nothing."

In music, double negatives can be employed to similar effect (as in [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Another Brick in the Wall]]", in which schoolchildren chant "We don't need no education / We don't need no thought control") or used to establish a frank and informal tone (as in [[The Rolling Stones]]' "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]").

==Germanic languages==
Double negation is uncommon in other [[West Germanic languages]]. A notable exception is [[Afrikaans]], where it is mandatory (for example, "He cannot speak Afrikaans" becomes ''Hy kan nie Afrikaans praat nie'', "He cannot Afrikaans speak not"). Dialectal Dutch, French and [[Khoisan languages|San]] have been suggested as possible origins for this trait. Its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as in these examples provided by Bruce Donaldson:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&amp;q=double+negative#v=onepage&amp;q=Ek%20het%20nie%20geweet%20dat%20hy%20sou%20kom%20nie&amp;f=false |title=''A Grammar of Afrikaans'', Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, p. 404 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ek het '''nie''' geweet dat hy sou kom '''nie'''''. ("I did not know that he would be coming.")
* ''Ek het geweet dat hy '''nie''' sou kom '''nie'''''. ("I knew that he would not be coming.")
* ''Hy sal '''nie''' kom '''nie''', want hy is siek''. ("He will not be coming because he is sick.")
* ''Dit is '''nie''' so moeilik om Afrikaans te leer '''nie'''''. ("It is not so difficult to learn Afrikaans.")

Another point of view is that this construction is not really an example of a "double negative" but simply a grammatical template for negation.  The second ''nie'' cannot be understood as a noun or adverb (as can, e.g., ''pas'' in French), and cannot be substituted by any part of speech other than itself with the sentence remaining grammatical.  It is a grammatical particle with no independent meaning that happens to be spelled and pronounced the same as the embedded ''nie'', meaning "not", through historical accident.

The second ''nie'' is used if and only if the sentence or phrase doesn't already end with ''nie'' or another negating adverb.
* ''Ek sien jou '''nie'''''. ("I don't see you")
* ''Ek sien jou '''nooit'''''. ("I never see you")

Afrikaans shares with English the property that two negatives make a positive.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} For example,
* ''Ek stem '''nie''' met jou saam '''nie'''''. ("I don't agree with you." )
* ''Ek stem '''nie''' '''nié''' met jou saam '''nie'''''. ("I don't ''not'' agree with you," i.e., I agree with you.)

While double negation is still found in the [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian dialects]] of west [[Flanders]] (e.g., ''Ik ne willen da nie doen'', "I do not want to do that") and in some villages in the central Netherlands such as [[Garderen]], it takes a different form than that found in Afrikaans. In [[Belgian Dutch]] dialects, however, there are still some widely used expressions like ''nooit niet'' ("never not") for "never".

Similar to some dialectal English, [[Austro-Bavarian language|Bavarian]] employs both single and double negation, with the latter denoting special emphasis. For example, compare the Bavarian ''Des hob i no nia ned g'hört'' ("This have I yet never not heard") with the standard German "Das habe ich noch nie gehört". The German emphatic "niemals!" (roughly "never ever") corresponds to Bavarian "(går) nia ned" or even "nie nicht" in Standard German pronunciation.

Another exception is [[Yiddish]]. Due to [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] influence, the double (and sometimes even triple) negative is quite common.

A few examples would be:
* איך האב '''קיינמאל''' '''נישט''' געזאגט ("I '''never''' '''didn't''' say")
* איך האב נישט '''קיין''' מורא פאר '''קיינעם''' '''ניט''' "I have '''no''' fear of '''no one not'''")
* It is common to add נישט ("not") after the Yiddish word גארנישט ("nothing"), i.e. איך האב גארנישט נישט געזאגט ("I have said nothing")

==Latin and Romance languages==
While in Latin a second negative word appearing along with ''non'' turns the meaning into a positive one: ''ullus'' means "any", ''nullus'' means "no", ''non...nullus'' (''nonnullus'') means "some". In the same way, ''umquam'' means "ever", ''numquam'' means "never", ''non...numquam'' (''nonnumquam'') means "sometimes", in many Romance languages a second term indicated a negative is required.

[[French grammar#Negation|In French]], the usual way to express negation is to employ two negatives, e.g. ''ne [verb] pas'', ''ne [verb] plus'', or ''ne [verb] jamais'', as in the sentences "Je ne sais pas" ("I do not know"), "Il n'y a plus de baguettes" ("There aren't any more baguettes"), and "On ne sait jamais" ("one never knows"). The second term was originally an emphatic; ''pas'', for example, derives from the Latin ''passus'', meaning "step", so that French ''Je ne marche pas'' and Catalan ''No camino pas'' originally meant "I will not walk a single step." This initial usage spread so thoroughly that it became a necessary element of any negation in the modern French language&lt;ref&gt;There are literary cases in which "ne" can be used without "pas"; many of these are traditional phrases stemming from a time before the emphatic became an essential part of negation.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, in fact, in contemporary French, the original actual negative ''ne'' is mostly left away in favour of ''pas'', as in ''Je sais pas'' "I don't know". In [[Northern Catalan]], ''no'' may be omitted in colloquial language, and [[Occitan language|Occitan]], which uses ''non'' only as a short answer to questions. In [[Venetian language|Venetian]], the double negation ''no ... mìa'' can likewise lose the first particle and rely only on the second: ''magno mìa'' ("I eat not") and ''vegno mìa'' ("I come not"). These exemplify [[Jespersen's cycle]].

[[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] languages usually employ doubled negative [[correlative]]s. Portuguese ''Não vejo nada'', Romanian ''Nu văd nimic'' and Italian ''Non vedo niente''&lt;ref&gt;In Italian a simple–negative phrase, ''Non vedo alcunché'' ("I don't see anything"), is also possible.&lt;/ref&gt; ("I do not see nothing") are used to express "No, I do not see anything". In Italian, a second following negative particle ''non'' turns the phrase into a positive one, but with a slightly different meaning. For instance, while both ''Voglio mangiare'' ("I want to eat") and ''Non voglio non mangiare'' ("I don't want not to eat") mean "I want to eat", the latter phrase more precisely means "I'd prefer to eat".

Other Romance languages employ double negatives less regularly. In [[Asturian language|Asturian]], an extra negative particle is used with negative adverbs: ''Yo nunca nun lu viera'' ("I had not never seen him") means "I have never seen him" and ''A mi tampoco nun me presta'' ("I neither do not like it") means "I do not like it either". Standard Catalan and Galician also used to possess a tendency to double ''no'' with other negatives, so ''Jo tampoc no l'he vista'' or ''Eu tampouco non a vira'', respectively ("I neither have not seen her") meant "I have not seen her either". That practice is dying out.

In 1974, Italy held [[Italian_divorce_referendum,_1974#Confusion_about_voting_methods|a referendum]] on whether to repeal a recent law that allowed divorce.  Voters were said to have been confused in that in order to support divorce, they needed to vote 'no' on the referendum which was worded so that 'yes' would support repeal.  And to reframe the fundamental underlying issue as being support/non-support of the continuation of marriage, then the vote was structured as a triple negative (with divorce as the negation of the continuation of marriage being the first negative).  This referendum was defeated, and without this confusion, it was said that it would have been defeated more decisively.

==Welsh==
In spoken [[Welsh language|Welsh]], the word '''ddim''' (not) often occurs with a prefixed or [[Consonant mutation|mutated]] verb form that is negative in meaning: ''Dydy hi ddim yma'' (word-for-word, "Not-is she not here") expresses "She is not here" and ''Chaiff Aled ddim mynd'' (word-for-word, "Not-will-get Aled not go") expresses "Aled is not allowed to go".

Negative correlatives can also occur with already negative verb forms. In literary Welsh, the mutated verb form is caused by an initial negative particle, '''ni''' or '''nid'''.  The particle is usually omitted in speech but the mutation remains: ''[Ni] wyddai neb'' (word-for-word, "[Not] not-knew nobody") means "Nobody knew" and ''[Ni] chaiff Aled fawr o bres'' (word-for-word, "[Not] not-will-get Aled lots of money") means "Aled will not get much money". This is not usually regarded as three negative markers, however, because the negative mutation is really just an effect of the initial particle on the following word.&lt;ref&gt;

==Greek==
===Ancient Greek===
Doubled negatives are perfectly correct in [[Ancient Greek]].  With few exceptions, a simple negative (οὐ or μή) following another negative (for example, οὐδείς, ''no one'') results in an affirmation: οὐδείς οὐκ ἔπασχε τι ("No one was not suffering") means more simply "Everyone was suffering". Meanwhile, a compound negative following a negative strengthens the negation: μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς ("Do not permit no one to raise an uproar") means "Let not a single one among them raise an uproar".

Those constructions apply only when the negatives all refer to the same word or expression. Otherwise, the negatives simply work independently of one another: οὐ διὰ τὸ μὴ ἀκοντίζειν οὐκ ἔβαλον αὐτόν means "It was not on account of their not throwing that they did not hit him", and one should not blame them for not trying.

===Modern Greek===
In [[Modern Greek]], negative concord is standard and more commonly used. For example, the sentence 'You (pl.) will not find anything' can be said in two ways: 'Δε θα βρείτε τίποτα' ('Not will find nothing') is more common than 'Δε θα βρείτε κάτι' ('Not will find something'). It depends simply on the mood of the speaker, and the latter being is considered slightly more polite. An exception to that rule is the (archaic) pronoun ουδείς, also meaning "no one", which does not allow negation of the verb that it governs.

==Slavic languages==
In [[Slavic languages]] other than [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]], multiple negatives are grammatically correct ways to express negation, and a single negative is often incorrect. In complex sentences, every part that could be grammatically negated should be negative. For example, in the [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], ''Ni(t)ko nikad(a) nigd(j)e ništa nije uradio'' ("Nobody never did not do nothing nowhere") means "Nobody has ever done anything, anywhere", and ''Nikad nisam tamo išao/išla'' ("Never I did not go there") means "I have never been there". In Czech it is also common to use  three or more negations. For example, ''Nikdy jsem nikde nikoho neviděl'' ("I have not never seen no one nowhere"). In Russian, "I know nothing" is я ничего не знаю (''ya nichevo nye znayu''), lit. "I nothing don't know."

A single negation, while syntactically correct, may result in a very unusual meaning or make no sense at all. Saying "I saw nobody" in [[Polish language|Polish]] (''Widziałem nikogo'') instead of the more usual "I did not see nobody" (''Nikogo nie widziałem'') might mean "I saw an instance of nobody" or "I saw Mr. Nobody" but it would not have its plain English meaning. Likewise, in [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], saying "I do not know anyone" (''{{lang|sl|Ne poznam kogarkoli}}'') in place of "I do not know no one" (''{{lang|sl|Ne poznam nikogar}}'') has the connotation "I do not know just ''anyone''": I know someone important or special.

==Baltic languages==
As with most [[synthetic language|synthetic]] ''[[centum-satem isogloss|satem]]'' languages double negative is mandatory{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} in [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. Furthermore, all verbs and [[indefinite pronoun]]s in a given statement must be negated, so it could be said that multiple negative is mandatory in Latvian.

For instance, a statement "I have '''not''' &lt;u&gt;ever&lt;/u&gt; owed &lt;u&gt;anything&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;anyone&lt;/u&gt;" would be rendered as ''es '''ne'''kad '''ne'''vienam '''ne'''ko '''ne'''esmu bijis parādā''. The only alternative would be using a negating [[subordinate clause]] and [[subjunctive]] in the [[main clause]], which could be approximated in English as "there has '''not''' &lt;u&gt;ever&lt;/u&gt; been an instance that I would have owed &lt;u&gt;anything&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;anyone&lt;/u&gt;" ('''''nav''' bijis tā, ka es &lt;u&gt;kādreiz&lt;/u&gt; būtu &lt;u&gt;kādam&lt;/u&gt; bijis &lt;u&gt;kaut ko&lt;/u&gt; parādā''), where negative pronouns (''nekad, neviens, nekas'') are replaced by [[indefinite pronoun]]s (''kādreiz, kāds, kaut kas'') more in line with the English "ever, any" indefinite pronoun structures.

==Uralic languages==
Double or multiple negatives are grammatically required in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] with negative pronouns: ''Nincs semmim'' (word for word: "[doesn't-exists] [nothing-of-mine]", and translates literally as "I do not have nothing") means "I do not have anything". Negative pronouns are constructed by means of adding the prefixes ''se-,'' ''sem-,'' and ''sen-'' to interrogative pronouns.

Something superficially resembling double negation is required also in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which uses the [[auxiliary verb]] ''ei'' to express negation. Negative pronouns are constructed by adding one of the suffixes ''-an,'' ''-än,'' ''-kaan,'' or ''-kään'' to interrogative pronouns: ''Kukaan ei soittanut minulle'' means "No one called me". These suffices are, however, never used alone, but always in connection with ''ei''. This phenomenon is commonplace in Finnish, where many words have alternatives that are required in negative expressions, for example ''edes'' for ''jopa'' ("even"), as in ''jopa niin paljon'' meaning "even so much", and ''ei edes niin paljoa'' meaning "not even so much".

==Turkish==

Negative verb forms are grammatically required in [[Turkish grammar|Turkish]] phrases with negative pronouns or adverbs that impart a negative meaning on the whole phrase. For example, ''Hiçbir şeyim yok'' (literally, word for word, "Not-one thing-of-mine exists-not") means "I don't have anything". Likewise, ''Asla memnun değilim'' (literally, "Never satisfied not-I-am") means "I'm never satisfied".

==Japanese==
Japanese employs [[litotes]] to phrase ideas in a more indirect and polite manner. Thus, one can indicate necessity by emphasizing that not doing something would not be proper. For instance, しなければならない (''shinakereba naranai'', "must") literally means "not doing [it] would not be proper". しなければいけません (''shinakereba ikemasen'', also "must") similarly means "not doing [it] cannot go forward".

Of course, indirectness can also be employed to put an edge on one's rudeness as well. "He has studied Japanese, so he should be able to write kanji" can be phrased 彼は日本語を勉強したから漢字で書けないわけがありません (''kare wa nihongo o benkyō shita kara kanji de kakenai wake ga arimasen''), there is a rather harsher idea: "As he has studied Japanese, the reasoning that he cannot write Kanji does not exist".

==Chinese==
[[Mandarin Chinese]] also employs [[litotes]] in a like manner. One common construction is '''不'''得'''不''' ([[Hanyu Pinyin|Pinyin]]: ''[[wikt:bùdébù|bùdébù]]'', "cannot not"), which is used to express (or feign) a necessity more regretful and polite than that expressed by 必须 (''[[wikt:bìxū|bìxū]]'', "must"). Compared with "我必须走" (''Wǒ bìxū zǒu'', "I must go"), "我'''不'''得'''不'''走" (''Wǒ bùdébù zǒu'', "I cannot not go") tries to emphasize that the situation is out of the speaker's hands and that the speaker has no choice in the matter: "Unfortunately, I have got to go". Similarly, "'''没有'''人'''不'''知道" (''Méiyǒu rén bù zhīdào'', "There is '''not''' a person who does '''not''' know") is a more emphatic way to express "Everyone knows".

Double negatives nearly always resolve to a positive meaning even in colloquial speech, while triple negatives resolve to a negative meaning. For example, "我'''不'''相信'''没'''人'''不'''来" (''Wǒ bù xiāngxìn méi rén bù lái'', "I do '''not''' believe '''no''' one will '''not''' come") means "I do not think everyone will come". However, triple or multiple negatives are considered obscure and are typically avoided.

==History of languages==
[[File:Jespersen's cycle.svg|thumb|250px|An illustration of Jespersen's cycle in French]]
{{main|Jespersen's Cycle}}
Many languages, including all living Germanic languages, French, Welsh and some Berber and Arabic dialects, have gone through a process known as [[Jespersen's cycle]], where an original negative particle is replaced by another, passing through an intermediate stage employing two particles (e.g. [[Old French]] ''jeo ne dis'' → Modern Standard French ''je ne dis pas'' → Modern Colloquial French ''je dis pas'' "I don't say").

In many cases, the original sense of the new negative particle is not negative ''per se'' (thus in French ''pas'' "step", originally "not a step" = "not a bit"), but in Germanic languages, such as English and German the intermediate stage was a case of double negation, as the current negatives ''not'' and ''nicht'' in these languages originally meant "nothing": e.g. [[Old English]] ''ic ne seah'' "I didn't see" &gt;&gt; [[Middle English]] ''I ne saugh nawiht'', lit. "I didn't see nothing" &gt;&gt; [[Early Modern English]] ''I saw not''.&lt;ref&gt;Kastovsky, Dieter. 1991. Historical English syntax. p. 452&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelderen, Elly. 2006. ''A history of the English language''. p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar development to a [[circumfix]] from double negation can be seen in non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] languages, too: for example, in [[Maltese language|Maltese]], ''kiel'' "he ate" is negated as ''ma kielx'' "he did not eat", where the verb is preceded by a negative particle ''ma''- "not" and followed by the particle -''x'', which was originally a shortened form of ''xejn'' "nothing" - thus, "he didn't eat nothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/language/maltesegrammar.htm#ver |title=Grazio Falzon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2857">The '''instantiation principle''' or '''principle of instantiation''' or '''principle of exemplification''' is the [[concept]] in [[metaphysics]] and [[logic]] (first put forward by [[David Malet Armstrong]]) that there can be no uninstantiated or unexemplified [[property (philosophy)|properties]] (or [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]]). In other words, it is impossible for a property to exist which is not had by some object.

Consider a chair. Presumably chairs did not exist 150,000 years ago. Thus, according to the principle of instantiation, the property of being a chair did not exist 150,000 years ago either. Similarly, if all red objects were to suddenly go out of existence, then the property of being red would likewise go out of existence.

To make the principle more plausible in the light of these examples, the existence of properties or universals is not tied to their actual existence now, but to their existence in space-time considered as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The property of being red would exist even if all red things were to be destroyed, because it has been instantiated. This broadens the range of properties which exist if the principle is true. 

Those who endorse the principle of instantiation are known as ''in re'' (in thing or in reality) realists or '[[immanent realist]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Distinguish|Landau principle}}
'''Landauer's principle''' is a [[Principle#Principle as scientific law|physical principle]] pertaining to the lower [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] limit of [[Energy conservation|energy consumption]] of [[computation]]. It holds that "any logically irreversible manipulation of [[Information#As a property in physics|information]], such as the erasure of a [[bit]] or the merging of two [[computation]] paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding [[entropy]] increase in non-information-bearing [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the information-processing apparatus or its environment".&lt;ref name = bennett&gt;{{Citation |arxiv=physics/0210005 |title=Notes on Landauer's principle, Reversible Computation and Maxwell's Demon |authorlink=Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist) |author=Charles H. Bennett |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=501–510 |year=2003 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos576/papers/bennett03.pdf |accessdate=2015-02-18 |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(03)00039-X|bibcode=2003SHPMP..34..501B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of phrasing Landauer's principle is that if an observer loses information about a [[physical system]], the observer loses the ability to extract work from that system.

A so-called logically-reversible computation, in which no information is erased, may in principle be carried out without releasing any heat.  This has led to considerable interest in the study of [[reversible computing]]. Indeed, without reversible computing, increases in the number of computations-per-joule-of-energy-dissipated must come to a halt by about 2050: because the limit implied by Landauer's principle will be reached by then, according to [[Koomey's law]]. 

At 20&amp;nbsp;°C (room temperature, or 293.15&amp;nbsp;K), the Landauer limit represents an energy of approximately 0.0172&amp;nbsp;[[electron volt|eV]], or 2.75&amp;nbsp;[[zeptojoule|zJ]]. Theoretically, room{{nbhyph}}temperature computer memory operating at the Landauer limit could be changed at a rate of one billion bits per second with energy being converted to heat in the memory media at the rate of only 2.85 trillionths of a watt (that is, at a rate of only 2.85 pJ/s).  Modern computers use millions of times as much energy per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tikalon.com/blog/blog.php?article=2011/Landauer |title=Tikalon Blog by Dev Gualtieri |publisher=Tikalon.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomweb.com/nanomagnet-memories-approach-low-power-limit/ |title=Nanomagnet memories approach low-power limit &amp;#124; bloomfield knoble |publisher=Bloomweb.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/landauer-limit-demonstrated |title=Landauer Limit Demonstrated - IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Rolf Landauer]] first proposed the principle in 1961 while working at [[IBM]].&lt;ref name="landauer"&gt;{{Citation |author=Rolf Landauer |url=http://worrydream.com/refs/Landauer%20-%20Irreversibility%20and%20Heat%20Generation%20in%20the%20Computing%20Process.pdf |title=Irreversibility and heat generation in the computing process |journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=183–191 |year=1961 |accessdate=2015-02-18 |doi=10.1147/rd.53.0183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He rigorously justified and stated important limits to an earlier conjecture by [[John von Neumann]]. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as being simply the Landauer bound or Landauer limit.

In 2011, the principle was generalized to show that while information erasure requires an increase in entropy, that increase could theoretically occur at no energy cost&lt;ref name="vaccaro"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Joan Vaccaro |author2=Stephen Barnett |title=Information Erasure Without an Energy Cost |journal=Proc. R. Soc. A |date=June 8, 2011 |volume=467 |issue=2130 |pages=1770–1778 |doi=10.1098/rspa.2010.0577 |url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsa/early/2011/01/07/rspa.2010.0577.full.pdf |arxiv=1004.5330|bibcode = 2011RSPSA.467.1770V }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, the cost can be taken in another [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved quantity]], such as  [[angular momentum]].

In a 2012 article published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], a team of physicists from the [[École normale supérieure de Lyon]], [[University of Augsburg]] and the [[University of Kaiserslautern]] described that for the first time they have measured the tiny amount of heat released when an individual bit of data is erased.&lt;ref name="berut"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Antoine Bérut |author2=Artak Arakelyan |author3=Artyom Petrosyan |author4=Sergio Ciliberto |author5=Raoul Dillenschneider |author6=Eric Lutz |doi=10.1038/nature10872 |title=Experimental verification of Landauer’s principle linking information and thermodynamics |journal=Nature |volume=483 |issue=7388 |pages=187–190 |date=8 March 2012 |url=http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/eggert/papers/raoul.pdf|bibcode = 2012Natur.483..187B |pmid=22398556|arxiv=1503.06537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, physical experiments tested Landauer's principle and confirmed its predictions.&lt;ref name="jun"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Yonggun Jun |author2=Momčilo Gavrilov |author3=John Bechhoefer |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.190601 |title=High-Precision Test of Landauer's Principle in a Feedback Trap |journal=[[Phys.

In 2016, researchers used a laser probe to measure the amount of energy dissipation that resulted when a nanomagnetic bit flipped from off to on. Flipping the bit required 15 millielectron volts (3 [[zeptojoule]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hong|first = Jeongmin|last2 = Lambson|first2 = Brian|last3 = Dhuey|first3 = Scott|last4 = Bokor|first4 = Jeffrey|date = 2016-03-01|title = Experimental test of Landauer’s principle in single-bit operations on nanomagnetic memory bits|url = http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/3/e1501492|journal = Science Advances|language = en|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = e1501492|doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1501492|issn = 2375-2548|pmc = 4795654|bibcode = 2016SciA....2E1492H|pmid=26998519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 article published in [[Nature Physics (journal)|''Nature Physics'']] features a Landauer erasure performed at cryogenic temperatures (T = 1K) on an array of high-spin (S = 10) quantum [[molecular magnets]]. The array is made to act as a spin register where each nanomagnet encodes a single bit of information.&lt;ref name="Gaudenzi"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment has laid the foundations for the extension of the validity of the Landauer principle to the quantum realm. Owing to the fast dynamics and low "inertia" of the single spins used in the experiment, the researchers also showed how an erasure operation can be carried out at the lowest possible thermodynamic cost — that imposed by the Landauer principle — and at a high speed.&lt;ref name="Gaudenzi"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Rocco Gaudenzi |author2=Enrique Burzuri |author3=Satoru Maegawa |author4=Herre van der Zant |author5=Fernando Luis |doi=10.1038/s41567-018-0070-7 |title=Quantum Landauer erasure with a molecular nanomagnet |journal= Nature Physics |volume=14 |pages= 565–568 |date=19 March 2018 |url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-018-0070-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

==Rationale==
Landauer's principle can be understood to be a simple [[logical consequence]] of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]—which states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] cannot decrease—together with the definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]]. For, if the number of possible logical states of a computation were to decrease as the computation proceeded forward (logical irreversibility), this would constitute a forbidden decrease of entropy, unless the number of possible physical states corresponding to each logical state were to simultaneously increase by at least a compensating amount, so that the total number of possible physical states was no smaller than it was originally (i.e. total entropy has not decreased).

Yet, an increase in the number of physical states corresponding to each logical state means that, for an observer who is keeping track of the logical state of the system but not the physical state (for example an "observer" consisting of the computer itself), the number of possible physical states has increased; in other words, entropy has increased from the point of view of this observer.

The maximum entropy of a bounded physical system is finite. (If the [[holographic principle]] is correct, then physical systems with finite [[surface area]] have a finite maximum entropy; but regardless of the truth of the holographic principle, [[quantum field theory]] dictates that the entropy of systems with finite radius and energy is finite due to the [[Bekenstein bound]].) To avoid reaching this maximum over the course of an extended computation, entropy must eventually be expelled to an outside environment.

==Equation==
Landauer's principle asserts that there is a minimum possible amount of energy required to erase one bit of information, known as the ''Landauer limit'':

:{{math|''kT'' ln&amp;#8239;2,}}
where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] (approximately 1.38×10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; J/K), ''T'' is the temperature of the heat sink in [[kelvin]]s, and ln&amp;#8239;2 is the [[natural logarithm]] of 2 (approximately 0.69315).

For an environment at temperature ''T'', energy ''E'' = ''ST'' must be emitted into that environment if the amount of added entropy is ''S''. For a computational operation in which 1 [[bit]] of logical information is lost, the amount of entropy generated is at least ''k'' ln&amp;#8239;2, and so, the energy that must eventually be emitted to the environment is ''E'' ≥ ''kT'' ln&amp;#8239;2.

==Challenges==
The principle is widely accepted as [[physical law]], but in recent years it has been challenged for using [[circular reasoning]] and faulty assumptions, notably in Earman and Norton (1998), and subsequently in Shenker (2000)&lt;ref name="shenker"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000115/ Logic and Entropy] Critique by Orly Shenker (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and Norton (2004,&lt;ref name="norton"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001729/ Eaters of the Lotus] Critique by John Norton (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; 2011&lt;ref name="norton2"&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Waiting_SHPMP.pdf Waiting for Landauer] Response by Norton (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;), and defended by Bennett (2003)&lt;ref name="bennett" /&gt; and Ladyman et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3883">'''Lexical entrainment''' is the phenomenon in conversational [[linguistics]] of the process of the subject adopting the reference terms of their interlocutor. In practice, it acts as a mechanism of the [[cooperative principle]] in which both parties to the conversation employ lexical entrainment as a progressive system to develop "conceptual pacts"&lt;ref name=sbrennan96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|title=Lexical entrainment in spontaneous dialog|journal=Proceedings, 1996 International Symposium on Spoken Dialogue|year=1996|issue=ISSD-96|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a working temporary conversational terminology) to ensure maximum clarity of reference in the communication between the parties; this process is necessary to overcome the ambiguity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=Werner|author2=Pechmann, Thomas |title=Social interaction and the development of definite descriptions|journal=Cognition|year=1982|volume=11|pages=159–184|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(82)90024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  inherent in the multitude of synonyms that exist in language. 

Lexical entrainment arises by two cooperative mechanisms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrod|first=Simon|author2=Anderson, Anthony |title=Saying what you mean in dialogue: A study in conceptual and semantic co-ordination|journal=Cognition|year=1987|volume=27|pages=181–218|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90018-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Embedded corrections – a reference to the object implied by the context of the sentence, but with no explicit reference to the change in terminology
* Exposed corrections – an explicit reference to the change in terminology, possibly including a request to assign the referent a common term (e.g., "by 'girl', do you mean 'Jane'?")

==Violation of Grice's maxim of quantity==
Once lexical entrainment has come to determine the phrasing for a referent, both parties will use that terminology for the referent for the duration, even if it proceeds to violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of quantity. For example, if one wants to refer to a brown loafer out of a set of shoes that consist of: the loafer, a sneaker, and a high-heeled shoe, they will not use ''the shoe'' to describe the object as this phrasing does not unambiguously describe one item in the set under consideration. They will also not call the object ''the brown loafer'' which would violate Grice's maxim of quantity. The speaker will settle on using the term ''the loafer'' as it is just informative enough without giving too much information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|author2=Clark, Herbert H. |title=Conceptual Pacts and Lexical Choice in Conversation|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1996|volume=22|issue=6|pages=1482–1493|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.22.6.1482}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another important factor is lexical availability; the ease of conceptualizing a referent in a certain way and then retrieving and producing a label for it. For many objects the most available labels are basic nouns; for example, the word "dog". Instead of saying ''animal'' or ''husky'' for the referent, most subjects will default to ''dog''.
If in a set of objects one is to refer to either a husky, a table, and a poster, people are still most likely to use the word "dog." This is technically a violation of Grice's maxim of quantity, as using the term ''animal'' is ideal.

==Applications==
Lexical entrainment has applications in [[natural language processing]] in computers as well as human–human interaction. Currently, the adaptability of computers to modify their referencing to the terms of their human interlocutor is limited, so the entrainment adaptation falls to the human operator; this phenomenon is readily demonstrated in Brennan's 1996 experiment.&lt;ref name=sbrennan96 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4445">[[File:Logical-hexagon.png|thumb|250px|right|The logical hexagon extends the [[square of opposition]] to six statements.]]

The '''logical hexagon''' (also called the '''hexagon of opposition''') is a [[conceptual model]] of the relationships between the [[truth value]]s of six [[statement (logic)|statement]]s. It is an extension of [[Aristotle]]'s [[square of opposition]]. It was discovered independently by both [[Augustin Sesmat]] and [[Robert Blanché]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alessiomoretti.perso.sfr.fr/NOTLogicalHexagon.html N-opposition theory ''logical hexagon'']&lt;/ref&gt;

This extension consists in introducing two statements '''U''' and '''Y'''. Whereas '''U''' is the [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] of '''A''' and '''E''', '''Y''' is the [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] of the two traditional particulars '''I''' and '''O'''.

== Summary of relationships ==

The traditional square of opposition demonstrates two sets of contradictories '''A''' and '''O''', and '''E''' and '''I''' (i.e. they cannot both be true and cannot both be false), two contraries '''A''' and '''E''' (i.e. they can both be false, but cannot both be true), and two subcontraries '''I''' and '''O''' (i.e. they can both be true, but cannot both be false) according to Aristotle’s definitions. However, the logical hexagon provides that '''U''' and '''Y''' are also contradictory.

== Interpretations of the logical hexagon ==

The logical hexagon may be interpreted in various ways, including as a model of traditional logic, quantifications, modal logic, order theory, or paraconsistent logic.

For instance, the statement A may be interpreted as "Whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is white."

    (x)(M(x) → W(x))

The statement E may be interpreted as "Whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is non-white."

    (x)(M(x) → ~W(x))

The statement I may be interpreted as "There exists at least one x that is both a man and white."

    (∃x)(M(x) &amp; W(x))

The statement O may be interpreted as "There exists at least one x that is both a man and non-white"

    (∃x)(M(x) &amp; ~W(x))

The statement Y may be interpreted as "There exists at least one x that is both a man and white and there exists at least one x that is both a man and non-white"

    (∃x)(M(x) &amp; W(x)) &amp; (∃x)(M(x) &amp; ~W(x))

The statement U may be interpreted as "One of two things, either whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is white or whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is non-white."

    (x)(M(x) → W(x)) w (x)(M(x) → ~W(x)) 

The logical hexagon may be interpreted in various ways, including as a model of traditional logic, quantifications, modal logic, order theory, or paraconsistent logic.



=== Modal logic ===

The logical hexagon may be interpreted as a model of modal logic such that

* '''A''' is interpreted as [[necessary and sufficient condition|necessity]]
* '''E''' is interpreted as impossibility
* '''I''' is interpreted as [[logical possibility|possibility]]
* '''O''' is interpreted as 'not necessarily'
* '''U''' is interpreted as non-contingency
* '''Y''' is interpreted as [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]

== Further extension ==
It has been proven that both the square and the hexagon, followed by a “[[logical cube]]”, belong to a regular series of n-dimensional objects called “logical bi-simplexes of dimension n.” The pattern also goes even beyond this.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Pellissier&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marginal demand'''  in [[economics]] is the change in demand for a product or service in response to a specific change in its price.

Normally, as prices for goods or service rise, demand falls, and conversely, as prices for goods or services fall, demand rises.

A product or service where price changes cause a relatively big change in demand is said to have ''elastic'' demand. A product or service where price changes cause a relatively small change in demand is said to have  ''inelastic'' demand. See [[Elasticity of demand]].

In [[economics]] and in particular [[neoclassical economics]], the '''marginal product''' or '''marginal physical productivity''' of an input ([[factor of production]]) is the change in output resulting from employing one more unit of a particular input (for instance, the change in output when a firm's labor is increased from five to six units), assuming that the quantities of other inputs are kept constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =The Making of the Classical Theory of Economic Growth|last=Brewer

The marginal product of a given input can be expressed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

as:
:&lt;math&gt;MP =  \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta X&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the firm's use of the input (conventionally a one-unit change) and &lt;math&gt;\Delta Y&lt;/math&gt; is the change in quantity of output produced (resulting from the change in the input). Note that the quantity &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; of the "product" is typically defined ignoring [[externalities|external costs and benefits]].

If the output and the input are infinitely divisible, so the marginal "units" are infinitesimal, the marginal product is the mathematical [[derivative]] of the [[production function]] with respect to that input. Suppose a firm's output ''Y'' is given by the production function:
:&lt;math&gt;Y=F(K,L)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K'' and ''L'' are inputs to production (say, capital and labor). Then the marginal product of capital (''MPK'') and marginal product of labor (''MPL'') are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;MPK=\frac{\partial F}{\partial K}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;MPL=\frac{\partial F}{\partial L}&lt;/math&gt;

In the "law" of [[diminishing returns|diminishing marginal returns]], the marginal product initially increases when more of an input (say labor) is employed, keeping the other input (say capital) constant. Here, labor is the variable input and capital is the fixed input (in a hypothetical two-inputs model). As more and more of variable input (labor) is employed, marginal product starts to fall. Finally, after a certain point, the marginal product becomes negative, implying that the additional unit of labor has ''decreased'' the output, rather than increasing it. The reason behind this is the diminishing [[marginal productivity of labor]].

The marginal product of labor is the slope of the [[total product]] curve, which is the production function plotted against labor usage for a fixed level of usage of the capital input.

In the neoclassical theory of [[perfect competition|competitive markets]], the [[marginal product of labor]] equals the [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] wage. In aggregate models of perfect competition, in which a single good is produced and that good is used both in consumption and as a capital good,  the [[marginal product of capital]] equals its [[rate of profit|rate of return]]. As was shown in the [[Cambridge capital controversy]], this proposition about the marginal product of capital cannot generally be sustained in multi-commodity models in which capital and consumption goods are distinguished.

'''Relationship of marginal product (MPP) with the total product (TPP)'''

The relationship can be explained in three phases-
(1) Initially, as the quantity of variable input is increased, TPP rises at an increasing rate. In this phase, MPP also rises.
(2) As more and more quantities of the variable inputs are employed, TPP increases at a diminishing rate. In this phase, MPP starts to fall.
(3) When the TPP reaches its maximum, MPP is zero. Beyond this point, TPP starts to fall and MPP becomes negative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5628">In economics, the '''marginal rate of substitution''' ('''MRS''') is the rate at which a consumer can give up some amount of one good in exchange for another good while maintaining the same level of [[utility]].  At equilibrium consumption levels (assuming no externalities), marginal rates of substitution are identical.

==As the slope of indifference curve==
Under the standard assumption of [[neoclassical economics]] that goods and services are continuously divisible, the marginal rates of substitution will be the same regardless of the direction of exchange, and will correspond to the slope of an [[indifference curve]] (more precisely, to the slope multiplied by −1) passing through the consumption bundle in question, at that point: mathematically, it is the [[implicit derivative]]. MRS of X for Y is the amount of Y which a consumer can exchange for one unit of X locally. The MRS is different at each point along the indifference curve thus it is important to keep locus in the definition. Further on this assumption, or otherwise on the assumption that utility is [[Measure (mathematics)|quantified]], the marginal rate of substitution of good or service Y for good or service X (MRS&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;) is also equivalent to the [[marginal utility]] of X over the marginal utility of Y. Formally,

:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{xy}=-m_\mathrm{indif}=-(dy/dx) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{xy}=MU_x/MU_y \,&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that when comparing bundles of goods X and Y that give a constant utility (points along an [[indifference curve]]), the [[marginal utility]] of X is measured in terms of units of Y that is being given up.

For example, if the MRS&lt;sub&gt;''xy''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the consumer will give up 2 units of Y to obtain 1 additional unit of X.

As one moves down a (standardly convex) indifference curve, the marginal rate of substitution decreases (as measured by the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve, which decreases). This is known as the law of diminishing marginal rate of substitution.

Since the indifference curve is convex with respect to the origin and we have defined the MRS as the negative slope of the indifference curve,

:&lt;math&gt;\ MRS_{xy} \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

==Simple mathematical analysis==
{{See|Implicit differentiation}}

Assume the consumer [[utility function]] is defined by &lt;math&gt;U(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''U'' is consumer utility, ''x'' and ''y'' are goods. Then the marginal rate of substitution can be computed via [[partial differentiation]], as follows.

Also, note that:

:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_x=\partial U/\partial x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_y=\partial U/\partial y &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ MU_x &lt;/math&gt; is the [[marginal utility]] with respect to good ''x'' and &lt;math&gt;\ MU_y &lt;/math&gt; is the marginal utility with respect to good ''y''.

By taking the [[total differential]] of the utility function equation, we obtain the following results:
:&lt;math&gt;\ dU=(\partial U/\partial x)dx + (\partial U/\partial y)dy &lt;/math&gt;, or substituting from above,

:&lt;math&gt;\ dU= MU_xdx + MU_ydy &lt;/math&gt;, or, without loss of generality, the total derivative of the utility function with respect to good ''x'',
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dx}= MU_x\frac{dx}{dx}+ MU_y\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dx}= MU_x + MU_y\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.
Through any point on the indifference curve, ''dU/dx'' = 0,    because ''U''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'', where ''c'' is a constant. It follows from the above equation that:
::&lt;math&gt; 0 = MU_x + MU_y\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;, or rearranging
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{MU_x}{MU_y}&lt;/math&gt;

The marginal rate of substitution is defined as the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve at whichever commodity bundle quantities are of interest.  That turns out to equal the ratio of the marginal utilities:
:&lt;math&gt;\ MRS_{xy}= MU_x/MU_y.\, &lt;/math&gt;.

----

When consumers maximize utility with respect to a budget constraint, the indifference curve is tangent to the [[budget line]], therefore, with ''m'' representing slope:

:&lt;math&gt;\ m_\mathrm{indif}=m_\mathrm{budget} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ -(MRS_{xy})=-(P_x/P_y) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ MRS_{xy}=P_x/P_y &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, when the consumer is choosing his utility maximized market basket on his budget line,

:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_x/MU_y=P_x/P_y &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ MU_x/P_x=MU_y/P_y &lt;/math&gt;

This important result tells us that utility is maximized when the consumer's budget is allocated so that the marginal utility per unit of money spent is equal for each good. If this equality did not hold, the consumer could increase his/her utility by cutting spending on the good with lower marginal utility per unit of money and increase spending on the other good. To decrease the marginal rate of substitution, the consumer must buy more of the good for which he/she wishes the marginal utility to fall for (due to the law of diminishing marginal utility).

'''Master–slave morality''' is a central theme of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s works, in particular the first essay of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''. Nietzsche argued that there were two fundamental types of [[morality]]: "master morality" and "slave morality". Master morality values pride and power, while slave morality values things like kindness, empathy, and sympathy. Master morality weighs actions on good or bad consequences (i. e., classical virtues and vices, [[consequentialism]]), unlike slave morality, which weighs actions on a scale of [[Good and evil|good or evil]] intentions (e. g., Christian virtues and vices, [[Kantian ethics|Kantian deontology]]).

For Nietzsche, a particular morality is inseparable from the formation of a particular culture, meaning that a culture's language, codes and practices, narratives, and institutions are informed by the struggle between these two moral structures (see [[Value theory|valuation]]).

==Master morality==
Nietzsche defined master morality as the morality of the strong-willed. Nietzsche criticizes the view (which he identifies with contemporary British ideology) that good is everything that is helpful, and bad is everything that is harmful. He argues proponents of this view have forgotten the origins of its values and it is based merely on a non-critical acceptance of habit: what is useful has always been defined as good, therefore usefulness is goodness as a value. He continues explaining that in the prehistoric state "the value or non-value of an action was derived from its consequences"{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=62}} but ultimately "[t]here are no moral phenomena at all, only moral interpretations of phenomena."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=96}} For strong-willed men, the "good" is the noble, strong, and powerful, while the "bad" is the weak, cowardly, timid, and petty. 

The essence of master morality is ''nobility''. Other qualities that are often valued in master morality are open-mindedness, courage, truthfulness, trust, and an accurate sense of one's self-worth. Master morality begins in the "noble man", with a spontaneous idea of the good; then the idea of bad develops as what is not good. "The noble type of man experiences ''itself'' as determining values; it does not need approval; it judges, "what is harmful to me is harmful in itself"; it knows itself to be that which first accords honour to things; it is ''value-creating''."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=39}} In this sense, the master morality is the full recognition that ''oneself'' is the measure of all moral truths.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Insofar as something is helpful to the strong-willed man, it is like what he values in himself; therefore, the strong-willed man values such things as good because they aid him in a life-long process of [[self-actualization]] through the [[will to power]].

==Slave morality==

According to Nietzsche, masters are creators of morality; slaves respond to master morality with their slave morality. Unlike master morality, which is sentiment, slave morality is based on [[ressentiment|re-sentiment]]—devaluing that which the master values and the slave does not have. As master morality originates in the strong, slave morality originates in the weak. Because slave morality is a reaction to oppression, it vilifies its oppressors. Slave morality is the inverse of master morality. As such, it is characterized by pessimism and cynicism. Slave morality is created in opposition to what master morality values as "good". 

Slave morality does not aim at exerting one's will by strength, but by careful subversion. It does not seek to transcend the masters, but to make them slaves as well. The essence of slave morality is ''utility'':{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=122}} The good is what is most useful for the whole community, not just the strong. Nietzsche saw this as a contradiction. Since the powerful are few in number, compared to the masses of the weak, the weak gain power by corrupting the strong into believing that the causes of slavery (viz., the [[will to power]]) are "evil", as are the qualities the weak originally could not choose because of their weakness. By saying humility is voluntary, slave morality avoids admitting that their humility was in the beginning forced upon them by a master. [[Biblical]] principles of humility, charity, and pity are the result of universalizing the plight of the slave onto all humankind, and thus enslaving the masters as well. "The ''democratic'' movement is the heir to [[Christianity]]"{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=125}}—the political manifestation of slave morality because of its obsession with freedom and equality.

{{quote|...the Jews achieved that miracle of inversion of values thanks to which life on earth has for a couple millennia acquired a new and dangerous fascination - their prophets fused "rich", "godless", "evil", "violent", "sensual" into one, and were the first to coin the word "world" as a term of infamy. It is this inversion of values (with which is involved the employment of the word for "poor" as a synonym for "holy" and "friend") that the significance of the Jewish people resides: With ''them'', there begins the ''slave revolt in morals''.{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=118}}}}

==Society==

This struggle between master and slave moralities recurs historically. According to Nietzsche, ancient Greek and Roman societies were grounded in master morality. The [[Homer]]ic hero is the strong-willed man, and the classical roots of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' exemplified Nietzsche's master morality. He calls the heroes "men of a noble culture",{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=153}} giving a substantive example of master morality. Historically, master morality was defeated, as the slave morality of Judaism and Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire. 

The essential struggle between cultures has always been between the Roman (master, strong) and the Judean (slave, weak). Nietzsche condemns the triumph of slave morality in the West, saying that the democratic movement is the "''collective degeneration of man''".{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=127}} He claimed that the nascent democratic movement of his time was essentially slavish and weak.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Weakness conquered strength, slave conquered master, re-sentiment conquered sentiment. This [[ressentiment]] Nietzsche calls "priestly vindictiveness",{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=19}} which is based on the jealous weak seeking to enslave the strong, and thus erode the basis for power itself by pulling the powerful down. Such movements were, according to Nietzsche, inspired by "the most intelligent revenge" of the weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Genealogy of Morals: A Polemic.

Nietzsche did not necessarily believe that everyone should adopt master morality as the "be-all, end-all" behavior. He thought that the [[Transvaluation of values|revaluation of morals]] would correct the inconsistencies in both master and slave moralities. But he asserted that for the individual, master morality was preferable to slave morality. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] disagrees that Nietzsche actually preferred master morality to slave morality. He certainly gives slave morality a more thorough critique, but this is partly because he thought of slave morality as society's more imminent danger.{{citation needed|reason=Sentence is vaguely worded and lacks documentation.|date=October 2015}}

The mental model theory of reasoning was developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991). It has been applied to the main domains of deductive inference including relational inferences such as spatial and temporal deductions; propositional inferences, such as conditional, disjunctive and negation deductions; quantified inferences such as syllogisms; and meta-deductive inferences.

Ongoing research on [[mental models and reasoning]] has led the theory to be extended to account for probabilistic inference (e.g., Johnson-Laird, 2006) and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25156">{{numeral systems}}
A '''negative base''' (or negative [[radix]]) may be used to construct a [[non-standard positional numeral system]]. Like other place-value systems, each position holds multiples of the appropriate power of the system's base; but that base is negative—that is to say, the base {{mvar|b}} is equal to {{mvar|−r}} for some natural number {{mvar|r}} ({{mvar|r ≥ 2}}).

Negative-base systems can accommodate all the same numbers as standard place-value systems, but both positive and negative numbers are represented without the use of a [[minus sign]] (or, in computer representation, a [[sign bit]]); this advantage is countered by an increased complexity of arithmetic operations. The need to store the information normally contained by a negative sign often results in a negative-base number being one digit longer than its positive-base equivalent.

The common names for negative-base positional numeral systems are formed by [[prefix (linguistics)|prefixing]] ''nega-'' to the name of the corresponding positive-base system; for example, '''negadecimal''' (base −10) corresponds to [[decimal]] (base 10), '''negabinary''' (base −2) to [[binary numeral system|binary]] (base 2), and '''negaternary''' (base −3) to [[ternary numeral system|ternary]] (base 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Donald|last=Knuth|title=[[The Art of Computer Programming]], Volume 2|year=1998|edition=3rd|pages=204–205}}. Knuth mentions both negabinary and negadecimal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The negaternary system is discussed briefly in {{Citation | last1=Petkovšek | first1=Marko | author1-link=Marko Petkovšek | title=Ambiguous numbers are dense | doi=10.2307/2324393 | mr=1048915 | year=1990 | journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly|The American Mathematical Monthly]] | issn=0002-9890 | volume=97 | issue=5 | pages=408–411}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Consider what is meant by the representation {{val|fmt=none|12243}} in the negadecimal system, whose base {{mvar|b}} is −10:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
|+ Multiples of
|-
| {{math|(−10)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 10,000}}
| {{math|(−10)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −1,000}}
| {{math|(−10)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 100}}
| {{math|(−10)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −10}}
| {{math|(−10)&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}
|-
| 1
| 2
| 2
| 4
| 3
|}

Since 10,000 + (−2,000) + 200 + (−40) + 3 = {{val|fmt=commas|8163}}, the representation {{val|fmt=commas|12243|s={{sub|−10}}}} in negadecimal notation is equivalent to {{val|fmt=commas|8,163|s={{sub|10}}}} in decimal notation, while {{val|fmt=commas|−8163|s={{sub|10}}}} in decimal would be written {{val|fmt=commas|9,977|s={{sub|−10}}}} in negadecimal.

==History==
Negative numerical bases were first considered by [[Vittorio Grünwald]] in his work ''Giornale di Matematiche di Battaglini'', published in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Vittorio Grünwald. ''Giornale di Matematiche di Battaglini'' (1885), 203-221, 367&lt;/ref&gt; Grünwald gave algorithms for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, root extraction, divisibility tests, and radix conversion. Negative bases were later independently rediscovered by [[Aubrey J. Kempner|A. J. Kempner]] in 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last = Kempner | first = A. J. | authorlink = Aubrey J. Kempner
 | doi = 10.2307/2300532
 | issue = 10
 | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]]
 | mr = 1523792
 | pages = 610–617
 | title = Anormal Systems of Numeration
 | volume = 43
 | year = 1936}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zdzisław Pawlak]] and A. Wakulicz in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last1 = Pawlak | first1 = Z.
 | last2 = Wakulicz | first2 = A.

 | pages = 233–236
 | title = Use of expansions with a negative basis in the arithmometer of a digital computer
 | volume = 5
 | year = 1957}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negabinary was implemented in the early [[Poland|Polish]] computer [[BINEG]] (and [[UMC (computer)|UMC]]), built 1957–59, based on ideas by Z. Pawlak and A. Lazarkiewicz from the [[Mathematical Institute]] in [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chc60.fgcu.edu/images/articles/Marczynski.pdf Marczynski, R. W., "The First Seven Years of Polish Computing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719192337/http://chc60.fgcu.edu/images/articles/Marczynski.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, Vol. 2, No 1, January 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  Implementations since then have been rare.

==Notation and use==
Denoting the base as {{mvar|−r}}, every [[integer]] {{mvar|a}} can be written uniquely as
:&lt;math&gt;a = \sum_{i=0}^{n}d_{i}(-r)^{i}&lt;/math&gt;
where each digit {{mvar|d&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an integer from 0 to {{math|''r'' - 1}} and the leading digit {{mvar|d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} is {{math|&gt; 0}} (unless {{math|''n''&amp;#x003D;0}}). The base {{mvar|−r}} expansion of {{mvar|a}} is then given by the string {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;hellip;''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Negative-base systems may thus be compared to [[signed-digit representation]]s, such as [[balanced ternary]], where the radix is positive but the digits are taken from a partially negative range. (In the table below the digit of value −1 is written as the single character T.)

Some numbers have the same representation in base {{mvar|−r}} as in base {{mvar|r}}.  For example, the numbers from 100 to 109 have the same representations in decimal and negadecimal.  Similarly,
:&lt;math&gt;17=2^4+2^0=(-2)^4+(-2)^0&lt;/math&gt;
and is represented by 10001 in binary and 10001 in negabinary.

Some numbers with their expansions in a number of positive and corresponding negative bases are:

Note that the base {{mvar|−r}} expansions of negative integers have an [[even number]] of digits, while the base {{mvar|−r}} expansions of the non-negative integers have an [[odd number]] of digits.

==Calculation==
The base {{mvar|−r}} expansion of a number can be found by repeated division by {{mvar|−r}}, recording the non-negative remainders of &lt;math&gt; 0, 1, \ldots, r-1&lt;/math&gt;, and concatenating those remainders, starting with the last.  Note that if {{math| ''a'' / ''b'' &amp;#x003D; ''c''}}, remainder {{mvar|d}}, then {{math| ''bc'' + ''d'' &amp;#x003D; ''a''}} and therefore {{math| ''d'' &amp;#x003D; ''a'' - ''bc''}}. To arrive at the correct conversion, the value for {{mvar|c}} must be chosen such that {{mvar|d}} is non-negative and minimal. This is exemplified in the fourth line of the following example wherein –5 ÷ –3 must be chosen to equal 2 remainder 1 instead of 1 remainder –2.

For example, to convert 146 in decimal to negaternary:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rr}
 146 \div (-3) = &amp; -48 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 2 \\
 -48 \div (-3) = &amp;  16 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 0 \\
  16 \div (-3) = &amp;  -5 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 1 \\
  -5 \div (-3) = &amp;   2 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 1 \\
   2 \div (-3) = &amp;   0 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 2
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
Reading the remainders backward we obtain the negaternary representation of 146&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;: 21102&lt;sub&gt;–3&lt;/sub&gt;.
:Proof: ((('''2'''·(–3)+'''1''')·(–3)+'''1''')·(–3)+'''0''')·(–3)+'''2''' = 146&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.

Note that in most [[programming languages]], the result (in integer arithmetic) of dividing a negative number by a negative number is rounded towards 0, usually leaving a negative remainder. In such a case we have {{math|''a'' &amp;#x003D; (−''r'')''c'' + ''d'' &amp;#x003D; (−''r'')''c'' + ''d'' − ''r'' + ''r'' &amp;#x003D; (−''r'')(''c'' + 1) + (''d'' + ''r'')}}. Because {{math|{{!}}d{{!}} &lt; r}}, {{math|(''d'' + ''r'')}} is the positive remainder. Therefore, to get the correct result in such case, computer implementations of the above algorithm should add 1 and {{mvar|r}} to the quotient and remainder respectively.

            )
            (while (/= num 0)
                (setq rst (- num (* baz (setq num (fix (/ num baz))))))
                (if
                    (minusp rst)
                    (setq

                        rst (- rst baz)
                    )
                )
                (setq dig (strcat (itoa (fix rst)) dig))
            )
            dig
        )
        (progn
            (prompt
                (cond
                    ((and (not (numberp num))(not (numberp baz)))   "\nWrong number and negabase.")
                    ((not (numberp num))                            "\nWrong number.")
                    ((not (numberp baz))                            "\nWrong negabase.")

                )
            )
            (princ)
        )
    )
)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Shortcut calculation ===
====To negabinary====
The conversion to ''negabinary'' (base −2; digits &lt;math&gt;\in \; \{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;) allows a remarkable shortcut 
(C implementation):
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
unsigned int toNegaBinary(unsigned int value) // input in standard binary
{
	unsigned int Schroeppel2 = 0xAAAAAAAA; // = 2/3*((2*2)^16-1) = ...1010
	return (value + Schroeppel2) ^ Schroeppel2; // eXclusive OR
	// resulting unsigned int to be interpreted as string of elements ε {0,1} (bits)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Due to D. Librik (Szudzik). The bitwise XOR portion is originally due to [[Richard Schroeppel|Schroeppel]] (1972).&lt;ref&gt;See the MathWorld Negabinary link&lt;/ref&gt;

JavaScript port for the same shortcut calculation: 
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
function toNegaBinary( number ) {
    var Schroeppel2 = 0xAAAAAAAA;
    // Convert to NegaBinary String
    return ( ( number + Schroeppel2 ) ^ Schroeppel2 ).toString(2);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====To negaquaternary====
The conversion to ''negaquaternary'' (base −4; digits &lt;math&gt;\in \; \{0, 1, 2, 3\}&lt;/math&gt;) allows a similar shortcut (C implementation):
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
unsigned int toNegaQuaternary(unsigned int value) // input in standard binary
{
	unsigned int Schroeppel4 = 0xCCCCCCCC; // = 4/5*((2*4)^8-1) = ...11001100 = ...3030
	return (value + Schroeppel4) ^ Schroeppel4; // eXclusive OR
	// resulting unsigned int to be interpreted as string of elements ε {0,1,2,3} (pairs of bits)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

JavaScript port for the same shortcut calculation: 
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
function toNegaQuaternary( number ) {
    var Schroeppel4 = 0xCCCCCCCC;
    // Convert to NegaQuaternary String
    return ( ( number + Schroeppel4 ) ^ Schroeppel4 ).toString(4);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Arithmetic operations==
The following describes the arithmetic operations for negabinary; calculations in larger bases are similar.

===Addition===
Adding negabinary numbers proceeds bitwise, starting from the [[least significant bit]]s; the bits from each addend are summed with the ([[balanced ternary]]) carry from the previous bit (0 at the LSB). This sum is then decomposed into an output bit and carry for the next iteration as show in the table:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:right;"
! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Sum
! colspan=3 | Output
! rowspan=2 | Comment 
|-
! Bit
! colspan=2 | Carry
|-
| −2 || 010{{sub|−2}} || 0 ||  1 || 01{{sub|−2}}
| style="text-align:left;" | −2 occurs only during subtraction.
|-
| −1 || 011{{sub|−2}} || 1 ||  1 || 01{{sub|−2}}
| style="text-align:left;" |
|-
|  0 || 000{{sub|−2}} || 0 ||  0 || 00{{sub|−2}}
| style="text-align:left;" |
|-
|  1 || 001{{sub|−2}} || 1 ||  0 || 00{{sub|−2}}
| style="text-align:left;" |
|-
|  2 || 110{{sub|−2}} || 0 || −1 || 11{{sub|−2}}
| style="text-align:left;" |
|-
|  3 || 111{{sub|−2}} || 1 || −1 || 11{{sub|−2}}
| style="text-align:left;" | 3 occurs only during addition.
|}

The second row of this table, for instance, expresses the fact that '''−1''' = '''1''' + '''1''' × −2; the fifth row says '''2''' = '''0''' + '''−1''' × −2; etc.

As an example, to add 1010101{{sub|−2}} (1 + 4 + 16 + 64 = 85) and 1110100{{sub|−2}} (4 + 16 − 32 + 64 = 52),

 Carry:          1 −1  0 −1  1 −1  0  0  0
 First addend:         1  0  1  0  1  0  1
 Second addend:        1  1  1  0  1  0  0 +
                --------------------------
 Number:         1 −1  2  0  3 −1  2  0  1
 Bit (result):   1  1  0  0  1  1  0  0  1
 Carry:          0  1 −1  0 −1  1 −1  0  0

so the result is 110011001{{sub|−2}} (1 − 8 + 16 − 128 + 256 = 137).

==== Another method ====
While adding two negabinary numbers, every time a carry is generated an extra carry should be propagated to next bit. Consider same example as above

 Extra carry:       1  1  0  1  0  0  0     
 Carry:          1  0  1  1  0  1  0  0  0
 First addend:         1  0  1  0  1  0  1
 Second addend:        1  1  1  0  1  0  0 +
                --------------------------
 Answer:         1  1  0  0  1  1  0  0  1

==== Negabinary full adder ====
A [[Adder (electronics)|full adder]] circuit can be designed to add numbers in negabinary. The following logic is used to calculate the sum and carries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Francis, Suganda, Shizuhuo |first=Yu, Jutamulia, Yin |date=4 September 2001 |title=Introduction to Information Optics |publisher=Academic Press |page=498 |isbn=9780127748115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s_i = a_i \oplus b_i \oplus c_i^+ \oplus c_i^-&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}^+ = \overline{a_i}\overline{b_i}\overline{c_i^+}c_i^-&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}^- = a_i b_i \overline{c_i^-} + (a_i \oplus b_i)c_i^+ \overline{c_i^-}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Incrementing negabinary numbers ====
Incrementing a negabinary number can be done by using the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1878151/why-does-the-following-formula-increment-a-negabinary-number-number-in-base-2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913101620/http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1878151/why-does-the-following-formula-increment-a-negabinary-number-number-in-base-2 |archivedate=2016-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2x \oplus ((2x \oplus x) + 1)&lt;/math&gt;

===Subtraction===
To subtract, multiply each bit of the second number by −1, and add the numbers, using the same table as above.

As an example, to compute 1101001{{sub|−2}} (1 − 8 − 32 + 64 = 25) minus 1110100{{sub|−2}} (4 + 16 − 32 + 64 = 52),

 Carry:          0  1 −1  1  0  0  0
 First number:   1  1  0  1  0  0  1
 Second number: −1 −1 −1  0 −1  0  0 +
                --------------------
 Number:         0  1 −2  2 −1  0  1
 Bit (result):   0  1  0  0  1  0  1
 Carry:          0  0  1 −1  1  0  0

so the result is 100101{{sub|−2}} (1 + 4 −32 = −27).

Unary negation, {{math|−''x''}}, can be computed as binary subtraction from zero, {{math|0 − ''x''}}.

===Multiplication and division===
Shifting to the left multiplies by −2, shifting to the right divides by −2.

To multiply, multiply like normal [[decimal]] or [[binary numeral system|binary]] numbers, but using the negabinary rules for adding the carry, when adding the numbers.

 First number:                   1  1  1  0  1  1  0
 Second number:                  1  0  1  1  0  1  1 ×
               -------------------------------------
                                 1  1  1  0  1  1  0
                              1  1  1  0  1  1  0
 
                        1  1  1  0  1  1  0
                     1  1  1  0  1  1  0
 
               1  1  1  0  1  1  0                   +
               -------------------------------------
 Carry:        0 −1  0 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1  0 −1  0  0
 Number:       1  0  2  1  2  2  2  3  2  0  2  1  0
 Bit (result): 1  0  0  1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  1  0
 Carry:           0 −1  0 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1  0 −1  0  0

For each column, add ''carry'' to ''number'', and divide the sum by −2, to get the new ''carry'', and the resulting bit as the remainder.

===Comparing negabinary numbers===
It is possible to compare negabinary numbers by slightly adjusting a normal unsigned [[digital comparator|binary comparator]]. When comparing the numbers &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, invert each odd positioned bit of both numbers.
After this, compare &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; using a standard unsigned comparator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murugesan |first=San|date=1977|title=Negabinary arithmetic circuits using binary arithmetic  |journal=Electronic Circuits and Systems, IEE Journal on |publisher=IET |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=77–78 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Root extraction===

--&gt;

==Fractional numbers==
Base {{mvar|−r}} representation may of course be carried beyond the [[radix point]], allowing the representation of non-integral numbers.

As with positive-base systems, terminating representations correspond to fractions where the denominator is a power of the base; repeating representations correspond to other rationals, and for the same reason.

===Non-unique representations===
Unlike positive-base systems, where integers and terminating fractions have non-unique representations (for example, in decimal [[0.999… = 1]]) in negative-base systems the integers have only a single representation.  However, there do exist rationals with non-unique representations. For the digits {0, 1, &amp;hellip;, '''t'''} with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}:=r\!-\!\!1=-b\!-\!\!1&lt;/math&gt; the biggest digit and
:&lt;math&gt;T:=0.\overline{01}_b = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} b^{-2i} = \frac1{b^2-1} = \frac1{r^2-1}&lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;0.\overline{0\mathbf{t}}_b=\mathbf{t}T=\frac{r\!-\!\!1}{r^2-1}=\frac1{r+1}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; as well as
:&lt;math&gt;1.\overline{\mathbf{t}0}_b = 1+\mathbf{t}bT = \frac{(r^2-1)+(r\!-\!\!1)b}{r^2-1}= \frac1{r+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
So every number &lt;math&gt;\frac1{r+1}+z&lt;/math&gt; with a [[Positional notation#Terminating fractions|terminating fraction]] &lt;math&gt;z\in \Z r^{\Z}&lt;/math&gt; added has two distinct representations.

For example, in negaternary, i.e. &lt;math&gt;b=-3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}=2&lt;/math&gt;, there is
: &lt;math&gt;1.\overline{02}_{(-3)} = \frac{5}{4} = 2.\overline{20}_{(-3)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Such non-unique representations can be found by considering the largest and smallest possible representations with integral parts 0 and 1 respectively, and then noting that they are equal. (Indeed, this works with any integral-base system.) The rationals thus non-uniquely expressible are those of form
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{z(r+1) + 1}{b^i(r + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;z,i\in \Z.&lt;/math&gt;

== Imaginary base ==
{{main article|Complex-base system}}

Just as using a negative base allows the representation of negative numbers without an explicit negative sign, using an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] base allows the representation of [[Gaussian integer]]s. [[Donald Knuth]] proposed the [[quater-imaginary base]] (base 2i) in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;D. Knuth. The Art of Computer Programming. Volume 2, 3rd Edition. Addison-Wesley. pp. 205, "Positional Number Systems"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative capability''' was a phrase first used by  [[Romantic poet]] [[John Keats]] in 1817 to characterise the capacity of the greatest writers (particularly Shakespeare) to pursue a vision of artistic beauty even when it leads them into intellectual confusion and uncertainty, as opposed to a preference for philosophical certainty over artistic beauty.  The term has been used by poets and philosophers to describe the ability of the individual to perceive, think, and operate beyond any presupposition of a predetermined capacity of the human being.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=no citation offered.}}

==Keats: The poet's turn of phrase==
Keats used the phrase only briefly in a private letter, and it became known only after his correspondence was collected and published.  In a letter to his brothers, George and Thomas, on 21 December 1817, Keats described a conversation he had been engaged in a few days previously:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Li|first=Ou|title=Keats and Negative Capability|year=2009|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I had not a dispute but a disquisition with [[Charles Wentworth Dilke|Dilke]], upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, and at once it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, especially in Literature, and which [[Shakespeare]] possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keats | first = John | title = The Complete Poetical Works and Letters of John Keats, Cambridge Edition | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin and Company | year = 1899 | page=277| isbn = 978-1-146-96754-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] was, by 1817, a frequent target of criticism by the younger poets of Keats's generation, often ridiculed for his infatuation with German idealistic philosophy.  Against Coleridge's obsession with philosophical truth, Keats sets up the model of Shakespeare, whose poetry articulated various points of view and never advocated a particular vision of truth.

Keats's ideas here, as was usually the case in his letters, were expressed tersely with no effort to fully expound what he meant, but passages from other letters enlarge on the same theme.  In a letter to J.H. Reynolds in February, 1818, he wrote:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us—and if we do not agree, seems to put its hand in its breeches pocket. Poetry should be great &amp; unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keats | first = John | title = The Complete Poetical Works and Letters of John Keats, Cambridge Edition | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin and Company | year = 1899 | page=314| isbn = 978-1-146-96754-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another letter to Reynolds the following May, he contrived the metaphor of 'the chamber of maiden thought' and the notion of the 'burden of mystery', which together express much the same idea as that of negative capability:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I compare human life to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, the doors of the rest being as yet shut upon me—The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think—We remain there a long while, and notwithstanding the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle—within us—we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the heart and nature of Man—of convincing ones nerves that the World is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness, and oppression—whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd and at the same time on all sides of it many doors are set open—but all dark—all leading to dark passages—We see not the balance of good and evil.  We are in a Mist—We are now in that state—We feel the 'burden of the Mystery,' To this point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive when he wrote 'Tintern Abbey' and it seems to me that his Genius is explorative of those dark Passages.  Now if we live, and go on thinking, we too shall explore them.  he is a Genius and superior to us, in so far as he can, more than we, make discoveries, and shed a light in them—Here I must think Wordsworth is deeper than Milton[.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keats | first = John | title = The Complete Poetical Works and Letters of John Keats, Cambridge Edition | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin and Company | year = 1899 | page=326| isbn = 978-1-146-96754-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Keats understood Coleridge as searching for a single, higher-order truth or solution to the mysteries of the natural world. He went on to find the same fault in Dilke and Wordsworth. All these poets, he claimed, lacked objectivity and universality in their view of the human condition and the natural world. In each case, Keats found a mind which was a narrow private path, not a "thoroughfare for all thoughts". Lacking for Keats were the central and indispensable qualities requisite for flexibility and openness to the world, or what he referred to as negative capability.&lt;ref&gt;Wigod, Jacob D. 1952. "Negative Capability and Wise Passiveness." PMLA 67 (4) (1 June): 384–386&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept of Negative Capability is precisely a rejection of set philosophies and preconceived systems of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, N. (1966). Negative Capability in Keats's Diction. Keats-Shelley Journal, 15, 59-68. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/30209856&lt;/ref&gt; He demanded that the poet be receptive rather than searching for fact or reason, and to not seek absolute knowledge of every truth, mystery, or doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Goellnicht, Donald.

&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known why Keats settled on the phrase 'negative capability', but some scholars have hypothesized that Keats was influenced in his studies of medicine and chemistry, and that it refers to the [[electric polarity|negative pole]] of an [[electric current]] which is passive and receptive. In the same way that the negative pole receives the current from the positive pole, the poet receives impulses from a world that is full of mystery and doubt, which cannot be explained but which the poet can translate into art.&lt;ref&gt;Goellnicht, Donald. "Negative Capability and Wise Passiveness" MA Thesis. (McMaster University, 1976), 13. http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/opendissertations/4675.

==Unger: The thesis of negative capability==
[[Roberto Unger]] appropriated Keats' term in order to explain resistance to rigid social divisions and hierarchies. For Unger, ''negative capability'' is the "denial of whatever in our contexts delivers us over to a fixed scheme of division and hierarchy and to an enforced choice between routine and rebellion." It is thus through ''negative capability'' that we can further empower ourselves against social and institutional constraints, and loosen the bonds that entrap us in a certain social station.&lt;ref name="fn"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=279–280, 632| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of negative capability can be seen at work in industrial innovation. In order to create an innovator's advantage and develop new forms of economic enterprise, the modern industrialist could not just become more efficient with surplus extraction based on pre-existing work roles, but rather needed to invent new styles of flexible labor, expertise, and capital management. The industrialist needed to bring people together in new and innovative ways and redefine work roles and workplace organization. The modern factory had to at once stabilize its productive environment by inventing new restraints upon labor, such as length of the work day and division of tasks, but at the same time could not be too severe or risk being at a disadvantage to competitors, e.g. not being able to shift production tasks or capacity. Those industrialists and managers who were able to break old forms of organizational arrangements exercised negative capability.&lt;ref name="fn 299"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=299–301| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thesis of ''negative capability'' is a key component in Unger's theory of [[false necessity]] and [[formative context]]. The theory of false necessity claims that our social worlds are the artifact of our own human endeavors. There is no pre-set institutional arrangement that our societies adhere to, and there is no necessary historical mold of development that they will follow. Rather we are free to choose and develop the forms and the paths that our societies will take through a process of conflicts and resolutions. However, there are groups of institutional arrangements that work together to bring out certain institutional forms, liberal democracy, for example. These forms are the basis of a social structure, and which Unger calls formative contexts. In order to explain how we move from one formative context to another without the conventional social theory constraints of historical necessity (e.g. feudalism to capitalism), and to do so while remaining true to the key insight of individual human empowerment and [[anti-necessitarian social thought]], Unger recognized that there are an infinite number of ways of resisting social and institutional constraints, which can lead to an infinite number of outcomes. This variety of forms of resistance and [[empowered democracy|empowerment]] (i.e. negative capability) make change possible.&lt;ref name="fn 35"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=35–36, 164, 169, 278–80, 299–301| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thesis of ''negative capability'' addresses the problem of [[agency (sociology)|agency]] in relation to [[social structure|structure]]. It recognizes the constraints of structure and its molding influence upon the individual, but at the same time finds the individual able to resist, deny, and transcend their context. Unlike other theories of [[structure and agency]], ''negative capability'' does not reduce the individual to a simple actor possessing only the dual capacity of compliance or rebellion, but rather sees him as able to partake in a variety of activities of self empowerment.&lt;ref name="fn 282"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=282| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bion==
The twentieth-century British psychoanalyst [[Wilfred Bion]] elaborated on Keats's term to illustrate an attitude of openness of mind which he considered of central importance, not only in the psychoanalytic session, but in life itself.&lt;ref&gt;Joan and Neville Symington, ''The Clinical Thinking of Wilfrid Bion'' (1996) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; For Bion, negative capability was the ability to tolerate the pain and confusion of not knowing, rather than imposing ready-made or omnipotent certainties upon an ambiguous situation or emotional challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Meg Harris Williams, ''The Aesthetic Development'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; His idea has been taken up more widely in the British Independent School,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 10 and p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt; as well as elsewhere in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychoanalysisdownunder.com.au/issues/8/papers/106]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the context of Zen ==
The notion of negative capability has been associated with the Zen philosophy.  Keats' man of negative capability had qualities that enabled him to "lose his self-identity, his 'imaginative identification' with and submission to things, and his power to achieve a unity with life". The Zen concept of [[satori]] is the outcome of passivity and receptivity, culminating in "sudden insight into the character of the real".  Satori is reached without deliberate striving. The antecedent stages to satori: quest, search, ripening and explosion. The "quest" stage is accompanied by a strong feeling of uneasiness, resembling the capacity to practice negative capability while the mind is in a state of "uncertainties, mysteries and doubts". In the explosive stage (akin to Keats' 'chief intensity'), a man of negative capability effects a "fellowship with essence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benton|first=R. P.|date=1966|title=Keats and Zen. Philosophy East and West|url=|journal=Philosophy East and West, 16(1/2), pp. 33–47|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Stanley Fish]] has expressed strong reservations about the attempt to apply the concept of negative capability to social contexts. He has written in critique of Unger's early work as being unable to chart a route for the idea to pass into reality, which leaves history closed and the individual holding onto the concept while kicking against air. Fish finds the capability Unger invokes in his early works unimaginable and unmanufacturable that can only be expressed outright in blatant speech, or obliquely in concept.&lt;ref&gt;S. Fish, "Unger and Milton", in ''Doing What Comes Naturally'' (1989): 430&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, Fish finds the idea of radical culture as an oppositional ideal in which context is continuously refined or rejected impracticable at best, and impossible at worst.&lt;ref&gt;H. Avram Veeser ed., ''The Stanley Fish Reader'' (Oxford 1999) p.216-7&lt;/ref&gt; Unger has addressed these criticisms by developing a full theory of historical process in which negative capability is employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative pledge''' is a provision in a [[contract]] which prohibits a party to the contract from creating any [[security interest]]s over certain property specified in the provision.

Negative pledges often appear in security documents, where they operate to prohibit the person who is granting the security interest from creating any other security interests over the same property, which might compete with (or rank ''[[pari passu]]'' with) the security of the first [[secured creditor]] under the security document in which the negative pledge appears.

In Australia, negative pledge lending took off after a substantial deal by [[Hanson Australia|Pioneer Concrete]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trevor Sykes]], ''The Bold Riders'', second edition, 1996, {{ISBN|1-86448-184-6}}, pages 7-10&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a new way of lending, which allowed the banks to lend to corporations, something previously the domain of life insurers.

Negative pledge clauses are almost universal in modern unsecured commercial loan documents. The purpose is to ensure that a borrower, having taken out an [[unsecured loan]], cannot subsequently take out another loan with a different lender, securing the subsequent loan on the specified assets. If the borrower could do this, the original lender would be disadvantaged because the subsequent lender would have first call on the assets in an [[event of default]].

A '''negative pregnant''' (sometimes called a '''pregnant denial''') refers to a denial which implies its affirmative opposite by seeming to deny only a qualification of the allegation and not the allegation itself.  For example, "I deny that I owe the plaintiff five hundred dollars" might imply that the person making the statement owes some other sum of money, and was only denying that they owe that particular amount.  

A negative pregnant which appears in [[pleading]]s will often elicit a request for [[further and better particulars]], or an [[interrogatory]].  In order to avoid a negative pregnant in the above example, one might instead say, "I deny that I owe the plaintiff five hundred dollars, or any other sum of money."

The issue can also arise in the context of [[statutory interpretation]]. For instance, Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] argues in his dissent to ''EEOC v. Aramco''&lt;ref&gt;''EEOC v. Aramco'' , 499 U.S. 244 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; that the presumption against [[extraterritoriality]] is rebutted by a negative inference from the alien-exemption provision of [[Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which states that Title VII "shall not apply to an employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside any State." Marshall concludes that "Absent an intention that Title VII ''apply'' 'outside any State,' Congress would have had no reason to craft this extraterritorial exemption. And because only discrimination against aliens is exempted, employers remain accountable for discrimination against United States citizens abroad." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/89-1838.ZD.html  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Arabian American Oil Co. (89-1838), at Cornell Legal Information Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15337">The [[probability]] of the outcome of an experiment is never negative, although a [[quasiprobability distribution]] allows a '''negative probability''', or '''quasiprobability''' for some events. These distributions may apply to unobservable events or conditional probabilities.

==Physics and mathematics==
In 1942, [[Paul Dirac]] wrote a paper "The Physical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1942.0023|pages=1–39|jstor=97777|title=Bakerian Lecture. The Physical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=180|issue=980|year=1942|last1=Dirac|first1=P. A. M.|bibcode=1942RSPSA.180....1D}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he introduced the concept of [[negative energy|negative energies]] and negative [[probabilities]]:

: "Negative energies and probabilities should not be considered as nonsense.  They are well-defined concepts mathematically, like a negative of money."

The idea of negative probabilities later received increased attention in physics and particularly in [[quantum mechanics]].  [[Richard Feynman]] argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feynman |first=Richard P. |date=1987 |editor1-last=Peat |editor1-first=F. David |editor2-last=Hiley |editor2-first=Basil |title=Quantum Implications: Essays in Honour of David Bohm |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd |pages=235–248 |chapter=Negative Probability |isbn=978-0415069601 |chapter-url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/154856/files/pre-27827.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; that no one objects to using negative numbers in calculations: although "minus three apples" is not a valid concept in real life, negative money is valid. Similarly he argued how negative probabilities as well as probabilities above [[1 (number)|unity]] possibly could be useful in probability [[calculations]].

Mark Burgin gives another example:
{{quote|"Let us consider the situation when an attentive person A with the high knowledge of English writes some text T. We may ask what the probability is for the word “texxt” or “wrod” to appear in his text T. Conventional probability theory gives 0 as the answer. However, we all know that there are usually misprints. So, due to such a misprint this word may appear but then it would be corrected. In terms of extended probability, a negative value (say, −0.1) of the probability for the word “texxt” to appear in his text T means that this word may appear due to a misprint but then it’ll be corrected and will not be present in the text T."|Mark Burgin|{{cite arXiv  |authorlink= |eprint=1008.1287 |title= Interpretations of Negative Probabilities|class= physics.data-an|year= 2010|version= |last1= Burgin|first1= Mark}}  }}

Negative probabilities have later been suggested to solve several problems and [[paradoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A. Y. (1997): ''Non-Archimedean Analysis: Quantum Paradoxes, Dynamical Systems and Biological Models''. Kluwer Academic Publishers. {{ISBN|0-7923-4800-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Half-coins'' provide simple examples for negative probabilities. These strange coins were introduced in 2005 by [[Gábor J. Székely]].&lt;ref&gt;Székely, G.J. (2005) [http://www.wilmott.com/pdfs/100609_gjs.pdf Half of a Coin: Negative Probabilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108010759/http://www.wilmott.com/pdfs/100609_gjs.pdf |date=2013-11-08 }}, Wilmott Magazine July, pp 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Half-coins have infinitely many sides numbered with 0,1,2,... and the positive even numbers are taken with negative probabilities. Two half-coins make a complete coin in the sense that if we flip two half-coins then the sum of the outcomes is 0 or 1 with probability 1/2 as if we simply flipped a fair coin.

In ''[[Convolution quotient]]s of nonnegative definite functions''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages= 235–239|doi=10.1007/BF01352002|title=Convolution quotients of nonnegative functions|journal=Monatshefte für Mathematik|volume=95|issue=3|year=1983|last1=Ruzsa|first1=Imre Z.|last2=SzéKely|first2=Gábor J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Algebraic Probability Theory'' &lt;ref&gt;Ruzsa, I.Z. and Székely, G.J. (1988): ''Algebraic Probability Theory'', Wiley, New York {{ISBN|0-471-91803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Imre Z. Ruzsa]] and [[Gábor J. Székely]] proved that if a [[random variable]] X has a signed or quasi distribution where some of the probabilities are negative then one can always find two random variables, Y and Z, with ordinary (not signed / not quasi) distributions such that X, Y are independent and X + Y = Z in distribution. Thus X can always be interpreted as the "difference" of two ordinary random variables, Z and Y. If Y is interpreted as a measurement error of X and the observed value is Z then the negative regions of the distribution of X are masked / shielded by the error Y.

Another example known as the Wigner distribution in [[phase space formulation|phase space]], introduced by [[Eugene Wigner]] in 1932 to study quantum corrections, often leads to negative probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=749–759|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.40.749|title=On the Quantum Correction for Thermodynamic Equilibrium|journal=Physical Review|volume=40|issue=5|year=1932|last1=Wigner|first1=E.|bibcode=1932PhRv...40..749W}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it has later been better known as the [[Wigner quasiprobability distribution]]. In 1945, [[M. S. Bartlett]] worked out the mathematical and logical consistency of such negative valuedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bartlett | first=  M. S.| year = 1945| title= Negative Probability | journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 41| pages=  71–73 | doi = 10.1017/S0305004100022398|bibcode = 1945PCPS...41...71B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wigner distribution function is routinely used in [[physics]] nowadays, and provides the cornerstone of [[Weyl quantization|phase-space quantization]]. Its negative features are an asset to the formalism, and often indicate quantum interference.  The negative regions of the distribution are shielded from direct observation by the quantum [[uncertainty principle]]: typically, the moments of such a non-positive-semidefinite quasiprobability distribution are highly constrained, and prevent ''direct measurability'' of the negative regions of the distribution. But these regions contribute negatively and crucially to the [[expected value]]s of observable quantities computed through such distributions, nevertheless.

=== An example: the double slit experiment ===

Consider a double slit experiment with photons. The two waves exiting each slit can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;f_1(x) = \sqrt{\frac{dN/dt}{2\pi/d}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}}\exp\left[i(h/\lambda)\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;f_2(x) = \sqrt{\frac{dN/dt}{2\pi/d}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}}\exp\left[i(h/\lambda)\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the distance to the detection screen, ''a'' is the separation between the two slits, ''x'' the distance to the center of the screen, ''λ'' the wavelength and ''dN/dt'' is the number of photons emitted per unit time at the source. The amplitude of measuring a photon at distance ''x'' from the center of the screen is the sum of these two amplitudes coming out of each hole, and therefore the probability that a photon is detected at position ''x'' will be given by the square of this sum:

[[File:Negative joint probability 2.svg|thumb|In blue, the sum of the probabilities of going through holes 1 and 2; in red, minus the joint probability of going through "both holes". The interference pattern is obtained by adding the two curves.]]whatever the last term means. Indeed, if one closes either one of the holes forcing the photon to go through the other slit, the two corresponding intensities are

&lt;math&gt;I_1(x) = \left\vert f_1(x) \right\vert^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;I_2(x) = \left\vert f_2(x) \right\vert^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

But now, if one does interpret each of these terms in this way, the joint probability takes negative values roughly every &lt;math&gt;\lambda\frac{d}{a}&lt;/math&gt; !&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} I_{12}(x) &amp; = \left[f_1^*(x)f_2(x)+f_1(x)f_2^*(x)\right] \\ &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}}\sin\left[(h/\lambda)(\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}-\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2})\right] \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

However, these negative probabilities are never observed as one can't isolate the cases in which the photon "goes through both slits", but can hint at the existence of anti-particles.

== Finance ==

Negative probabilities have more recently been applied to [[mathematical finance]]. In quantitative finance most probabilities are not real probabilities but pseudo probabilities, often what is known as [[risk neutral]] probabilities.{{clarify|date=March 2015}} These are not real probabilities, but theoretical "probabilities" under a series of assumptions that helps simplify calculations by allowing such pseudo probabilities to be negative in certain cases as first pointed out by Espen Gaarder Haug in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Haug, E. G. (2004): [http://www.espenhaug.com/NegativeProbabilitiesHaug.pdf Why so Negative to Negative Probabilities], Wilmott Magazine, Re-printed in the book (2007); Derivatives Models on Models, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

A rigorous mathematical definition of negative probabilities and their properties was recently derived by Mark Burgin and Gunter Meissner (2011). The authors also show how negative probabilities can be applied to financial [[option pricing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1773077  Burgin and Meissner: Negative Probabilities in Financial Modeling] Wilmott Magazine March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of negative probabilities have also been proposed for reliable facility location models where facilities are subject to negatively correlated disruption risks when facility locations, customer allocation, and backup service plans are determined simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=L.V.|last2=Daskin|first2=M.S.|date=2005|title=Reliability Models for Facility Location: The Expected Failure Cost Case|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/trsc.1040.0107|journal=Transportation Science|volume=39|issue=3|pages=400–416|doi=10.1287/trsc.1040.0107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cui|first=T.|last2=Ouyang|first2=Y.|last3=Shen|first3=Z-J.

This approach reduces a problem from one with correlated disruptions to one without. Xie et al.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=S.|last2=Li|first2=X.|last3=Ouyang|first3=Y.|date=|year=2015|title=Decomposition of general facility disruption correlations via augmentation of virtual supporting stations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261515001290|journal=Transportation Research Part B|volume=80|pages=64–81|doi=10.1016/j.trb.2015.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; later showed how negatively correlated disruptions can also be addressed by the same modeling framework, except that a supporting station now may be disrupted with a “failure propensity” which

“... inherits all mathematical characteristics and properties of a failure probability except that we allow it to be larger than 1...”

This finding paves ways for using compact mixed-integer mathematical programs to optimally design reliable location of service facilities under site-dependent and positive/negative/mixed disruption correlations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=S.|last2=An|first2=K.|last3=Ouyang|first3=Y.|date=2017|title=Planning of Facility Location under Correlated Facility Disruptions|url=|journal=Under Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed “propensity” concept in Xie et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; turns out to be what Feynman and others referred to as “quasi-probability.” Note that when a quasi-probability is larger than 1, then 1 minus this value gives a negative probability. The truly physically verifiable observation is the facility disruption states, and there is no direct information on the station states or their corresponding probabilities. Hence the failure probability of the stations, interpreted as “probabilities of imagined intermediary states,” could exceed unity.

* Existence of states of negative norm (or fields with the wrong sign of the kinetic term, such as [[Pauli–Villars regularization|Pauli–Villars ghosts]]) allows the probabilities to be negative. See [[Ghosts (physics)]].

Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current &lt;math&gt;v/i\,&lt;/math&gt;, and ''differential resistance'', the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;. The term negative resistance means '''negative differential resistance (NDR)''', &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. In general, a negative differential resistance is a two-terminal component which can [[amplifier|amplify]],&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;"''In semiconductor physics, it is known that if a two-terminal device shows negative differential resistance it can amplify.''" {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of devices with negative differential resistance are [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, and [[gas discharge tube]]s such as [[neon lamp]]s. In addition, circuits containing amplifying devices such as [[transistor]]s and [[op amp]]s with [[positive feedback]] can have negative differential resistance. These are used in [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] and [[active filter]]s.

Because they are nonlinear, negative resistance devices have a more complicated behavior than the positive "ohmic" resistances usually encountered in [[electric circuit]]s. Unlike most positive resistances, negative resistance varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and negative resistance devices can have negative resistance over only a limited portion of their voltage or current range.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; Therefore, there is no real "negative resistor" analogous to a positive [[resistor]], which has a constant negative resistance over an arbitrarily wide range of current.

The [[electrical resistance|resistance]] between two terminals of an electrical device or circuit is determined by its current–voltage (''I–V'') curve ([[current–voltage characteristic|characteristic curve]]), giving the current &lt;math&gt;i\,&lt;/math&gt; through it for any given voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; across it.&lt;ref name="Herrick"&gt;{{cite book

The resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, the inverse slope of the line (in ''I–V'' graphs where the voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is the independent variable) and is constant.

Negative resistance occurs in a few [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] (nonohmic) devices.&lt;ref name="Haisch"&gt;{{cite web

One way in which the different types of resistance can be distinguished is in the directions of current and electric power between a circuit and an electronic component. The illustrations below, with a rectangle representing the component attached to a circuit, summarize how the different types work:

|-
| The voltage '''''v''''' and current '''''i''''' variables in an electrical component must be defined according to the [[passive sign convention]]; positive [[conventional current]] is defined to enter the positive voltage terminal; this means power '''''P''''' flowing from the circuit into the component is defined to be positive, while power flowing from the component into the circuit is negative.&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt; This applies to both DC and AC current.

The device consumes DC power, some of which is converted to AC signal power which can be delivered to a load in the external circuit,&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; enabling the device to amplify the AC signal applied to it.&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; || [[File:Negative differential resistance animation.gif|150px]]

In an electronic device, the differential resistance &lt;math&gt;r_\text{diff}\,&lt;/math&gt;, the static resistance &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\,&lt;/math&gt;, or both, can be negative,&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; so there are three categories of devices ''(fig. 2–4 above, and table)'' which could be called "negative resistances".

}} In this video Prof. Horowitz demonstrates that negative static resistance actually exists. He has a black box with two terminals, labelled "−10 kilohms" and shows with ordinary test equipment that it acts like a linear negative resistor (active resistor) with a resistance of −10 KΩ: a positive voltage across it causes a proportional ''negative'' current through it, and when connected in a voltage divider with an ordinary resistor the output of the divider is greater than the input, it can amplify. At the end he opens the box and shows it contains an op-amp negative impedance converter circuit and battery.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Unlike in the above devices, the downward-sloping region of the ''I–V'' curve passes through the origin, so it lies in the 2nd and 4th quadrants of the plane, meaning the device sources power.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; Amplifying devices like [[transistor]]s and [[op-amp]]s with positive [[feedback]] can have this type of negative resistance,&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pippard3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisson"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Battery and resistor circuit 2.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|From [[Kirchhoff's voltage law|KVL]], the static resistance of a power source (''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;), such as a battery, is always equal to the negative of the static resistance of its load (''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt; ]]

However it is easily shown that the ratio of voltage to current '''''v/i''''' at the terminals of any power source (AC or DC) is negative.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt; For electric power ([[potential energy]]) to flow out of a device into the circuit, charge must flow through the device in the direction of increasing potential energy, [[conventional current]] (positive charge) must move from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; So the direction of the instantaneous current is ''out'' of the positive terminal. This is opposite to the direction of current in a passive device defined by the [[passive sign convention]] so the current and voltage have opposite signs, and their ratio is negative
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{static} = \frac {v}{i} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
This can also be proved from [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]]&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = iv = i^2 R_\mathrm{static} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that power can flow out of a device into the circuit {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;P\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;)}} if and only if &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; Whether or not this quantity is referred to as "resistance" when negative is a matter of convention. The absolute resistance of power sources is negative,&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; but this is not to be regarded as "resistance" in the same sense as positive resistances. The negative static resistance of a power source is a rather abstract and not very useful quantity, because it varies with the load. Due to [[conservation of energy]] it is always simply equal to the negative of the static resistance of the attached circuit ''(right)''.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;

[[Work (physics)|Work]] must be done on the charges by some source of energy in the device, to make them move toward the positive terminal against the electric field, so [[conservation of energy]] requires that negative static resistances have a source of power.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar"&gt;{{cite book

This derives a slightly more complicated circuit where the two voltage divider resistors are different to allow scaling, but it reduces to the text circuit by setting ''R2'' and ''R3'' in the source to ''R1'' in the text, and ''R1'' in source to ''Z'' in the text. The ''I–V'' curve is the same.&lt;/ref&gt; will reverse the direction of current flow, making its static resistance positive so it consumes power. Similarly, applying a voltage to the negative impedance converter below greater than its power supply voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; will cause the amplifier to saturate, also making its resistance positive.

The ''I–V'' curve is [[monotonic|nonmonotonic]] (having peaks and troughs) with regions of negative slope representing negative differential resistance.

[[Passivity (engineering)|Passive]] negative differential resistances have positive ''static'' resistance;&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; they consume net power. Therefore, the ''I–V'' curve is confined to the 1st and 3rd quadrants of the graph,&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; and passes through the origin. This requirement means (excluding some asymptotic cases) that the region(s) of negative resistance must be limited,&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; and surrounded by regions of positive resistance, and cannot include the origin.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;

The reason is that in [[linear circuit]]s if the load line crosses the I-V curve of the NR device at one point, the circuit is stable, while in nonlinear switching circuits that operate by [[hysteresis]] the same condition causes the circuit to become unstable and oscillate as an [[astable multivibrator]], and the [[bistability|bistable]] region is considered the "stable" one. This article uses the former "linear" definition, the earliest one, which is found in the Abraham, Bangert, Dorf, Golio, and Tellegen sources. The latter "switching circuit" definition is found in the Kumar and Taub sources.&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''N'''" type): In this type the current is a [[single-valued function|single valued]], [[continuous function]] of the voltage, but the voltage is a [[multivalued function]] of the current.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; In the most common type there is only one negative resistance region, and the graph is a curve shaped generally like the letter "N". As the voltage is increased, the current increases (positive resistance) until it reaches a maximum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), then decreases in the region of negative resistance to a minimum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then increases again.

An intrinsic parameter used to compare different devices is the ''peak-to-valley current ratio'' (PVR),&lt;ref name="Franz" /&gt; the ratio of the current at the top of the negative resistance region to the current at the bottom ''(see graphs, above)'':
:&lt;math&gt;\text{PVR} = i_1 / i_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
The larger this is, the larger the potential AC output for a given DC bias current, and therefore the greater the efficiency

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel diode ''TD'' has voltage controlled negative differential resistance.&lt;ref name="Fogiel" /&gt; The battery &lt;math&gt;V_b&lt;/math&gt; adds a constant voltage (bias) across the diode so it operates in its negative resistance range, and provides power to amplify the signal. Suppose the negative resistance at the bias point is &lt;math&gt;\Delta v /\Delta i\,=\,-r&lt;/math&gt;. For stability &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Using the formula for a [[voltage divider]], the AC output voltage is&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_o = \frac{-r}{R-r}v_i = \frac{r}{r-R}v_i \,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;so the [[voltage gain]] is &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;G_v = \frac{r}{r-R} \,&lt;/math&gt;
In a normal voltage divider, the resistance of each branch is less than the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage is less than the input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance &lt;math&gt;r - R\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than the resistance of the diode alone &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; so the AC output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_o&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the input &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage gain &lt;math&gt;G_v\,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, and increases without limit as &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NDR acts as a dependent AC [[current source]] of value Δ''i'' = Δ''v''/''r''. Because the current and voltage are 180° out of phase, the instantaneous AC current Δ''i'' flows ''out'' of the terminal with positive AC voltage Δ''v''. Therefore it adds to the AC source current Δ''i''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; through the load ''R'', increasing the output power.&lt;ref name="Lowry" /&gt;

The diagrams illustrate how a biased negative differential resistance device can increase the power of a signal applied to it, amplifying it, although it only has two terminals. Due to the [[superposition principle]] the voltage and current at the device's terminals can be divided into a DC bias component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;V_{bias},\;I_{bias}&lt;/math&gt;)}} and an AC component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\Delta v,\;\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;)}}.
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = V_\text{bias} + \Delta v(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = I_\text{bias} + \Delta i(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Since a positive change in voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; causes a ''negative'' change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current and voltage in the device are 180° [[out of phase]].&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radmanesh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web

Unlike in a [[two port]] amplifying device such as a transistor or op amp, the amplified signal leaves the device through the same two terminals ([[two port|port]]) as the input signal enters.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

In a passive device, the AC power produced comes from the input DC bias current,&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; the device absorbs DC power, some of which is converted to AC power by the nonlinearity of the device, amplifying the applied signal.

The reason that the output signal can leave a negative resistance through the same port that the input signal enters is that from [[transmission line]] theory, the AC voltage or current at the terminals of a component can be divided into two oppositely moving waves, the ''incident wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_I\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels toward the device, and the ''reflected wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_R\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels away from the device.&lt;ref name="Bowick"&gt;{{cite book

The DC load line (DCL) is a straight line determined by the DC bias circuit, with equation
:&lt;math&gt;V = V_S - IR\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_S&lt;/math&gt; is the DC bias supply voltage and R is the resistance of the supply. The possible DC operating point(s) ([[Q point]]s) occur where the DC load line intersects the ''I–V'' curve. For stability&lt;ref name="Krugman" /&gt;
*VCNRs require a low impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}}, such as a [[voltage source]].
*CCNRs require a high impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}} such as a [[current source]], or voltage source in series with a high resistance.
The AC load line (''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a straight line through the Q point whose slope is the differential (AC) resistance &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; facing the device. Increasing &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; rotates the load line counterclockwise. The circuit operates in one of three possible regions ''(see diagrams)'', depending on &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;
*'''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;Stable region (green)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): When the load line lies in this region, it intersects the ''I–V'' curve at one point ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; For nonreactive circuits it is a [[stability theory|stable equilibrium]] ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in the LHP) so the circuit is stable. Negative resistance [[amplifier]]s operate in this region. However, due to [[hysteresis]], with an energy storage device like a capacitor or inductor the circuit can become unstable to make a nonlinear [[relaxation oscillator]] ([[astable multivibrator]]) or a [[monostable multivibrator]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22negative+resistance Gottlieb 1997 ''Practical Oscillator Handbook'', pp. 105–108] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515053022/https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC |date=2016-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**VCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
**CCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''Unstable point''' (Line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): When &lt;math&gt;R_L\;=\;r&lt;/math&gt; the load line is tangent to the ''I–V'' curve. The total differential (AC) resistance of the circuit is zero (poles on the ''jω'' axis), so it is unstable and with a [[tuned circuit]] can oscillate. Linear [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] operate at this point. Practical oscillators actually start in the unstable region below, with poles in the RHP, but as the amplitude increases the oscillations become nonlinear, and due to ''eventual passivity'' the negative resistance ''r'' decreases with increasing amplitude, so the oscillations stabilize at an amplitude where&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R_L&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Bistable region (red)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): In this region the load line can intersect the ''I–V'' curve at three points.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; The center point (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is a point of [[unstable equilibrium]] (poles in the RHP), while the two outer points, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[stable equilibria]]. So with correct biasing the circuit can be [[bistability|bistable]], it will converge to one of the two points ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and can be switched between them with an input pulse. Switching circuits like [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s ([[bistable multivibrator]]s) and [[Schmidt trigger]]s operate in this region.
**VCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;
**CCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;

In circuit theory these are called "active resistors".&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kouřil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miano" /&gt; Applying a voltage across the terminals causes a proportional current ''out'' of the positive terminal, the opposite of an ordinary resistor.&lt;ref name="Crisson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HorowitzVideo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; For example, connecting a battery to the terminals would cause the battery to [[rechargeable battery|charge]] rather than discharge.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

Considered as one-port devices, these circuits function similarly to the passive negative differential resistance components above, and like them can be used to make one-port amplifiers and oscillators&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; with the advantages that:
*because they are active devices they do not require an external DC bias to provide power, and can be [[DC coupling|DC coupled]],

*they can be linear circuit elements;&lt;ref name="Groszkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimopoulos" /&gt; if operation is confined to the straight segment of the curve near the origin the voltage is proportional to the current, so they do not cause [[harmonic distortion]].
The ''I–V'' curve can have voltage-controlled ("N" type) or current-controlled ("S" type) negative resistance, depending on whether the feedback loop is connected in "shunt" or "series".&lt;ref name="Crisson" /&gt;

===Q enhancement===
A tuned circuit connected to a negative resistance which cancels some but not all of its parasitic loss resistance (so &lt;math&gt;|R_\text{if}|\;&lt;\;r_\text{loss}&lt;/math&gt;) will not oscillate, but the negative resistance will decrease the damping in the circuit (moving its [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s toward the ''jω'' axis), increasing its [[Q factor]] so it has a narrower [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and more [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite conference

:&lt;math&gt;v_o = v(R_1 + R_1)/R_1 = 2v \,&lt;/math&gt;
So if a voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the input, the same voltage is applied "backwards" across &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, causing current to flow through it out of the input.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The current is
:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac {v - v_o}{Z} = \frac {v - 2v}{Z} = - \frac {v}{Z} \, &lt;/math&gt;
So the input impedance to the circuit is&lt;ref name="Muthuswamy" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{in} = \frac {v}{i} = -Z \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The circuit converts the impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to its negative. If &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a resistor of value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, within the linear range of the op amp &lt;math&gt;V_\text{S}/2\;&lt;\;v\;&lt;\;-V_\text{S}/2&lt;/math&gt; the input impedance acts like a linear "negative resistor" of value &lt;math&gt;-R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The input port of the circuit is connected into another circuit as if it was a component. An NIC can cancel undesired positive resistance in another circuit,&lt;ref name="Maxim"&gt;{{cite web

===Negative capacitance and inductance===
By replacing &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in the above circuit with a capacitor {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;) or inductor (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;)}}, negative capacitances and inductances can also be synthesized.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; A negative capacitance will have an ''I–V'' relation and an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{C}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;i = -C {dv \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_C = -1/j\omega C \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Applying a positive current to a negative capacitance will cause it to ''discharge''; its voltage will ''decrease''. Similarly, a negative inductance will have an ''I–V'' characteristic and impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{L}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;v = -L {di \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_L = -j\omega L \,&lt;/math&gt;
A circuit having negative capacitance or inductance can be used to cancel unwanted positive capacitance or inductance in another circuit.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; NIC circuits were used to cancel reactance on telephone cables.

There is also another way of looking at them. In a negative capacitance the current will be 180° opposite in phase to the current in a positive capacitance. Instead of leading the voltage by 90° it will lag the voltage by 90°, as in an inductor.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Therefore, a negative capacitance acts like an inductance in which the impedance has a reverse dependence on frequency ω; decreasing instead of increasing like a real inductance&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Similarly a negative inductance acts like a capacitance that has an impedance which increases with frequency. Negative capacitances and inductances are "non-Foster" circuits which violate [[Foster's reactance theorem]].&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in modern high frequency oscillators, transistors are increasingly used as one-port negative resistance devices like diodes. At microwave frequencies, transistors with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable due to internal feedback and show negative resistance at the other port.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt; So high frequency transistor oscillators are designed by applying a reactive load to one port to give the transistor negative resistance, and connecting the other port across a resonator to make a negative resistance oscillator as described below.&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

''DCL'': DC load line, which sets the Q point.&lt;br /&gt;
''SSL'': negative resistance during startup while amplitude is small. Since &lt;math&gt;r\;&lt;\;R&lt;/math&gt; poles are in RHP and amplitude of oscillations increases.&lt;br /&gt;
''LSL'': large-signal load line. When the current swing approaches the edges of the negative resistance region ''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;(green)&lt;/span&gt;'', the sine wave peaks are distorted ("clipped") and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; decreases until it equals &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. ]]

The common [[Gunn diode]] oscillator ''(circuit diagrams)''&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; illustrates how negative resistance oscillators work. The diode ''D'' has voltage controlled ("N" type) negative resistance and the voltage source &lt;math&gt;V_\text{b}&lt;/math&gt; biases it into its negative resistance region where its differential resistance is &lt;math&gt;dv/di\;=\;-r&lt;/math&gt;. The [[choke (electronics)|choke]] ''RFC'' prevents AC current from flowing through the bias source.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent resistance due to damping and losses in the series tuned circuit &lt;math&gt;LC&lt;/math&gt;, plus any load resistance. Analyzing the AC circuit with [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] gives a differential equation for &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d^2 i}{dt^2} + \frac {R - r}{L}\frac {di}{dt} + \frac {1}{LC}i = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this equation gives a solution of the form&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = i_0 e^{\alpha t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{r - R}{2L} \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac {1}{LC} - \left(\frac {r - R}{2L}\right)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the current through the circuit, &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, varies with time about the DC [[Q point]], &lt;math&gt;I_\text{bias}&lt;/math&gt;. When started from a nonzero initial current &lt;math&gt;i(t)\;=\;i_0&lt;/math&gt; the current oscillates [[sinusoidal]]ly at the [[resonant frequency]] '''''ω''''' of the tuned circuit, with amplitude either constant, increasing, or decreasing [[exponential function|exponentially]], depending on the value of '''''α'''''. Whether the circuit can sustain steady oscillations depends on the balance between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the positive and negative resistance in the circuit:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
#[[File:Sinusoid decreasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &lt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &lt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in left half plane) If the diode's negative resistance is less than the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, the damping is positive. Any oscillations in the circuit will lose energy as heat in the resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and die away exponentially to zero, as in an ordinary tuned circuit.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; So the circuit does not oscillate.
#[[File:Sinusoid constant amplitude.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r = R \Rightarrow \alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles on '''''jω''''' axis) If the positive and negative resistances are equal, the net resistance is zero, so the damping is zero. The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator.
#[[File:Sinusoid increasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &gt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles in right half plane) If the negative resistance is greater than the positive resistance, damping is negative, so oscillations will grow exponentially in energy and amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during startup.

Practical oscillators are designed in region (3) above, with net negative resistance, to get oscillations started.&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; A widely used rule of thumb is to make &lt;math&gt;R\;=\;r/3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung2"&gt;{{cite web

}}, Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Oscillators, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; When the power is turned on, [[electrical noise]] in the circuit provides a signal &lt;math&gt;i_0&lt;/math&gt; to start spontaneous oscillations, which grow exponentially. However, the oscillations cannot grow forever; the nonlinearity of the diode eventually limits the amplitude.

At large amplitudes the circuit is nonlinear, so the linear analysis above does not strictly apply and differential resistance is undefined; but the circuit can be understood by considering &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to be the "average" resistance over the cycle. As the amplitude of the sine wave exceeds the width of the negative resistance region and the voltage swing extends into regions of the curve with positive differential resistance, the average negative differential resistance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; becomes smaller, and thus the total resistance &lt;math&gt;R\;-\;r&lt;/math&gt; and the damping &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; becomes less negative and eventually turns positive. Therefore, the oscillations will stabilize at the amplitude at which the damping becomes zero, which is when &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;

For steady-state oscillation the equal sign applies. During startup the inequality applies, because the circuit must have excess negative resistance for oscillations to start.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

Alternately, the condition for oscillation can be expressed using the [[reflection coefficient]].&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; The voltage waveform at the reference plane can be divided into a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; travelling toward the negative resistance device and a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; travelling in the opposite direction, toward the resonator part. The reflection coefficient of the active device &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_N = V_2/V_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, while that of the resonator part &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_L = V_1/V_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; is less than one. During operation the waves are reflected back and forth in a round trip so the circuit will oscillate only if&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Gamma_N \Gamma_L| \ge 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
As above, the equality gives the condition for steady oscillation, while the inequality is required during startup to provide excess negative resistance. The above conditions are analogous to the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]] for feedback oscillators; they are necessary but not sufficient,&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; so there are some circuits that satisfy the equations but do not oscillate. Kurokawa also derived more complicated sufficient conditions,&lt;ref name="Kurokawa" /&gt; which are often used instead.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

==Amplifiers==
Negative differential resistance devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes are also used to make [[amplifier]]s, particularly at microwave frequencies, but not as commonly as oscillators.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Because negative resistance devices have only one ''port'' (two terminals), unlike [[two-port network|two-port]] devices such as [[transistor]]s, the outgoing amplified signal has to leave the device by the same terminals as the incoming signal enters it.&lt;ref name="Iniewski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Without some way of separating the two signals, a negative resistance amplifier is ''bilateral''; it amplifies in both directions, so it suffers from sensitivity to load impedance and feedback problems.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; To separate the input and output signals, many negative resistance amplifiers use [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] devices such as [[isolator (microwave)|isolator]]s and [[directional coupler]]s.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A circulator is a [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] component with three [[two port|ports]] (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode ''N'' is attached through a filter ''F'' to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing "reflected" amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt; of the input and output [[transmission line]]s, usually 50Ω, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter ''F'' is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

The filter has only reactive components and so does not absorb any power itself, so power is passed between the diode and the ports without loss. The input signal power to the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{in} = V_I^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
The output power from the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{out} = V_R^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
So the [[power gain]] &lt;math&gt;G_P&lt;/math&gt; of the amplifier is the square of the reflection coefficient&lt;ref name="Das" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart"&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{P} = |\Gamma|^2 = {(r + R_1)^2 + 4X_N^2 \over (r - R_1)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The VCNR reflection amplifier above is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; while a CCNR amplifier is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen that the reflection amplifier can have unlimited gain, approaching infinity as &lt;math&gt;R_\text{1}&lt;/math&gt; approaches the point of oscillation at &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers,&lt;ref name="Willardson" /&gt; contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward "leakage" coupling between circulator ports.

[[Maser]]s and [[parametric amplifier]]s are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like [[radio telescope]]s.&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

==Switching circuits==
Negative differential resistance devices are also used in [[switching circuit]]s in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with [[hysteresis]].&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a [[relaxation oscillator]], [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] or memory cell can be built with a single active device,&lt;ref name="Abraham" /&gt; whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the [[multivibrator|Eccles-Jordan multivibrator]], requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are
*''[[Astable multivibrator]]'' – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a [[relaxation oscillator]], and can produce [[square wave]]s or [[triangle wave]]s.
*''[[Monostable multivibrator]]'' – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.
*''[[Bistable multivibrator]]'' or ''[[flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]]'' – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and [[digital counter]]s.

===Vacuum tubes===
By the early 20th century, although the physical causes of negative resistance were not understood, engineers knew it could generate oscillations and had begun to apply it.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt; [[Heinrich Barkhausen]] in 1907 showed that oscillators must have negative resistance.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; Ernst Ruhmer and Adolf Pieper discovered that [[mercury vapor lamp]]s could produce oscillations, and by 1912 AT&amp;T had used them to build amplifying [[repeater]]s for [[telephone line]]s.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;

In 1918 Albert Hull at [[General Electric|GE]] discovered that [[vacuum tube]]s could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called [[secondary emission]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite journal

This represents a current ''away'' from the plate, reducing the plate current.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt; Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a ''decrease'' in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the [[dynatron oscillator]]. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the [[magnetron]] invented by Hull in 1920.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}

In [[western astrology|astrology]], a '''negative''', '''ceptive''', '''dispassive''', '''yin''', '''nocturnal''' or '''feminine''' sign refers to any of the six even-numbered signs of the [[zodiac]]: [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] or [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]].

These signs constitute the [[earth sign|earth]] and [[water sign|water]] [[triplicity|triplicities]].

==Introduction to signs==
In astrology there are two groups: positive and negative. These two groups also
include six individual signs that are called zodiac signs. The negative signs associated
with the zodiac are Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. The positive
signs associated with the zodiac are Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and
Aquarius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Rooij|first=Jan J. F.|title=Introversion-Extraversion: astrology versus psychology|journal=Department of Psychology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands|date=1993|volume=16|issue=6|pages=985–988|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886994902437|accessdate=November 3, 2011|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90243-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The twelve signs are divided into two
groups based upon one's exact time and place of birth. The negative and positive signs
alternate, starting with Aries as positive and Taurus as negative and continuing this pattern through the list of zodiac signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Emerson|first=Michael|title=History of Astrology-Origins and Beginnings|url=http://www.astrology-insight.com/astrologyinformation.htm|publisher=Astrology insight|accessdate=December 5, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202075959/http://www.astrology-insight.com/astrologyinformation.htm|archivedate=December 2, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different types of sign terminology==
The signs negative and positive are referred to as a negative-sunsign or a
positive-sunsign. There are many terms used in astrology to differentiate the
two groups. In Chinese astrology, the two groups are categorized as yin and yang, corresponding respectively to negative and positive.  Standen explains that different astrologers may refer to signs by different names. For example, an astrologer may refer to positive signs as masculine and negative signs as feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raaj Sudhanshu|first=Rajendra|title=Positive &amp; Negative Sign|url=http://www.subhanshu.com/astrology/positive-negative-sign.htm|publisher=Subhanshu.com|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each sign is divided into two main
types: active and passive. As a general rule, the active type will be called masculine and the passive type will be called feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Standen|first=Anthony|title=Is There An Astrological Effect On Personality|journal=The Journal of Psychology|date=1975|volume=89|issue=2|pages=259–260|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/vjrl20|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative Zodiacs==
Zodiac signs associated with the negative are Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. Note that there is no value judgment attached to the terms negative or positive. They may be likened to polarities in a magnet: one side is positive and one side is negative. Neither side is "good" nor "bad"—they are merely different.

==The “Sunsign Effect”==
The sunsign effect is a pattern of alternating high and low extraversion-scores for
the 12 signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Rooij|first=Jan J. F.|title=Introversion-Extraversion: astrology versus psychology|journal=Department of Psychology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands|date=1993|volume=16|issue=6|pages=985–988|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886994902437|accessdate=November 3, 2011|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90243-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introvert is a person who gains energy when alone and spends it when with other people. Extravert is a person who gains energy from socialization, expending it when alone. Jan J.F. van Rooij did an experiment on Introversion-Extraversion: astrology
versus psychology, to see if those in the negative sunsign were introverted and those in
the positive sunsign were negative. Van Rooijs did this experiment on those with
astrological knowledge and on those with no astrological knowledge. His results showed
that negative sunsign people are not that responsive to the outer world and are
accordingly not influenced that easily by astrological information. They rely more on
their own ideas and feelings, thus proving his point that people who are born with the
negative sunsign are introverted, and those born with the positive sunsign are
extroverted.

==Element Associated with negative signs==
Earth and Water are the elements attached to those who are in the negative sign.
Earth is the element of Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. Water is the element of Cancer,
Scorpio, and Pisces. Elements are the basic traits of the signs. They reveal the
fundamental aspects of the personality.
“Water signs are attuned to waves of emotion, and often seem to have a built-in
sonar for reading a mood. This gives them a special sensitivity in relationships, knowing
when to show warmth and when to hold back. At their best, they are a healing force that
bring people together -- at their worst, they are psychic vampires, able to manipulate
and drain the life force of the closest to them”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Molly|title=The Water Element|url=http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=December 1, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017135609/http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|archivedate=October 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall explains that water signs are
more in tune with their emotions and are comfortable showing them. Water signs bring a
certain presence to a situation; they seek out the problem and fix it.
“Earth signs are sensual, meaning they engage with life through the five senses.
It takes time to sense the dense physical world, and earth signs can operate at a slower,
more thorough pace than the other elements. Theyʼre oriented toward whatʼs real, and
often this makes them very productive, able to create tangible results.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Molly|title=The Water Element|url=http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=December 1, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017135609/http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|archivedate=October 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Earth signs are described by Hall as earthy people. These signs focus on the things
that connect us to the earth: things which bring peace, as opposed to focusing on the material world.

In [[quantum thermodynamics]], certain [[system (thermodynamics)|systems]] can achieve '''negative temperature'''; that is, their [[Thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] can be expressed as a [[negative number|negative]] quantity on the [[Kelvin]] or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] scales.

A system with a truly negative temperature on the Kelvin scale is ''hotter'' than any system with a positive temperature.  If a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat will flow from the negative- to the positive-temperature system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1956-07-01 |title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics at Negative Absolute Temperatures |journal=Physical Review |volume=103 |issue=1 |pages=20–28 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v103/p20 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.103.20|bibcode = 1956PhRv..103...20R |authorlink1=Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.|last1=Ramsey|first1=Norman }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1975-11-18 |title=Comment on: Negative Kelvin temperatures: some anomalies and a speculation |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=44 |pages=994–995 |url=http://www.physique.usherbrooke.ca/~tremblay/articles/Comment%20on%20%27Negative%20Kelvin%20temperatures,%20Some%20anomalies%20and%20a%20speculation%27.%20Tremblay.pdf|doi=10.1119/1.10248|issue=10|bibcode = 1976AmJPh..44..994T|last1=Tremblay|first1=André-Marie }}&lt;/ref&gt; A standard example of such a system is [[population inversion]] in [[laser physics]].

[[Temperature]] is loosely interpreted as the average kinetic energy of the system's particles. The existence of negative temperature, let alone negative temperature representing "hotter" systems than positive temperature, would seem paradoxical in this interpretation.  
The paradox is resolved by considering the more rigorous definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] as the tradeoff between [[internal energy]] and [[entropy]]
contained in the system, with "[[thermodynamic beta|coldness]]", the ''reciprocal'' of temperature, being the more fundamental quantity.  
Systems with a positive temperature will increase in entropy as one adds energy to the system, while  
systems with a negative temperature will decrease in entropy as one adds energy to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages= 10–14|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical thermodynamic systems cannot achieve negative temperatures: adding [[heat]] always increases their [[entropy]].  
The possibility of a decrease in entropy as energy increases requires the system to "saturate" in entropy. This is only possible if the number of high energy states is limited. In classical [[Boltzmann statistics]], the number of high energy states is unlimited (particle speeds can in principle be increased indefinitely).
Systems bounded by a maximum amount of energy are generally forbidden in classical mechanics, and the phenomenon of negative temperature is strictly a 
[[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon.  Some systems, however (see the [[#Examples|examples]] below), have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages=  89–95|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of temperature ==
The definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] {{mvar|T}} as a function of the change in the system's [[entropy]]  {{mvar|S}}  under reversible [[heat transfer]] 
&lt;math&gt;Q_\mathrm{rev}&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{dQ_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}.&lt;/math&gt;
Entropy being a [[state function]], the integral of {{mvar|dS}} over any cyclical process is zero.
For a system in which the entropy is purely a function of the system's energy {{mvar|E}}, the temperature can be defined as:
: &lt;math&gt; T  = \left( \frac{dS}{dE} \right)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, [[thermodynamic beta]], or "coldness", is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{kT} = \frac{1}{k} \frac{dS}{dE},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|k}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

Note that in classical thermodynamics, {{mvar|S}} is defined in terms of temperature. This is reversed here, {{mvar|S}} is the [[statistical entropy]], a function of the possibly microstates of the system, and temperature conveys information on the distribution of energy levels among the possible microstates.
For systems with many degrees of freedom, the statistical and thermodynamic definitions of entropy are generally consistent with each other. 
However, for small systems and systems where the number of states decreases with energy, the definitions of statistical entropy and thermodynamic entropy are not necessarily consistent, and the temperatures derived from these entropies are different. 

Some theorists have proposed using an alternate definition of entropy originally proposed by Gibbs as a way to resolve these inconsistencies,&lt;ref name="DunkelHilbert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Dunkel|first1 = Jorn|last2 = Hilbert|first2 = Stefan|title = Consistent thermostatistics forbids negative absolute temperatures|journal = Nature Physics|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 67|doi = 10.1038/nphys2815|arxiv = 1304.2066|bibcode = 2014NatPh..10...67D|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this new definition would create other inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gibbs, Boltzmann, and negative temperatures|journal = American Journal of Physics|date = 2015-02-01|issn = 0002-9505|pages = 163–170|volume = 83|issue = 2|doi = 10.1119/1.4895828|first = Daan|last = Frenkel|first2 = Patrick B.|last2 = Warren|arxiv = 1403.4299 |bibcode = 2015AmJPh..83..163F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heat and molecular energy distribution ==
Negative temperatures can only exist in a system where there are a limited number of energy states (see below). As the temperature is increased on such a system, particles move into higher and higher energy states, and as the temperature increases, the number of particles in the lower energy states and in the higher energy states approaches equality.  (This is a consequence of the definition of temperature in [[statistical mechanics]] for systems with limited states.)  By injecting energy into these systems in the right fashion, it is possible to create a system in which there are more particles in the higher energy states than in the lower ones. The system can then be characterised as having a negative temperature.

A substance with a negative temperature is not colder than [[absolute zero]], but rather it is hotter than infinite temperature. As Kittel and Kroemer (p.&amp;nbsp;462) put it, "The temperature scale from cold to hot runs:

: +0 K, … , +300 K, … , +∞ K, −∞ K, … , −300 K, … , −0 K."

The corresponding inverse temperature scale, for the quantity ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''kT'' (where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]]), runs continuously from low energy to high as +∞, … , 0, …, −∞. Because it avoids the abrupt jump from +∞ to −∞, β is considered more natural than ''T''.   Although a system can have multiple negative temperature regions and thus have -∞ to +∞ discontinuities.

In many familiar physical systems, temperature is associated to the kinetic energy of atoms. Since there is no upper bound on the momentum of an atom, there is no upper bound to the number of energy states available when more energy is added, and therefore no way to get to a negative temperature. However, in statistical mechanics, temperature can correspond to other degrees of freedom than just kinetic energy (see below).

== Temperature and disorder ==
The distribution of energy among the various [[translation (physics)|translational]], [[oscillation|vibrational]], [[rotation]]al, [[Electron configuration|electronic]], and [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] modes of a system determines the macroscopic temperature. In a "normal" system, thermal energy is constantly being exchanged between the various modes.

However, in some situations, it is possible to isolate one or more of the modes. In practice, the isolated modes still exchange energy with the other modes, but the [[Speed|time scale]] of this exchange is much slower than for the exchanges within the isolated mode. One example is the case of [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] [[spin (physics)|spins]] in a strong external [[magnetic field]]. In this case, energy flows fairly rapidly among the spin states of interacting atoms, but energy transfer between the nuclear spins and other modes is relatively slow. Since the energy flow is predominantly within the spin system, it makes sense to think of a spin temperature that is distinct from the temperature associated to other modes.

A definition of [[Temperature#Second law of thermodynamics|temperature]] can be based on the relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{dq_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}
&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship suggests that a ''positive temperature'' corresponds to the condition where [[entropy]], ''S'', increases as thermal energy, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;rev&lt;/sub&gt;, is added to the system. This is the "normal" condition in the macroscopic world, and is always the case for the translational, vibrational, rotational, and non-spin related electronic and nuclear modes. The reason for this is that there are an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of these types of modes, and adding more heat to the system increases the number of modes that are energetically accessible, and thus increases the entropy.

== Examples ==

=== Noninteracting two-level particles ===
{{multiple image

   | direction = vertical
   | footer    =

   | image2    = Negative temperature beta of E.png
   | width3    = 235
   | image3    = Negative temperature T of E.png
  }}
The simplest example, albeit a rather nonphysical one, is to consider a system of ''N'' particles, each of which can take an energy of either ''+ε'' or ''-ε'' but are otherwise noninteracting.  This can be understood as a limit of the [[Ising model]] in which the interaction term becomes negligible.  The total energy of the system is

:&lt;math&gt;E=\epsilon\sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i = \epsilon \cdot j&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the sign of the ''i''th particle and ''j'' is the number of particles with positive energy minus the number of particles with [[negative energy]].  From elementary [[combinatorics]], the total number of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] with this amount of energy is a [[binomial coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_E=\binom{N}{(N+j)/2} = \frac{N!}{\left(\frac{N+j}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N - j}{2}\right)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics]], the entropy of this [[microcanonical ensemble]] is

:&lt;math&gt;S=k_B \ln \Omega_E &lt;/math&gt;

We can solve for thermodynamic beta (β = 1/k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T) by considering it as a [[central difference]] without taking the continuum limit:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{k_B} \frac{\delta_{2\epsilon}[S]}{2\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} ( \ln \Omega_{E+\epsilon} - \ln \Omega_{E-\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{\left(\frac{N+j-1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j+1}{2}\right)!}{\left(\frac{N+j+1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j-1}{2}\right)!} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{N-j+1}{N+j+1} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
hence the temperature

:&lt;math&gt;T(E)=\frac{2\epsilon}{k_B}\left[\ln \left( \frac{(N+1)\epsilon - E}{(N+1)\epsilon + E} \right)\right]^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This entire proof assumes the microcanonical ensemble with energy fixed and temperature being the emergent property.  In the [[canonical ensemble]], the temperature is fixed and energy is the emergent property.  This leads to (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; refers to microstates):
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \sum_{i=1}^N\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\epsilon_i\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(Z) + \frac{E}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
Following the previous example, we choose a state with two levels and two particles.  This leads to microstates &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1  = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_2  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_3  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_4  = 2&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \exp(-0 \beta) + 2\exp(-1 \beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = 1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{0\exp(-0 \beta) + 2*1\exp(-1 \beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)) + \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta))T}&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting values for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are all increasing with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and never need to enter a negative temperature regime.

=== Nuclear spins ===
The previous example is approximately realized by a system of nuclear spins in an external magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1951-01-15 |title=A Nuclear Spin System at Negative Temperature |journal=Physical Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=279–280 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v81/p279 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.81.279|bibcode = 1951PhRv...81..279P |authorlink1=Edward Mills Purcell |authorlink2=Robert Pound |last1=Purcell |first1=E.

In the case of electronic and nuclear spin systems, there are only a finite number of modes available, often just two, corresponding to [[spin (physics)#Properties of spin|spin up and spin down]]. In the absence of a [[magnetic field]], these spin states are ''degenerate'', meaning that they correspond to the same energy. When an external magnetic field is applied, the energy levels are split, since those spin states that are aligned with the magnetic field will have a different energy from those that are anti-parallel to it.

In the absence of a magnetic field, such a two-spin system would have maximum entropy when half the atoms are in the spin-up state and half  are in the spin-down state, and so one would expect to find the system with close to an equal distribution of spins. Upon application of a magnetic field, some of the atoms will tend to align so as to minimize the energy of the system, thus slightly more atoms should be in the lower-energy state (for the purposes of this example we will assume the spin-down state is the lower-energy state).  It is possible to add energy to the spin system using [[radio frequency]] (RF) techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Norman F.|authorlink=Norman Ramsey|title=Spectroscopy with coherent radiation: selected papers of Norman F. Ramsey with commentary|year=1998|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore; River Edge, N.J.|isbn= 9789810232504 |pages=417|oclc=38753008|series=World Scientific series in 20th century physics, v. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes atoms to ''flip'' from spin-down to spin-up.

Since we started with over half the atoms in the spin-down state, this initially drives the system towards a 50/50 mixture, so the entropy is increasing, corresponding to a positive temperature. However, at some point, more than half of the spins are in the spin-up position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levitt|first=Malcolm H.|title=Spin Dynamics: Basics of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex, England|isbn= 978-0-470-51117-6|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, adding additional energy reduces the entropy, since it moves the system further from a 50/50 mixture. This reduction in entropy with the addition of energy corresponds to a negative temperature.&lt;ref name="kylma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ltl.tkk.fi/triennial/positive.html |title=Positive and negative picokelvin temperatures}}&lt;/ref&gt; In NMR spectroscopy, this corresponds to pulses with a pulse width of over 180° (for a given spin). While relaxation is fast in solids, it can take several seconds in solutions and even longer in gases and in ultracold systems; several hours were reported for silver and rhodium at picokelvin temperatures.&lt;ref name="kylma" /&gt; It is still important to understand that the temperature is negative only with respect to nuclear spins. Other degrees of freedom, such as molecular vibrational, electronic and electron spin levels are at a positive temperature, so the object still has positive sensible heat. Relaxation actually happens by exchange of energy between the nuclear spin states and other states (e.g. through the [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] with other spins).

=== Lasers ===
This phenomenon can also be observed in many [[laser|lasing]] systems, wherein a large fraction of the system's [[atom]]s (for chemical and gas lasers) or [[electron]]s (in [[semiconductor]] lasers) are in excited states. This is referred to as a [[population inversion]].

The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for a single mode of a luminescent radiation field at frequency ''ν'' is
:&lt;math&gt;H=(h\nu - \mu)a^\dagger a. \, &lt;/math&gt;
The density operator in the [[grand canonical ensemble]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{\exp(-\beta H)}{\mathbf{Tr}( \exp(-\beta H))}.&lt;/math&gt;
For the system to have a ground state, the trace to converge, and the density operator to be generally meaningful, ''βH'' must be positive semidefinite. So if ''hν''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''μ'', and ''H'' is negative semidefinite, then ''β'' must itself be negative, implying a negative temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Motional degrees of freedom ===
Negative temperatures have also been achieved in motional [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. Using an [[optical lattice]], upper bounds were placed on the kinetic energy, interaction energy and potential energy of cold {{SimpleNuclide|Potassium|39}} atoms. This was done by tuning the interactions of the atoms from repulsive to attractive using a [[Feshbach resonance]] and changing the overall harmonic potential from trapping to anti-trapping, thus transforming the [[Bose-Hubbard model|Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian]] from &lt;math&gt;\hat{H} \rightarrow -\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Performing this transformation adiabatically while keeping the atoms in the [[Mott insulator]] regime, it is possible to go from a low entropy positive temperature state to a low entropy negative temperature state. In the negative temperature state, the atoms macroscopically occupy the maximum momentum state of the lattice. The negative temperature ensembles equilibrated and showed long lifetimes in an anti-trapping harmonic potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Braun | first1 = S. | last2 = Ronzheimer | first2 = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">An '''organizing principle''' is a core assumption from which everything else by proximity can derive a classification or a value.  It is like a central reference point that allows all other objects to be located, often used in a [[conceptual framework]]. Having an organizing principle might help one simplify and get a handle on a particularly complicated domain or phenomenon.  On the other hand, it might create a deceptive prism that colors one's judgment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7883">The '''Pollyanna principle''' (also called '''Pollyannaism''' or '''positivity bias''') is the tendency for people to remember pleasant items more accurately than unpleasant ones.{{sfn|Matlin|Stang|1978|p=260}} Research{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} indicates that at the subconscious level, the mind has a tendency to focus on the optimistic; while at the conscious level, it has a tendency to focus on the negative. This subconscious bias towards the positive is often described as the Pollyanna principle and is similar to the [[Forer effect]].&lt;ref&gt;http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/Forer_The%20fallacy%20of%20personal%20validation_1949.pdf Forer BR (1949).

==Development==
The name derives from the 1913 novel ''[[Pollyanna]]'' by [[Eleanor H. Porter]] describing a girl who plays the "glad game"—trying to find something to be glad about in every situation. The novel has been adapted to film several times, most famously in [[Pollyanna (1920 film)|1920]] and [[Pollyanna (1960 film)|1960]]. An early use of the name "Pollyanna" in psychological literature was in 1969 by Boucher and Osgood who described a ''Pollyanna hypothesis'' as a universal human tendency to use evaluatively positive words more frequently and diversely than evaluatively negative words in communicating.{{sfn|Boucher|Osgood|1969}} Empirical evidence for this tendency has been provided by computational analyses of large corpora of text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dodds|first=Peter Sheridan|last2=Clark|first2=Eric M.|last3=Desu|first3=Suma|last4=Frank|first4=Morgan R.|last5=Reagan|first5=Andrew J.|last6=Williams|first6=Jake Ryland|last7=Mitchell|first7=Lewis|last8=Harris|first8=Kameron Decker|last9=Kloumann|first9=Isabel M.|date=2015-02-24|title=Human language reveals a universal positivity bias|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/8/2389|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=112|issue=8|pages=2389–2394|doi=10.1073/pnas.1411678112|issn=0027-8424|pmid=25675475|pmc=4345622|arxiv=1406.3855|bibcode=2015PNAS..112.2389D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holtz|first=Peter|last2=Deutschmann|first2=Emanuel|last3=Dobewall|first3=Henrik|date=2017-08-23|title=Cross-Cultural Psychology and the Rise of Academic Capitalism: Linguistic Changes in CCR and JCCP Articles, 1970-2014|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0022022117724902|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|language=en|volume=48|issue=9|pages=1410–1431|doi=10.1177/0022022117724902|issn=0022-0221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pollyanna principle'' was described by Matlin and Stang in 1978 using the [[archetype]] of Pollyanna more specifically as a psychological principle which portrays the [[nostalgia|positive bias people have when thinking of the past]]. According to the Pollyanna Principle, the brain processes information that is pleasing and agreeable in a more precise and exact manner as compared to unpleasant information. We actually tend to remember past experiences as more rosy than they actually occurred.{{sfn|Matlin|Stang|1978}}

Researchers Margaret Matlin and David Stang provided substantial evidence of the Pollyanna Principle. They found that people expose themselves to positive stimuli and avoid negative stimuli, they take longer to recognize what is unpleasant or threatening than what is pleasant and safe, and they report that they encounter positive stimuli more frequently than they actually do. Matlin and Stang also determined that selective recall was a more likely occurrence when recall was delayed: the longer the delay, the more selective recall that occurred.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The Pollyanna principle has been observed on online social networks as well. For example, [[Twitter]] users preferentially share more, and are emotionally affected more frequently by, positive information.{{sfn|Ferrara|Yang|2015a}}{{sfn|Ferrara|Yang|2015b}}

However, the Pollyanna principle does not always apply to individuals suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[anxiety]], who tend to either have more [[depressive realism]] or a negative bias.{{sfn|Carr|2004}}

In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], the concept of a '''possible world''' is used to express [[modal logic|modal claims]]. The concept of possible worlds is common in contemporary philosophical discourse but has been disputed.

== Possibility, necessity, and contingency ==
{{Further|Modal logic#The ontology of possibility}}
Those theorists who use the concept of possible worlds consider the ''actual'' world to be one of the many possible worlds. For each distinct way the world could have been, there is said to be a distinct possible world; the actual world is the one we in fact live in. Among such theorists there is disagreement about the nature of possible worlds; their precise [[Modal logic#The ontology of possibility|ontological status]] is disputed, and especially the difference, if any, in ontological status between the actual world and all the other possible worlds. One position on these matters is set forth in [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s modal realism (see below). There is a close relation between [[proposition]]s and possible worlds. We note that every proposition is either true or false at any given possible world; then the ''[[modal logic|modal status]]'' of a proposition is understood in terms of the ''worlds in which it is true'' and ''worlds in which it is false''. The following are among the assertions we may now usefully make:

* '''[[Truth|True propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in the actual world'' (for example: "[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969").
* '''[[Falsity|False propositions]]''' are those that are ''false in the actual world'' (for example: "[[Ronald Reagan]] became president in 1969"). (Reagan did not run for president until 1976, and thus couldn't possibly have been elected.)
* '''[[Logical possibility|Possible propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in at least one possible world'' (for example: "[[Hubert Humphrey]] became president in 1969"). (Humphrey did run for president in 1968, and thus could have been elected.) This includes propositions which are necessarily true, in the sense below.
* '''[[Contradiction|Impossible propositions]]''' (or ''necessarily false propositions'') are those that are ''true in no possible world'' (for example: "Melissa and Toby are taller than each other at the same time").
* '''[[Logical truth|Necessarily true propositions]]''' (often simply called '''necessary propositions''') are those that are ''true in all possible worlds'' (for example: "2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4"; "all bachelors are unmarried").&lt;ref&gt;See "A Priori and A Posteriori" (author: Jason S. Baehr), at ''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/apriori/#H3 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]'': "A necessary proposition is one the truth value of which remains constant across all possible worlds. Thus a necessarily true proposition is one that is true in every possible world, and a necessarily false proposition is one that is false in every possible world. By contrast, the truth value of contingent propositions is not fixed across all possible worlds: for any contingent proposition, there is at least one possible world in which it is true and at least one possible world in which it is false." Accessed 7 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Contingency (philosophy)|Contingent propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in some possible worlds and false in others'' (for example: "[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969" is ''contingently false'' and "[[Hubert Humphrey]] became president in 1969" is ''contingently true'').

The idea of possible worlds is most commonly attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]], who spoke of possible worlds as ideas in the mind of [[God]] and used the notion to argue that our actually created world must be "the [[best of all possible worlds]]". [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that on the contrary our world must be the worst of all possible worlds, because if it were only a little worse it could not continue to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, "De Welt als Wille and Vorstellung," supplement to the 4th book "Von der Nichtigkeit und dem Leiden des Lebens" p. 2222, see also R.B. Haldane and J. Kemp's translation [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation/Supplements_to_the_Fourth_Book "On the Vanity and Suffering of Life"] pp 395-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have found implicit earlier traces of the idea of possible worlds in the works of [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;"Nor could we doubt that, if God had created many worlds, they would not be as true in all of them as in this one. Thus those who could examine sufficiently the consequences of these truths and of our rules, could be able to discover effects by their causes, and, to explain myself in the language of the schools, they could have a priori demonstrations of everything that could be produced in this new world." -The World, Chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt; a major influence on Leibniz, [[Al-Ghazali]] (''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''), [[Averroes]] (''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence]]''),&lt;ref name=Kukkonen&gt;{{citation|title=Possible Worlds in the Tahâfut al-Falâsifa: Al-Ghazâlî on Creation and Contingency|author=Taneli Kukkonen|journal=[[Journal of the History of Philosophy]]|volume=38|issue=4|year=2000|pages=479–502|doi=10.1353/hph.2005.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (''Matalib al-'Aliya'')&lt;ref name=Setia&gt;{{citation|title=Fakhr Al-Din Al-Razi on Physics and the Nature of the Physical World: A Preliminary Survey|author=Adi Setia|journal=Islam &amp; Science|volume=2|year=2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QYQ/is_2_2/ai_n9532826/|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name=Kukkonen/&gt; The modern philosophical use of the notion was pioneered by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] and [[Saul Kripke]].

== Formal semantics of modal logics ==
{{Main|Modal logic#Semantics}}

A semantics for modal logic was first introduced in the late-1950s work of [[Saul Kripke]] and his colleagues. A statement in modal logic that is ''possible'' is said to be true in at least one possible world; a statement that is ''necessary'' is said to be true in all possible worlds.

== From modal logic to philosophical tool ==
From this groundwork, the theory of possible worlds became a central part of many philosophical developments, from the 1960s onwards &amp;ndash; including, most famously, the analysis of [[counterfactual conditional]]s in terms of "nearby possible worlds" developed by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] and [[Robert Stalnaker]]. On this analysis, when we discuss what ''would'' happen ''if'' some set of conditions ''were'' the case, the truth of our claims is determined by what is true at the nearest possible world (or the ''set'' of nearest possible worlds) where the conditions obtain. (A possible world W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is said to be near to another possible world W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in respect of R to the degree that the same things happen in W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in respect of R; the more different something happens in two possible worlds in a certain respect, the "further" they are from one another in that respect.) Consider this conditional sentence: "If George W. Bush hadn't become president of the U.S. in 2001, Al Gore would have." The sentence would be taken to express a claim that could be reformulated as follows: "In all nearest worlds to our actual world (nearest in relevant respects) where George W. Bush didn't become president of the U.S. in 2001, Al Gore became president of the U.S. then instead." And on this interpretation of the sentence, if there is or are some nearest worlds to the actual world (nearest in relevant respects) where George W. Bush didn't become president but Al Gore didn't either, then the claim expressed by this counterfactual would be false.

Today, possible worlds play a central role in many debates in philosophy, including especially debates over the [[philosophical zombie|Zombie Argument]], and [[physicalism]] and [[supervenience]] in the [[philosophy of mind]]. Many debates in the [[philosophy of religion]] have been reawakened by the use of possible worlds. Intense debate has also emerged over the [[ontology|ontological]] status of possible worlds, provoked especially by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s defense of [[modal realism]], the doctrine that talk about "possible worlds" is best explained in terms of innumerable, ''really existing'' worlds beyond the one we live in. The fundamental question here is: ''given'' that modal logic works, and that some possible-worlds semantics for modal logic is correct, ''what has to be true'' of the world, and just what ''are'' these possible worlds that we range over in our interpretation of modal statements? Lewis argued that what we range over are real, concrete ''worlds'' that exist just as unequivocally as our actual world exists, but that are distinguished from the actual world simply by standing in no spatial, temporal, or causal relations with the actual world. (On Lewis's account, the only "special" property that the ''actual'' world has is a relational one: that ''we'' are in it. This doctrine is called "the indexicality of actuality": "actual" is a merely [[indexicality|indexical]] term, like "now" and "here".) Others, such as [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] and [[William Lycan]], reject Lewis's picture as metaphysically extravagant, and suggest in its place an interpretation of possible worlds as consistent, maximally complete sets of descriptions of or propositions about the world, so that a "possible world" is conceived of as a complete ''description'' of ''a way the world could be'' &amp;ndash; rather than a ''world that is that way''. (Lewis describes their position, and similar positions such as those advocated by [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Peter Forrest (philosopher)|Peter Forrest]], as "''ersatz'' modal realism", arguing that such theories try to get the benefits of possible worlds semantics for modal logic "on the cheap", but that they ultimately fail to provide an adequate explanation.) [[Saul Kripke]], in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', took explicit issue with Lewis's use of possible worlds semantics, and defended a ''stipulative'' account of possible worlds as purely ''formal'' (logical) entities rather than either really existent worlds or as some set of propositions or descriptions.

== Possible-world theory in literary studies ==
Possible worlds theory in literary studies uses concepts from possible-world logic and applies them to worlds that are created by fictional texts, [[fictional universe]]. In particular, possible-world theory provides a useful vocabulary and conceptual framework with which to describe such worlds. However, a literary world is a specific type of possible world, quite distinct from the possible worlds in logic. This is because a literary text houses its own system of modality, consisting of actual worlds (actual events) and possible worlds (possible events). In fiction, the principle of simultaneity, it extends to cover the dimensional aspect, when it is contemplated that two or more physical objects, realities, perceptions and objects non-physical, can coexist in the same space-time.{{vague|date=April 2015}} Thus, a literary universe is granted autonomy in much the same way as the actual universe.

Literary critics, such as [[Marie-Laure Ryan]], [[Lubomír Doležel]], and [[Thomas Pavel]], have used possible-worlds theory to address notions of literary truth, the nature of fictionality, and the relationship between fictional worlds and reality. Taxonomies of fictional possibilities have also been proposed where the likelihood of a fictional world is assessed. Possible-world theory is also used within narratology to divide a specific text into its constituent worlds, possible and actual. In this approach, the modal structure of the fictional text is analysed in relation to its [[narrative]] and thematic concerns. [[Rein Raud]] has extended this approach onto "cultural" worlds, comparing possible worlds to the particular constructions of reality of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;"Identity, Difference and Cultural Worlds", in Lang, V. &amp; Kull, K. (eds) (2014) Estonian Approaches to Culture Theory. Approaches to Culture Theory 4, 164–179. University of Tartu Press, Tartu, https://www.academia.edu/9128313/Identity_Difference_and_Cultural_Worlds&lt;/ref&gt; However, the metaphor of the "cultural possible worlds" relates to the framework of [[cultural relativism]] and, depending on the ontological status ascribed to possible worlds, warrants different, often controversial claims ranging from ethnocentrism to cultural imperialism.

'''The primary/secondary quality distinction''' is a conceptual distinction in [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]], concerning the nature of [[reality]].  It is most explicitly articulated by [[John Locke]] in his ''[[Essay concerning Human Understanding]]'', but earlier thinkers such as [[Galileo]] and [[Descartes]] made similar distinctions.

'''Primary qualities''' are thought to be [[properties]] of objects that are independent of any observer, such as [[solid]]ity, [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]], [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[number]] and [[shape|figure]]. These characteristics convey facts. They exist in the thing itself, can be determined with certainty, and do not rely on subjective judgments. For example, if an object is spherical, no one can reasonably argue that it is triangular.

'''Secondary qualities''' are thought to be properties that produce [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s in observers, such as [[color]], [[taste]], [[olfaction|smell]], and [[sound]]. They can be described as the effect things have on certain people. [[Knowledge]] that comes from secondary qualities does not provide objective facts about things.

Primary qualities are measurable aspects of physical reality. Secondary qualities are subjective.

==History==

* "By convention there are sweet and bitter, hot and cold, by convention there is color; but in truth there are atoms and the void"
:—Democritus, Fragment 9.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Sextus Empiricus, ''Adversus Mathematicos'' vii 135&lt;/ref&gt;
* "I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so on are no more than mere names so far as the object in which we locate them are concerned, and that they reside in consciousness. Hence if the living creature were removed, all these qualities would be wiped away and annihilated"
:—Galileo Galilei, ''The Assayer'' (published 1623).&lt;ref&gt;As reprinted in (Drake, 1957, p. 274)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[I]t must certainly be concluded regarding those things which, in external objects, we call by the names of light, color, odor, taste, sound, heat, cold, and of other tactile qualities, [...]; that we are not aware of their being anything other than various arrangements of the size, figure, and motions of the parts of these objects which make it possible for our nerves to move in various ways, and to excite in our soul all the various feelings which they produce there."
:—René Descartes, ''Principles of Philosophy'' (published 1644/1647).&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, René.  ''Principles of Philosophy''.  1644/1647.  Trans. Valentine Rodger Miller and Reese P. Miller.  D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1984.  Page 282.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "For the rays, to speak properly, are not coloured. In them there is nothing else than a certain power and disposition to stir up a sensation of this or that colour."
:—Isaac Newton, ''Optics'' (3rd ed. 1721, original in 1704).&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in (Newton, 1953, ed. Chris Jamieson, p. 100)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Leibniz===

[[Leibniz]] was an early critic of the distinction, writing in his 1686 ''[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]'' that "[i]t is even possible to demonstrate that the ideas of size, figure and motion are not so distinctive as is imagined, and that they stand for something imaginary relative to our perceptions as do, although to a greater extent, the ideas of color, heat, and the other similar qualities in regard to which we may doubt whether they are actually to be found in the nature of the things outside of us."&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, G. W.  ''Discourse on Metaphysics'', XII.  1686.  Trans. George R. Montgomery.  The Open Court Publishing Company, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berkeley===

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}

[[George Berkeley]] wrote his famous critique of this distinction in his book [[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous]]. Berkeley maintained that the ideas created by sensations are all that people can know for sure. As a result, what is perceived as real consists only of ideas in the mind. The crux of Berkeley's argument is that once an object is stripped of all its secondary qualities, it becomes very problematic to assign any acceptable meaning to the idea that ''there is'' some object.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Georges Dicker, ''Berkeley's Idealism: A Critical Examination'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011, Part III, paragraph 8: "Berkeley's Attack on the Theory of Primary and Secondary Qualities"&lt;/ref&gt; Not that one cannot picture to oneself (in one's mind) that some object could exist apart from any perceiver — one clearly can do this — but rather, that one cannot give any ''content'' to this idea. Suppose that someone says that a particular mind-independent object (meaning, an object free of all secondary qualities) exists at some particular spatio-temporal location (in Newtonian terms, in some particular place and at some particular time). Now, none of this particularly means anything if one cannot specify a place and time. In that case it's still a purely imaginary, empty idea. This is not generally thought to be a problem because realists imagine that they can, in fact, specify a place and time for a 'mind-independent' object.  What is overlooked is that they can only specify a place and time in place and time ''as we experience them''. Berkeley did not doubt that one can do this, but that it is objective. One has simply related ideas to experiences (the idea of an ''object'' to our ''experiences of space and time''). In this case there is no space and time, and therefore no objectivity. Space and time as we experience them are always piecemeal (even when the piece of space is big, as in some astronomical photos), it is only in imagination that they are total and all-encompassing, which is how we definitely imagine (!) 'real' space and time as being. This is why Berkeley argued that the materialist has merely an ''idea'' of an unperceived object: because people typically do take our imagining or picturing, as guaranteeing an objective reality to the 'existence' of 'something'. In no adequate way has it been specified nor given any acceptable meaning. As such Berkeley comes to his conclusion that having a compelling image in the mind, one which connects to no specifiable thing external to us, does not guarantee an objective existence.

===Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science]]'', claimed that primary, as well as secondary, qualities are subjective. They are both mere appearances that are located in the mind of a knowing observer. In  § 13, Remark II, he wrote: "Long before Locke's time, but assuredly since him, it has been generally assumed and granted without detriment to the actual existence of external things, that many of their predicates may be said to belong not to the things in themselves, but to their appearances, and to have no proper existence outside our representation. Heat, color, and taste, for instance, are of this kind. Now, if I go farther, and for weighty reasons rank as mere appearances the remaining qualities of bodies also, which are called primary, such as extension, place, and in general space, with all that which belongs to it (impenetrability or materiality, space, etc.)—no one in the least can adduce the reason of its being inadmissible."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4174">In philosophy and rhetoric, the '''principle of charity''' or '''charitable interpretation''' requires interpreting a speaker's statements in the most rational way possible and, in the case of any argument, considering its best, strongest possible interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Normand Baillargeon: ''Intellectual Self-Defense''. Seven Stories Press 2007, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In its narrowest sense, the goal of this methodological principle is to avoid attributing irrationality, [[logical fallacies]], or falsehoods to the others' statements, when a coherent, rational interpretation of the statements is available. According to [[Simon Blackburn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Blackburn |first=Simon

|title=''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]''
|location=Oxford
|publisher=Oxford University Press
|page=62
}}&lt;/ref&gt; "it constrains the interpreter to maximize the truth or rationality in the subject's sayings."

==Application==
Neil L. Wilson gave the principle its name in 1958–59. Its main area of application, by his lights, is determining the referent of a proper name:
&lt;blockquote&gt;How should we set about discovering the significance which a person attaches to a given name? […] Let us suppose that somebody (whom I am calling "Charles") makes just the following five assertions containing the name "Caesar." […]&lt;br/&gt;
(1) Caesar conquered Gaul. (Gc) &lt;br/&gt;
(2) Caesar crossed the Rubicon. (Rc) &lt;br/&gt;
(3) Caesar was murdered on the Ides of March. (Mc) &lt;br/&gt;
(4) Caesar was addicted to the use of the ablative absolute. (Ac)&lt;br/&gt;
(5) Caesar was married to Boadicea. (Bc)&lt;br/&gt;
[…] And so we act on what might be called the Principle of Charity. We select as designatum that individual which will make the largest possible number of Charles' statements true. […] We might say the designatum is that individual which satisfies more of the asserted matrices containing the word "Caesar" than does any other individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide other formulations of the principle of charity. Davidson sometimes referred to it as ''the principle of rational accommodation''. He summarized it: ''We make maximum sense of the words and thoughts of others when we interpret in a way that optimises agreement''. The principle may be invoked to make sense of a speaker's utterances when one is unsure of their meaning. In particular, Quine's use of the principle gives it this latter, wide domain.

Since the time of Quine ''et al.'', other philosophers{{Who|date=August 2011}} have formulated at least four versions of the principle of charity. These alternatives may conflict with one another, so which principle to use may depend on the goal of the conversation. The four principles are:

#The other uses words in the ordinary way;
#The other makes true statements;
#The other makes valid arguments;
#The other says something interesting.

A related principle is the [[principle of humanity]], which states that we must assume that another speaker's beliefs and desires are connected to each other and to reality in some way, and attribute to him or her "the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances" ([[Daniel Dennett]], "Mid-Term Examination," in ''The Intentional Stance'', p.&amp;nbsp;343).

The '''principle of nonvacuous contrast''' is a logical or methodological principle which requires that a genuine predicate never refer to everything, or to nothing, within its [[universe of discourse]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19261">The '''principle of sufficient reason''' states that everything must have a [[Reason (argument)|reason]] or a [[cause]]. The modern&lt;ref&gt;From Hamilton 1860:67" 
In modern times, the attention of philosophers was called to this law of Leibnitz, who, on the two principles of Reason and of Contradiction, founded the whole edifice of his philosophy.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; See Théodicée, § 44. [[Monadology|Monadologie]], §§ 81, 82. —ED."&lt;/ref&gt; formulation of the principle is usually attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;There are numerous anticipations. One often pointed to is in [[Anselm of Canterbury]]: his phrase [http://12koerbe.de/pan/curdeus5.htm ''quia Deus nihil sine ratione facit''] and the formulation of the [[ontological argument for the existence of God]]. A clearer connection is with the [[cosmological argument for the existence of God]]. The principle can be seen in both [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[William of Ockham]]. Leibniz formulated it, but was not an originator. See chapter on Leibniz and Spinoza in [[A. O. Lovejoy]], ''The Great Chain of Being''.&lt;/ref&gt; although the idea was conceived of and utilized by various philosophers who preceded him, including [[Anaximander]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World|last= Freeman|first= Charles|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1999|publisher= Allen Lane|location= |isbn= 0-7139-9224-7|page= 152|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parmenides]], [[Archimedes]],&lt;ref name="Principle of Sufficient Reason"&gt;{{cite web |title= Principle of Sufficient Reason |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref name="Hamilton66"&gt;[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]] 1860:66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]],&lt;ref name="Hamilton66"/&gt; [[Avicenna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=Kara|title=Avicenna and the Principle of Sufficient Reason|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2014|volume=67|issue=4|pages=743–768}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spinoza |last=Della Rocca |first=Michael |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn= 0415283302 |pages=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers have associated the principle of sufficient reason with "''[[ex nihilo nihil fit]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander R. Pruss (2007) "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit: Augments new and old for the Principle of Sufficient Reason" in ''Explication Topic in Contemporary Philosophy'' Ch. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton attributes this expression to [[Cicero]]; Hamilton 1860:66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]] identified the laws of inference [[modus ponens]] with the "law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent" and [[modus tollens]] with its [[contrapositive]] expression.&lt;ref&gt;From Hamilton 1860:241–242: “2°, "If the essential nature of an Hypothetical Syllogism consist in this, – that the subsumption affirms or denies one or other of the two parts of a thought, standing to each other in the relation of the thing conditioning and the thing conditioned, it will be the law of an hypothetical syllogism, that, – If the condition or antecedent be affirmed, so also must be the conditioned or consequent, and that if the conditioned or consequent be denied, so likewise must be the condition or antecedent. But this is manifestly nothing else than the law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent." &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The principle of this syllogism is thus variously enounced: ''Posita conditione, ponitur conditionatum, sublato conditionato, tlitur conditio''. Or, otherwise, ''a ratione ad rationatum, a negatione rationati ad negationem rationis, valet consequentia''. The one alternative of either rule being regulative of ''modus ponens'', the other of the ''modus tollens''. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Esser, Logik, I 91, p. 174. —ED. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; See Kant, Logik §§ 75–76 . Krug, Logik, § 82. —ED." See in particular Hamilton's discussion that leads to this quote starting at page 239ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulation==

The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

*For every entity ''X'', if ''X'' exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''X'' exists.
*For every event ''E'', if ''E'' occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''E'' occurs.
*For every proposition ''P'', if ''P'' is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''P'' is true.

A sufficient explanation may be understood either in terms of ''reasons'' or ''causes,'' for like many philosophers of the period, Leibniz did not carefully distinguish between the two. The resulting principle is very different{{clarify|reason=needs elaboration|date=March 2016}}, however, depending on which interpretation is given.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

It is an open question whether the principle of sufficient reason can be applied to [[axiom]]s within a logic construction like a mathematical or a physical theory, because axioms are propositions accepted as having no justification possible within the system
&lt;!--{{Fact}} begin--&gt;{{fix
|link=Wikipedia:Citation needed
|text=citation needed
|class=Template-Fact
|title=This claim needs references to reliable sources
}}&lt;!--{{Fact}} end--&gt;. 
The principle declares that all propositions considered to be true within a system should be [[deductive reasoning|deducible]] from the set axioms at the base of the construction (with some theoretical exceptions: see [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]]).

==Leibniz's view==
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] identified two kinds of truth, necessary and contingent truths. He believed necessary mathematical truths to be derived from the [[law of identity]] (and the [[principle of contradiction]]): "Necessary truths are those that can be demonstrated through an analysis of terms, so that in the end they become identities, just as in Algebra an equation expressing an identity ultimately results from the substitution of values [for variables]. That is, necessary truths depend upon the principle of contradiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muhit|first=Abdul|title=Leibniz on Necessary and Contingent Truths|url=http://www.banglajol.info/index.php/AFJ/article/download/12936/9300|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz states that the sufficient reason for necessary truths is that their negation is a contradiction.&lt;ref name="Principle of Sufficient Reason"/&gt;

Leibniz admitted contingent truths on the basis of [[infinitary]] reasons, to which [[God]] had access but humans did not:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In contingent truths, even though the predicate is in the subject, this can never be demonstrated, nor can a proposition ever be reduced to an equality or to an identity, but the resolution proceeds to infinity, God alone seeing, not the end of the resolution, of course, which does not exist, but the connection of the terms or the containment of the predicate in the subject, since he sees whatever is in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=G. W. Leibniz:  Philosophical Essays|year=1989|publisher=Hackett |location=Indianapolis|editors=Ariew, Roger and Daniel Garber, eds and trans}}, p. 94, ''On Freedom'' (1689?).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Without this qualification, the principle can be seen as a description of a certain notion of [[closed system]], in which there is no 'outside' to provide unexplained events with causes. It is also in tension with the paradox of [[Buridan's ass]].  Leibniz denied that the paradox of Buridan's ass could ever occur, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt; In consequence of this, the case also of Buridan's ass between two meadows, impelled equally towards both of them, is a fiction that cannot occur in the universe....For the universe cannot be halved by a plane drawn through the middle of the ass, which is cut vertically through its length, so that all is equal and alike on both sides.....Neither the parts of the universe nor the viscera of the animal are alike nor are they evenly placed on both sides of this vertical plane. There will therefore always be many things in the ass and outside the ass, although they be not apparent to us, which will determine him to go on one side rather than the other. And although man is free, and the ass is not, nevertheless for the same reason it must be true that in man likewise the case of a perfect equipoise between two courses is impossible. ([http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17147 ''Theodicy'', pg. 150])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leibniz also used the principle of sufficient reason to refute the idea of [[absolute space and time|absolute space]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I say then, that if space is an absolute being, there would be something for which it would be impossible there should be a sufficient reason. Which is against my axiom. And I prove it thus. Space is something absolutely uniform; and without the things placed in it, one point in space does not absolutely differ in any respect whatsoever from another point of space.  Now from hence it follows, (supposing space to be something in itself, beside the order of bodies among themselves,) that 'tis impossible that there should be a reason why God, preserving the same situation of bodies among themselves, should have placed them in space after one particular manner, and not otherwise; why everything was not placed the quite contrary way, for instance, by changing East into West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=H.G. |title=The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence |date=1956 |publisher=Barnes and Noble |location=New York, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==As a law of thought==

The principle was one of the four recognised [[laws of thought]], that held a place in European [[pedagogy]] of [[logic]] and [[reasoning]] (and, to some extent, [[philosophy]] in general) in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was influential in the thinking of [[Leo Tolstoy]], amongst others, in the elevated form that [[history]] could not be accepted as [[random]].

A sufficient reason is sometimes described as the coincidence of every single thing that is needed for the occurrence of an effect (i.e. of the so-called ''necessary conditions'').&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. T. Hobbes, ''Quaestiones de libertate et necessitate, contra Doctorem Bramhallum'', 7. Quoted in: A. Schopenhauer, [[On the Freedom of the Will]], c. 4. See also: [[John Bramhall]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such view could perhaps be also applied to indeterministic systems, as long as randomness is in a way incorporated in the preconditions.

===Hamilton's fourth law: "Infer nothing without ground or reason"===
Here is how [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]], circa 1837–1838,&lt;ref&gt;From the Preface: "The Lectures on Logic, like those on Metaphysics, were chiefly composed during, the session in which they were first delivered (1837–8)." The lectures were assembled, with added footnotes marked by "—ED." by Mansel and Veitch and published in 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed his "fourth law" in his LECT. V. LOGIC. 60–61:

:"I now go on to the fourth law.

:"'''Par. XVII. Law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent''':

:"XVII. The thinking of an object, as actually characterized by positive or by negative attributes, is not left to the caprice of Understanding – the faculty of thought; but that faculty must be necessitated to this or that determinate act of thinking by a knowledge of something different from, and independent of; the process of thinking itself. This condition of our understanding is expressed by the law, as it is called, of Sufficient Reason ('''principium Rationis Sufficientis'''); but it is more properly denominated the law of Reason and Consequent ('''principium Rationis et Consecutionis'''). That knowledge by which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit something else, is called the ''logical reason ground,'' or ''antecedent''; that something else which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit, is called the ''logical consequent''; and the relation between the reason and consequent, is called the ''logical connection or consequence''. This law is expressed in the formula – Infer nothing without a ground or reason.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

:"'''Relations between Reason and Consequent''': The relations between Reason and Consequent, when comprehended in a pure thought, are the following:
:1. When a reason is explicitly or implicitly given, then there must ¶ exist a consequent; and, ''vice versa'', when a consequent is given, there must also exist a reason.

::&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; See Schulze, ''Logik'', §19, and Krug, ''Logik'', §20, – ED.&lt;ref&gt;From the index: "SCHULZE, G. E., KRUG, W. T." These are philosophers [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]] (23 August 1761 – 14 January 1833) and [[Wilhelm Traugott Krug]] (22 June 1770 – 12 January 1842).&lt;/ref&gt;

:"2. Where there is no reason there can be no consequent; and, ''vice versa'', where there is no consequent (either implicitly or explicitly) there can be no reason. That is, the concepts of reason and of consequent, as reciprocally relative, involve and suppose each other.

:"'''The logical significance of this law''': The logical significance of the law of Reason and Consequent lies in this, – That in virtue of it, thought is constituted into a series of acts all indissolubly connected; each necessarily inferring the other. Thus it is that the distinction and opposition of possible, actual and necessary matter, which has been introduced into Logic, is a doctrine wholly extraneous to this science."

==Schopenhauer's Four Forms==
{{main|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason}}
According to [[Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'', there are four distinct forms of the principle.

First Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Becoming (principium rationis sufficientis fiendi); appears as the law of causality in the understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 20, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Knowing (principium rationis sufficientis cognoscendi); asserts that if a judgment is to express a piece of knowledge, it must have a sufficient ground or reason, in which case it receives the predicate true.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 29, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Being (principium rationis sufficientis essendi); the law whereby the parts of space and time determine one another as regards those relations.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 36, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Example in arithmetic: Each number presupposes the preceding numbers as grounds or reasons of its being; "I can reach ten only by going through all the preceding numbers; and only by virtue of this insight into the ground of being, do I know that where there are ten, so are there eight, six, four."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 38, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now just as the subjective correlative to the first class of representations is the understanding, that to the second the faculty of reason, and that to the third pure sensibility, so is the subjective correlative to this fourth class found to be the inner sense, or generally self-consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, page 212, S 42, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fourth Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Acting (principium rationis sufficientis agendi); briefly known as the law of motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 43, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Any judgment that does not follow its previously existing ground or reason" or any state that cannot be explained away as falling under the three previous headings "must be produced by an act of will which has a motive." As his proposition in 43 states, "Motivation is causality seen from within."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 43, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed proofs of universal validity==
{{See also|Free will#Free will and views of causality|label 1=Views of causality (from the article on free will)}}
Several proofs have been prepared in order to demonstrate that the universe is at bottom causal, i.e. works in accord with the principle in question; perhaps not in every single case (randomness might still play a part here and there), but that causality must be the way it works at least ''in general'', in most of what we see; and that our minds are aware of the principle even before any experience. The two famous arguments or proofs were proposed by Immanuel Kant (from the form of Time, temporal ordering of events and "directionality" of time) and by Arthur Schopenhauer (by demonstrating how all perception depends on causality and the intellect).

Once it is agreed (e.g. from a kind of an "arrow of time") that causal interconnections, as a form of principle of sufficient reason, indeed must in general exist everywhere in the universe (at least in the large scale), ''backwards'' causality in general might then be precluded using a form of the [[paradox of free will]] (i.e. an event that has a future source might cause us to remove that source quick enough and thus causality would not work&lt;ref&gt;Likewise, announcing prophecies so that they will still be correct requires, in general, a lot of high-level research of human psychics, because sometimes they will be in accord with human determination and will be welcome, but sometimes announcing them without interference with the prophesied outcome is just impossible. The requirement of such high-level research, in every single case, seems in general to rule out the possibility of backwards causality in physics.&lt;/ref&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3970">The '''self-consistency principle''' was established by [[Rolf Hagedorn]] in 1965 to explain the thermodynamics of [[Fireball concept|fireballs]] in [[high energy physics]] collisions. A thermodynamical approach to the high energy collisions first proposed by [[Enrico Fermi|E. Fermi]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Fermi. Prog. Theor. Phys. 5 (1950) 570.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partition function==
The partition function of the [[Fireball concept|fireballs]] can be written in two forms, one in terms of its density of states, &lt;math&gt;\sigma(E)&lt;/math&gt;, and the other in terms of its mass spectrum, &lt;math&gt;\rho(m)&lt;/math&gt;.

The self-consistency principle says that both forms must be asymptotically equivalent for energies or masses sufficiently high (asymptotic limit). Also, the density of states and the mass spectrum must be asymptotically equivalent in the sense of the weak constraint proposed by Hagedorn&lt;ref&gt;R. Hagedorn, Suppl. Al Nuovo Cimento 3 (1965) 147.&lt;/ref&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; log[\rho(m)]= log[\sigma(E)] &lt;/math&gt;.

These two conditions are known as the ''self-consistency principle'' or ''bootstrap-idea''. After a long mathematical analysis Hagedorn was able to prove that there is in fact &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \rho(m) &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sigma(E)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the above conditions, resulting in

:&lt;math&gt; \rho(m) = a m^{-5/2} exp(\beta_o m) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma(E) = b E^{\alpha -1} exp(\beta_o E) &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\textstyle a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \alpha &lt;/math&gt; related by

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{a V}{(2 \pi \beta)^{3/5}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the asymptotic partition function is given by

:&lt;math&gt; Z_q(V_o,T)=\bigg(\frac{1}{\beta - \beta _o }\bigg)^{\alpha}-1 &lt;/math&gt;

where a singularity is clearly observed for &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; →&lt;math&gt;\beta_o&lt;/math&gt;. This singularity determines the limiting temperature &lt;math&gt;\textstyle T_o=1/\beta _o&lt;/math&gt; in Hagedorn's theory, which is also known as [[Hagedorn temperature]].

Hagedorn was able not only to give a simple explanation for the thermodynamical aspect of high energy particle production, but also worked out a formula for the [[hadronic]] mass spectrum and predicted the limiting temperature for hot hadronic systems.

After some time this limiting temperature was shown by [[Nicola Cabibbo|N. Cabibbo]] and [[Giorgio Parisi|G. Parisi]] to be related to a [[phase transition]],&lt;ref&gt;N. Cabibbo and G. Parisi, Phys. Lett. 59B (1975) 67.&lt;/ref&gt; which characterizes by the deconfinement of [[quark]]s at high energies. The mass spectrum was further analyzed by [[Steven Frautschi]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Frautschi, Phys. Rev. D 11 (1971) 2821.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Q-exponential function==
The Hagedorn theory was able to describe correctly the experimental data from collision with center-of-mass energies up to approximately 10 GeV, but above this region it failed. In 2000 [[I. Bediaga]], [[E. M. F. Curado]] and [[J. M. de Miranda]]&lt;ref&gt;I. Bediaga, E.M.F. Curado and J.M. de Miranda, Physica A 286 (2000) 156.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a phenomenological generalization of Hagedorn's theory by replacing the exponential function that appears in the partition function by the [[Tsallis_statistics#q-exponential|q-exponential]] function from the [[Constantino Tsallis|Tsallis]] non-extensive statistics. With this modification the generalized theory was able again to describe the extended experimental data.

In 2012 [[A. Deppman]] proposed a [[non-extensive self-consistent thermodynamical theory]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Deppman, Physica A 391 (2012) 6380.&lt;/ref&gt; that includes the self-consistency principle and the non-extensive statistics. This theory gives as result the same formula proposed by [[Bediaga]] et al., which describes correctly the high energy data, but also new formulas for the mass spectrum and density of states of fireball. It also predicts a new limiting temperature and a limiting entropic index.

'''Systems art''' is [[art]] influenced by [[cybernetics]], and [[systems theory]], that reflects on natural systems, social systems and social signs of the [[art world]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aat-ned.nl/wwwopac.exe?database=aat&amp;language=1&amp;TAB=&amp;%250=2583 Systems art], Dutch Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus, retrieved March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems art emerged as part of the first wave of the [[conceptual art]] movement extended in the 1960s and 1970s. Closely related and overlapping terms are ''[[Anti-form movement]]'', ''[[Cybernetic art]]'', ''Generative Systems'', ''[[Process art]]'', ''Systems aesthetic'', ''Systemic art'', ''Systemic painting'' and ''Systems sculptures''.

==Related fields of systems art==

=== Anti-form movement ===
By the early 1960s Minimalism had emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in [[geometric abstraction]] via [[Malevich]], [[the Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]) which rejected the idea of relational, and subjective painting, the complexity of [[Abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional [[zeitgeist]] and polemics present in the arena of [[Action painting]]. Minimalism argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. The term '''Systematic art''' was coined by [[Lawrence Alloway]] in 1966 as a description of the method artists, such as [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]] and [[Frank Stella]],  were using for composing [[abstract painting]]s.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Chilvers, Ian and Glaves-Smith, John, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'', second edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 694. {{ISBN|0199239665}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with painters such as [[Frank Stella]], minimalism in painting, as opposed to other areas, is a modernist movement. Depending on the context, minimalism might be construed as a precursor to the postmodern movement. Seen from the perspective of writers who sometimes classify it as a postmodern movement, early minimalism began and succeeded as a modernist movement to yield advanced works, but which partially abandoned this project when a few artists changed direction in favor of the anti-form movement.

In the late 1960s the term [[Postminimalism]] was coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]]&lt;ref&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, [[Art &amp; Auction|Art+Auction]], March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe minimalist derived art which had content and contextual overtones which minimalism rejected, and was applied to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Sol LeWitt]], and Barry Le Va, and others. Minimalists like [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce their [[Late modernism|late modernist]] paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.

=== Cybernetic art ===
[[File:Tsai opticalpainting.jpg|thumb|right|''Optical Painting'' by [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] (1964)]] 
Audio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], for example, used "all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media."&lt;ref name="RA 07"&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott," in Roy Ascott (2003, 2007), ''Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness'', University of California, {{ISBN|0-520-22294-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] and cybernetician [[Gordon Pask]] and the animist kinetics of Robert Breer and [[Jean Tinguely]], the 1960s produced a strain of cybernetic art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cybernetic art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and [[Gene Youngblood]] drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist [[Roy Ascott]] with his essay "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in the journal Cybernetica (1966–67), and  the American critic and theorist [[Jack Burnham]]. In ''Beyond Modern Sculpture'' from 1968 Burnham builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Whitelaw (2004), ''Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life'', MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-23234-0}} p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1968, curator Jasia Reichardt organized the landmark exhibition, Cybernetic Serendipity, at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London.

=== Generative systems ===
{{main|Generative art}}
[[File:Dombis 1687.jpg|thumb|Installation view of ''Irrational Geometrics'' 2008 by [[Pascal Dombis]]]]
Generative art is [[art]] that has been generated, composed, or constructed in an [[algorithmic art|algorithmic]] manner through the use of systems defined by [[computer]] [[software]] [[algorithms]], or similar [[mathematical]] or mechanical or [[random]]ised autonomous processes. [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] established Generative Systems as a program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"&gt;Sonia Landy Sheridan, "Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 16, No. 2 (Spring, 1983), pp. 103-108. {{doi|10.2307/1574794}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, which brought artists and scientists together, was an effort at turning the artist's passive role into an active one by promoting the investigation of contemporary scientific—technological systems and their relationship to art and life. Unlike copier art, which was a simple commercial spin-off, Generative Systems was actually involved in the development of elegant yet simple systems intended for creative use by the general population. Generative Systems artists attempted to bridge the gap between elite and novice by directing the line of communication between the two, thus bringing first generation information to greater numbers of people and bypassing the entrepreneur.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"/&gt;

=== Process art ===
{{main|Process art}}
[[File:Bolognini-CIMs.JPG|thumb|right|[[Maurizio Bolognini]], ''Collective Intelligence Machines'' series (CIMs, from 2000). These are generative and interactive installations using the mobile phone network and participation technologies taken from e-democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurizio Bolognini]], "De l'interaction à la démocratie. Vers un art génératif post-digital" / [http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm "From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art"], in ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique'', Edition L'Harmattan. Paris, 2011, pp. 229-239.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Process art is an [[artistic movement]] as well as a creative sentiment and world view where the end product of ''art'' and ''craft'', the ''[[:wikt:objet d’art|objet d’art]]'', is not the principal focus. The 'process' in process art refers to the process of the formation of art: the gathering, sorting, collating, associating, and patterning.  Process art is concerned with the actual ''doing''; art as a [[rite]], [[ritual]], and [[performance]]. Process art often entails an inherent motivation, rationale, and [[intentionality]]. Therefore, art is viewed as a creative journey or process, rather than as a deliverable or end product.
In the artistic discourse the work of [[Jackson Pollock]] is hailed as an antecedent. Process art in its employment of [[serendipity]] has a marked correspondence with [[Dada]]. Change and transience are marked themes in the process art movement. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] states that Robert Morris in 1968 had a groundbreaking exhibition and essay defining the movement and the Museum Website states as "Process artists were involved in issues attendant to the body, random occurrences, improvisation, and the liberating qualities of nontraditional materials such as wax, felt, and latex. Using these, they created eccentric forms in erratic or irregular arrangements produced by actions such as cutting, hanging, and dropping, or organic processes such as growth, condensation, freezing, or decomposition".&lt;ref&gt;Source:  {{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200906/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} (accessed: Thursday, March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Systemic art ===
According to Chilvers (2004) "earlier in 1966 the British art critic [[Lawrence Alloway]] had coined the term "Systemic art", to describe a type of abstract art characterized by the use of very simple standardized forms, usually geometric in character, either in a single concentrated image or repeated in a system arranged according to a clearly visible principle of organization. He considered the chevron paintings of [[Kenneth Noland]] as examples of Systemic art, and considered this as a branch of [[Minimal art]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Systemic art." The Oxford Dictionary of Art. Ed. Ian Chilvers. Oxford University Press, 2004. eNotes.com. 2006. 19 Mar, 2008 [http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/ systemic-art]&lt;/ref&gt;

John G. Harries considered a common ground in the ideas that underlie developments in 20th-century art such as [[Serial art]], Systems Art, [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Kinetic art]]. These kind of arts often do not stem directly from observations of things visible in the external natural environment, but from the observation of depicted shapes and of the relationship between them.&lt;ref name = "JGH 81"&gt;John G. Harries, "Personal Computers and Notated Visual Art", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 14, No. 4 (Autumn, 1981), pp. 299-301.&lt;/ref&gt; Systems art, according to Harries, represents a deliberate attempt by artists to develop a more flexible frame of reference. A style in which its frame of reference is taken as a model to be emulated rather than as a cognitive systems, that only leads to the institutionalization of the imposed model. But to transfer the meaning of a picture to its location within a systemic structure does not remove the need to define the constitutive elements of the system: if they are not defined, one will not know how to build the system.&lt;ref name = "JGH 81"/&gt;

=== Systemic painting ===
Systemic Painting, according to Auping (1989) "was the title of an highly influential exhibition at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in 1966 assembled and introduction written by [[Lawrence Alloway]] as curator. The show contained numerous works that many critics today would consider part of the [[Minimal art]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Auping (1989), ''Abstraction, Geometry, Painting: Selected Geometric Abstract Painting'', Albright-Knox Art Gallery, page 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In the catalogue Alloway noted, that ... "paintings, such as those in this exhibition are not, as has been often claimed, impersonal. The personal is not expunged by using a neat technique: anonymity is not a consequence of highly finishing a painting".&lt;ref name = "LA 66"&gt;Lawrence Alloway, "Systemic Painting", in: ''Minimal Art: A Critical Anthology'', by Gregory Battcock (1995). p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "systemic painting" later on has become the name for artists who employ systems make a number of aesthetic decisions before commencing 
to paint.&lt;ref&gt;John Albert Walker (1973), ''Glossary of Art, Architecture, and Design Since 1945: Terms and Labels'', p.197.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Systems sculpture ===
According to Feldman (1987) "[[serial art]], serial painting, systems sculpture and [[ABC art]], were art styles of the 1960s and 1970s in which simple geometric configurations are repeated with little or no variation. Sequences becomes important as in mathematics and linguistic context. These works rely on simple arrangements of basic volumes and voids, mechanically produced surfaces, and algebraic permutations of form. The impact on the viewer, however, is anything but simple".&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke Feldman (1987), ''Composition (Art)'', H.N. Abrams, {{ISBN|0-13-940602-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides object types, the terminology model allows defining hierarchical classifications, definitions for object type and [[property]] behavior and definition of casual relations.

The terminology model is a means for subject matter experts to express their knowledge about the subject in subject specific terms. Since the terminology model is structured rather similar to an [[object-oriented]] database schema, is can be transformed without loss of information into an object-oriented [[database schema]]. Thus, the terminology model is a method for problem analysis on the one side and a mean of defining database schema on the other side.

Several terminology models have been developed and published in the field of statistics:

{{Certainty sidebar}}

A '''theory''' is a [[contemplation|contemplative]] and [[reason|rational]] type of [[abstraction|abstract]] or generalizing thinking, or the results of such thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4y4DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT10&amp;ots=gRlsPCgq1L&amp;dq=A%20theory%20is%20a%20contemplative%20and%20rational%20type%20of%20abstract%20or%20generalizing%20thinking,%20or%20the%20results%20of%20such%20thinking&amp;pg=PT10#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20theory%20is%20a%20contemplative%20and%20rational%20type%20of%20abstract%20or%20generalizing%20thinking,%20or%20the%20results%20of%20such%20thinking&amp;f=false|title=Human Motivation, Metaphors, Theories, and Research|last=Reviews|first=C. T. I.|date=2016-10-16|publisher=Cram101 Textbook Reviews|isbn=9781497041400|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=November 2018}} Depending on the context, the results might, for example, include generalized explanations of how [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] works. The word has its roots in [[ancient Greek]], but in modern use it has taken on several related meanings.

Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McMurray|first1=Foster |title=Preface to an Autonomous Discipline of Education |journal=Educational Theory |date=July 1955 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=129–140 |doi = 10.1111/j.1741-5446.1955.tb01131.x |accessdate=3 March 2017 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-5446.1955.tb01131.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}} A theory can be a [[body of knowledge]], which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory [[Conceptual model|models]]. To theorize is to develop this body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Gary |title=Education and theory : strangers in paradigms |year=2007 |publisher=Open Univ. Press |location=Maidenhead |isbn=9780335211791 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}}

As already in Aristotle's definitions, theory is very often contrasted to "[[praxis (process)|practice]]" (from Greek ''[[Wiktionary:praxis|praxis]]'', πρᾶξις) a Greek term for ''doing'', which is opposed to theory because pure theory involves no doing apart from itself.{{reference needed|date=October 2018}} A classical example of the distinction between "theoretical" and "practical" uses the discipline of medicine: [[medical theory]] involves trying to understand the [[Causality|causes]] and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy. These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked.{{efn|1= See for example [[Hippocrates]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0251:text=Praec.:section=1&amp;highlight=medical%2Ctheory Praeceptiones, Part 1].  {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140912175614/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0251:text=Praec.:section=1&amp;highlight=medical%2Ctheory |date = September 12, 2014 }} }}

In modern [[science]], the term "theory" refers to [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], a well-confirmed type of explanation of [[nature]], made in a way [[Consistency|consistent]] with [[scientific method]], and fulfilling the [[Scientific theory#Characteristics of theories|criteria]] required by [[modern science]]. Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] support for, or empirically contradict ("[[Falsifiability|falsify]]") it. Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schafersman |first=Steven D. |title=An Introduction to Science |url = http://www.geo.sunysb.edu/esp/files/scientific-method.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to more common uses of the word "theory" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word ''[[hypothesis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Medicine|first1=National Academy of Sciences, Institute of|title=Science, evolution, and creationism|date=2008|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0309105862|page=11|edition=|url=http://nationalacademies.org/evolution/TheoryOrFact.html|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable [[conjecture]]s, and from [[scientific laws]], which are descriptive accounts of how nature behaves under certain conditions.

== Ancient uses ==
The English word ''theory'' derives from a technical term in [[philosophy]] in [[Classical Greece|Ancient Greek]]. As an everyday word, ''[[theoria]]'', {{lang|grc|θεωρία}}, meant "a looking at, viewing, beholding", but in more technical contexts it came to refer to [[contemplation|contemplative]] or [[speculative reason|speculative]] understandings of [[nature (philosophy)|natural things]], such as those of [[natural philosopher]]s, as opposed to more practical ways of knowing things, like that of skilled orators or artisans.{{efn|1=The word ''theoria'' occurs in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]], for example, that of [[Plato]]. It is a statement of how and why particular facts are related. It is related to words for {{lang|grc|θεωρός}} "spectator", {{lang|grc|θέα}} ''thea'' "a view" + {{lang|grc|ὁρᾶν}} ''horan'' "to see", literally "looking at a show". See for example [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=qewr&amp;lang=greek dictionary entries at Perseus website].}} English-speakers have used the word ''theory'' since at least the late [[16th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|theory|accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern uses of the word ''theory'' derive from the original definition, but have taken on new shades of meaning, still based on the idea of a theory as a thoughtful and [[reason|rational]] explanation of the general [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] of things.

Although it has more mundane meanings in Greek, the word {{lang|grc|θεωρία}} apparently developed special uses early in the recorded history of the [[Greek language]]. In the book ''From Religion to Philosophy'', [[F. M. Cornford|Francis Cornford]] suggests that the [[Orphics]] used the word ''theoria'' to mean "passionate sympathetic contemplation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From religion to philosophy: a study in the origins of western speculation |last=Cornford |first=Francis Macdonald |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=November 8, 1991 |isbn=978-0-691-02076-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pythagoras]] changed the word to mean a passionate sympathetic contemplation of mathematical knowledge, because he considered this intellectual pursuit the way to reach the highest plane of existence. Pythagoras emphasized subduing emotions and bodily desires to help the intellect function at the higher plane of theory. Thus, it was Pythagoras who gave the word ''theory'' the specific meaning that led to the classical and modern concept of a distinction between theory (as uninvolved, neutral thinking) and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Bertrand Russell |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]] |year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's terminology, as already mentioned, contrasts theory with ''praxis'' or practice, and this contrast remains today. For Aristotle, both practice and theory involve thinking, but the aims are different. Theoretical contemplation considers things humans do not move or change, such as [[nature (philosophy)|nature]], so it has no human aim apart from itself and the knowledge it helps create. On the other hand, ''praxis'' involves thinking, but always with an aim to desired actions, whereby humans cause change or movement themselves for their own ends. Any human movement that involves no conscious choice and thinking could not be an example of ''praxis'' or doing.{{efn|1= 
The [[A Greek–English Lexicon|LSJ]] cites two passages of Aristotle as examples, both from the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' and involving the definition of [[natural science]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D11%3Asection%3D1064a 11.1064a17], "it is clear that natural science (φυσικὴν ἐπιστήμην) must be neither practical (πρακτικὴν) nor productive (ποιητικὴν), but speculative (θεωρητικὴν)" and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D1025b 6.1025b25], "Thus if every intellectual activity [διάνοια] is either practical or productive or speculative (θεωρητική), physics (φυσικὴ) will be a speculative [θεωρητική] science." So Aristotle actually made a three way distinction between practical, theoretical and productive or technical—or between doing, contemplating or making. All three types involve thinking, but are distinguished by what causes the objects of thought to move or change.}}

== Theories formally and scientifically ==
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}
Theories are [[analysis|analytical]] tools for [[understanding]], [[explanation|explaining]], and making [[prediction]]s about a given subject matter. There are theories in many and varied fields of study, including the [[art]]s and [[science]]s. A formal theory is [[syntax (logic)|syntactic]] in nature and is only meaningful when given a [[semantics|semantic]] component by applying it to some content (e.g., [[fact]]s and relationships of the actual historical world as it is unfolding). Theories in various fields of study are expressed in [[natural language]], but are always constructed in such a way that their general form is identical to a theory as it is expressed in the [[formal language]] of [[mathematical logic]]. Theories may be expressed mathematically, symbolically, or in common language, but are generally expected to follow principles of [[reason|rational thought]] or [[logic]].

Theory is constructed of a set of [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] that are entirely true statements about the subject under consideration. However, the truth of any one of these statements is always relative to the whole theory. Therefore, the same statement may be true with respect to one theory, and not true with respect to another. This is, in ordinary language, where statements such as "He is a terrible person" cannot be judged as true or false without reference to some [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of who "He" is and for that matter what a "terrible person" is under the theory.&lt;ref name="curry"&gt;Curry, Haskell, ''Foundations of Mathematical Logic''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes two theories have exactly the same [[explanatory power]] because they make the same predictions. A pair of such theories is called indistinguishable or [[observational equivalence|observationally equivalent]], and the choice between them reduces to convenience or philosophical preference.

The [[metatheory|form of theories]] is studied formally in mathematical logic, especially in [[model theory]]. When theories are studied in mathematics, they are usually expressed in some formal language and their statements are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under application of certain procedures called [[rules of inference]]. A special case of this, an axiomatic theory, consists of [[axioms]] (or axiom schemata) and rules of inference. A [[theorem]] is a statement that can be derived from those axioms by application of these rules of inference. Theories used in applications are [[abstraction]]s of observed phenomena and the resulting theorems provide solutions to real-world problems. Obvious examples include [[arithmetic]] (abstracting concepts of number), [[geometry]] (concepts of space), and [[probability]] (concepts of randomness and likelihood).

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] shows that no consistent, [[recursively enumerable]] theory (that is, one whose theorems form a recursively enumerable set) in which the concept of [[natural numbers]] can be expressed, can include all [[truth|true]] statements about them. As a result, some domains of knowledge cannot be formalized, accurately and completely, as mathematical theories. (Here, formalizing accurately and completely means that all true propositions—and only true propositions—are derivable within the mathematical system.) This limitation, however, in no way precludes the construction of mathematical theories that formalize large bodies of scientific knowledge.

===Underdetermination===
{{Main|Underdetermination}}
A theory is ''underdetermined'' (also called ''indeterminacy of data to theory'') if a rival, inconsistent theory is at least as consistent with the evidence. Underdetermination is an [[epistemology|epistemological]] issue about the relation of [[evidence]] to conclusions.

A theory that lacks supporting evidence is generally, more properly, referred to as a [[hypothesis]].

===Intertheoretic reduction and elimination===
{{Main|Intertheoretic reduction}}
If a new theory better explains and predicts a phenomenon than an old theory (i.e., it has more [[explanatory power]]), we are [[Theory of justification|justified]] in believing that the newer theory describes reality more correctly. This is called an ''intertheoretic reduction'' because the terms of the old theory can be reduced to the terms of the new one. For instance, our historical understanding about ''sound'', "light" and ''heat'' have been reduced to ''wave compressions and rarefactions'', ''electromagnetic waves'', and ''molecular kinetic energy'', respectively. These terms, which are identified with each other, are called ''intertheoretic identities.'' When an old and new theory are parallel in this way, we can conclude that the new one describes the same reality, only more completely.

When a new theory uses new terms that do not reduce to terms of an older theory, but rather replace them because they misrepresent reality, it is called an ''intertheoretic elimination.'' For instance, the [[superseded scientific theories|obsolete scientific theory]] that put forward an understanding of heat transfer in terms of the movement of [[caloric fluid]] was eliminated when a theory of heat as energy replaced it. Also, the theory that [[phlogiston]] is a substance released from burning and rusting material was eliminated with the new understanding of the reactivity of oxygen.

===Theories vs. theorems===
Theories are distinct from [[theorem]]s. A ''theorem'' is [[formal proof|derived]] deductively from [[axiom]]s (basic assumptions) according to a [[formal system]] of rules, sometimes as an end in itself and sometimes as a first step toward being tested or applied in a concrete situation; theorems are said to be true in the sense that the conclusions of a theorem are logical consequences of the axioms. ''Theories'' are abstract and conceptual, and are supported or challenged by observations in the world. They are '[[rigor]]ously tentative', meaning that they are proposed as true and expected to satisfy careful examination to account for the possibility of faulty inference or incorrect observation. Sometimes theories are incorrect, meaning that an explicit set of observations contradicts some fundamental objection or application of the theory, but more often theories are corrected to conform to new observations, by restricting the class of phenomena the theory applies to or changing the assertions made. An example of the former is the restriction of classical mechanics to phenomena involving macroscopic length scales and particle speeds much lower than the speed of light.

==Scientific theories==
{{Main|Scientific theory}}
In science, the term "theory" refers to "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been [[Reproducibility|repeatedly confirmed]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=2 National Academy of Sciences], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAAS Evolution Resources"&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/news/press_room/evolution/qanda.shtml AAAS Evolution Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; Theories must also meet further requirements, such as the ability to make [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] predictions with consistent accuracy across a broad area of scientific inquiry, and production of strong evidence in favor of the theory from multiple independent sources ([[consilience]]).

The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain, which is measured by its ability to make [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] [[Prediction#Prediction in science|predictions]] with respect to those phenomena. Theories are improved (or replaced by better theories) as more evidence is gathered, so that accuracy in prediction improves over time; this increased accuracy corresponds to an increase in scientific knowledge. Scientists use theories as a foundation to gain further scientific knowledge, as well as to accomplish goals such as inventing [[technology]] or curing [[disease]].

===Definitions from scientific organizations===
The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] defines scientific theories as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The formal scientific definition of "theory" is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence.  Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics)...One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=11 National Academy of Sciences] (2008), ''Science, Evolution, and Creationism.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than "just a theory." It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.&lt;ref name="AAAS Evolution Resources"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that the term ''theory'' would not be appropriate for describing untested but intricate hypotheses or even [[Scientific modelling|scientific models.]]

=== Philosophical views===
The [[logical positivist]]s thought of scientific theories as ''deductive theories''—that a theory's content is based on some [[formal system|formal system of logic]] and on basic [[axioms]]. In a deductive theory, any sentence which is a [[logical consequence]] of one or more of the axioms is also a sentence of that theory.&lt;ref name="curry"/&gt; This is called the [[received view of theories]].

In the [[semantic view of theories]],  which has largely replaced the received view,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suppe |first1=Frederick |year=1998 |title=Understanding Scientific Theories: An Assessment of Developments, 1969-1998 |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=67 |pages=S102–S115 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/Suppe_2000.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013 |doi=10.1086/392812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halvorson |first1=Hans |year=2012 |title=What Scientific Theories Could Not Be |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=183–206 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/halvorson2012.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013 |doi=10.1086/664745}}&lt;/ref&gt; theories are viewed as [[scientific models]]. A [[Scientific model|model]] is a logical framework intended to represent reality (a "model of reality"), similar to the way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or country. In this approach, theories are a specific category of models that fulfill the necessary criteria. (See [[Scientific theory#Theories as models|Theories as models]] for further discussion.)

===In physics===
In [[physics]] the term ''theory'' is generally used for a mathematical framework—derived from a small set of basic [[postulates]] (usually symmetries, like equality of locations in space or in time, or identity of electrons, etc.)—which is capable of producing experimental predictions for a given category of physical systems. One good example is [[classical electromagnetism]], which encompasses results derived from [[gauge symmetry]] (sometimes called gauge invariance) in a form of a few equations called [[Maxwell's equations]]. The specific mathematical aspects of classical electromagnetic theory are termed "laws of electromagnetism", reflecting the level of consistent and reproducible evidence that supports them. Within electromagnetic theory generally, there are numerous hypotheses about how electromagnetism applies to specific situations. Many of these hypotheses are already considered adequately tested, with new ones always in the making and perhaps untested.

=== Regarding the term ''theoretical'' ===
Acceptance of a theory does not require that all of its major predictions be tested{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, if it is already supported by sufficiently strong evidence. For example, certain tests may be infeasible or technically difficult. As a result, theories may make predictions that have not yet been confirmed or proven incorrect; in this case, the predicted results may be described informally using the term "theoretical." These predictions can be tested at a later time, and if they are incorrect, this may lead to revision, invalidation, or rejection of the theory.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/21457-what-is-a-law-in-science-definition-of-scientific-law.html|title=What Is a Law in Science?|accessdate=January 1, 2017|work=Live Science |first=Alina|last=Bradford|date=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical theories ==
{{Main|Philosophical theory}}
A theory can be either ''descriptive'' as in science, or ''prescriptive'' ([[normative ethics|normative]]) as in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kneller|first1=George Frederick|title=Introduction to the philosophy of education|date=1964|publisher=J. Wiley|location=New York|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OQhAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions:UOM39015026974538|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter are those whose subject matter consists not of empirical data, but rather of [[idea]]s. At least some of the elementary theorems of a philosophical theory are statements whose truth cannot necessarily be scientifically tested through [[empiricism|empirical observation]].

A field of study is sometimes named a "theory" because its basis is some initial set of assumptions describing the field's approach to the subject. These assumptions are the elementary theorems of the particular theory, and can be thought of as the axioms of that field. Some commonly known examples include [[set theory]] and [[number theory]]; however [[literary theory]], [[critical theory]], and [[music theory]] are also of the same form.

=== Metatheory ===
{{Main|Metatheory}}
One form of philosophical theory is a ''metatheory'' or ''meta-theory''. A metatheory is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory or set of theories. In other words, it is a theory about theories. [[Statement (logic)|Statements]] made in the metatheory about the theory are called [[metatheorem]]s.

== Political theories ==
{{Main|Political theory}}
A political theory is an [[ethics|ethical]] theory about the law and government. Often the term "political theory" refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about [[politics]].

== Jurisprudential theories ==
{{Main|Jurisprudence|Law}}
In social science, [[jurisprudence]] is the philosophical theory of law. Contemporary philosophy of law addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution.

==List of notable theories==
Most of the following are scientific theories; some are not, but rather encompass a body of knowledge or art, such as Music theory and Visual Arts Theories.

Copenhagen 1811, in Danish, printed by Johan Frederik Schulz. In Kirstine Meyer's 1920 edition of Ørsted's works, vol.'''III''' pp. 151-190. ) "First Introduction to Physics: the Spirit, Meaning, and Goal of Natural Science".

Given the structure of the [[experiment]], it may not be possible to perform it, and even if it could be performed, there need not be an intention to perform it.

The common goal of a thought experiment is to explore the potential consequences of the principle in question:
::"A thought experiment is a device with which one performs an intentional, structured process of intellectual deliberation in order to speculate, within a specifiable problem domain, about potential consequents (or antecedents) for a designated antecedent (or consequent)" (Yeates, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;150).

Examples of thought experiments include [[Schrödinger's cat]], illustrating [[quantum indeterminacy]] through the manipulation of a perfectly sealed environment and a tiny bit of [[radioactive]] substance, and [[Maxwell's demon]], which attempts to demonstrate the ability of a hypothetical finite being to violate the [[second law of thermodynamics|2nd law of thermodynamics]].

== Overview ==
The ancient Greek '''δείκνυμι''' ''([[Transliteration|transl.]]: deiknymi)'', or thought experiment, "was the most ancient pattern of [[mathematical proof]]", and existed before Euclidean mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;Szábo, Árpád. (1958) " 'Deiknymi' als Mathematischer Terminus fur 'Beweisen' ", ''Maia'' N.S. '''10''' pp. 1–26 as cited by [[Imre Lakatos]] (1976) in ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]'' p.9. (John Worrall and Elie Zahar, eds.) Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-21078-X}}. The English translation of the title of Szábo's article is "'Deiknymi' as a mathematical expression for 'to prove'", as translated by [http://cimm.ucr.ac.cr/ciaem/articulos/historia/filo/%C3%81rpad%20zs%C3%A1bo%20and%20imre%20lakatos,%20or%20the%20relation%20between%20history%20and%20philosophy%20of%20mathematics.*M%C3%A1t%C3%A9,%20Andr%C3%A1s.*Lakatos.pdf András Máté] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231500/http://cimm.ucr.ac.cr/ciaem/articulos/historia/filo/%C3%81rpad%20zs%C3%A1bo%20and%20imre%20lakatos,%20or%20the%20relation%20between%20history%20and%20philosophy%20of%20mathematics.*M%C3%A1t%C3%A9,%20Andr%C3%A1s.*Lakatos.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}, p.285&lt;/ref&gt; where the emphasis was on the conceptual, rather than on the experimental part of a thought-experiment. Perhaps the key experiment in the history of modern science is [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s demonstration that falling objects must fall at the same rate regardless of their masses. This is widely thought&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Martin, "Wittgenstein's Beetle and Other Classic Thought Experiments", Blackwell, (Oxford), 2005, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;  to have been a straightforward physical demonstration, involving climbing up the Leaning Tower of Pisa and dropping two heavy  weights off it, whereas in fact, it was a logical demonstration, using the 'thought experiment' technique. The 'experiment' is described by Galileo in ''[[Two New Sciences|Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche]]'' (1638) (literally, 'Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations') thus:

{{quote|''Salviati''. If then we take two bodies whose natural speeds are different, it is clear that on uniting the two, the more rapid one will be partly retarded by the slower, and the slower will be somewhat hastened by the swifter. Do you not agree with me in this opinion?

''Simplicio''. You are unquestionably right.

''Salviati''. But if this is true, and if a large stone moves with a speed of, say, eight while a smaller moves with a speed of four, then when they are united, the system will move with a speed less than eight; but the two stones when tied together make a stone larger than that which before moved with a speed of eight. Hence the heavier body moves with less speed than the lighter; an effect which is contrary to your supposition. Thus you see how, from your assumption that the heavier body moves more rapidly than the lighter one, I infer that the heavier body moves more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/tns61.htm |title=Galileo on Aristotle and Acceleration  |accessdate=2008-05-24 }} &lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the extract does not convey the elegance and power of the 'demonstration' terribly well, it is clear that it is a 'thought' experiment, rather than a practical one. Strange then, as Cohen says, that philosophers and scientists alike refuse to acknowledge either Galileo in particular, or the thought experiment technique in general for its pivotal role in both science and philosophy. (The exception proves the rule&amp;nbsp;— the iconoclastic philosopher of science, [[Paul Feyerabend]], has also observed this methodological prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Paul Feyerabend, 'Against Method', Verso (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;)

Instead, many philosophers prefer to consider 'Thought Experiments' to be merely the use of a hypothetical [[scenario]] to help understand the way things are.

== Variety ==
Thought experiments have been used in a variety of fields, including [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[physics]], and [[mathematics]]. In philosophy, they have been used at least since [[classical antiquity]], some pre-dating [[Socrates]]. In law, they were well-known to [[Roman law]]yers quoted in the [[Pandects|Digest]].&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Pandects'' "every logical rule of law is capable of illumination from the law of the Pandects."&lt;/ref&gt; In physics and other sciences, notable thought experiments date from the 19th and especially the 20th century, but examples can be found at least as early as [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]].

==Origins and use of the literal term==
Johann Witt-Hansen established that [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] was the first to use the Latin-German mixed term ''Gedankenexperiment'' (lit. thought experiment) circa 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Witt-Hansen (1976). Although ''Experiment'' is a German word, it is derived from [[Latin]]. The synonym ''Versuch'' has purely [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] roots.&lt;/ref&gt; Ørsted was also the first to use its entirely German equivalent, ''Gedankenversuch'', in 1820.

Much later, [[Ernst Mach]] used the term ''Gedankenexperiment'' in a different way, to denote exclusively the ''imaginary'' conduct of a ''real'' experiment that would be subsequently performed as a ''real physical experiment'' by his students.&lt;ref&gt;Mach, Ernst (1883), The Science of Mechanics (6th edition, translated by Thomas J. McCormack), LaSalle, Illinois: Open Court, 1960.  pp. 32-41, 159-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Physical and mental experimentation could then be contrasted: Mach asked his students to provide him with explanations whenever the results from their subsequent, real, physical experiment differed from those of their prior, imaginary experiment.

The English term ''thought experiment'' was coined (as a [[calque]]) from Mach's ''Gedankenexperiment'', and it first appeared in the 1897 English translation of one of Mach’s papers.&lt;ref&gt;Mach, Ernst (1897), "On Thought Experiments", in ''Knowledge and Error'' (translated by Thomas J. McCormack and Paul Foulkes), Dordrecht Holland: Reidel, 1976, pp. 134-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its emergence, the activity of posing hypothetical questions that employed subjunctive reasoning had existed for a very long time (for both scientists and philosophers). However, people had no way of categorizing it or speaking about it. This helps to explain the extremely wide and diverse range of the application of the term "thought experiment" once it had been introduced into English.

==Uses==
Thought experiments, which are well-structured, well-defined hypothetical questions that employ [[subjunctive]] reasoning ([[irrealis moods]]) – "What might happen (or, what might have happened) if . . . " – have been used to pose questions in philosophy at least since Greek antiquity, some pre-dating [[Socrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Nicholas Rescher|last=Rescher |first= N.|chapter=Thought Experiment in Pre-Socratic Philosophy|pages=31–41 |editor1-last=Horowitz  |editor1-first=T. |editor2-last=Massey |editor2-first=G.J.  |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00003190/ |title=Thought Experiments in Science and Philosophy | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield, (Savage)|year=1991 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In physics and other sciences many thought experiments date from the 19th and especially the 20th Century, but examples can be found at least as early as [[Galileo]].

In thought experiments we gain new information by rearranging or reorganizing already known empirical data in a new way and drawing new (a priori) inferences from them or by looking at these data from a different and unusual perspective. In Galileo’s thought experiment, for example, the rearrangement of empirical experience consists in the original idea of combining bodies of different weight.&lt;ref&gt;Brendal, Elke, "Intuition Pumps and the Proper Use of Thought Experiments". Dialectica. V.58, Issue 1, p 89–108, March   2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Thought experiments have been used in [[philosophy]] (especially [[ethics]]), [[physics]], and other fields (such as [[cognitive psychology]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[economics]], [[social psychology]], [[law]], [[organizational studies]], [[marketing]], and [[epidemiology]]).  In law, the synonym "hypothetical" is frequently used for such experiments.

Regardless of their intended goal, all thought experiments display a patterned way of thinking that is designed to allow us to explain, predict and control events in a better and more productive way.

===Theoretical consequences===
In terms of their theoretical consequences, thought experiments generally:
* challenge (or even refute) a prevailing theory, often involving the device known as [[reductio ad absurdum]], (as in Galileo's original argument, a [[proof by contradiction]]),
* confirm a prevailing theory,
* establish a new theory, or
* simultaneously refute a prevailing theory and establish a new theory through a process of mutual exclusion

===Practical applications===
Thought experiments can produce some very important and different outlooks on previously unknown or unaccepted theories. However, they may make those theories themselves irrelevant, and could possibly create new problems that are just as difficult, or possibly more difficult to resolve.

In terms of their practical application, thought experiments are generally created to:
* challenge the prevailing [[status quo]] (which includes activities such as correcting [[misinformation]] (or misapprehension), identify flaws in the argument(s) presented, to  preserve (for the long-term) objectively established fact, and to refute  specific assertions that some particular thing is permissible, forbidden, known, believed, possible, or necessary);
* [[extrapolate]] beyond (or [[interpolate]] within) the boundaries of already established fact;
* [[predict]] and [[forecasting|forecast]] the (otherwise) indefinite and unknowable future;
* explain the past;
* the [[retrodiction]], [[postdiction]] and [[hindcast]]ing of the (otherwise) indefinite and unknowable past;
* facilitate decision making, choice and strategy selection;
* solve problems, and generate ideas;
* move current (often insoluble) problems into another, more helpful and more productive problem space (e.g.: [[functional fixedness]]);
* attribute causation, preventability, blame and responsibility for specific outcomes;
* assess [[culpability]] and [[compensatory damages]] in social and legal contexts;
* ensure the repeat of past success; or
* examine the extent to which past events might have occurred differently.
* ensure the (future) avoidance of past failures

==In science==
Scientists tend to use thought experiments as imaginary, "proxy" experiments prior to a real, "physical" experiment ([[Ernst Mach]] always argued that these '''''gedankenexperiments''''' were "a necessary precondition for physical experiment"). In these cases, the result of the "proxy" experiment will often be so clear that there will be no need to conduct a physical experiment at all.

Scientists also use thought experiments when particular physical experiments are impossible to conduct ([[Carl Gustav Hempel]] labeled these sorts of experiment "''theoretical experiments-in-imagination''"), such as [[Einstein's thought experiments|Einstein's thought experiment]] of chasing a light beam, leading to [[special relativity]].  This is a unique use of a scientific thought experiment, in that it was never carried out, but led to a successful theory, proven by other empirical means.

==Relation to real experiments==
The relation to real experiments can be quite complex, as can be seen again from an example going back to Albert Einstein. In 1935, with two coworkers, he published a paper on a newly created subject called later the EPR effect ([[EPR paradox]]). In this paper, starting from certain philosophical assumptions,&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, E.T. (1989).[http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf  Clearing up the Mysteries], opening talk at the 8th International MAXENT Workshop, St John's College, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of a rigorous analysis of a certain, complicated, but in the meantime assertedly realizable model, he came to the conclusion that  ''quantum mechanics should be described as "incomplete"''. [[Niels Bohr]] asserted a refutation of Einstein's analysis immediately, and his view prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P., Taylor, E.F. (1979/1989). ''An Introduction to Quantum Physics'', Van Nostrand Reinhold (International), London, {{ISBN|0-442-30770-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, J.A, Zurek, W.H., editors (1983). ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', Princeton University Press, Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;d'Espagnat, B. (2006). ''On Physics and Philosophy'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, {{ISBN|978-0-691-11964-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some decades, it was asserted that feasible experiments could prove the error of the EPR paper. These experiments tested the [[Bell inequalities]] published in 1964 in a purely theoretical paper. The above-mentioned EPR philosophical starting assumptions were considered to be falsified by empirical fact (e.g. by the optical ''real experiments'' of  [[Alain Aspect]]).

Thus ''thought experiments'' belong to a theoretical discipline, usually to [[theoretical physics]], but often to [[theoretical philosophy]]. In any case, it must be distinguished from a real experiment, which belongs naturally to the experimental discipline and has "the final decision on ''true'' or ''not true''", at least in physics.

==Causal reasoning==
The first characteristic pattern that thought experiments display is their orientation
in time.&lt;ref&gt;Yeates, 2004, pp.138-143.&lt;/ref&gt; They are either:
* ''Antefactual speculations'': experiments that speculate about what might have happened prior to a specific, designated event, or
* ''Postfactual speculations'': experiments that speculate about what may happen subsequent to (or consequent upon) a specific, designated event.

The second characteristic pattern is their movement in time in relation to “the present
moment standpoint” of the individual performing the experiment; namely, in terms of:
* Their ''temporal direction'': are they past-oriented or future-oriented?
* Their ''temporal sense'':
:(a) in the case of past-oriented thought experiments, are they examining the consequences of temporal “movement” from the present to the past, or from the past to the present? or,
:(b) in the case of future-oriented thought experiments, are they examining the consequences of temporal “movement” from the present to the future, or from the future to the present?

== Seven types ==
[[File:The Prefactual Thought Experiment.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of a prefactual thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Generally speaking, there are seven types of thought experiments in which one reasons from causes to effects, or effects to causes:&lt;ref&gt;See Yeates, 2004, pp.138-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prefactual===
''Prefactual (before the fact) thought experiments'' — the term '''[[Defensive_pessimism#Prefactual_thinking|prefactual]]''' was coined by Lawrence J. Sanna in 1998&lt;ref&gt;Sanna, L.J., "Defensive Pessimism and Optimism: The Bitter-Sweet Influence of Mood on Performance and Prefactual and Counterfactual Thinking", ''Cognition and Emotion'', Vol.12, No.5, (September 1998), pp.635-665. (Sanna used the term ''prefactual'' to distinguish these sorts of thought experiment from both ''semifactuals'' and ''counterfactuals''.)&lt;/ref&gt; — speculate on possible future outcomes, given the present, and ask "What will be the outcome if event E occurs?"

===Counterfactual===
[[File:The Counterfactual Thought Experiment.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of a counterfactual thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.144.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Counterfactual (contrary to established fact) thought experiments'' — the term ''[[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]]'' was coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N., "The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol.44, No.5, (27 February 1947), pp.113-128.&lt;/ref&gt; extending [[Roderick Chisholm]]'s (1946) notion of a "contrary-to-fact conditional"&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, R.M., "The Contrary-to-Fact Conditional", ''Mind'', Vol.55, No.220, (October 1946), pp.289-307.&lt;/ref&gt; — speculate on the possible outcomes of a different past;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]] (''[[Shadows of the Mind|Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness]]'', Oxford University Press, (Oxford),1994, p.240) considers counterfactuals to be "things that might have happened, although they did not in fact happen".&lt;/ref&gt; and ask "What might have happened if A had happened instead of B?" (e.g., "If [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]  '''''had'''''  cooperated with each other, what would mathematics look like today?").&lt;ref&gt;In 1748, when defining causation, [[David Hume]] referred to a counterfactual case: "…we may define a cause to be an ''object, followed by another, and where all objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the second''.

===Semifactual===
[[File:The Semifactual Thought Experiment.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of a semifactual thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.144.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Semifactual thought experiments'' — the term ''semifactual'' was coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in 1947&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N., "The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol.44, No.5, (27 February 1947), pp.113-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman's original concept has been subsequently developed and expanded by (a) Daniel Cohen (Cohen, D., "Semifactuals, Even-Ifs, and Sufficiency", ''International Logic Review'', Vol.16, (1985), pp.102-111), (b) Stephen Barker (Barker, S., "''Even'', ''Still'' and Counterfactuals", ''Linguistics and Philosophy'', Vol.14, No.1, (February 1991), pp.1-38; Barker, S., "Counterfactuals, Probabilistic Counterfactuals and Causation", ''Mind'', Vol.108, No.431, (July 1999), pp.427-469), and (c) Rachel McCloy and Ruth Byrne (McCloy, R. &amp; Byrne, R.M.J., "Semifactual 'Even If' Thinking", ''Thinking and Reasoning'', Vol.8, No.1, (February 2002), pp.41-67).&lt;/ref&gt; — speculate on the extent to which things might have remained the same, despite there being a different past; and asks the question Even though X happened instead of E, would Y have still occurred? (e.g., Even if the goalie '''''had''''' moved left, rather than right, could he have intercepted a ball that was traveling at such a speed?).

Semifactual speculations are an important part of clinical medicine.

===Prediction===
[[File:Prediction, Forecasting and Nowcasting.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of prediction, forecasting and nowcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.145.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of [[prediction]] attempts to project the circumstances of the present into the future. According to David Sarewitz and Roger Pielke (1999, p123), scientific prediction takes two forms:
:(1) “The elucidation of invariant — and therefore predictive — principles of nature”; and
:(2) “[Using] suites of observational data and sophisticated numerical models in an effort to foretell the behavior or evolution of complex phenomena”.&lt;ref&gt;Sarewitz, D. &amp; Pielke, R., "Prediction in Science and Policy", ''Technology in Society'', Vol.21, No.2, (April 1999), pp.121-133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they perform different social and scientific functions, the only difference between the qualitatively identical activities of ''predicting'', ''forecasting,'' and ''nowcasting'' is the distance of the speculated future from the present moment occupied by the user.&lt;ref&gt;Nowcasting (obviously based on forecasting) is also known as ''very-short-term forecasting''; thus, also indicating a ''very-short-term'', ''mid-range'', and ''long-range forecasting'' continuum.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the activity of nowcasting, defined as “a detailed description of the current weather along with forecasts obtained by extrapolation up to 2 hours ahead”, is essentially concerned with describing the current state of affairs, it is common practice to extend the term “to cover very-short-range forecasting up to 12 hours ahead” (Browning, 1982, p.ix).&lt;ref&gt;Browning, K.A. (ed.), ''Nowcasting'', Academic Press, (London), 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, and Brown — Murphy, A.H. &amp; Brown, B.G., "Similarity and Analogical Reasoning: A Synthesis", pp.3-15 in Browning, K.A. (ed.),
''Nowcasting'', Academic Press, (London), 1982 — describe a large range of specific applications for meteorological nowcasting over wide range of user demands:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Agriculture: (a) wind and precipitation forecasts for effective seeding and spraying from aircraft; (b) precipitation forecasts to minimize damage to seedlings; (c) minimum temperature, dewpoint, cloud cover, and wind speed forecasts to protect crops from frost; (d) maximum temperature forecasts to reduce adverse effects of high temperatures on crops and livestock; (e) humidity and cloud cover forecasts to prevent fungal disease crop losses ; (f) hail forecasts to minimize damage to livestock and greenhouses; (g) precipitation, temperature, and dewpoint
forecasts to avoid during- and after-harvest losses due to crops rotting in the field; (h) precipitation forecasts to minimize losses in drying raisins; and (i) humidity forecasts to reduce costs and losses resulting from poor conditions for drying tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Construction: (a) precipitation and wind speed forecasts to avoid damage to finished work (e.g. concrete) and minimize costs of protecting exposed surfaces, structures, and work sites; and (b) precipitation, wind speed, and high/low temperature forecasts to schedule work in an efficient manner.&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Energy: (a) temperature, humidity, wind, cloud, etc. forecasts to optimize procedures related to generation and distribution of electricity and gas; (b) forecasts of thunderstorms, strong winds, low temperatures, and freezing precipitation minimize damage to lines and equipment and
to schedule repairs.&lt;br /&gt;
(4) Transportation: (a) ceiling height and visibility, winds and turbulence, and surface ice and snow forecasts minimize risk, maximize efficiency in pre-flight and in-flight decisions and other adjustments to weather-related fluctuations in traffic; (b) forecasts of wind speed and direction, as well as severe weather and icing conditions along flight paths facilitate optimal airline route planning; (c) forecasts of snowfall, precipitation, and other storm-related events allow truckers, motorists, and public transportation systems to avoid damage to weather-sensitive goods, select optimum routes, prevent accidents, minimize delays, and maximize revenues under conditions of adverse weather.&lt;br /&gt;
(5) Public Safety &amp; General Public: (a) rain, snow, wind, and temperature forecasts assist the general public in planning activities such as commuting, recreation, and shopping; (b) forecasts of temperature/humidity extremes (or significant changes) alert hospitals, clinics, and the public to weather conditions that may seriously aggravate certain health-related illnesses; (c) forecasts related to potentially dangerous or damaging natural events (e.g., tornados, severe thunderstorms, severe winds, storm surges, avalanches, precipitation, floods) minimize loss of life and property damage; and (d) forecasts of snowstorms, surface icing, visibility, and other events (e.g. floods) enable highway maintenance and traffic control organizations to take appropriate actions to reduce risks of traffic accidents and protect roads from damage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindcasting===
[[File:Hindcasting.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of hindcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.145.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of [[Backtesting#Hindcast|hindcasting]] involves running a forecast model after an event has happened in order to test whether the model's [[simulation]] is valid.

In 2003, Dake Chen and his colleagues “trained” a computer using the data of the surface temperature of the oceans from the last 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, D., Cane, M.A., Kaplan, A., Zebiak, S.E. &amp; Huang, D., "Predictability of El Niño Over the Past 148 Years", ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.733-736; Anderson, D., "Testing Time for El Niño", ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.709, 711.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, using data that had been collected on the surface temperature of the oceans for the period 1857 to 2003, they went through a hindcasting exercise and discovered that their simulation not only accurately predicted every [[El Niño]] event for the last 148 years, it also identified the (up to 2 years) looming foreshadow of every single one of those El Niño events.&lt;ref&gt;Not only did their hindcasting demonstrate that the computerized simulation models could predict the onset of El Niño climatic events from changes in the temperature of the ocean's surface temperature that occur up to two years earlier — meaning that there was now, potentially, at least 2 years' lead time — but the results also implied that El Niño events seemed to be the effects of some causal regularity; and, therefore, were not due to simple chance.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrodiction===
[[File:Retrodiction or Postdiction.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of retrodiction or postdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of ''[[retrodiction]]'' (or ''postdiction'') involves moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the present into the speculated past to establish the ultimate cause of a specific event (e.g., [[reverse engineering]] and [[forensics]]).

Given that retrodiction is a process in which "past observations, events and data are used as evidence to infer the process(es) the produced them" and that [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] "involve[s] going from visible effects such as symptoms, signs and the like to their prior causes",&lt;ref&gt;p.24, Einhorn, H.J. &amp; Hogarth, R.M., "Prediction, Diagnosis, and Causal Thinking in Forecasting", ''Journal of Forecasting'', (January–March 1982), Vol.1, No.1, pp.23-36.&lt;/ref&gt; the essential balance between prediction and retrodiction could be characterized as:
::'''retrodiction : diagnosis :: prediction : prognosis'''
regardless of whether the [[prognosis]] is of the course of the disease in the absence of treatment, or of the application of a specific treatment regimen to a specific disorder in a particular patient.&lt;ref&gt;"…We consider diagnostic inference to be based on causal thinking, although in doing diagnosis one has to mentally reverse the time order in which events were thought to have occurred (hence the term “backward inference”). On the other hand, predictions involve forward inference; i.e., one goes forward in time from present causes to future effects. However, it is important to recognize the dependence of forward inference/prediction on backward inference/diagnosis. In particular, it seems likely that success in predicting the future depends to a considerable degree on making sense of the past. Therefore, people are continually engaged in shifting between forward and backward inference in both making and evaluating forecasts. Indeed, this can be eloquently summarized by Kierkegaard's observation that, 'Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards' …"(Einhorn &amp; Hogarth, 1982, p.24).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backcasting===
[[File:Backcasting.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of backcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of ''[[backcasting]]'' — the term ''backcasting'' was coined by John Robinson in 1982&lt;ref&gt;See Robinson, J.B., "Energy Backcasting: A Proposed Method of Policy Analysis", ''Energy Policy'', Vol.10, No.4 (December 1982), pp.337-345; Robinson, J.B., "Unlearning and Backcasting: Rethinking Some of the Questions We Ask About the Future", ''Technological Forecasting and Social Change'', Vol.33, No.4, (July 1988), pp.325-338; Robinson, J., "Future Subjunctive: Backcasting as Social Learning", ''Futures'', Vol.35, No.8, (October 2003), pp.839-856.&lt;/ref&gt; — involves establishing the description of a very definite and very specific future situation. It then involves an imaginary moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the future to the present to reveal the mechanism through which that particular specified future could be attained from the present.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson's backcasting approach is very similar to the ''anticipatory scenarios'' of Ducot and Lubben (Ducot, C. &amp; Lubben, G.J., "A Typology for Scenarios", ''Futures'', Vol.11, No.1, (February 1980), pp.51-57), and Bunn and Salo (Bunn, D.W. &amp; Salo, A.A., "Forecasting with scenarios", European Journal of Operational Research, Vol.68, No.3, (13 August 1993), pp.291-303).&lt;/ref&gt;

Backcasting is not concerned with predicting the future:
::The major distinguishing characteristic of backcasting analyses is the concern, not with likely energy futures, but with how desirable futures can be attained. It is thus explicitly [[normative]], involving 'working backwards' from a particular future end-point to the present to determine what policy measures would be required to reach that future.&lt;ref&gt;p.814, Dreborg, K.H., "Essence of Backcasting", ''Futures'', Vol.28, No.9, (November 1996), pp.813-828.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jansen (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;503:&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, L., "Towards a Sustainable Future, en route with Technology", pp.496-525 in Dutch Committee for Long-Term Environmental Policy (ed.), ''The Environment: Towards a Sustainable Future (Environment &amp; Policy, Volume 1)'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, (Dortrecht), 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
::Within the framework of technological development, “forecasting” concerns the extrapolation of developments towards the future and the exploration of achievements that can be realized through technology in the long term. Conversely, the reasoning behind “backcasting” is: on the basis of an interconnecting picture of demands technology must meet in the future — “sustainability criteria” — to direct and determine the process that technology development must take and possibly also the pace at which this development process must take effect.
::Backcasting [is] both an important aid in determining the direction technology development must take and in specifying the targets to be set for this purpose. As such, backcasting is an ideal search toward determining the nature and scope of the technological challenge posed by sustainable development, and it can thus serve to direct the search process toward new — sustainable — technology.

==In philosophy==
In philosophy, a thought experiment typically presents an imagined scenario with the intention of eliciting an intuitive or reasoned response about the way things are in the thought experiment.  (Philosophers might also supplement their thought experiments with theoretical reasoning designed to support the desired intuitive response.)  The scenario will typically be designed to target a particular philosophical notion, such as morality, or the nature of the mind or linguistic reference.  The response to the imagined scenario is supposed to tell us about the nature of that notion in any scenario, real or imagined.

For example, a thought experiment might present a situation in which an agent intentionally kills an innocent for the benefit of others.  Here, the relevant question is not whether the action is moral or not, but more broadly whether a moral theory is correct that says morality is determined solely by an action's consequences (See [[Consequentialism]]).  [[John Searle]] imagines a man in a locked room who receives written sentences in Chinese, and returns written sentences in Chinese, according to a sophisticated instruction manual.  Here, the relevant question is not whether or not the man understands Chinese, but more broadly, whether a [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalist theory of mind]] is correct.

It is generally hoped that there is universal agreement about the intuitions that a thought experiment elicits.  (Hence, in assessing their own thought experiments, philosophers may appeal to "what we should say," or some such locution.)  A successful thought experiment will be one in which intuitions about it are widely shared.  But often, philosophers differ in their intuitions about the scenario.

Other philosophical uses of imagined scenarios arguably are thought experiments also.  In one use of scenarios, philosophers might imagine persons in a particular situation (maybe ourselves), and ask what they would do.

For example, in the [[veil of ignorance]], [[John Rawls]] asks us to imagine a group of persons in a situation where they know nothing about themselves, and are charged with devising a social or political organization. The use of the [[state of nature]] to imagine the origins of government, as by [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]], may also be considered a thought experiment. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] explored the possible ethical and religious implications of [[Abraham]]'s [[binding of Isaac]] in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' Similarly, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', speculated about the historical development of Judeo-Christian morality, with the intent of questioning its legitimacy.

An early written thought experiment was [[Plato]]'s [[allegory of the cave]].&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Rep.'' vii, I–III, 514–518B.&lt;/ref&gt; Another historic thought experiment was [[Avicenna]]'s "[[Avicennism#Thought experiments on self-consciousness|Floating Man]]" thought experiment in the 11th century. He asked his readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]] in order to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and [[self-consciousness]], and the [[Substance theory|substantiality]] of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 315, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-13159-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility===
In many thought experiments, the scenario would be [[nomological possibility|nomologically possible]], or possible according to the laws of nature.  John Searle's [[Chinese room]] is nomologically possible.

Some thought experiments present scenarios that are not [[Subjunctive possibility|nomologically]] possible.  In his [[Twin Earth thought experiment]], [[Hilary Putnam]] asks us to imagine a scenario in which there is a substance with all of the observable properties of water (e.g., taste, color, boiling point), but is chemically different from water.  It has been argued that this thought experiment is not nomologically possible, although it may be possible in some other sense, such as [[metaphysical possibility]].  It is debatable whether the nomological impossibility of a thought experiment renders intuitions about it moot.

In some cases, the hypothetical scenario might be considered metaphysically impossible, or impossible in any sense at all.  [[David Chalmers]] says that we can imagine that there are [[philosophical zombie|zombies]], or persons who are physically identical to us in every way but who lack consciousness.  This is supposed to show that [[physicalism]] is false.  However, some argue that zombies are inconceivable:  we can no more imagine a zombie than we can imagine that 1+1=3. Others have claimed that the conceivability of a scenario may not entail its possibility.

===Interactive thought experiments in digital environments===
{{External links|section|date=May 2018}}
The philosophical work of [[Stefano Gualeni]] focuses on the use of virtual worlds to materialize thought experiments and to playfully negotiate philosophical ideas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools: How to Philosophize with a Digital Hammer|last=Gualeni|first=Stefano|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2015|isbn=978-1-137-52178-1|location=Basingstoke (UK)|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His arguments were originally presented in his 2015 book [http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137521774 ''Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools''.]

Gualeni's argument is that the history of philosophy has, until recently, merely been the history of written thought, and digital media can complement and enrich the limited and almost exclusively linguistic approach to philosophical thought.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gualeni|first=Stefano|date=2016|title=Self-reflexive videogames: observations and corollaries on virtual worlds as philosophical artifacts|url=http://www.gamejournal.it/gualeni-self-reflexive-videogames/|journal=G A M E, The Italian Journal of Game Studies|volume=1, 5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He considers virtual worlds to be philosophically viable and advantageous in contexts like those of thought experiments, when the recipients of a certain philosophical notion or perspective are expected to objectively test and evaluate different possible courses of action, or in cases where they are confronted with interrogatives concerning non-actual or non-human phenomenologies &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Among the most visible thought experiments designed by [[Stefano Gualeni]]:

* [[Braitenberg vehicle]]s (robotics, neural control and sensing systems) (some have been built)
* [[Doomsday argument]] ([[anthropic principle]])
* [[The Lady, or the Tiger?]] (human nature)&lt;ref&gt;While the problem presented in this short story's scenario is not unique, it is extremely unusual. Most thought experiments are intentionally (or, even, sometimes unintentionally) skewed towards the inevitable production of a particular solution to the problem posed; and this happens because of the way that the problem and the scenario are framed in the first place. In the case of ''The Lady, or the Tiger?'', the way that the story unfolds is so "end-neutral" that, at the finish, there is no "correct" solution to the problem. Therefore, all that one can do is to offer one's own innermost thoughts on how the account of human nature that has been presented might unfold ? according to one's own experience of human nature ? which is, obviously, the purpose of the entire exercise. The extent to which the story can provoke such an extremely wide range of (otherwise [[equipollent]]) predictions of the participants' subsequent behaviour is one of the reasons the story has been so popular over time.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5086">A '''variational principle''' is a scientific principle used within the [[calculus of variations]], which develops general methods for finding functions which extremize the value of quantities that depend upon those functions. For example, to answer this question: "What is the [[Catenary|shape of a chain]] suspended at both ends?" we can use the variational principle that the shape must minimize the gravitational potential energy.

==Overview==
Any physical law which can be expressed as a variational principle describes a [[self-adjoint operator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Cornelius |last=Lanczos |author-link=Cornelius Lanczos |orig-year=1st published 1970, [[University of Toronto Press]] |title=The Variational Principles of Mechanics |publisher=Dover |date=1974 |ISBN=0-8020-1743-6 |edition=4th, paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expressions are also called [[Hermitian]]. Such an expression describes an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under a Hermitian transformation.

==History==
{{main|History of variational principles in physics}}
[[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]] attempted to identify such invariants under a group of transformations. In what is referred to in physics as [[Noether's theorem]], the [[Poincaré group]] of transformations (what is now called a [[gauge group]]) for [[general relativity]] defines symmetries under a group of transformations which depend on a variational principle, or [[Action (physics)|action principle]].

The '''vicious circle principle''' is a principle that was endorsed by many [[impredicativity|predicativist]] mathematicians in the early 20th century to prevent contradictions.  The principle states that no object or property may be introduced by a definition that depends on that object or property itself.  In addition to ruling out definitions that are explicitly circular (like "an object has property P [[iff]] it is not next to anything that has property P"), this principle rules out definitions that quantify over domains which include the entity being defined.  Thus, it blocks [[Russell's paradox]], which defines a set S that contains all sets that don't contain themselves.  This definition is blocked because it defines a new set in terms of the totality of all sets, of which this new set would itself be a member.

However, it also blocks one standard definition of the [[natural numbers]].  First, we define a property as being "[[hereditary]]" if, whenever a number ''n'' has the property, so does ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.  Then we say that ''x'' has the property of being a natural number [[iff|if and ''only'' if]] it has every hereditary property that 0 has.  This definition is blocked, because it defines "natural number" in terms of the totality of all hereditary properties, but "natural number" itself would be such a hereditary property, so the definition is circular in this sense.

Most modern mathematicians and philosophers of mathematics think that this particular definition is not circular in any problematic sense, and thus they reject the vicious circle principle.  But it was endorsed by many early 20th century researchers including [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Henri Poincaré]].  On the other hand, [[Frank P. Ramsey]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]] accepted the ban on explicit circularity, but argued against the ban on circular quantification.  After all, the definition "let T be the tallest man in the room" defines T by means of quantification over a domain (men in the room) of which T is a member.  But this is not problematic, they suggest, because the definition doesn't actually create the person, but merely shows how to pick him out of the totality.  Similarly, they suggest, definitions don't actually create sets or properties or objects, but rather just give one way of picking out the already existing entity from the collection of which it is a part.  Thus, this sort of circularity in terms of quantification can't cause any problems.

This principle was the reason for Russell's development of the [[System of types#The 1908 .22ramified.22 theory of types|ramified theory of types]] rather than the [[History of type theory#Theory of simple types|theory of simple types]].  (See "Ramified Hierarchy and Impredicative Principles".&lt;ref name="SEP001"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An analysis of the paradoxes to be avoided shows that they all result from a kind of vicious circle. The vicious circles in question arise from supposing that a collection of objects may contain members which can only be defined by means of the collection as a whole. Thus, for example, the collection of propositions will be supposed to contain a proposition stating that “all propositions are either true or false.” It would seem, however, that such a statement could not be legitimate unless “all propositions” referred to some already definite collection, which it cannot do if new propositions are created by statements about “all propositions.” We shall, therefore, have to say that statements about “all propositions” are meaningless.… The principle which enables us to avoid illegitimate totalities may be stated as follows: “Whatever involves all of a collection must not be one of the collection”; or, conversely: “If, provided a certain collection had a total, it would have members only definable in terms of that total, then the said collection has no total.” We shall call this the “vicious-circle principle,” because it enables us to avoid the vicious circles involved in the assumption of illegitimate totalities. (Whitehead and Russell 1910, 37) (quoted in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] entry on [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/ Russell's Paradox])
