'''A Mathematical Programming Language''' ('''AMPL''') is an [[algebraic modeling language]] to describe and solve high-complexity problems for large-scale mathematical computing (i.e., large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems).&lt;ref name="ampl-book"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
It was developed by [[Robert Fourer]], David Gay, and [[Brian Kernighan]] at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]].
AMPL supports dozens of [[solver]]s, both [[Open-source software|open source]] and [[commercial software]], including CBC, [[CPLEX]], [[FortMP]], [[Gurobi]], [[MINOS (optimization software)|MINOS]], [[IPOPT]], [[SNOPT]], [[KNITRO]], and LGO. Problems are passed to solvers as [[nl (format)|nl]] files.
AMPL is used by more than 100 corporate clients, and by government agencies and academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

One advantage of AMPL is the similarity of its syntax to the mathematical notation of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. This allows for a very concise and readable definition of problems in the domain of [[mathematical programming|optimization]]. Many modern solvers available on the [[NEOS Server]] (formerly hosted at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], currently hosted at the [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]]&lt;ref name="neos-uwm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neos-guide.org/About/|title=About|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) accept AMPL input. According to the NEOS statistics AMPL is the most popular format for representing mathematical programming problems.

==Features==
AMPL features a mix of [[declarative programming|declarative]] and [[imperative programming|imperative]] programming styles. Formulating optimization models occurs via declarative language elements such as sets, scalar and multidimensional parameters, decision variables, objectives and constraints, which allow for concise description of most problems in the domain of mathematical optimization.

Procedures and [[control flow]] statements are available in AMPL for
* the exchange of data with external data sources such as [[spreadsheet]]s, [[database]]s, [[XML]] and text files
* data pre- and post-processing tasks around optimization models
* the construction of hybrid algorithms for problem types for which no direct efficient solvers are available.

To support re-use and simplify construction of large-scale optimization problems, AMPL allows separation of model and data.

AMPL supports a wide range of problem types, among them:
* [[Linear programming]]
* [[Quadratic programming]]
* [[Nonlinear programming]]
* [[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|Mixed-integer programming]]
* Mixed-integer quadratic programming with or without [[Convex function|convex]] quadratic constraints
* Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
* [[Second-order cone programming]]
* [[Global optimization]]
* [[Semidefinite programming]] problems with [[Bilinear form|bilinear]] matrix inequalities
* [[Complementarity theory]] problems (MPECs) in discrete or continuous variables
* [[Constraint programming]]&lt;ref name="cp-support"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

AMPL invokes a solver in a separate process which has these advantages:
* User can interrupt the solution process at any time
* Solver errors do not affect the interpreter
* 32-bit version of AMPL can be used with a 64-bit solver and vice versa
Interaction with the solver is done through a well-defined [[nl (format)|nl interface]].

==Availability==
[[File:Neos-stats-2011-01.png|right|thumb|352px|[[Argonne National Laboratory#User facilities|NEOS]] input statistics for January 2011.]]
AMPL is available for many popular 32- and 64-bit [[operating system]]s including [[Linux]], Mac [[OS X]], some [[Unix]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ampl.com/products/ampl/ AMPL page at AMPL Optimization Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Disappearing Number''''' is a 2007 play co-written and devised by the Théâtre de Complicité company and directed and conceived by English playwright [[Simon McBurney]]. It was inspired by the collaboration during the 1910s between two of the most remarkable pure mathematicians of the twentieth century, [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] from India, and the [[Cambridge University]] [[University don|don]] [[G.H. Hardy]].

It was a co-production between the UK-based theatre company [[Complicite]] and [[Theatre Royal, Plymouth]], and [[Ruhrfestspiele]], [[Wiener Festwochen]], and the [[Holland Festival]]. ''A Disappearing Number'' premiered in Plymouth in March 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/29033/complicite-transfer-a-disappearing-number-to|title=Complicite transfer A Disappearing Number to West End|last=Smith|first=Alistair|date=26 July 2010|work=[[The Stage]]|accessdate=9 August 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; toured internationally, and played at [[The Barbican Centre]] in Autumn 2007 and 2008&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2008/a-disappearing-number-review-at-barbican-theatre-london/&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Lincoln Center]] in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/theater/reviews/17disappear.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by [[Simon McBurney]] with music by [[Nitin Sawhney]].  The production is 110 minutes with no intermission.

The piece was co-devised and written by the cast and company. The cast in order of appearance: [[Firdous Bamji]], Saskia Reeves, David Annen, [[Paul Bhattacharjee]], Shane Shambu, Divya Kasturi and Chetna Pandya.

==Plot==
Ramanujan first attracted Hardy's attention by writing him a letter in which he proved that
:&lt;math&gt;1+2+3+\cdots = -\frac{1}{12}\ (\Re)&lt;/math&gt;

where the notation &lt;math&gt;(\Re)&lt;/math&gt; indicates a [[Ramanujan summation]].

Hardy realised that this confusing presentation of the series [[1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯]] was an application of the [[Riemann zeta function]] &lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;s=-1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus du Sautoy]], ''[[The Music of the Primes]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanujan's work became the foundation of [[string theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Polchinski | first = Joseph | authorlink = Joseph Polchinski | title = String Theory, Volume I: An Introduction to the Bosonic String | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1998 | pages = 22 | isbn = 978-0-521-63303-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play includes live ''[[tabla]]'' playing, which "morphs seductively into pure mathematics", as the ''[[Financial Times]]'' review put it, "especially when … its rhythms shade into chants of number sequences reminiscent of the libretto to [[Philip Glass]]'s ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]''. One can hear the beauty of the sequences without grasping the rules that govern them."

The play has two strands of narrative and presents strong visual and [[physical theatre]]. It interweaves the passionate intellectual relationship between Hardy and the more intuitive Ramanujan, with the present-day story of Ruth, an English maths lecturer, and her husband, a globe-trotting Indian-American businessman "to illuminate the beauty and the patterns — the mystery — of mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128513493 Jeff Lunden, "'A Disappearing Number': A Vivid Theatrical Equation"], ''NPR Morning Edition'', 15 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It also explores the nature and spirituality of infinity, and explores several aspects of the Indian [[diaspora]].

Ruth travels to India in Ramanujan's footsteps and eventually dies. Al follows, to get closer to her ghost. Meanwhile, 100 years previously, Ramanujan is travelling in the opposite direction, making the trip to England, where he works with Hardy on maths and contracts tuberculosis. [[Partition (number theory)|Partition]] (as a maths concept) is explored, and diverging and converging series in mathematics become a metaphor for the Indian [[diaspora]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7400">[[File:Rectangle example.svg|thumb|A simple example measure assigns to a subregion of the [[rectangle]] the fraction of the geometrical [[area]] it occupies. Then, the rectangle's [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] has measure 0, while its interior has  measure 1. Almost every point of the rectangle is an [[Interior (topology)#Interior point|interior point]], yet the interior has a nonempty [[complement (set theory)|complement]].]]
In [[measure theory]] (a branch of [[mathematical analysis]]), a property holds '''almost everywhere''' if, in a technical sense, the set for which the property holds takes up nearly all possibilities.  The notion of almost everywhere is a companion notion to the concept of [[measure zero]].  In the subject of [[probability]], which is largely based in measure theory, the notion is referred to as ''[[almost surely]]''.

More specifically, a property holds almost everywhere if the set of elements for which the property does not hold is a set of measure zero (Halmos 1974), or equivalently if the set of elements for which the property holds is [[conull set|conull]]. In cases where the measure is not [[Complete measure|complete]], it is sufficient that the set is contained within a set of measure zero. When discussing sets of [[real number]]s, the [[Lebesgue measure]] is assumed unless otherwise stated.

The term ''almost everywhere'' is abbreviated ''a.e.''; in older literature ''p.p.'' is used, to stand for the equivalent [[French language]] phrase ''presque partout''.

A set with '''full measure''' is one whose complement is of measure zero. In [[probability theory]], the terms ''[[almost surely]]'', ''almost certain'' and ''almost always'' refer to [[event (probability theory)|event]]s with [[probability]] 1, which are exactly the sets of full measure in a probability space.

Occasionally, instead of saying that a property holds almost everywhere, it is said that the property holds for '''almost all''' elements (though the term [[almost all]] also has other meanings).

== Definition ==

If &lt;math&gt;(X,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[measure space]], a property &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is said to hold almost everywhere in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a set &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mu(N) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and for &lt;math&gt;x\in X\setminus N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has property &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Another common way of expressing the same thing is to say that "almost every point satisfies &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;" or "for almost every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; holds".

It is ''not'' required that the set &lt;math&gt;\{x\in X: \neg P(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; has measure 0; it may not belong to &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties ==

* If property ''P'' holds almost everywhere and implies property ''Q'', then property ''Q'' holds almost everywhere. This follows from the [[Measure (mathematics)#Monotonicity|monotonicity]] of measures.
* If &lt;math&gt; (P_n) &lt;/math&gt; is a finite or countable sequence of properties, each of which holds almost everywhere, then their conjunction &lt;math&gt; \forall n P_n &lt;/math&gt; holds almost everywhere. This follows from the [[Measure (mathematics)#Measures of infinite unions of measurable sets|countable subadditivity]] of measures.
* By contrast, if  &lt;math&gt; (P_x)_{x\in \mathbf R} &lt;/math&gt; is an uncountable family of properties, each of which holds almost everywhere, then their conjunction &lt;math&gt; \forall x P_x &lt;/math&gt; does not necessarily hold almost everywhere. For example, if &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is Lebesgue measure on &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbf R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P_x &lt;/math&gt; is the property of not being equal to &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt; P_x(y) &lt;/math&gt; is true if and only if &lt;math&gt; y \neq x&lt;/math&gt;), then each &lt;math&gt; P_x &lt;/math&gt; holds almost everywhere, but the conjunction &lt;math&gt; \forall x P_x &lt;/math&gt; does not hold anywhere.

As a consequence of the first two properties, it is often possible to reason about "almost every point" of a measure space as though it were an ordinary point rather than an abstraction. This is often done implicitly in informal mathematical arguments. However, one must be careful with this mode of reasoning because of the third bullet above: universal quantification over uncountable families of statements is valid for ordinary points but not for "almost every point".

== Examples ==
{{unordered list
| If ''f'' : '''R''' → '''R''' is a [[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue integrable]] function and ''f''(''x'') ≥ 0 almost everywhere, then
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) \, dx \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;}}
for all real numbers ''a'' &lt; ''b'' with equality [[iff]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere.
| If ''f'' : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R''' is a [[monotonic function]], then ''f'' is [[derivative|differentiable]] almost everywhere.
| If ''f'' : '''R''' → '''R''' is Lebesgue measurable and
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b |f(x)| \, dx &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;}}
for all real numbers ''a'' &lt; ''b'', then there exists a set ''E'' (depending on ''f'') such that, if ''x'' is in ''E'', the Lebesgue mean
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2\epsilon} \int_{x-\epsilon}^{x+\epsilon} f(t)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;}}
converges to ''f''(''x'') as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; decreases to zero. The set ''E'' is called the Lebesgue set of ''f''.  Its complement can be proved to have measure zero.  In other words, the Lebesgue mean of ''f'' converges to ''f'' almost everywhere.
| A bounded [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is [[Riemann integral|Riemann integrable]] if and only if it is [[continuous function|continuous]] almost everywhere.
| As a curiosity, the decimal expansion of almost every real number in the interval [0, 1] contains the complete text of [[Shakespeare's plays]], encoded in [[ASCII]]; similarly for every other finite digit sequence, see [[Normal number]].}}

== Definition using ultrafilters ==

Outside of the context of real analysis, the notion of a property true almost everywhere is sometimes defined in terms of an [[ultrafilter]]. An ultrafilter on a set ''X'' is a maximal collection ''F'' of subsets of ''X'' such that:
# If ''U'' ∈ ''F'' and ''U'' ⊆ ''V'' then ''V'' ∈ ''F''
# The intersection of any two sets in ''F'' is in ''F''
# The empty set is not in ''F''
A property ''P'' of points in ''X'' holds almost everywhere, relative to an ultrafilter ''F'', if the set of points for which ''P'' holds is in ''F''.

For example, one construction of the [[hyperreal number]] system defines a hyperreal number as an equivalence class of sequences that are equal almost everywhere as defined by an ultrafilter.

The definition of ''almost everywhere'' in terms of ultrafilters is closely related to the definition in terms of measures, because each ultrafilter defines a finitely-additive measure taking only the values 0 and 1, where a set has measure 1 if and only if it is included in the ultrafilter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27237">In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical computer science]], '''analysis of Boolean functions'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Donnell|first=Ryan|date=2014|title=Analysis of Boolean functions|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-03832-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the study of real-valued functions on &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; from a spectral perspective (such functions are sometimes known as [[pseudo-Boolean function]]s). The functions studied are often, but not always, Boolean-valued, making them [[Boolean function]]s. The area has found many applications in [[combinatorics]], [[social choice theory]], [[random graph]]s, and theoretical computer science, especially in [[hardness of approximation]], [[property testing]] and [[probably approximately correct learning|PAC learning]].

==Basic concepts==

We will mostly consider functions defined on the domain &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes it is more convenient to work with the domain &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; instead. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined on &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, then the corresponding function defined on &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;f_{01}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = f((-1)^{x_1},\ldots,(-1)^{x_n}).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for us a Boolean function is a &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt;-valued function, though often it is more convenient to consider &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;-valued functions instead.

===Fourier expansion===

Every real-valued function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; has a unique expansion as a multilinear polynomial:

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S(x), \quad \chi_S(x) = \prod_{i \in S} x_i. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[Hadamard transform]] of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[Fourier transform]] in the [[group (mathematics)|group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2^n&lt;/math&gt;. The coefficients &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(S)&lt;/math&gt; are known as ''Fourier coefficients'', and the entire sum is known as the ''Fourier expansion'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. The functions &lt;math&gt;\chi_S&lt;/math&gt; are known as ''Fourier characters'', and they form an orthonormal basis for the space of all functions over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to the inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle f,g \rangle = 2^{-n} \sum_{x \in \{-1,1\}^n} f(x) g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The Fourier coefficients can be calculated using an inner product:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{f}(S) = \langle f, \chi_S \rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

In particular, this shows that &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(\emptyset) = \mathbb{E}[f].&lt;/math&gt; Parseval's identity states that

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|^2 = \mathbb{E}[f^2] = \sum_S \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

If we skip &lt;math&gt;S = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, then we get the variance of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{V}[f] = \sum_{S \neq \emptyset} \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Fourier degree and Fourier levels ===

The ''degree'' of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(S) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for some set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the degree of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is its degree as a multilinear polynomial.

It is convenient to decompose the Fourier expansion into ''levels'': the Fourier coefficient &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(S)&lt;/math&gt; is on level &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;'' part of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; f^{=d} = \sum_{|S| = d} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S. &lt;/math&gt;

It is obtained from &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by zeroing out all Fourier coefficients not on level &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

We similarly define &lt;math&gt;f^{&gt;d},f^{&lt;d},f^{\geq d},f^{\leq d}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Influence===

The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th influence of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined in two equivalent ways:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \mathbb{E}\left[ \left(\frac{f - f^{\oplus i}}{2} \right)^2 \right] = \sum_{S \ni i} \hat{f}(S)^2, \\[5pt]
&amp; f^{\oplus i}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = f(x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},-x_i,x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Boolean then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}_i[f]&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that flipping the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th coordinate flips the value of the function:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \Pr[f(x) \neq f^{\oplus i}(x)]. &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; doesn't depend on the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th coordinate.

The ''total influence'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of all of its influences:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] = \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \sum_S |S| \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

The total influence of a Boolean function is also the ''average sensitivity'' of the function. The ''sensitivity'' of a Boolean function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at a given point is the number of coordinates &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; such that if we flip the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th coordinate, the value of the function changes. The average value of this quantity is exactly the total influence.

The total influence can also be defined using the [[Discrete Laplace operator#Graph Laplacians|discrete Laplacian]] of the [[Hamming graph]], suitably normalized:  &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] = \langle f,Lf \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

===Noise stability===

Given &lt;math&gt;-1 \leq \rho \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, we say that two random vectors &lt;math&gt;x,y \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; are ''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated'' if the marginal distributions of &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; are uniform, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[x_iy_i] = \rho&lt;/math&gt;. Concretely, we can generate a pair of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated random variables by first choosing &lt;math&gt;x,z \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random, and then choosing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; according to one of the following two equivalent rules, applied independently to each coordinate:

:&lt;math&gt; y_i = \begin{cases} x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \rho, \\ z_i &amp; \text{w.p. } 1-\rho. \end{cases} \quad \text{or} \quad y_i = \begin{cases} x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \frac{1+\rho}{2}, \\ -x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \frac{1-\rho}{2}. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

We denote this distribution by &lt;math&gt; y \sim N_\rho(x) &lt;/math&gt;.

The ''noise stability'' of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; can be defined in two equivalent ways:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[f] = \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{x; y \sim N_\rho(x)}[f(x) f(y)] = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \rho^{|S|} \hat{f}(S)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \delta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, the ''noise sensitivity'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{NS}_\delta[f] = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{Stab}_{1-2\delta}[f]. &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Boolean, then this is the probability that the value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; changes if we flip each coordinate with probability &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, independently.

===Noise operator===

The ''noise operator'' &lt;math&gt;T_\rho&lt;/math&gt; is an operator taking a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and returning another function &lt;math&gt;T_\rho f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt; (T_\rho f)(x) = \mathbb{E}_{y \sim N_\rho(x)}[f(y)] = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \rho^{|S|} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S. &lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;\rho &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the noise operator can also be defined using a [[continuous-time Markov chain]] in which each bit is flipped independently with rate 1. The operator &lt;math&gt;T_\rho&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to running this Markov chain for &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\log\frac{1}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; steps starting at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and taking the average value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at the final state. This Markov chain is generated by the Laplacian of the Hamming graph, and this relates total influence to the noise operator.

Noise stability can be defined in terms of the noise operator: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[f] = \langle f, T_\rho f \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

===Hypercontractivity===

For &lt;math&gt;1 \leq q &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Lp space#Lp spaces|&lt;math&gt;L_q&lt;/math&gt;-norm]] of a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|_q = \sqrt[q]{\mathbb{E}[|f|^q]}. &lt;/math&gt;

We also define &lt;math&gt;\|f\|_\infty = \max_{x \in \{-1,1\}^n} |f(x)|.&lt;/math&gt;

The hypercontractivity theorem states that for any &lt;math&gt;q &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q' = 1/(1-1/q)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \|T_\rho f\|_q \leq \|f\|_2 \quad \text{and} \quad \|T_\rho f\|_2 \leq \|f\|_{q'}. &lt;/math&gt;

Hypercontractivity is closely related to the [[logarithmic Sobolev inequalities]] of [[functional analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diaconis|first1=Persi|last2=Saloff-Coste|first2=Laurent|date=1996|title=Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for finite Markov chains|journal=Ann. Appl. Probab.|volume=6|number=3|pages=695–750|doi=10.1214/aoap/1034968224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar result for &lt;math&gt;q &lt; 2&lt;/math&gt; is known as ''reverse hypercontractivity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mossel|first1=Elchanan|last2=Oleszkiewicz|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Sen|first3=Arnab|date=2013|title=On reverse hypercontractivity|journal=GAFA|volume=23|number=3|pages=1062–1097|doi=10.1007/s00039-013-0229-4|arxiv=1108.1210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''p''-Biased analysis===

In many situations the input to the function is not uniformly distributed over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;, but instead has a bias toward &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. In these situations it is customary to consider functions over the domain &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; p &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, the ''p''-biased measure &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mu_p(x) = p^{\sum_i x_i} (1-p)^{\sum_i (1-x_i)}. &lt;/math&gt;

This measure can be generated by choosing each coordinate independently to be 1 with probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and 0 with probability &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt;.

The classical Fourier characters are no longer orthogonal with respect to this measure. Instead, we use the following characters:

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_S(x) = \left(\sqrt{\frac{p}{1-p}}\right)^{|\{i \in S : x_i = 0\}|} \left(-\sqrt{\frac{1-p}{p}}\right)^{|\{i \in S : x_i = 1\}|}. &lt;/math&gt;

The ''p''-biased Fourier expansion of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the expansion of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a linear combination of ''p''-biased characters:

:&lt;math&gt; f = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S) \omega_S. &lt;/math&gt;

We can extend the definitions of influence and the noise operator to the ''p''-biased setting by using their spectral definitions.

====Influence====

The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'s influence is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \sum_{S \ni i} \hat{f}(S)^2 = p(1-p) \mathbb{E}[(f-f^{\oplus i})^2]. &lt;/math&gt;

The total influence is the sum of the individual influences:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] = \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{Inf}_i[f].&lt;/math&gt;

====Noise operator====

A pair of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated random variables can be obtained by choosing &lt;math&gt;x,z \sim \mu_p&lt;/math&gt; independently and &lt;math&gt;y \sim N_\rho(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N_\rho&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; y_i = \begin{cases} x_i &amp; \text{w.p. } \rho, \\ z_i &amp; \text{w.p. } 1-\rho. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

The noise operator is then given by

:&lt;math&gt; (T_\rho f)(x) = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \rho^{|S|} \hat{f}(S) \omega_S(x) = \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{y \sim N_\rho(x)} [f(y)]. &lt;/math&gt;

Using this we can define the noise stability and the noise sensitivity, as before.

====Russo–Margulis formula====

The Russo–Margulis formula states that for monotone Boolean functions &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dp} \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{x \sim \mu_p} [f(x)] = \frac{\operatorname{Inf}[f]}{p(1-p)} = \sum_{i=1}^n \Pr[f \neq f^{\oplus i}]. &lt;/math&gt;

Both the influence and the probabilities are taken with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt;, and on the right-hand side we have the average sensitivity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. If we think of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a property, then the formula states that as &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; varies, the derivative of the probability that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; occurs at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; equals the average sensitivity at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

The Russo–Margulis formula is key for proving sharp threshold theorems such as [[#Friedgut's sharp threshold theorem|Friedgut's]].

===Gaussian space===

One of the deepest results in the area, the [[#Invariance principle|invariance principle]], connects the distribution of functions on the Boolean cube &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; to their distribution on ''Gaussian space'', which is the space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; endowed with the standard &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Gaussian measure]].

Many of the basic concepts of Fourier analysis on the Boolean cube have counterparts in Gaussian space:

* The counterpart of the Fourier expansion in Gaussian space is the Hermite expansion, which is an expansion to an infinite sum (converging in &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;) of multivariate [[Hermite polynomials]].
* The counterpart of total influence or average sensitivity for the indicator function of a set is Gaussian surface area, which is the Minkowski content of the boundary of the set.
* The counterpart of the noise operator is the [[Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process|Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator]] (related to the [[Mehler kernel|Mehler transform]]), given by &lt;math&gt;(U_\rho f)(x) = \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{z \sim N(0,1)}[f(\rho x + \sqrt{1-\rho^2}z)]&lt;/math&gt;, or alternatively by &lt;math&gt;(U_\rho f)(x) = \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}[f(y)]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; is a pair of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;-correlated standard Gaussians.
* Hypercontractivity holds (with appropriate parameters) in Gaussian space as well.

Gaussian space is more symmetric than the Boolean cube (for example, it is rotation invariant), and supports continuous arguments which may be harder to get through in the discrete setting of the Boolean cube. The invariance principle links the two settings, and allows deducing results on the Boolean cube from results on Gaussian space.

==Basic results==

===Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem===

If &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; has degree at most 1, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is either constant, equal to a coordinate, or equal to the negation of a coordinate. In particular, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a ''dictatorship'': a function depending on at most one coordinate.

The Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedgut |first1=Ehud |last2=Kalai |first2=Gil |last3=Naor |first3=Assaf |date=2002 |title=Boolean functions whose Fourier transform is concentrated on the first two levels |journal=Adv. Appl. Math. |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=427–437 |doi=10.1016/S0196-8858(02)00024-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the ''FKN theorem'', states that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; ''almost'' has degree 1 then it is ''close'' to a dictatorship. Quantitatively, if &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|f^{&gt;1}\|^2 &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;-close to a dictatorship, that is, &lt;math&gt;\|f - g\|^2 = O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; for some Boolean dictatorship &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\Pr[f \neq g] = O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; for some Boolean dictatorship &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, a Boolean function of degree at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; depends on at most &lt;math&gt;d2^{d-1}&lt;/math&gt; coordinates, making it a ''junta'' (a function depending on a constant number of coordinates). The Kindler–Safra theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kindler |first=Guy |date=2002 |title=Property testing, PCP, and juntas |chapter=16 |publisher=Tel Aviv University}}&lt;/ref&gt; generalizes the Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem to this setting. It states that if &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\|f^{&gt;d}\|^2 &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;-close to a Boolean function of degree at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

===Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem===

The Poincaré inequality for the Boolean cube (which follows from formulas appearing above) states that for a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V}[f] \leq \operatorname{Inf}[f] \leq \deg f \cdot \mathbb{V}[f]. &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that &lt;math&gt;\max_i \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] \geq \frac{\mathbb{V}[f]}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=The influence of variables on Boolean functions. |last1=Kahn |first1=Jeff |last2=Kalai |first2=Gil |last3=Linial |first3=Nati |date=1988 |publisher=IEEE |book-title=Proc. 29th Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science |pages=68–80 |location=White Plains |conference=SFCS'88 |doi=10.1109/SFCS.1988.2192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the ''KKL theorem'', states that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Boolean then &lt;math&gt;\max_i \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] = \Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The bound given by the Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem is tight, and is achieved by the ''Tribes'' function of Ben-Or and Linial:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Collective coin flipping, robust voting schemes and minima of Banzhaf values |last1=Ben-Or |first1=Michael |last2=Linial |first2=Nathan |date=1985 |publisher=IEEE |book-title=Proc. 26th Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science |pages=408–416 |location=Portland, Oregon |conference=SFCS'85 |doi=10.1109/SFCS.1985.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (x_{1,1} \land \cdots \land x_{1,w}) \lor \cdots \lor (x_{2^w,1} \land \cdots \land x_{2^w,w}). &lt;/math&gt;

The Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem was one of the first results in the area, and was the one introducing hypercontractivity into the context of Boolean functions.

===Friedgut's junta theorem===

If &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;-junta (a function depending on at most &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; coordinates) then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Inf}[f] \leq M&lt;/math&gt; according to the Poincaré inequality.

Friedgut's theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedgut |first=Ehud |date=1998 |title=Boolean functions with low average sensitivity depend on few coordinates |journal=Combinatorica |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=474–483 |doi=10.1007/PL00009809}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a converse to this result. It states that for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-close to a Boolean junta depending on &lt;math&gt;\exp (\operatorname{Inf}[f]/\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; coordinates.

Combined with the Russo–Margulis lemma, Friedgut's junta theorem implies that for every &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, every monotone function is close to a junta with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mu_q&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;q \approx p&lt;/math&gt;.

===Invariance principle===

The invariance principle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mossel |first1=Elchanan |last2=O'Donnell |first2=Ryan |last3=Oleszkiewicz |first3=Krzysztof |date=2010 |title=Noise stability of functions with low influences: Invariance and optimality |journal=Ann. Math. |volume=171 |issue=1 |pages=295–341 |doi=10.4007/annals.2010.171.295|arxiv=math/0503503 }}&lt;/ref&gt; generalizes the [[Berry–Esseen theorem]] to non-linear functions.

The Berry–Esseen theorem states (among else) that if &lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i x_i&lt;/math&gt; and no &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is too large compared to the rest, then the distribution of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is close to a normal distribution with the same mean and variance.

The invariance principle (in a special case) informally states that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a multilinear polynomial of bounded degree over &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; and all influences of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are small, then the distribution of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; under the uniform measure over &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is close to its distribution in Gaussian space.

More formally, let &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; be a univariate [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz function]], let &lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S) \chi_S&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;k=\deg f&lt;/math&gt;, and let
&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \max_i \sum_{S \ni i} \hat{f}(S)^2&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{S \neq \emptyset} \hat{f}(S)^2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt; \left| \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \{-1,1\}^n} [\psi(f(x))] - \mathbb{E}_{g \sim N(0,I)} [\psi(f(g))] \right| = O(k9^k \varepsilon). &lt;/math&gt;

By choosing appropriate &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, this implies that the distributions of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; under both measures are close in [[Cumulative distribution function|CDF distance]], which is given by &lt;math&gt;\sup_t |\Pr[f(x)&lt;t] - \Pr[f(g)&lt;t]|&lt;/math&gt;.

The invariance principle was the key ingredient in the original proof of the [[#Majority is Stablest|''Majority is Stablest'' theorem]].

==Some applications==

===Linearity testing===

A Boolean function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is ''linear'' if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;f(xy) = f(x)f(y)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;xy = (x_1y_1,\ldots,x_ny_n)&lt;/math&gt;. It is not hard to show that the Boolean linear functions are exactly the characters &lt;math&gt;\chi_S&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[property testing]] we want to test whether a given function is linear. It is natural to try the following test: choose &lt;math&gt;x,y \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random, and check that &lt;math&gt;f(xy) = f(x)f(y)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is linear then it always passes the test. Blum, Luby and Rubinfeld&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blum |first1=Manuel |last2=Luby |first2=Michael |last3=Rubinfeld |first3=Ronitt |date=1993 |title=Self-testing/correcting with applications to numerical problems |journal=J. Comput. Syst. Sci. |volume=47 |number=3 |pages=549–595 |doi=10.1016/0022-0000(93)90044-W}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that if the test passes with probability &lt;math&gt;1-\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;-close to a Fourier character. Their proof was combinatorial.

Bellare et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Bellare |first1=Mihir |last2=Coppersmith |first2=Don |last3=Håstad |first3=Johan |last4=Kiwi |first4=Marcos |last5=Sudan |first5=Madhu |date=1995 |title= Linearity testing in characteristic two |booktitle = Proc. 36th Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science |conference=FOCS'95}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an extremely simple Fourier-analytic proof, that also shows that if the test succeeds with probability &lt;math&gt;1/2 + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is correlated with a Fourier character. Their proof relies on the following formula for the success probability of the test:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{S \subseteq [n]} \hat{f}(S)^3. &lt;/math&gt;

===Arrow's theorem===

[[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that for three and more candidates, the only unanimous voting rule for which there is always a [[Condorcet criterion|Condorcet winner]] is a dictatorship.

The usual proof of Arrow's theorem is combinatorial. Kalai&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kalai |first=Gil |date=2002 |title=A Fourier-theoretic perspective on the Condorcet paradox and Arrow's theorem |journal=Adv. Appl. Math. |volume=29 |number=3 |pages=412–426 |doi=10.1016/S0196-8858(02)00023-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an alternative proof of this result in the case of three candidates using Fourier analysis. If &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is the rule that assigns a winner among two candidates given their relative orders in the votes, then the probability that there is a Condorcet winner given a uniformly random vote is &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{4} \operatorname{Stab}_{-1/3}[f]&lt;/math&gt;, from which the theorem easily follows.

The [[#Friedgut–Kalai–Naor theorem|FKN theorem]] implies that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a rule for which there is almost always a Condorcet winner, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is close to a dictatorship.

===Sharp thresholds===

A classical result in the theory of [[random graph]]s states that the probability that a &lt;math&gt;G(n,p)&lt;/math&gt; random graph is connected tends to &lt;math&gt;e^{-e^{-c}}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;p \sim \frac{\log n + c}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. This is an example of a ''sharp threshold'': the width of the "threshold window", which is &lt;math&gt;O(1/n)&lt;/math&gt;, is asymptotically smaller than the threshold itself, which is roughly &lt;math&gt;\frac{\log n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, the probability that a &lt;math&gt;G(n,p)&lt;/math&gt; graph contains a triangle tends to &lt;math&gt;e^{-c^3/6}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;p \sim \frac{c}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Here both the threshold window and the threshold itself are &lt;math&gt;\Theta(1/n)&lt;/math&gt;, and so this is a ''coarse threshold''.

Friedgut's sharp threshold theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedgut |first=Ehud |date=1999 |title=Sharp thresholds of graph properties and the k-SAT problem |journal=J. Am. Math. Soc. |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=1017–1054 |doi=10.1090/S0894-0347-99-00305-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; states, roughly speaking, that a monotone graph property (a graph property is a property which doesn't depend on the names of the vertices) has a sharp threshold unless it is correlated with the appearance of small subgraphs. This theorem has been widely applied to analyze random graphs and [[percolation]].

On a related note, the [[#Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem|KKL theorem]] implies that the width of threshold window is always at most &lt;math&gt;O(1/\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedgut |first1=Ehud |last2=Kalai |first2=Gil |date=1996 |title=Every monotone graph property has a sharp threshold |journal= Proc. Am. Math. Soc. |volume=124 |issue=10 |pages=2993–3002 |doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-96-03732-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majority is Stablest===

Let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Maj}_n\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; denote the majority function on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; coordinates. Sheppard's formula gives the asymptotic noise stability of majority:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[\operatorname{Maj}_n] \longrightarrow 1 - \frac{2}{\pi} \arccos \rho. &lt;/math&gt;

This is related to the probability that if we choose &lt;math&gt;x \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; uniformly at random and form &lt;math&gt;y \in \{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; by flipping each bit of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac{1-\rho}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, then the majority stays the same:
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Stab}_\rho[\operatorname{Maj}_n] = 2\Pr[\operatorname{Maj}_n(x) = \operatorname{Maj}_n(y)]-1&lt;/math&gt;.

There are Boolean functions with larger noise stability. For example, a dictatorship &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; has noise stability &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

The Majority is Stablest theorem states, informally, then the only functions having noise stability larger than majority have influential coordinates. Formally, for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;\tau &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt; has expectation zero and &lt;math&gt;\max_i \operatorname{Inf}_i[f] \leq \tau&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Stab}_\rho[f] \leq 1 - \frac{2}{\pi} \arccos \rho + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

The first proof of this theorem used the [[#Invariance principle|invariance principle]] in conjunction with an isoperimetric theorem of Borell in Gaussian space; since then more direct proofs were devised.

Majority is Stablest implies that the [[Semidefinite programming#Example 3 .28Goemans-Williamson MAX CUT approximation algorithm.29|Goemans–Williamson approximation algorithm]] for [[Maximum cut|MAX-CUT]] is optimal, assuming the [[unique games conjecture]].

'''''Arcadia''''' is a 1993 play by [[Tom Stoppard]] concerning the relationship between past and present, order and disorder, certainty and uncertainty. It has been praised by many critics as the finest play from one of the most significant contemporary playwrights in the English language.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=1}}  In 2006, the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]] named it one of the [[Best science book ever|best science-related works]] ever written.&lt;ref&gt;Randerson, James (2006) "[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/oct/21/uk.books Levi's memoir beats Darwin to win science book title]," ''The Guardian'', 20 October 2006, accessed 30 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Arcadia'' is set in Sidley Park, an [[English country house]] in [[Derbyshire]], and takes place in both 1809/1812 and the present day (1993 in the original production). The activities of two modern scholars and the house's current residents are juxtaposed with those of the people who lived there in the earlier period.

In 1809, Thomasina Coverly, the daughter of the house, is a precocious teenager with ideas about mathematics, nature and physics well ahead of her time. She studies with her [[tutor]] Septimus Hodge, a friend of [[Lord Byron]] (an unseen guest in the house). In the present, writer Hannah Jarvis and literature professor Bernard Nightingale converge on the house: she is investigating a [[Garden hermit|hermit who once lived on the grounds]]; he is researching a mysterious chapter in the life of Byron. As their studies unfold – with the help of Valentine Coverly, a post-graduate student in [[mathematical biology]] – the truth about what happened in Thomasina's time is gradually revealed.

The play's set features a large table, used by the characters in both past and present. Props are not removed when the play switches time period; books, [[coffee mug]]s, [[quill pen]]s, portfolios, and laptop computers appear together, blurring past and present.  An ancient but still living [[tortoise]] also appears in every scene, symbolising long-suffering endurance and the continuity of existence.

===Scene 1 (Act 1)===
The play opens on 10 April 1809, in a garden-front room of the house. Septimus Hodge is trying to distract 13-year-old Thomasina from her curiosity about "[[carnal desire|carnal embrace]]" by challenging her to prove [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]; he also wants to focus on reading the poem "The Couch of Eros" by Ezra Chater, a guest at the house. Thomasina starts asking why jam mixed in [[rice pudding]] can never be unstirred, which leads her on to the topic of [[determinism]] and to a beginning theory about chaotic shapes in nature. This is interrupted by Chater himself, who is angry that his wife was caught in the aforementioned "carnal embrace" with Septimus; he has come to demand a [[duel]]. Septimus tries to defuse the situation by heaping praise on "The Couch of Eros". The tactic works, because Chater does not know it was Septimus who savaged an earlier work of his, "The Maid of Turkey". Then [[landscape architect]] Richard Noakes enters, shortly accompanied by Captain Brice and Lady Croom; the three discuss proposed modifications to the gardens, while Thomasina sketches an imaginary hermit on Noakes's technical drawing of the garden.

===Scene 2===
The setting shifts to the present day. Hannah Jarvis is researching the house, the garden, and specifically the hermit, for a study of hermits and the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] imagination. Bernard Nightingale enters with Chloe Coverly; she conceals his identity from Hannah, as he had given Hannah's last book a poor review. Chloe's brother, Valentine, is gathering data on the [[population biology]] of the [[grouse]] in the surrounding grounds, using the house's "game books". When Chloe accidentally reveals Bernard's identity, Hannah reacts angrily; but she agrees to share her research material, which enables him to propose the theory that one of the 1809 inhabitants, Ezra Chater, was killed in a duel by Lord Byron. Bernard notes that records of Chater the poet disappeared after 1809, and the only other Chater of record is a [[botanist]].

===Scene 3===
The third scene returns to the earlier time frame; Septimus is again tutoring Thomasina, this time in translating [[Latin]]. Again their focus diverts, this time to [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria|the destruction of the Alexandrian Library]], which upsets Thomasina.  She mourns the loss of the knowledge stored there, and Septimus responds that all that was lost will eventually turn up again. They are again interrupted by Chater, who succeeds in challenging Septimus to the duel, having learned (from Lord Byron off-stage) that Septimus wrote the damning review.

===Scene 4===
Hannah rediscovers Thomasina's [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] containing her ideas on [[iteration]] and [[chaos theory]]; this recalls Septimus' assertion that what was lost is eventually rediscovered. Valentine reacts with interest to the notes, as his own research centres on similar concepts.

===Scene 5 (Act 2)===
Still in the present, Bernard gives Hannah, Valentine, and Chloe a preview of his lecture theorising that Lord Byron shot and killed Chater in a duel. When Hannah and Valentine challenge his logic, Bernard launches into a diatribe about the irrelevance of science, then departs for his lecture (and a promotional media appearance) in London. Hannah begins to suspect that the hermit of Sidley Park – who was reportedly obsessed with algebraic computations about the [[heat death of the universe]], the theory suggested in Thomasina's diagram – could have been Septimus.

===Scene 6===
Returning to 1809, we learn that the duel never occurred. Instead, the Chaters left for the [[West Indies]] with Captain Brice, Mr. Chater serving as the expedition's botanist and Mrs. Chater as the captain's secret [[paramour]]. Lord Byron has also left the country. Septimus has gone [[rabbiting|rabbit hunting]] for Thomasina, who favours [[rabbit pie]]; he returns to find Lady Croom searching for him. She has found two letters Septimus wrote in case he should die in the duel: one to Thomasina, is about rice pudding, and the other is a love letter addressed to herself. Lady Croom invites Septimus to an amorous rendezvous.

===Scene 7===
The final scene takes place in both 1812 and the present, the actions running concurrently. Some present-day characters are in [[fancy dress]] for a party, so that both casts appear similarly attired. Chloe reads a newspaper report on the Byron murder theory and then talks about determinism with Valentine, echoing the discussion between Septimus and Thomasina. Chloe, however, believes that sex is the force disrupting the universe's ordered plan. Valentine, using his computer to extrapolate Thomasina's ideas, relates them to the concept of [[entropy]]; he wonders whether Thomasina or Septimus was the genius behind the theories. Hannah and Valentine mention that Thomasina died in a fire on the eve of her seventeenth birthday.

Meanwhile, Thomasina asks Septimus to teach her to dance, for her forthcoming birthday party. Lady Croom enters, complaining to Noakes about the noise of his [[steam engine]]; Thomasina notes that the machine obeys the laws of entropy (which have not yet been [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalized]]), which describe the [[universe]] as winding down. In the present, Bernard arrives and is met by Hannah, who has found a letter detailing the facts of Chater's death – this discovery totally discredits his theory and vindicates Lord Byron's reputation. While Septimus awaits appropriate music for Thomasina's dance lesson, he examines the sketch she made to illustrate the [[Irreversible process|irreversibility of heat]]; his action mirrors that of Hannah and Valentine, who also pondered the same diagram. Bernard is caught in a compromising position with Chloe, and is asked to depart.

Eventually a [[waltz]] starts, and Septimus dances with Thomasina, their relationship increasingly complicated by hints of romance. Gus (Valentine and Chloe's younger brother, who has been silent for the entire play) hands another of Thomasina's drawings to a surprised Hannah. It depicts Septimus and the tortoise, confirming her suspicion that the hermit, who had a tortoise called Plautus, was actually Septimus. After Thomasina's tragic death, he apparently became a hermit; accepting her challenge to the laws of the universe as propounded by [[Sir Isaac Newton|Newton]], he worked for the rest of his life to apply "honest English algebra" to the question of the universe's future.

* Septimus Hodge: Thomasina's tutor, and the academic colleague and friend of Lord Byron (an unseen but important character). While teaching Thomasina, he works on his own research and has affairs with the older women of the house. When Thomasina is older, he falls in love with her; after her death, he becomes the "hermit of Sidley Park", working on her theories until his own death.
* Jellaby: The Crooms' butler. His chief functions are to spread gossip and to deliver letters.
* Ezra Chater: An unsuccessful [[poetaster]] staying at Sidley Park. His wife's romantic affairs lead him to challenge Septimus to a duel. Later, it is revealed that he is the amateur botanist "Mr. Chater," who dies of a monkey bite in [[Martinique]], where he has travelled with his wife and Captain Brice.
* Charity Chater: Ezra Chater's wife. Though she, like Byron, never appears onstage, she plays a vital role. She sleeps with Septimus, and her repeatedly cuckolded husband challenges him to a duel. She sleeps with Lord Byron and gets him, her husband, Captain Brice, and herself kicked out of Sidley Park.
* Richard Noakes: Lady Croom's gardener. Throughout the play, he is working to transform Sidley Park's classical, Arcadia-like landscape into the popular Gothic style – which Lady Croom begrudgingly accepts. He is key in exposing Septimus' and Mrs. Chater's affair.
* Lady Croom: Thomasina's mother.  She rules the Coverly estate with an iron fist, but flirts with Septimus and other gentlemen throughout the play. A second Lady Croom, the mother of Valentine, Chloe and Gus in the modern half of the play, never appears on stage.
* Captain Brice: The brother of Lady Croom (of 1809). He is a sea captain who falls in love with Mrs. Chater. He takes her and her husband to the West Indies at the end of the play. After Mr. Chater's death, Captain Brice marries Mrs. Chater.
* Augustus Coverly: Thomasina's trouble-making younger brother.  He appears in only a few brief scenes. (Gus and Augustus are played by the same actor.)

===Characters of the present===
* Hannah Jarvis: The author of a best-seller on Byron's mistress Lady Caroline Lamb. Hannah is researching the elusive [[hermit]] of Sidley Park, who lived there in the early 19th century. Hannah collaborates (warily) with Bernard and also with Valentine, though she rejects the romantic advances of both.
* Chloe Coverly: The 18-year-old daughter of the modern Lady Croom. While her mind is not as rigorous as Thomasina's, Chloe likes to propose wild ideas. She argues that the Newtonian universe has been destabilized by sex and the problems it causes. She tries to set up Hannah with Bernard, but ends up sleeping with him herself.
* Bernard Nightingale: A don at a modern university in Sussex, England. Bernard comes to Sidley Park hoping to work with Hannah on his theory about Lord Byron staying at the estate. Foolishly, instead of seeking further evidence, he announces on TV his theory that Lord Byron killed Ezra Chater in a duel. At the end of the play, Hannah proves him wrong, much to his chagrin.
* Valentine Coverly: Chloe's older brother. A graduate student of mathematics, he pores over several old documents and comes to acknowledge Thomasina's genius.
* Gus Coverly: Valentine and Chloe's younger brother, who has been mute since the age of five. Gus helps to pass several important props from past to present, and helps connect key moments in the play. (Gus and Augustus are played by the same actor.)

==Genre==
''Arcadia'' is, on the surface, somewhere between a [[tragedy]] and a comedy. It involves some elements of classical tragedy — "[[Integrity|noble]]" characters and the audience's foreknowledge of Thomasina's death — but the predominant element is comedy, in the way that the characters interact with each other and in their witty, [[epigram]]matic dialogue.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=45}}

==Themes==
''Arcadia'' explores the nature of evidence and truth in the context of modern ideas about history, mathematics and [[physics]]. It shows how clues left by the past are interpreted in the present, by both laypeople and scholars. Stoppard has said that his initial inspiration came from reading [[James Gleick]]'s 1987 bestseller, ''[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]'', "which is about this new kind of mathematics. That sounds fairly daunting if one's talking about a play. I thought, here is a marvellous metaphor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Delaney |first=Paul |date=1994 |title=Tom Stoppard in Conversation |url= |location= |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=224 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Broderson|first1=Elizabeth|title=Chaos in Arcadia|url=http://www.act-sf.org/content/dam/act/education_department/words_on_plays/Arcadia%20Words%20on%20Plays%20(2013).pdf|website=American Conservatory Theater|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides chaos, the play attends to a wide array of subjects, including [[thermodynamics]], computer [[algorithms]], [[fractals]], [[population dynamics]], [[determinism]] (especially in the context of love and death), [[classics]], [[landscape design]], [[Romanticism]] vs. [[Classicism]], [[English literature]] (particularly poetry), [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], 18th century [[periodical]]s, modern [[academia]], and even South Pacific [[botany]]. These are all concrete topics of conversation; their more abstract resonances rise into [[epistemology]], [[nihilism]], and the origins of [[lust]] and [[Insanity|madness]].

''Arcadia'''s themes are presented in a series of dichotomies. Most prominent is chaos versus order. The play's characters and action embody this, moving from a settled social order, in which relationships arise, toward the final scene, where the social order – and even the separation of the two eras – dissolve in the party's chaos, relationships collapse, and the characters die or disperse. Yet within that chaos, order can still be found. As Valentine declares: "In an ocean of ashes, islands of order. Patterns making themselves out of nothing." Although the play's world grows increasingly chaotic – with overlapping time periods, increasingly complex ideas, and ever greater variations in social norms and assumptions — connections and order can still be discerned. The characters attempt to find and articulate the order they perceive in their world, even as it is continually overturned.

The center-stage table that collects props from both time periods throughout the play is a vivid metaphor of the chaos/order dichotomy. As Paul Edwards, professor of English and History of Art at [[Bath Spa University]], explains: "At the end of the play, the table has accumulated a variety of objects that, if one saw them without having seen the play, would seem completely random and disordered. Entropy is high. But if one has seen the play, one has full information about the objects and the hidden 'order' of their arrangement, brought about by the performance itself. Entropy is low; this can be proved by reflecting that tomorrow night's performance of the play will finish with the table in a virtually identical 'disorder' — which therefore cannot really be disorder at all."&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt;

A closely related theme in ''Arcadia'' is the opposition of [[Classicism]] and [[Romanticism]]. This appears most clearly in the running argument between Noakes and Lady Croom about proposed changes to the garden. They all involve moving from the tidy order of Classic style to the rugged naturalism and Gothic mystery of the Romantic. A parallel dichotomy is expressed by Septimus and Thomasina: He instructs her in the Newtonian vision of the universe, while she keeps posing questions and proposing theories that undercut it.  Hannah's search for the hermit of Sidley Park also touches on this theme. "The whole Romantic sham!" she passionately exclaims to Bernard. "It's what happened to the Enlightenment, isn't it? A century of intellectual rigour turned in on itself. A mind in chaos suspected of genius ... The decline from thinking to feeling."

Another major theme is entropy and the irreversibility of time. Thomasina examines this scientifically, remarking that while [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian equations]] work both backwards and forwards, things in reality – like her rice pudding – cannot be "unstirred." Heat, too, she notes, flows in only one direction (the second law of thermodynamics). This is embodied by the characters, who burn bridges in relationships, burn candles, and burn letters – and in the end, Thomasina herself (like a short-lived candle) burns to death.

Thomasina's insights into thermodynamics and heat transfer, and the idea that the universe is cooling, echo the poem ''[[Darkness (poem)|Darkness]]'' by her "real life" contemporary, Lord Byron.&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt; Written in 1816 — the "[[Year Without a Summer]]", caused by atmospheric ash from the volcano [[Mount Tambora]] erupting in the [[Dutch East Indies]] — "Darkness" depicts a world grown dark and cold because the sun has been extinguished.

The play's end brings all these dichotomous themes together, showing that while things may appear to contradict — Romanticism and Classicism, intuition and logic, thought and feeling — they can exist, paradoxically, in the same time and space. Order is found amid the chaos.

==Style==
Jim Hunter writes that ''Arcadia'' is a relatively [[Realism (theatre)|realistic]] play, compared to Stoppard's other works, though the realism is "much enhanced and teased about by the alternation of two eras".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Jim|title=Tom Stoppard|publisher=Faber|location=London|year=2000|series=Faber Critical Guides|page=155|chapter=Arcadia|isbn=0-571-19782-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setting and characters are true-to-life, without being archetypal. It is [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehensible]]: the plot is both logical and probable, following events in a linear fashion.  ''Arcadia'''s major deviation from realism, of course, is in having two  plotlines that are linear and parallel. Thus we see Thomasina deriving her mathematical equations to describe the forms of nature;{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=49}} we later see Val, with his computer, [[Graph of a function|plotting]] them to produce the image of a leaf.{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=62}}

==Language==
The language of ''Arcadia'' switches between the [[colloquialism]]s of early 19th century England and those of modern England. Stoppard's language reflects his periods, historical and modern, and he uses speech patterns and lexicons in keeping with his characters.

But his is a stylised dialogue, conveying the "look and feel" of the past as perceived by the modern audience.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=95}} Still, it has sufficient latitude in [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] to make plain the relationships between the characters. For example, Septimus, after failing to deflect a question from Thomasina with a joke, bluntly explains to his pupil the nature of "carnal embrace"{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=4}} – but this bluntness is far removed from that with which he repudiates Chater's defence of his wife's honour (which he says "could not be adequately defended with a platoon of musketry").{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=9}}  With Lady Croom, who sees Mrs. Chater as a "harlot", Septimus delicately admits that "her passion is not as fixed" as one might wish.{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=95}}

In the modern sequences, the dialogue is more realistic.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=45}} But Bernard consciously assumes some stylisation of language: He rehearses his public lecture in heightened, flamboyant rhetoric;{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=70}} and he unleashes a "performance art" polemic against Valentine's scientific thought, not from spite but for "recreation".{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|pp=80–82}}{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=64}}

The play's scientific concepts are set forth primarily in the historical scenes, where Thomasina delivers her precocious (or even anachronistic) references to [[entropy]], the [[deterministic universe]] and [[Iteration|iterated equations]] in improvised, colloquial terms.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Paul|title=The Cambridge Companion to Tom Stoppard|editor=Kelly, Katherine E |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2001|pages=178–183|isbn=0-521-64592-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era, Valentine explains the significance of Thomasina's rediscovered notebook with careful detail, reflecting Stoppard's research into his play's scientific materials.{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|pp=56–63}}{{sfn|Fleming|2008|pp=48–51}}

Consciously echoed phrases, across the time frames, help to unify the play. For example, Chloe asks Valentine if "the future is all programmed like a computer", and whether she is the first to think that theory discredited "because of sex".{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=97}} Thomasina has been there before: "If you could stop every atom in its position and direction ... you could write the formula for all the future," she tells Septimus, then adds, "Am I the first person to have thought of this?"{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=66}} The difference is significant: Chloe's intuitive version allows for the effects of [[Chaos theory|chaos]], illustrating Stoppard's theme of the interdependence of science and art, and between professional and amateur thinking.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|pp=65–66}}

==Title==
[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|thumb|The title ''Arcadia'' alludes to a pastoral ideal.]]
[[File:Nicolas Poussin - Et in Arcadia ego (deuxième version).jpg|thumb|''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]'' is most known as the title of this painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]], also known as ''Les bergers d'Arcadie'' ("The Arcadian Shepherds")]]
The play's title is abbreviated from its initial version: ''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]''.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|pp=57–58}}  ''Arcadia'' refers to the pastoral ideal; the phrase literally translates, "and in Arcadia I am".  The tradition of placing a tomb in a pastoral idyll can be traced to Virgil's ''Eclogues'', while the phrase first appears in [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin's]] 1637 painting. Both the image and the motto are commonly considered a ''[[memento mori]]'', with the phrase being spoken by Death: "I, too, am in Arcadia". But the enigmatic phrase remains a subject of much academic discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cohen | first=J.M. | authorlink=J. M. Cohen |author2=Cohen, M.J. | title=The Penguin Dictionary of Quotations | publisher=Penguin Books | year=1960 | location=Harmondsworth, England | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Panofsky | first=Erwin | authorlink=Erwin Panofsky | others=quoted in Knowles, Elizabeth (Ed.) | title=The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations:Arcadia | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2004 | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Croom, enthusing about paintings of pretty landscapes, translates the phrase as "Here I am in Arcadia!" Thomasina drily comments, "Yes Mama, if you would have it so". Septimus notices; later, suspecting his pupil will appreciate the motto's true meaning, he offers the translation "Even in Arcadia, there am I". He is right – "Oh, phooey to Death!" she exclaims.{{sfn|Stoppard|1993|p=13}} Although these brief exchanges are the only direct references in the play to its title, they presage the two main characters' fates: Thomasina's early death, and Septimus's voluntary exile from life.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|pp=57–58}} Stoppard originally wanted to make this connection more explicit by using ''Et in Arcadia Ego'' for the title, but "box office sense prevailed".{{sfn|Fleming|2008|pp=57–58}}

In a more obvious sense, the title also invokes the ideal of nature as an ordered paradise, while the estate's landscape steadily evolves into a more irregular form. This provides a recurring image of the different ways in which "true nature" can be understood, and a homely parallel to Thomasina's theoretical description of the natural world's structure and [[entropy|entropic decline]] using mathematics.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|pp=57–58}}

==Contextual information==
In ''Arcadia'', Stoppard presents his audience with several highly complex but fundamental mathematical and scientific concepts. He also uses these theories and ideas to illuminate relationships among his characters, adding to their poignancy.

One of the play's main thematic concepts is [[chaos theory]]. Paul Edwards, in his essay "Science in ''Hapgood'' and ''Arcadia''", notes that "chaos mathematics is about the recovery of information from apparently chaotic and random systems where entropy is high. [...] It is 'asymmetric' (unlike the equations of [[classical physics]]), yet it finds regularities that prove to be the regularities of nature itself. Strikingly, this mathematics can generate patterns of amazing complexity, but it also has the power to generate seemingly natural or organic shapes that defeat Newtonian geometry. The promise, then, (however questionable it is in reality) is that information, and by extension, nature itself, can overcome the tendency to increase in entropy".{{cn|date=April 2015}}{{rp|181}}

John Fleming, in his book ''Stoppard's Theatre: Finding Order amid Chaos'', makes a similar observation. "Deterministic chaos", he writes, "deals with systems of unpredictable determinism. ... [T]he uncertainty does not result in pure randomness, but rather in complex patterns. Traditionally, scientists expected [[dynamic system]]s to settle into stable, predictable behavior."  But as systems respond to variations in input, they become more random or chaotic. "Surprisingly, within these random states, windows of order reappear. [...] There is order in chaos — an unpredictable order, but a determined order nonetheless, and not merely random behavior."{{sfn|Fleming|2001|pp=193–194}}

Closely related scientific and mathematical concepts in ''Arcadia'' are the [[second law of thermodynamics]] and [[entropy]]. Fleming describes these two principles. "Entropy is the measure of the randomness or disorder of a system. The law of increase of entropy states that as a whole, the universe is evolving from order to disorder. This relates to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that heat spontaneously flows in only one direction, from hotter to colder. Since these equations, unlike [[Newton's laws of motion]], do not go backward and forward, there is an '[[arrow of time]]' that points toward the eventual 'heat death' of the universe."{{sfn|Fleming|2001|p=194}}

In ''Arcadia'', Stoppard uses all these concepts to reveal that "there is an underlying order to seemingly random events." The characters discuss these topics, while their interactions reflect them.

Some ideas in the play recall [[Goethe]]'s novella ''[[Elective Affinities]]'': Stoppard's characters "Thomasina" and "Septimus" have parallels in Goethe's "Ottilie" and "Eduard", and the historical section of Stoppard's play is set in 1809, the year of Goethe's novella.{{sfn|Wilson|2003|pp=59–66}}  Among other parallels, the older work takes the [[Chemical affinity#Early theories|theory of affinity between chemical elements]] as a metaphor for ineluctable, inevitable "human chemistry" in the same way as Stoppard makes use of the force of determinism acting on his characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Demastes|first1=William W|title=The Cambridge introduction to Tom Stoppard|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=9781107021952|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shepherd-Barr|first1=Kirsten E.|title=Theatre and Evolution from Ibsen to Beckett|date=3 Mar 2015|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn= 9780231164702|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature of both works is the preoccupation with remodelling country house landscapes; Goethe's young character "Ottilie" (the counterpart to Thomasina) dies as an indirect result of this.{{sfn|Wilson|2003|pp=59–66}}

==Productions==
[[File:ArcadiaPoster.jpg|right|thumb|135px|Poster, by [[James McMullan]], for the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] 1995 production]]''Arcadia'' first opened at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in London on 13 April 1993, in a production directed by [[Trevor Nunn]] with [[Rufus Sewell]] as Septimus Hodge, [[Felicity Kendal]] as Hannah Jarvis, [[Bill Nighy]] as Bernard Nightingale, [[Emma Fielding]] as Thomasina Coverly, Alan Mitchell as Jellaby, Derek Hutchinson as Ezra Chater, Sidney Livingston as Richard Noakes, [[Harriet Walter]] as Lady Croom, Graham Sinclair as Captain Brice, Harriet Harrison as Chloe Coverly, [[Tim Matthews (actor)|Timothy Matthews]] as Augustus  and Gus Coverly and [[Samuel West]] as Valentine Coverly. It won the 1993 [[Olivier Award|Olivier]] and [[Evening Standard Award]]s for Best Play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albemarle-london.com/awards/AwardWinners.php?Award_Type=Evening%20Standard%20Awards&amp;Year=1993 Evening Standard Award] Retrieved on 8 October 2009  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504091559/http://www.albemarle-london.com/awards/AwardWinners.php?Award_Type=Evening+Standard+Awards&amp;Year=1993 |date= 4 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first New York production opened in March 1995, at the [[Vivian Beaumont Theater]].&lt;ref name="canbynyt" /&gt; It was again directed by [[Trevor Nunn]], but with an entirely new cast. It starred [[Billy Crudup]] as Septimus, [[Blair Brown]] as Hannah, [[Victor Garber]] as Bernard, [[Robert Sean Leonard]] as Valentine and [[Jennifer Dundas]] as Thomasina. This production was the Broadway debut of [[Paul Giamatti]], who played Ezra Chater. The other actors were [[Lisa Banes]] (Lady Croom), Richard Clarke (Jellaby), John Griffin (Gus/Augustus), Peter Maloney (Noakes), David Manis (Captain Brice, RN) and [[Haviland Morris]] (Chloe). This production won the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle]] Award, and was nominated for the 1995 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play, losing to [[Terrence McNally]]'s ''[[Love! Valour! Compassion!]]''.

In December 1996, the first major US regional production was mounted at the [[Arena Stage]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/theater/reviews/arcadia.htm|title=Stoppard's Coolly Clever ‘Arcadia’|last=Rose|first=Lloyd|authorlink=Lloyd Rose|date=20 December 1996|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May 2009, a London production, directed by [[David Leveaux]], opened at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] starring [[Dan Stevens]] (Septimus Hodge),  [[Samantha Bond]] (Hannah Jarvis), [[Jessie Cave]] (Thomasina Coverly), [[Nancy Carroll (British actress)|Nancy Carroll]] (Lady Croom), [[Trevor Cooper]] (Richard Noakes), [[Sam Cox (actor)|Sam Cox]] (Jellaby), [[Lucy Griffiths (actress, born 1986)|Lucy Griffiths]] (Chloë Coverly), Tom Hodgkins (Captain Brice), [[Hugh Mitchell (actor)|Hugh Mitchell]] (Augustus/Gus Coverly), [[Neil Pearson]] (Bernard Nightingale), George Potts (Ezra Chater) and [[Ed Stoppard]] (Valentine Coverly). The production recouped its costs and closed on 12 September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;It was produced by [[Sonia Friedman]].[http://broadwayworld.com/article/ARCADIA_Recoups_Production_Costs_Finishes_Run_Sept_12_20090806  ''Arcadia'' Recoups Production Costs, Finishes Run Sept 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Arcadia'' returned to Broadway, at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]], on 17 March 2011, again directed by David Leveaux. The cast included [[Margaret Colin]] (Lady Croom), [[Billy Crudup]] (Septimus in the original Broadway version, now playing Bernard Nightingale), [[Raúl Esparza]] (Valentine Coverly), Glenn Fleshler (Captain Brice), [[Grace Gummer]] (Chloë Coverly), Edward James Hyland (Jellaby), Byron Jennings (Richard Noakes), [[Bel Powley]] (Thomasina Coverly), [[Tom Riley (actor)|Tom Riley]] (Septimus Hodge), [[Noah Robbins]] (Gus Coverly/Augustus Coverly), David Turner (Ezra Chater), and [[Lia Williams]] (Hannah Jarvis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/Crudup_Esparza_Williams_More_to_Star_in_ARCADIA_Begins_at_Barrymore_Theatre_on_Feb_25_20101229_page2|title=Crudup, Esparza, Williams &amp; More to Star in ARCADIA; Begins at Barrymore Theatre on 25 Feb.|date=29 December 2010|work=Broadwayworld.com|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/150437-2011-Tony-Nominations-Announced-Book-of-Mormon-Earns-14-Nominations |title=2011 Tony Nominations Announced; Book of Mormon Earns 14 Nominations |date=3 May 2011 |work=[[Playbill]] |accessdate=2 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914233343/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/150437-2011-Tony-Nominations-Announced-Book-of-Mormon-Earns-14-Nominations |archivedate=14 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[The Times]]'', reviewing the first production in 1993, praised it as a "perfect marriage of ideas and high comedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nightingale|first=Benedict|authorlink=Benedict Nightingale|date=14 April 1993|title=Ideas meet their comic match|journal=The Times|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; But for some, the ideas overwhelmed the comedy: "[T]oo clever by about two-and-three-quarters," noted ''[[The Daily Mail]]''. "One comes away instructed with more than one can usefully wish to know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tinker|first=Jack|authorlink=|date=14 April 1993|title=Another lesson in whims and conceit at the knee of too-clever Mr Stoppard|journal=The Daily Mail|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an eight-month run at the National, the play's transfer to the West End gave an opportunity for re-appraisal. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' critic commented: "I have never left a play more convinced that I had just witnessed a masterpiece".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Spencer (journalist)|date=26 May 1994|title=Stoppard's thrilling workout|journal=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the play as "Tom Stoppard's richest, most ravishing comedy to date, a play of wit, intellect, language, brio and, new for him, emotion".&lt;ref name="canbynyt"&gt;{{cite news | first=Vincent | last=Canby | authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Theatre Review: Arcadia; Stoppard's Comedy Of 1809 and Now | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/theater/theater-review-arcadia-stoppard-s-comedy-of-1809-and-now.html?scp=1 | work=The New York Times | date=31 March 1995 | accessdate=3 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; But other New York reviews were mixed or unfavourable, complaining of the anachronisms and lack of realism.{{sfn|Fleming|2008|p=82}} The production left [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' with the view that "Stoppard overdoes it…''Arcadia'' makes better reading than seeing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=John|title=Wits' End|journal=New York Magazine|date=10 April 1995|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 London revival prompted more critics to laud the play as "Stoppard's finest work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=198&amp;story=E8831244481126&amp;title=Review%20Round-up:%20Critics%20Hail%20Stoppard%27s%20Arcadia|title=Critics Hail Stoppard's ''Arcadia''|last=Bosanquet|first=Theo|work=Review Round-up|publisher=Whatsonstage.com|quote=confirms the status of the play as Stoppard's "finest work".|accessdate=1 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810010709/http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=198|archive-date=10 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the play "gets richer with each viewing. ... [T]here is poetry and passion behind the mathematics and metaphysics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Billington|first=Michael|date=5 June 2009|title=Review: Arcadia|journal=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jun/05/review-theatre-arcadia-duke-of-yorks-london?intcmp=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Hari]] of ''[[The Independent]]'' speculated that ''Arcadia'' would be recognised "as the greatest play of its time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/is-tom-stoppards-arcadia-the-greatest-play-of-our-age-1688852.html|title=Is Tom Stoppard's Arcadia the greatest play of our age?|last=Hari|first=Johann|date=22 May 2009|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=1 December 2010|location=London|quote=Standing above them all, making the case for the entire genre [of 'plays of ideas'], is perhaps the greatest play of its time: Arcadia by Tom Stoppard. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 Broadway staging met with a mixed reception. [[Ben Brantley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the production "a half-terrific revival of Mr. Stoppard's entirely terrific ''Arcadia''", noting that "several central roles are slightly miscast", and "some of the performances from the Anglo-American cast are pitched to the point of incoherence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/theater/reviews/arcadia-by-tom-stoppard-on-broadway-review.html?ref=arts&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Theater Review; The 180-Year Itch, Metaphysically Speaking|last=Brantley|first=Ben|date=18 March 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns were raised by critics from the ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', ''[[Time Out New York]]'' and [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/Broadway_Review_Roundup_ARCADIA_20110317|title=Broadway Review Roundup: ARCADIA|date=18 March 2011|work=BroadwayWorld.com|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=July 2016}}
In [[mathematics]], '''connectedness'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/connectedness|title=the definition of connectedness|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to refer to various properties meaning, in some sense, "all one piece". When a mathematical object has such a property, we say it is '''connected'''; otherwise it is '''disconnected'''. When a disconnected object can be split naturally into connected pieces, each piece is usually called a ''component'' (or ''connected component'').

==Connectedness in topology==
{{Main article|Connected space}}

A [[topological space]] is said to be ''[[connected space|connected]]'' if it is not the union of two [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] nonempty [[open set]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Topology|last=Munkres|first=James|publisher=Pearson|year=2000|isbn=978-0131816299|location=|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is open if it contains no point lying on its [[boundary (topology)|boundary]]; thus, in an informal, intuitive sense, the fact that a space can be partitioned into disjoint open sets suggests that the boundary between the two sets is not part of the space, and thus splits it into two separate pieces.

==Other notions of connectedness==
Fields of mathematics are typically concerned with special kinds of objects. Often such an object is said to be ''connected'' if, when it is considered as a topological space, it is a connected space. Thus, [[manifold]]s, [[Lie group]]s, and [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s are all called ''connected'' if they are connected as topological spaces, and their components are the topological components. Sometimes it is convenient to restate the definition of connectedness in such fields. For example, a graph is said to be ''[[connected graph|connected]]'' if each pair of [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] in the graph is joined by a [[path (graph theory)|path]]. This definition is equivalent to the topological one, as applied to graphs, but it is easier to deal with in the context of [[graph theory]]. Graph theory also offers a context-free measure of connectedness, called the [[clustering coefficient]].

Other fields of mathematics are concerned with objects that are rarely considered as topological spaces. Nonetheless, definitions of ''connectedness'' often reflect the topological meaning in some way. For example, in [[category theory]], a [[category (mathematics)|category]] is said to be ''[[connected category|connected]]'' if each pair of objects in it is joined by a sequence of [[morphism]]s. Thus, a category is connected if it is, intuitively, all one piece.

There may be different notions of ''connectedness'' that are intuitively similar, but different as formally defined concepts. We might wish to call a topological space ''connected'' if each pair of points in it is joined by a [[path (topology)|path]]. However this condition turns out to be stronger than standard topological connectedness; in particular, there are connected topological spaces for which this property does not hold. Because of this, different terminology is used; spaces with this property are said to be ''[[path connected]]''. While not all connected spaces are path connected, all path connected spaces are connected.

Terms involving ''connected'' are also used for properties that are related to, but clearly different from, connectedness. For example, a path-connected topological space is ''[[simply connected space|simply connected]]'' if each loop (path from a point to itself) in it is [[contractible]]; that is, intuitively, if there is essentially only one way to get from any point to any other point. Thus, a [[sphere]] and a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] are each simply connected, while a [[torus]] is not. As another example, a [[directed graph]] is ''[[strongly connected component|strongly connected]]'' if each [[ordered pair]] of vertices is joined by a [[directed path]] (that is, one that "follows the arrows").

Other concepts express the way in which an object is ''not'' connected. For example, a topological space is ''[[totally disconnected]]'' if each of its components is a single point.

==Connectivity==
{{Main article|Connectivity (graph theory)}}
Properties and parameters based on the idea of connectedness often involve the word ''connectivity''. For example, in [[graph theory]], a [[connected graph]] is one from which we must remove at least one vertex to create a disconnected graph&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Graph Theory and Applications|last=Bondy|first=J.A.|last2=Murty|first2=U.S.R.|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishing Co.|year=1976|isbn=0444194517|location=New York, NY|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In recognition of this, such graphs are also said to be ''1-connected''. Similarly, a graph is ''2-connected'' if we must remove at least two vertices from it, to create a disconnected graph. A ''3-connected'' graph requires the removal of at least three vertices, and so on. The ''[[connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]]'' of a graph is the minimum number of vertices that must be removed, to disconnect it. Equivalently, the connectivity of a graph is the greatest integer ''k'' for which the graph is ''k''-connected.

While terminology varies, [[noun]] forms of connectedness-related properties often include the term ''connectivity''. Thus, when discussing simply connected topological spaces, it is far more common to speak of ''simple connectivity'' than ''simple connectedness''. On the other hand, in fields without a formally defined notion of ''connectivity'', the word may be used as a synonym for ''connectedness''.

Another example of connectivity can be found in regular tilings. Here, the connectivity describes the number of neighbors accessible from a single [[tile]]:

Image:Square_4_connectivity.svg|[[4-connected graph|4-connectivity]] in a [[square tiling]],&amp;nbsp;
Image:Hexagonal_connectivity.svg|6-connectivity in a [[hexagonal tiling]],&amp;nbsp;
Image:Square_8_connectivity.svg|[[8-connectivity]] in a [[square tiling]] (note that distance equity is not kept)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4181">The '''cumulative accuracy profile (CAP)''' is used in data science to visualize the discriminative power of a model. The CAP of a model represents the cumulative number of positive outcomes along the ''y''-axis versus the corresponding cumulative number of a classifying parameter along the ''x''-axis. The CAP is distinct from the [[receiver operating characteristic]] (ROC), which plots the [[true-positive rate]] against the [[false-positive rate]].

==Example==

An example is a model that predicts whether a product is bought ('''positive outcome''') by each individual from a group of people ('''classifying parameter''') based on factors such as their gender, age, income etc. If group members would be contacted at random, the cumulative number of products sold would rise linearly toward a maximum value corresponding to the total number of buyers within the group. This distribution is called the '''"random" CAP'''. A perfect prediction, on the other hand, determines exactly which group members will buy the product, such that the maximum number of products sold will be reached with a minimum number of calls. This produces a steep line on the CAP curve that stays flat once the maximum is reached (contacting all other group members will not lead to more products sold), which is the '''"perfect" CAP'''.

[[File:CAP profiles.jpg|thumb|The CAP profiles for the perfect, good and random model predicting the buying customers from a pool of 100 individuals.]]

A successful model predicts the likelihood of individuals purchasing the product and ranks these probabilities to produce a list of potential customers to be contacted first. The resulting cumulative number of sold products will increase rapidly and eventually flatten out to the given maximum as more group members are contacted. This results in a distribution that lies between the random and the perfect CAP curves.

==Analyzing a CAP==

The CAP can be used to evaluate a model by comparing the curve to the '''perfect CAP''' in which the maximum number of positive outcomes is achieved directly and to the '''random CAP''' in which the positive outcomes are distributed equally. A good model will have a CAP between the perfect CAP and the random CAP with a better model tending to the perfect CAP.

The '''accuracy ratio (AR)''' is defined as the ratio of the area between the model CAP and the random CAP and the area between the perfect CAP and the random CAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Another indication of the model strength is given by the cumulative number of positive outcomes at 50% of the classifying parameter. For a successful model this value should lie between 50% and 100% of the maximum, with a higher percentage for stronger models.

==Applications==

The CAP and the ROC are both commonly used by banks and regulators to analyze the discriminatory ability of rating systems that evaluate the credit risks &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">In [[quantum field theory]], the '''Dirac adjoint''' defines the [[dual vector space|dual]] operation of a [[Dirac spinor]].  The Dirac adjoint is motivated by the need to form well-behaved, measurable quantities out of Dirac spinors.  Since the usual [[Hermitian adjoint]] lacks the [[Lorentz symmetry]] of the system, the Dirac adjoint must be used instead.

Possibly to avoid confusion with the usual [[Hermitian adjoint]], some textbooks do not provide a name for the Dirac adjoint but simply call it "&lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;-bar".

== Definition ==

Let &lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt; be a [[Dirac spinor]].  Then its Dirac adjoint is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\bar\psi \equiv \psi^\dagger \gamma^0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the [[Hermitian adjoint]] of the spinor &lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;γ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the time-like [[gamma matrices|gamma matrix]].

== Spinors under Lorentz transformations ==

The [[Lorentz group]] of [[special relativity]] is not [[compact space|compact]], therefore [[Representations of the Lorentz group|representation]]s of [[Lorentz transformation]]s in the Dirac spinor space are not [[unitary operator|unitary]].  That is, in general,

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^\dagger \ne \lambda^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;var&gt;λ&lt;/var&gt; is the corresponding Lorentz transformation that maps spinors:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi \mapsto \lambda \psi&lt;/math&gt;.

The Hermitian adjoint of spinors transforms according to

:&lt;math&gt;\psi^\dagger \mapsto \psi^\dagger \lambda^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, using only the Hermitian adjoint, one finds that {{nowrap|&lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;}} is not a [[Lorentz scalar]] and {{nowrap|&lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;var&gt;γ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;var&gt;μ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;}} is not even [[self-adjoint operator|Hermitian]].

Using the definition, one finds that the Dirac adjoint of spinors transforms according to

:&lt;math&gt;\bar\psi \mapsto \left(\lambda \psi\right)^\dagger \gamma^0&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the identity {{nowrap|&lt;var&gt;γ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;var&gt;λ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;var&gt;γ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} &lt;var&gt;λ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the transformation reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\bar\psi \mapsto \bar\psi \lambda^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;,

which possesses the required Lorentz symmetry for {{nowrap|{{overline|&lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;}} &lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{nowrap|{{overline|&lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;}}  &lt;var&gt;γ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;var&gt;μ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;/var&gt;}}.

== Usage ==

Using the Dirac adjoint, the [[probability current|probability four-current]] &lt;var&gt;'''J'''&lt;/var&gt; for a spin-1/2 particle field can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;J^\mu = c \bar\psi \gamma^\mu \psi&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt; is the speed of light and the components of &lt;var&gt;'''J'''&lt;/var&gt; represent the probability density &lt;var&gt;ρ&lt;/var&gt; and the probability 3-current &lt;var&gt;'''j'''&lt;/var&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol J = (c \rho, \boldsymbol j)&lt;/math&gt;.

Taking {{nowrap|&lt;var&gt;μ&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 0}} and using the relation for [[gamma matrices]]

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\gamma^0\right)^2 = I&lt;/math&gt;,

the probability density becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \psi^\dagger \psi&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5258">The following '''examples of [[generating function]]s''' are in the spirit of [[George Pólya]], who advocated learning mathematics by doing and re-capitulating as many examples and proofs as possible.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The purpose of this article is to present common ways of creating generating functions.

== Worked example A: basics ==
New [[generating function]]s can be created by extending simpler generating functions. For [[Worked-example effect|example]], starting with

:&lt;math&gt;G(1;x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n = \frac{1}{1-x}&lt;/math&gt;

and replacing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;ax&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;G(1;ax)=\frac{1}{1-ax} = 1+(ax)+(ax)^2+\cdots+(ax)^n+\cdots =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a^n x^n = G(a^n;x).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Bivariate generating functions ===
One can define generating functions in several variables, for series with several indices. These are often called '''super generating functions,''' and for 2 variables are often called '''bivariate generating functions.'''

For instance, since &lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n&lt;/math&gt; is the generating function for [[binomial coefficients]] for a fixed ''n,'' one may ask for a bivariate generating function that generates the binomial coefficients &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt; for all ''k'' and ''n.''
To do this, consider &lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n&lt;/math&gt; as ''itself'' a series (in ''n''), and find the generating function in ''y'' that has these as coefficients. Since the generating function for &lt;math&gt;a^n&lt;/math&gt; is just &lt;math&gt;1/(1-ay)&lt;/math&gt;, the generating function for the binomial coefficients is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-(1+x)y}=1+(1+x)y+(1+x)^2y^2+\dots,&lt;/math&gt;
and the coefficient on &lt;math&gt;x^ky^n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt; binomial coefficient.

== Worked example B: Fibonacci numbers ==

Consider the problem of finding a [[Closed-form expression|closed formula]] for the [[Fibonacci number]]s ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; defined by ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n'' ≥ 2. We form the ordinary generating function

:&lt;math&gt;
f = \sum_{n \ge 0} F_n x^n
&lt;/math&gt;

for this sequence. The generating function for the sequence (''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is ''xf'' and that of (''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''f''. From the recurrence relation, we therefore see that the power series ''xf'' + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' agrees with ''f'' except for the first two coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcrcrcrcrcrcr}
f    &amp; = &amp; F_0x^0 &amp; + &amp; F_1x^1 &amp; + &amp; F_2x^2 &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp; F_ix^i &amp; + &amp;\cdots\\
xf   &amp; = &amp;        &amp;  &amp; F_0x^1  &amp; + &amp; F_1x^2 &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp;F_{i-1}x^i &amp; + &amp;\cdots\\
x^2f &amp; = &amp;        &amp;  &amp;         &amp;   &amp; F_0x^2 &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp;F_{i-2}x^i &amp; +&amp;\cdots\\
(x+x^2)f &amp; = &amp;    &amp;  &amp; F_0x^1  &amp; + &amp; (F_0+F_1)x^2 &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp; (F_{i-1}+F_{i-2})x^i &amp; +&amp;\cdots\\
     &amp; = &amp;        &amp;  &amp;         &amp;   &amp; F_2x^2       &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp; F_ix^i &amp; +&amp; \cdots\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking these into account, we find that

:&lt;math&gt;
f = xf + x^2 f + x .
&lt;/math&gt;

(This is the crucial step; recurrence relations can almost always be translated into equations for the generating functions.) Solving this equation for ''f'', we get

:&lt;math&gt;
f = \frac{x} {1 - x - x^2} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The denominator can be factored using the [[golden ratio]] φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (1 + {{radic|5}})/2 and φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (1 &amp;minus; {{radic|5}})/2, and the technique of [[partial fraction decomposition]] yields

:&lt;math&gt;
f = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left (\frac{1}{1-\varphi_1 x} - \frac{1} {1- \varphi_2 x} \right ) .
&lt;/math&gt;

These two formal power series are known explicitly because they are [[geometric series]]; comparing coefficients, we find the explicit formula

:&lt;math&gt;
F_n = \frac{1} {\sqrt{5}} (\varphi_1^n - \varphi_2^n).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Worked example C: Number of ways to make change==
The number of {{em|unordered}} ways ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to make change for ''n'' cents using coins with values 1, 5, 10, and 25 is given by the generating function
:&lt;math&gt;G(a_n, x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n = \frac{1}{(1-x)(1-x^5)(1-x^{10})(1-x^{25})}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
For example there are two unordered ways to make change for 6 cents; one way is six 1-cent coins, the other way is one 1-cent coin and one 5-cent coin.  See {{oeis|A001299}}.

On the other hand, the number of {{em|ordered}} ways ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to make change for ''n'' cents using coins with values 1, 5, 10, and 25 is given by the generating function
:&lt;math&gt;G(b_n, x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n x^n = \frac{1}{1-x-x^5-x^{10}-x^{25}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
For example there are three ordered ways to make change for 6 cents; one way is six 1-cent coins, a second way is one 1-cent coin and one 5-cent coin, and a third way is one 5-cent coin and one 1-cent coin.  Compare to {{oeis|A114044}}, which differs from this example by also including coins with values 50 and 100.

== Notation ==
The following summarizes short definitions and notations that are used in this article.

==== Manifold ====
&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional smooth manifolds, where &lt;math&gt; n\in \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;. That is, [[differentiable manifold]]s that can be differentiated enough times for the purposes on this page.

&lt;math&gt; p \in M &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; q \in N &lt;/math&gt; denote two points on the manifolds.

&lt;math&gt;TM&lt;/math&gt; is the [[tangent bundle]] of the smooth manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; T_p M &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; T_q N &lt;/math&gt; denote the [[tangent space]]s of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; at the points &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

[[Section (fiber bundle)|Sections]] of the tangent bundles, also known as [[vector field]]s, are typically denoted as &lt;math&gt;X, Y, Z \in \Gamma(TM)&lt;/math&gt; such that at a point &lt;math&gt; p \in M &lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt; X|_p, Y|_p, Z|_p \in T_p M &lt;/math&gt;.

Given an [[Inner product space|inner product]] &lt;math&gt; g( \cdot , \cdot  )_p &lt;/math&gt; on each &lt;math&gt; T_p M &lt;/math&gt;, the manifold becomes a [[Riemannian manifold]].

The boundary of a [[manifold]] &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is a manifold &lt;math&gt; \partial M &lt;/math&gt;, which has dimension &lt;math&gt; n - 1 &lt;/math&gt;.  An orientation on &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; induces an orientation on &lt;math&gt; \partial M &lt;/math&gt;.

We usually denote a [[submanifold]] by &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \subset M&lt;/math&gt;.

==== ''k''-forms ====

&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-forms are [[differential form]]s defined on &lt;math&gt;TM&lt;/math&gt;. We denote the set of all &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-forms as &lt;math&gt;\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt; 0\leq k,\ l,\ m\leq n &lt;/math&gt; we usually write &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta\in\Omega^l(M)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma\in\Omega^m(M)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;-forms &lt;math&gt;f\in\Omega^0(M)&lt;/math&gt; are just scalar functions &lt;math&gt;C^{\infty}(M)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}\in\Omega^0(M)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the constant &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;-form equal to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; everywhere.

==== Omitted elements of a sequence ====

When we are given &lt;math&gt;(k+1)&lt;/math&gt; inputs &lt;math&gt;X_0,\ldots,X_k&lt;/math&gt; and a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; we omit the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th entry by writing

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(X_0,\ldots,\hat{X}_i,\ldots,X_k):=\alpha(X_0,\ldots,X_{i-1},X_{i+1},\ldots,X_k) .&lt;/math&gt;

==== Exterior product ====

The [[exterior product]] is also known as the ''wedge product''. It is denoted by &lt;math&gt; \wedge : \Omega^k(M) \times \Omega^l(M) \rightarrow \Omega^{k+l}(M)&lt;/math&gt;. The exterior product of a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; and an &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;\beta\in\Omega^l(M)&lt;/math&gt; produce a &lt;math&gt;(k+l)&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;\alpha\wedge\beta \in\Omega^{k+l}(M)&lt;/math&gt;. It can be written using the set &lt;math&gt;S(k,k+l)&lt;/math&gt; of all permutations &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sigma(1)&lt;\ldots &lt;\sigma(k), \ \sigma(k+1)&lt;\ldots &lt;\sigma(k+l) &lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha\wedge\beta)(X_1,\ldots,X_{k+l})=\sum_{\sigma\in S(k,k+l)}\text{sign}(\sigma)\alpha(X_{\sigma(1)},\ldots,X_{\sigma(k)})\beta(X_{\sigma(k+1)},\ldots,X_{\sigma(k+l)}) .&lt;/math&gt;

==== Lie bracket ====

The [[Lie bracket of vector fields | Lie bracket]] of sections &lt;math&gt;X,Y \in \Gamma(TM)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the unique section &lt;math&gt;[X,Y] \in \Gamma(TM)&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;
\forall f\in\Omega^0(M) \Rightarrow [X,Y]f = XYf-YXf .
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Exterior derivative ====

The [[exterior derivative]] &lt;math&gt;d_k : \Omega^k(M) \rightarrow \Omega^{k+1}(M) &lt;/math&gt; is defined for all &lt;math&gt; 0 \leq k\leq n&lt;/math&gt;.  We generally omit the subscript when it is clear from the context.
&lt;!--Its defining integral property is that for any &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; dimensional submanifold &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\subset M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\Sigma} d\alpha = \int_{\partial\Sigma} \alpha &lt;/math&gt; --&gt;

For a &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;f\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;d_0f\in\Omega^1(M)&lt;/math&gt; as the directional derivative &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-form. i.e. in the direction &lt;math&gt;X\in T_pM&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;(d_0f)(X)=Xf&lt;/math&gt;.{{citation needed|reason=The notation Xf is only defined in words, and its use here is confusing.|date=November 2018}}

For &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; k\leq n&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; (d_k\omega)(X_0,\ldots,X_k)=\sum_{0\leq j\leq k}(-1)^jd_{k-1}(\omega(X_0,\ldots,\hat{X}_j,\ldots,X_k))(X_j) + \sum_{0\leq i &lt; j\leq k}(-1)^{i+j}\omega([X_i,X_j],X_0,\ldots,\hat{X}_i,\ldots,\hat{X}_j,\ldots,X_k) .&lt;/math&gt;

==== Tangent maps ====

If &lt;math&gt; \phi : M \rightarrow N &lt;/math&gt; is a smooth map, then &lt;math&gt;(d\phi)_p:T_pM\rightarrow T_{\phi(p)}N&lt;/math&gt; defines a tangent map from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. It is defined through curves &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with derivative &lt;math&gt;\gamma'(0)=X\in T_pM&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;d\phi(X):=(\phi\circ\gamma)' .&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;-form with values in &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Pull-back ====

If &lt;math&gt; \phi : M \rightarrow N &lt;/math&gt; is a smooth map, then the [[Pullback_(differential_geometry) | pull-back]] of a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt; \alpha\in \Omega^k(N) &lt;/math&gt; is defined such that for any &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; dimensional submanifold &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\subset M&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\Sigma} \phi^*\alpha = \int_{\phi(\Sigma)} \alpha .&lt;/math&gt;

The pull-back can also be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;(\phi^*\alpha)(X_1,\ldots,X_k)=\alpha(d\phi(X_1),\ldots,d\phi(X_k)) .&lt;/math&gt;

==== Musical isomorphisms ====

Given a section &lt;math&gt; A \in \Gamma(TM)&lt;/math&gt; there exists a &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;A^{\flat}\in\Omega^1(M)&lt;/math&gt; such that on each &lt;math&gt;p \in M&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\forall X \in T_p M \Rightarrow A^{\flat}(X) = g(A,X)_p .&lt;/math&gt;

We call this mapping the flat operator &lt;math&gt;\flat&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\Omega^1(M)&lt;/math&gt; there exists a section &lt;math&gt; \alpha^{\sharp}\in \Gamma(TM)&lt;/math&gt; such that on each &lt;math&gt;p\in M&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\forall X \in T_pM \Rightarrow g(\alpha|_p^{\sharp},X)_p = \alpha|_p(X) .&lt;/math&gt;

We call this mapping the sharp operator &lt;math&gt;\sharp&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\sharp&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\flat&lt;/math&gt; constitute the [[musical isomorphisms]].

==== Interior product ====

Also known as the interior derivative, the [[interior product]] given a section &lt;math&gt; Y\in \Gamma(TM) &lt;/math&gt; is a map &lt;math&gt;\iota_Y:\Omega^{k+1}(M) \rightarrow \Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; that effectively substitutes the first input of a &lt;math&gt;(k+1)&lt;/math&gt;-form with &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\Omega^{k+1}(M)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_i\in \Gamma(TM)&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt; (\iota_Y\alpha)(X_1,\ldots,X_k) = \alpha(Y,X_1,\ldots,X_k) .&lt;/math&gt;

==== Hodge star ====

The [[Hodge star operator]] &lt;math&gt;{\star}:\Omega^k(M)\rightarrow\Omega^{n-k}(M)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as such that it maps &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-forms &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; to their dual &lt;math&gt;(n-k)&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;({\star}\alpha) \ \Omega^{n-k}(M)&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, if &lt;math&gt;(X_1,\ldots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a positively oriented frame for &lt;math&gt;TM&lt;/math&gt; according to the given metric &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;
({\star}\alpha)(X_1,\ldots,X_{n-k})=\alpha(X_{n-k+1},\ldots,X_n) .
&lt;/math&gt;

We omit to write the dimension &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; or inversion symbol &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; with the Hodge star operator as it is evident in the context. &lt;!--Note that &lt;math&gt;{\star}^{(-1)} = (-1)^{k(n-k)}&lt;/math&gt;.--&gt;

We call &lt;math&gt;s=\text{sign}(g)&lt;/math&gt; the [[Hodge_star_operator#Duality | signature]] of the metric &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. For example in [[Minkowski_space | Minkowski space]] &lt;math&gt;s=-1&lt;/math&gt; and in Riemannian manifolds &lt;math&gt;s=1&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Co-differential operator ====

The [[Hodge_star_operator#Codifferential|co-differential operator]] &lt;math&gt;\delta:\Omega^k(M)\rightarrow\Omega^{k-1}(M)&lt;/math&gt; on an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dimensional manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\delta:=(-1)^{nk+n+1}{\star} d {\star} .&lt;/math&gt;

==== Oriented manifold ====

An &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[orientable manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a manifold that can be equipped with a choice of a non-zero &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;\mu\in\Omega^n(M)&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Volume form ====

On a orientable manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; the canonical choice of a [[ Volume_form | volume form ]] given a metric &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{det}:=\sqrt{\det g}\;dX_1^{\flat}\wedge\ldots\wedge dX_n^{\flat}&lt;/math&gt; for any [[Orientation_(vector_space)#Multilinear_algebra | positively oriented]] basis &lt;math&gt;dX_1,\ldots, dX_n&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Area form ====

Given a volume form &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{det}&lt;/math&gt; and a unit normal vector &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; we can also define an area form &lt;math&gt;\sigma:=\iota_N\textbf{det}&lt;/math&gt; on the {{nowrap|boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial M.&lt;/math&gt;}}

==== Inner product for ''k''-forms ====

The [[inner product]] between two &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-forms &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\beta\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; is defined [[pointwise]] on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle\alpha,\beta\rangle|_p := {\star}(\alpha\wedge {\star}\beta )|_p .
&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;-inner product for the space of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-forms &lt;math&gt;\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle\!\langle\alpha,\beta\rangle\!\rangle:= \int_M\alpha\wedge {\star}\beta .
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Lie derivative ====

We define the [[Lie derivative]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}:\Omega^k(M)\rightarrow\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; through [[Cartan's magic formula]] for a given section &lt;math&gt;X\in \Gamma(TM)&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{L}_X = d \circ \iota_X + \iota_X \circ d .
&lt;/math&gt;

It describes the change of a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-form along a flow map &lt;math&gt;\phi_t&lt;/math&gt; associated to the section &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!--
==== Levi-Civita connection ====

The [[Levi-Civita connection]] is the unique map &lt;math&gt;\nabla : \Gamma(TM)\times\Gamma(TM) \rightarrow \Gamma(TM) &lt;/math&gt; that is ''affine'', ''compatible with the given metric'' and ''torsion free''.

We write &lt;math&gt;\nabla(X,Y)=\nabla_XY&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Covariant derivative ====

The generalization of the Levi-Civita connection to be applied on &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-forms is called the [[covariant derivative]]. Typically the same symbol &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is used since it acts on forms in &lt;math&gt;\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; and not on sections in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(TM)&lt;/math&gt;. It is defined as a map

&lt;math&gt;
\nabla: \Gamma(TM)\times\Omega^k(M)\rightarrow\Omega^k(M)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
(\nabla_Y\alpha):= d(\alpha(X_1,\ldots,X_k))(Y) - \sum_{i=1}^k\alpha(X_1,\ldots,\nabla_YX_i,\ldots,X_k) .
&lt;/math&gt;

Note &lt;math&gt;\alpha(X_1,\ldots,X_k)&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;-form (scalar function) as it is evaluated on the input and that &lt;math&gt;d(\alpha(X_1,\ldots,X_k))(Y)&lt;/math&gt; is a directional derivative of the scalar function &lt;math&gt;\alpha(X_1,\ldots,X_k)&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.--&gt;

==== Laplace–Beltrami operator ====

The [[Laplace operator | Laplacian]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta:\Omega^k(M) \rightarrow \Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\Delta = -(d\delta + \delta d)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Important Definitions ==

==== Definitions on Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') ====

&lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; is called...

* ''closed'' if &lt;math&gt;d\alpha=0&lt;/math&gt;
* ''exact'' if &lt;math&gt;\exists \beta\in\Omega^{k-1}: \ \alpha = d\beta&lt;/math&gt;
* ''coclosed'' if &lt;math&gt;\delta\alpha=0&lt;/math&gt;
* ''coexact'' if &lt;math&gt;\exists \beta\in\Omega^{k+1}: \ \alpha = \delta\beta&lt;/math&gt;
* ''harmonic'' if ''closed'' and ''coclosed''

==== Cohomology ====

The &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th [[cohomology]] of a manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and its exterior derivative operators &lt;math&gt;d_0,\ldots,d_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
H^k(M):=\tfrac{\text{ker}(d_{k})}{\text{im}(d_{k-1})}
&lt;/math&gt;

Two closed &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-forms &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\beta\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; are in the same cohomology class if their difference is an exact form i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;
[\alpha]=[\beta] \Leftrightarrow \exist \ \eta\in\Omega^{k-1}(M) \ : \ \alpha -\beta = d\eta
&lt;/math&gt;

A closed surface of genus &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; will have &lt;math&gt;2g&lt;/math&gt; generators which are harmonic.

==== [[Dirichlet energy]] ====

Given &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{E}_D(\alpha):= \dfrac{1}{2}\langle\!\langle d\alpha,d\alpha\rangle\!\rangle + \dfrac{1}{2}\langle\!\langle \delta\alpha,\delta\alpha\rangle\!\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--
==== Definitions on metric ''g'' ====

Given Riemannian manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with metric &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and immersion &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. We call &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;...

* isometric if &lt;math&gt;g(df(X),df(X)) =  g(X,X)&lt;/math&gt;
* conformal if &lt;math&gt;g(df(X),df(Y)) = \lambda g(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;
&lt;!--
==== Lagrangian derivative ====

Given a flow map &lt;math&gt;\phi_t&lt;/math&gt; from a section &lt;math&gt;X\in\Gamma(TM)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the Lagrangian derivative of a time dependent &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
D_X(\alpha) := \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right|_{t=0}(\phi^*\alpha) = \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right|_{t=0}\alpha + \mathcal{L}_X\alpha
&lt;/math&gt;

It is not the same as the [[material derivative]].--&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha \wedge \alpha = 0
&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank} \alpha \le 1&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[Exterior algebra#Rank of a k-vector|rank of a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-form]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the minimum number of terms, each consisting of the exterior product of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-forms, that can be summed to produce &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;!-- this result generalizes to form of higher rank; it would be nice to put the general result here. For 2-forms, the rank can be determined as the largest number of copies wedged together that produces a non-zero result, and this might apply unchanged to other forms. --&gt;

==== Projection and rejection ====

(-1)^k\iota_X{\star}\alpha = {\star}(X^{\flat}\wedge\alpha)
&lt;/math&gt; ( ''Interior product &lt;math&gt;\iota_X{\star}&lt;/math&gt; dual to wedge &lt;math&gt;X^{\flat}\wedge&lt;/math&gt;'' )

&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\Omega^{k+1}(M),\beta\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;|X|=1, \ \alpha\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt;, then

*&lt;math&gt;\iota_X\circ (X^{\flat}\wedge ):\Omega^k(M)\rightarrow\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''projection'' of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; onto the orthogonal complement of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

*&lt;math&gt;(X^{\flat}\wedge )\circ \iota_X:\Omega^k(M)\rightarrow\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''rejection'' of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the remainder of the projection.

* thus &lt;math&gt; \iota_X \circ (X^{\flat}\wedge ) + (X^{\flat}\wedge)\circ\iota_X = \text{id} &lt;/math&gt; ( ''Projection rejection decomposition'' )

Given the boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial M&lt;/math&gt; with unit normal vector &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}:=\iota_N\circ (N^{\flat}\wedge )&lt;/math&gt; extracts the ''tangential component'' of the boundary.

*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}:=(\text{id}-\mathbf{t})&lt;/math&gt; extracts the ''normal component'' of the boundary.

:&lt;math&gt;
\omega = d\alpha + \delta\beta + \gamma
&lt;/math&gt;

==== [[Poincaré lemma]] ====

If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has only one cohomology class &lt;math&gt;H^k(M)=\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; and no boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial M=\empty&lt;/math&gt;, then for any closed &lt;math&gt;\omega\in\Omega^k(M) \Rightarrow \exists \ \alpha\in\Omega^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; such that

The term '''fractal expressionism''' was coined by physicist-artist Richard Taylor and co-authors to distinguish fractal art generated directly by artists from fractal art generated using mathematics and/or computers.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.Taylor, A.P. Micolich and D. Jonas, Fractal Expressionism, Physics World, 25, October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Fractals are patterns that repeat at increasingly fine scales and are prevalent in natural scenery (examples include clouds, rivers, and mountains).&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, BB, The Fractal Geometry of Nature, WH Freedman, New York, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Fractal expressionism implies a direct expression of nature's patterns in an art work.

== Jackson Pollock's poured paintings ==

The initial studies of fractal expressionism focused on the poured paintings by the American artist [[Jackson Pollock]] (1912-1956), whose work has traditionally been associated with the [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist movement]].&lt;ref name="taylor1999nature"&gt;[Taylor, Richard P., Adam P. Micolich, and David Jonas. "Fractal Analysis of Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 399.6735 (1999): 422. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor1999physicsworld"&gt;["Fractals Determine Date of Paintings." Physics World 04 June 1999: n. pag. Web. &lt;http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/1999/jun/04/fractals-determine-date-of-paintings&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Richard P., Adam P. Micolich, and David Jonas. "Fractal Analysis of Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 399.6735 (1999): 422. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock’s patterns had previously been referred to as “natural” and “organic”, inviting speculation by author John Briggs in 1992 that Pollock's work featured fractals.&lt;ref&gt;John Briggs, Fractals, Touchstone Publishers, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Taylor built a pendulum device called the Pollockizer which painted fractal patterns bearing a similarity to Pollock’s work.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.Taylor, A.P. Micolich and D. Jonas, Fractal Expressionism, Physics World, 25, October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Computer analysis of Pollock's work published by Taylor et al.  in a 1999 Nature article found that Pollock's painted patterns have characteristics that match those displayed by nature's fractals (specifically, they demonstrate a statistical [[self-similarity]] quantified by a non-integer dimension over a magnification range of 1.5-2 orders of magnitude).  This analysis supported clues (see below) that Pollock's patterns are fractal and reflect "the fingerprint of nature".&lt;ref name="taylor1999nature" /&gt;

Taylor noted several similarities between Pollock's painting style and the processes used by nature to construct its landscapes.  For instance, he cites Pollock's propensity to revisit paintings that he had not adjusted in several weeks as being comparable to cyclic processes in nature, such as the seasons or the tides.&lt;ref name="artbook"&gt;[Taylor, Richard. "Fractal Expressionism—Where Art Meets Science." Art and Complexity. Ed. John Casti and Anders Karlqvist. 1st ed. Greenwich: JAI, 2003. 117-44. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Taylor observed several visual similarities between the patterns produced by nature and those produced by Pollock as he painted.  He points out that Pollock abandoned the use of a traditional frame for his paintings, preferring instead to roll out his canvas on the floor; this, Taylor asserts, is more compatible with how nature works than traditional painting techniques because the patterns in nature's scenery are not artificially bounded.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;

The perceived similarities between the processes and patterns involved in Pollock's paintings and those of nature compelled Taylor to posit that the same "basic trademark" of nature's pattern construction also appears in Pollock's work.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;  Since some natural fractals are generated by a process known as "chaos",&lt;ref name="chaosbook"&gt;[Cvitanovic´, Predrag, Roberto Artuso, Ronnie Mainieri, and Gábor Vattay. Chaos: Classical and Quantum. Copenhagen: Niels Bohr Institute, 2016. ChaosBook.org. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt; including fractals in human physiology,&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Bassingthwaighte et al, Fractal Physiology, Oxford University press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor believed that Pollock's painting process might also have been chaotic, and could therefore leave behind a fractal pattern.  Taylor's hypothesis seems to be reflected in Pollock's statement "I am nature", which he made when asked if nature was a source of inspiration for his work.&lt;ref name="krasner"&gt;Krasner, Lee. "Lee Krasner Oral History." Interview by Dorothy Seckler. Archives of American Art. Smithsonian, 19 May 2005. Web. 30 Dec. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Pollock is also quoted as stating "No chaos, damn it",  in response to a Time magazine article that referred to his paintings as "chaotic".&lt;ref name="nochaos"&gt;[Karmel, Pepe, ed. Jackson Pollock: Key Interviews, Articles and Reviews. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;   However, chaos theory was not understood until after Pollock's death, so he could not have been referring to the chaotic systems in nature but rather its common usage to mean disorder. In the famous film footage of [[Hans Namuth]],&lt;ref name="[https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/jackson-pollock-paintings-have-a-life-of-their-own/ sfmoma]"&gt;[Jackson Pollock: Paintings Have a Life of Their Own. Perf. Jackson Pollock. SFMOMA. SFMOMA, n.d. Web. &lt;https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/jackson-pollock-paintings-have-a-life-of-their-own/&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock says his paintings are no accident, and that he was able to control the flow of paint onto the canvas.

Taylor points to two aspects of Pollock's painting process that have the potential to introduce fractal patterns. The first is Pollock's motion as he moved around the canvas, which Taylor hypothesized followed a Levy flight, a type of chaotic motion that is known to leave behind a fractal pattern.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mandelbrot"&gt;[Mandelbrot, Benoit B. The Fractal Geometry of Nature. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1982. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, a number of studies have shown that the motions associated with human balance have fractal characteristics. The second source of chaos could be introduced through Pollock's pouring technique.  Falling fluid has the capability of changing from a non-chaotic to a chaotic flow, meaning that Pollock could have introduced a chaotic flow of paint as he dripped it onto the canvas.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt; Although the fractal characteristics of human balance and falling liquid are generated on Pollock's painting time and length scales, physicist [[Predrag Cvitanovic]] notes that it would be quite an artistic challenge to control them: such parameters "are in no sense observable and measurable on the length-scales and time-scales dominated by chaotic dynamics".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Since Taylor's initial Pollock analysis in 1999, more than ten research groups have used various forms of fractal analysis to successfully quantify Pollock’s work.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Mureika, C.C.

Lee, S 2007"/&gt; Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot (who invented the term fractal) and art theorist Francis O’Connor (the chief Pollock scholar) are well known advocates of fractal expressionism.&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"&gt;J. Rehmeyer, “Fractal or Fake?”, ScienceNews, vol. 171, 122-123, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see o'conner's website&lt;/ref&gt;

== The relationship between fractal expressionism and fractal fluency ==

Fractal expressionism is related to fractal fluency&lt;ref&gt;23 Taylor, RP, and Spehar B, Fractal Fleuncy: An Intimate Relationship Between the Brain and Processing of Fractal Stimuli, In: The Fractal Geometry of the Brain. New York: Springer; 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; because the latter provides an appealing motivation for why artists such as Pollock might aspire to Fractal Expressionism.  Fractal fluency is a neuroscience model that proposes that, through exposure to nature’s fractal scenery, people’s visual systems have adapted to efficiently process fractals with ease. This adaptation occurs at many stages of the visual system, from the way people’s eyes move to which regions of the brain get activated. Fluency puts the viewer in a ‘comfort zone’ so inducing an aesthetic experience. Neuroscience experiments have shown that Pollock’s paintings induce the same positive physiological responses in the observer as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals.&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar 2011"&gt;R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar, P. Van Donkelaar and C.M. Hagerhall, “Perceptual and Physiological Responses to Jackson Pollock’s Fractals,” Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, vol. 5 1- 13 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of fractal fluency and the associated aesthetics, other artists might be expected to display fractal expressionism. One year before Taylor’s publication, mathematician Richard Voss quantified Chinese art using fractal analysis.&lt;ref name="R. Voss 1998"&gt;R. Voss, Fractal Image Encoding and Analysis, Springer, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other groups have used computer analysis to identify fractal content in a number of Western and Eastern artists,&lt;ref name="C. Redies, J 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D.J. Field, 2008"/&gt; most recently in Pollock’s colleague Willem De Kooning’s work.&lt;ref&gt;A. Forsythe et al, Journal of Neurophysiology, vol. 31, 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above analyzed works, symbolic representations of fractals can be found in cultures across the continents spanning several centuries, including Roman, Egyptian, Aztec, Incan and Mayan civilizations. They frequently predate patterns named after the mathematicians who subsequently developed their visual characteristics. For example, although von Koch is famous for developing The Koch Curve in 1904, a similar shape featuring repeating triangles was first used to depict waves in friezes by Hellenic artists (300 B.C.E.). In the 13th century, repetition of triangles in Cosmati Mosaics generated a shape later known in mathematics as The Sierpinski Triangle (named after Sierpinski’s 1915 pattern). Triangular repetitions are also found in the 12th century pulpit of The Ravello Cathedral in Italy. The lavish artwork within The Book of Kells (circa 800 C.E.) and the sculpted arabesques in The Jain Dilwara Temple in Mount Abu, India (1031 C.E.) also both reveal stunning examples of exact fractals. The artistic works of Leonardo da Vinci and Katsushika Hokusai serve as more recent examples from Europe and Asia, each reproducing the recurring patterns that they saw in nature. Da Vinci’s sketch of turbulence in water, The Deluge (1571–1518), was composed of small swirls within larger swirls of water. In The Great Wave off Kanagawa (1830–1833), Hokusai portrayed a wave crashing on a shore with small waves on top of a large wave. Other woodcuts from the same period also feature repeating patterns at several size scales: The Ghost of Kohada Koheiji shows fissures in a skull and The Falls At Mt. Kurokami features branching channels in a waterfall.

== The use of fractals to authenticate art and the associated controversy ==

Voss's 1998 study of Chinese art was the first demonstration of using fractal analysis to distinguish between the works of different artists.&lt;ref name="R. Voss 1998"/&gt; Following Taylor's 1999 Pollock publication, Art conservator Jim Coddington proposed that fractal analysis should be explored as a technique to help authenticate Pollock paintings. In 2005, Taylor and colleagues published a fractal analysis of 14 authentic and 37 imitation Pollocks suggesting that, when combined with other techniques, fractal analysis might be useful for authenticating Pollock's work.&lt;ref&gt;R.P. Taylor et al, “Authenticating Pollock Paintings Using Fractal Geometry”, Pattern Recognition Letters, vol. 28, 695-702 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, The Pollock-Krasner Foundation requested a fractal analysis to be used for the first time in an authenticity dispute,&lt;ref&gt;A Abbott, Fractals and art: In the hands of a master, Nature 439, 648-650 (9 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis identified “significant deviations from Pollock’s characteristics.” Taylor cautioned that the results should be “coupled with other important information such as provenance, connoisseurship and materials analysis.” Two years later, materials scientists showed that pigments on the paintings dated from after Pollock’s death.
 
In 2006, the use of fractals to authenticate Pollocks stirred controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Jones-Smith et al, “Fractal Analysis: Revisiting Pollock’s Paintings”Nature, Brief Communication Arising, vol. 444, E9-10, (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor 2006"&gt;R.P. Taylor et al, “Fractal Analysis: Revisiting Pollock’s Paintings” Nature, Brief Communication Arising, vol. 444, E10-11, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"/&gt; This controversy was triggered by physicists Katherine Jones-Smith and Harsh Mathur who claimed that the fractal characteristics identified by Taylor et al. are also present in crude sketches made in [[Adobe Photoshop]],&lt;ref name="kate2006nature"&gt;[Jones-Smith, Katherine. "Revisiting Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 444.7119 (2006): E9-E10. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; and deliberately fraudulent poured paintings made by other artists&lt;ref name="kate2006nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="physrevE"&gt;[ Jones-Smith, Katherine, Harsh Mathur, and Lawrence M. Krauss. "Drip paintings and fractal analysis." Physical Review E 79.4 (2009): 046111. ]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to Jones-Smith and Mathur, labeling Pollock's paintings as "fractal" is meaningless, because the same characteristics are found in other non-fractal images. However, Taylor's rebuttal published in Nature&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor 2006"/&gt; showed that Taylor's group's fractal analysis could distinguish between Pollock paintings and the crude sketches, and identified further limitations in Jones-Smith and Mathur's analysis.

Jones-Smith and Mathur raised a valid concern applicable to all forms of fractal expressionism: are art works too small for the painted patterns to repeat over sufficient magnifications to assume the visual characteristics of fractals? In the case of Pollock paintings, the largest range used by Taylor et al. to determine each fractal parameter in a Pollock painting is less than two orders of magnitude in magnification. Nature's fractals repeat over limited magnification ranges (typically just over one order of magnitude), prompting scientists to debate what range is required to reliably establish fractal behavior.&lt;ref name="Ave/Man"&gt;[Avnir, David, Ofer Biham, Daniel M. Lidar, and Ofer Malcai. "Is the Geometry of Nature Fractal?" Science 279.5347 (1998): 39-40. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot refused to include a required magnification range in his definition of fractals and instead noted that it is the range necessary to generate the properties associated with fractal repetition. In the case of Pollock's work, this would be the magnification range necessary for the patterns to generate the fractal aesthetics. Neuroscience experiments have shown that this magnification range is less than two orders and that Pollock’s paintings do indeed induce the same physiological responses as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar 2011"/&gt; Mandelbrot concluded "I do believe that Pollocks are fractal."&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"/&gt;

At the time of the controversy, Coddington summarized as follows: “Fractal geometry has begun to play an important role in the authentication of the work of Jackson Pollock. We believe such analyses are necessary for pushing the field forward.”&lt;ref&gt;(J. Coddington et al, Proceedings SPIE, vol. 6810, 68100F 1-12, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent results, In 2015, by computer scientist Lior Shamir showed that, when combined with other pattern parameters, fractal analysis can be used to distinguish between real and imitation Pollocks with 93% accuracy. He found that the fractal parameters were the most powerful contributors to the detection accuracy&lt;ref&gt;L.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Galley_Method1.png|thumb|270px|16th century example of galley division]] --&gt;

In [[arithmetic]], the '''galley method''', also known as the '''batello''' or the '''scratch method''', was the most widely used method of [[division (mathematics)|division]] in use prior to 1600.  The names [[galea (boat)|galea]] and batello refer to a boat which the outline of the work was thought to resemble.

An earlier version of this method was used as early as 825 by [[Al-Khwarizmi]].  The galley method is thought to be of [[Arab]] origin and is most effective when used on a sand [[abacus]]. However, [[Lam Lay Yong]]'s research pointed out that the galley method of division originated in the 1st century AD in ancient China.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | title = On the Chinese Origin of the Galley Method of Arithmetical Division | journal = The British Journal for the History of Science | date = June 1966 | first = Lam | last = Lay-Yong | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 66–69 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0007087400000200 | accessdate = 2012-12-29 | doi=10.1017/s0007087400000200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The galley method writes fewer figures than [[long division]], and results in interesting shapes and pictures as it expands both above and below the initial lines.  It was the preferred method of division for seventeen centuries, far longer than long division's four centuries.

==How it works==
[[Image:Galley Method3.png|thumb|right|280px|65284/594 using galley division]]
[[Image:Galley Method4.png|thumb| right |180px|The completed problem]]
[[Image:Galley Method2.png|thumb|right|110px|65284/594 using "modern" long division for comparison]]
Set up the problem by writing the dividend and then a bar. The quotient will be written after the bar. Steps:
:(a1) Write the divisor below the dividend. Align the divisor so that its leftmost digit is directly below the dividend's leftmost digit (if the divisor is 594, for instance, it would be written an additional space to the right, so that the "5" would appear below the&amp;nbsp;"6", as shown in the illustration). 
:(a2) Dividing 652 by 594 yields the quotient 1 which is written to the right of the bar.
Now multiply each digit of the divisor by the new digit of the quotient and subtract that from the left-hand segment of the dividend. Where the subtrahend and the dividend segment differ, cross out the dividend digit and write if necessary the subtrahend digit and next vertical empty space. Cross out the divisor digit used.
:(b) Compute 6&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;5&amp;times;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. Cross out the 6 of the dividend and above it write a 1. Cross out the 5 of the divisor. The resulting dividend is now read off as the topmost un-crossed digits: 15284.
:(c) Using the left-hand segment of the resulting dividend we get 15&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;9&amp;times;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6. Cross out the 1 and 5 and write 6 above. Cross out the 9. The resulting dividend is 6284.
:(d) Compute 62&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;4&amp;times;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;58. Cross out the 6 and 2 and write 5 and 8 above. Cross out the 4. The resulting dividend is 5884.
:(e) Write the divisor one step to the right of where it was originally written using empty spaces below existing crossed out digits. 
:(f1) Dividing 588 by 594 yields 0 which is written as the new digit of the quotient. 
:(f2) As 0 times any digit of the divisor is 0, the dividend will remain unchanged. We therefore can cross out all the digits of the divisor.
:(f3) We write the divisor again one space to the right
:(omitted) Dividing 5884 by 594 yields 9 which is written as the new digit of the quotient. 58&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;5&amp;times;9&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;13 so cross out the 5 and 8 and above them write 1 and 3. Cross out the 5 of the divisor. The resulting divident is now 1384. 138&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;9&amp;times;9&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;57. Cross out 1,3, and 8 of the dividend and write 5 and 7 above. Cross out the 9 of the divisor. The resulting dividend is 574. 574&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;4&amp;times;9&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;538. Cross out the 7 and 4 of the dividend and write 3 and 8 above them. Cross out the 4 of the divisor. The resulting dividend is 538. The process is done, the quotient is 109 and the remainder is 538.

===Other versions===

The above is called the cross-out version and is the most common. An erasure version exists for situations where erasure is acceptable and there is not need to keep track of the intermediate steps. This is the method used with a sand abacus. Finally, there is a printers' method that uses neither erasure or crossouts. Only the top digit in each column of the dividend is active with a zero used to denote an entirely inactive column.

==Modern usage==
Galley division was the favorite method of division with arithmeticians through the 18th century and it is thought that it fell out of use due to the lack of cancelled types in printing. It is still taught in the [[Moorish]] schools of [[North Africa]] and other parts of the [[Middle East]].

[[File:AL Khwarizmi division.GIF|right|thumb|200px|825AD. Division algorithm described in Al-Khwarizmi's book (animated diagram showing the progression of working)]]

Lam Lay Yong, mathematics professor of [[National University of Singapore]], traced the origin of the galley method to the ''[[Sunzi Suanjing]]'' written about 400AD. The division described by [[Al-Khwarizmi]] in 825 was identical to the Sunzi algorithm for
division.&lt;ref&gt;Lam Lay Yong, The Development of Hindu-Arabic and Traditional Chinese Arithmetic , Chinese Science, 13 1996, 35&amp;ndash;54&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a number of concepts employ the word '''harmonic'''.  The similarity of this terminology to that of [[Harmonic|music]] is not accidental: the [[equations of motion]] of vibrating strings, drums and columns of air are given by formulas involving [[Laplacian]]s; the solutions to which are given by [[eigenvalue]]s corresponding to their modes of vibration.  Thus, the term "harmonic" is applied when one is considering [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] with [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] variations, or solutions of [[Laplace's equation]] and related concepts.

Design of robust and reliable networks and [[network service]]s relies on an understanding of the [[network traffic|traffic]] characteristics of the network. Throughout history, different models of network traffic have been developed and used for evaluating existing and proposed networks and services.

Demands on [[computer network]]s are not entirely predictable. Performance modeling is necessary for deciding the [[quality of service]] (QoS) level. Performance models in turn, require accurate [[traffic model]]s that have the ability to capture the statistical characteristics of the actual traffic on the network. Many traffic models have been developed based on traffic measurement data. If the underlying traffic models do not efficiently capture the characteristics of the actual traffic, the result may be the under-estimation or over-estimation of the performance of the network. This impairs the design of the network. Traffic models are hence, a core component of any performance evaluation of networks and they need to be very accurate.

“Teletraffic theory is the application of mathematics to the measurement, modeling, and control of traffic in [[telecommunications network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Mathematics Meets the Internet|publisher=AMS|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199808/paxson.pdf|author=Willinger and Paxson|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of traffic modeling is to find stochastic processes to represent the behavior of traffic. Working at the Copenhagen Telephone Company in the 1910s, [[A. K. Erlang]] famously characterized telephone traffic at the call level by certain probability distributions for arrivals of new calls and their holding times. Erlang applied the traffic models to estimate the telephone switch capacity needed to achieve a given call blocking probability. The Erlang blocking formulas had tremendous practical interest for public carriers because telephone facilities (switching and transmission) involved considerable investments. Over several decades, Erlang’s work stimulated the use of queuing theory, and applied probability in general, to engineer the public switched [[telephone network]]. Teletraffic theory for packet networks has seen considerable progress in recent decades.&lt;ref name=parkwill&gt;{{cite book | last1=Park | first1=Kihong | last2=Willinger|first2=Walter|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/047120644X.fmatter_indsub/pdf|title=Self-similar network traffic and performance evaluation | publisher=Wiley | publication-place=New York | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-471-31974-0 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adas&gt;{{cite journal | last=Adas | first=A. | title=Traffic models in broadband networks | journal=IEEE Communications Magazine | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=35 | issue=7 | year=1997 | issn=0163-6804 | doi=10.1109/35.601746 | pages=82–89 | ref=harv}}

==Network traffic models usage==
Measurements are useful and necessary for verifying the actual [[network performance]]. However, measurements do not have the level of abstraction that makes traffic models useful. Traffic models can be used for hypothetical problem solving whereas traffic measurements only reflect current reality. In probabilistic terms, a traffic trace is a realization of a [[random process]], whereas a traffic model is a random process. Thus, traffic models have universality. A traffic trace gives insight about a particular traffic source, but a traffic model gives insight about all traffic sources of that type. Traffic models have three major uses. One important use of traffic models is to properly dimension network resources for a target level of [[Quality of service|QoS]]. It was mentioned earlier that Erlang developed models of [[voice call]]s to estimate telephone switch capacity to achieve a target call blocking probability. Similarly, models of packet traffic are needed to estimate the bandwidth and buffer resources to provide acceptable packet delays and [[packet loss]] probability. Knowledge of the average traffic rate is not sufficient. It is known from [[queuing theory]] that queue lengths increase with the variability of traffic.&lt;ref name="Kleinrock1975"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kleinrock | first=Leonard | title=Queueing systems | publisher=Wiley | publication-place=New York | year=1975 | isbn=978-0-471-49110-1 | language=de | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, an understanding of traffic burstiness or variability is needed to determine sufficient buffer sizes at nodes and link capacities.&lt;ref name="Barakat Thiran Iannaccone Diot 2003 pp. 2111–2124"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barakat | first=C. | last2=Thiran | first2=P. | last3=Iannaccone | first3=G. | last4=Diot | first4=C. | last5=Owezarski | first5=P. | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.2.8066&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Modeling internet backbone traffic at the flow level | journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=51 | issue=8 | year=2003 | issn=1053-587X | doi=10.1109/tsp.2003.814521 | pages=2111–2124}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second important use of traffic models is to verify network performance under specific traffic controls. For example, given a packet scheduling algorithm, it would be possible to evaluate the network performance resulting from different traffic scenarios. For another example, a popular area of research is new improvements to the TCP congestion avoidance algorithm. It is critical that any algorithm is stable and allows multiple hosts to share bandwidth fairly, while sustaining a high throughput. Effective evaluation of the stability, fairness, and throughput of new algorithms would not be possible without realistic source models. A third important use of traffic models is admission control. In particular, connection oriented networks such as ATM depends on admission control to block new connections to maintain QOS guarantees. A simple admission strategy could be based on the peak rate of a new connection; a new connection is admitted if the available bandwidth is greater than the peak rate. However, that strategy would be overly conservative because a variable bit-rate connection may need significantly less bandwidth than its peak rate. A more sophisticated admission strategy is based on effective bandwidths.&lt;ref name="Statistical Laboratory"&gt;{{cite web | title=Notes on effective bandwidths | website=Statistical Laboratory | url=http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~frank/eb.html | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source traffic behavior is translated into an effective bandwidth between the peak rate and average rate, which is the specific amount of bandwidth required to meet a given QoS constraint. The effective bandwidth depends on the variability of the source.&lt;ref name=chen2007/&gt;

==Network traffic models steps==
Traffic modeling consists of three steps:
* (i) selection of one or more models that may provide a good description of the traffic type
* (ii) estimation of parameters for the selected models
* (iii) statistical testing for election of one of the considered models and analysis of its suitability to describe the traffic type under analysis.
Parameter estimation is based on a set of statistics (e.g. mean, variance, density function or auto covariance function, multifractal characteristics) that are measured or calculated from observed data. The set of statistics used in the inference process depends on the impact they may have in the main performance metrics of interest.&lt;ref name=nogueira&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nogueira | first=António | last2=Salvador | first2=Paulo | last3=Valadas | first3=Rui | last4=Pacheco | first4=António | journal=Telecommunication Systems | title=Modeling Network Traffic with Multifractal Behavior|publisher=Springer Nature | volume=24 | issue=2/4 | year=2003 | issn=1018-4864 | doi=10.1023/a:1026183318200 | pages=339–362 | ref=harv|url=
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7c27/a4732bc89057878b7bbf0db8772d2b13d6bd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network traffic models parameter==
In recent years several types of traffic behavior, that can have significant impact on network performance, were discovered: long-range dependence, [[self-similarity]] and, more recently, multifractality.
There are two major parameters generated by network traffic models: packet length distributions and packet inter-arrival distributions. Other parameters, such as routes, distribution of destinations, etc., are of less importance. Simulations that use traces generated by network traffic models usually examine a single node in the network, such as a router or switch; factors that depend on specific network topologies or routing information are specific to those topologies and simulations.&lt;ref name=arrowsmith&gt;{{cite web|author=D.K. Arrowsmith, R.J. Mondragon|title=Modelling Network Data Traffic|location=Queen Mary, University of London|url=http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~arrow/BrisComp06.pdf|year=2006| access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of packet size distribution is fairly well-understood today. Existing models of packet sizes have proven to be valid and simple. Most packet size models do not consider the problem of order in packet sizes. For example, a TCP datagram in one direction is likely to be followed by a tiny ACK in the other direction about half of one Round-Trip Time (RTT) later. The problem of packet inter-arrival distribution is much more difficult. Understanding of network traffic has evolved significantly over the years, leading to a series of evolutions in network traffic models.

==Self-similar traffic models==
One of the earliest objections to self-similar traffic models was the difficulty in mathematical analysis. Existing self-similar models could not be used in conventional queuing models. This limitation was rapidly overturned and workable models were constructed. Once basic self-similar models became feasible, the traffic modeling community settled into the “detail” concerns. TCP’s congestion control algorithm complicated the matter of modeling traffic, so solutions needed to be created. Parameter estimation of self-similar models was always difficult, and recent research addresses ways to model network traffic without fully understanding it.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;

* [[Fractional Brownian motion]]:
When self-similar traffic models were first introduced, there were no efficient, analytically tractable processes to generate the models. [[Ilkka Norros]] devised a stochastic process for a storage model with self-similar input and constant bit-rate output. While this initial model was continuous rather than discrete, the model was effective, simple, and attractive.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
* SWING:
All self-similar traffic models suffer from one significant drawback: estimating the self-similarity parameters from real network traffic requires huge amounts of data and takes extended computation. The most modern method, wavelet multi-resolution analysis, is more efficient, but still very costly. This is undesirable in a traffic model. SWING uses a surprisingly simple model for the network traffic analysis and generation. The model examines characteristics of users, Request-Response Exchanges (RREs), connections, individual packets, and the overall network. No attempt is made to analyze self-similarity characteristics; any self-similarity in the generated traffic comes naturally from the aggregation of many ON/OFF sources.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web | last=Wilson | first=Michael L. | title=A Historical View of Network Traffic Models | website=wustl.edu |year=2006| url=https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-06/ftp/traffic_models2/ | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pareto distribution]] process:
The Pareto distribution process produces independent and identically distributed (IID) inter-arrival times. In general if X is a random variable with a Pareto distribution, then the probability that X is greater than some number x is given by P(X &gt; x) = (x/x_m)-k for all x ≥ x_m where k is a positive parameter and x_m is the minimum possible value of Xi The probability distribution and the density functions are represented as:
F(t) = 1 – (α/t)β where α,β ≥ 0 &amp; t ≥ α
f(t) = βαβ t-β-1
The parameters β and α are the shape and location parameters, respectively. The Pareto distribution is applied to model self-similar arrival in packet traffic. It is also referred to as double exponential, power law distribution. Other important characteristics of the model are that the Pareto distribution has infinite variance, when β ≥ 2 and achieves infinite mean, when β ≤ 1.
* [[Weibull distribution]] process:
The Weibull distributed process is heavy-tailed and can model the fixed rate in ON period and ON/OFF period lengths, when producing self-similar traffic by multiplexing ON/OFF sources. The distribution function in this case is given by:
F(t) = 1 – e-(t/β)α t &gt; 0
and the density function of the weibull distribution is given as:
f(t) = αβ-α tα-1 e -(t/β)α t &gt; 0
where parameters β ≥ 0 and α &gt; 0 are the scale and location parameters respectively.
The Weibull distribution is close to a normal distribution. For β ≤ 1 the density function of the distribution is L shaped and for values of β &gt; 1, it is bell shaped. This distribution gives a failure rate increasing with time. For β &gt; 1, the failure rate decreases with time. At, β = 1, the failure rate is constant and the lifetimes are exponentially distributed.
* [[Autoregressive model]]s:
The Autoregressive model is one of a group of linear prediction formulas that attempt to predict an output y_n of a system based on previous set of outputs {y_k} where k &lt; n and inputs x_n and {x_k} where k &lt; n. There exist minor changes in the way the predictions are computed based on which, several variations of the model are developed. Basically, when the model depends only on the previous outputs of the system, it is referred to as an auto-regressive model. It is referred to as a Moving Average Model (MAM), if it depends on only the inputs to the system. Finally, Autoregressive-Moving Average models are those that depend both on the inputs and the outputs, for prediction of current output. Autoregressive model of order p, denoted as AR(p), has the following form:
Xt = R1 Xt-1 + R2 Xt-2 + ... + Rp Xt-p + Wt
where Wt is the white noise, Ri are real numbers and Xt are prescribed correlated random numbers. The auto-correlation function of the AR(p) process consists of damped sine waves depending on whether the roots (solutions) of the model are real or imaginary. Discrete Autoregressive Model of order p, denoted as DAR(p), generates a stationary sequence of discrete random variables with a probability distribution and with an auto-correlation structure similar to that of the Autoregressive model of order p.[3]
* [[Regression model]]s:
Regression models define explicitly the next random variable in the sequence by previous ones within a specified time window and a moving average of a white noise.[5]
* [[TES model]]s :
Transform-expand-sample (TES) models are non-linear regression models with modulo-1 arithmetic. They aim to capture both auto-correlation and marginal distribution of empirical data. TES models consist of two major TES processes: TES+ and TES–. TES+ produces a sequence which has positive correlation at lag 1, while TES– produces a negative correlation at lag 1.&lt;ref name="Jelenkovic1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jelenkovic | first=P.R. | last2=Melamed | first2=B. | title=Algorithmic modeling of TES processes | journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=40 | issue=7 | year=1995 | issn=0018-9286 | doi=10.1109/9.400470 | pages=1305–1312|url=http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~predrag/mypub/TES95.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-self-similar traffic models==
Early traffic models were derived from telecommunications models and focused on simplicity of analysis. They generally operated under the assumption that aggregating traffic from a large number of sources tended to smooth out bursts; that burstiness decreased as the number of traffic sources increased.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
* [[Poisson distribution]] model:
One of the most widely used and oldest traffic models is the Poisson Model. The memoryless Poisson distribution is the predominant model used for analyzing traffic in traditional telephony networks. The Poisson process is characterized as a renewal process. In a Poisson process the inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed with a rate parameter λ: P{An ≤ t} = 1 – exp(-λt). The Poisson distribution is appropriate if the arrivals are from a large number of independent sources, referred to as Poisson sources. The distribution has a mean and variance equal to the parameter λ.
The Poisson distribution can be visualized as a limiting form of the binomial distribution, and is also used widely in queuing models. There are a number of interesting mathematical properties exhibited by Poisson processes. Primarily, superposition of independent Poisson processes results in a new Poisson process whose rate is the sum of the rates of the independent Poisson processes. Further, the independent increment property renders a Poisson process memoryless. Poisson processes are common in traffic applications scenarios that consist of a large number of independent traffic streams. The reason behind the usage stems from Palm's Theorem which states that under suitable conditions, such large number of independent multiplexed streams approach a Poisson process as the number of processes grows, but the individual rates decrease in order to keep the aggregate rate constant. Nevertheless, it is to be noted that traffic aggregation need not always result in a Poisson process. The two primary assumptions that the Poisson model makes are:&lt;ref name=chandra&gt;{{cite web | last=Chandrasekaran | first=Balakrishnan | title=Survey of Network Traffic Models | website=Washington University in St. Louis - Computer Science &amp; Engineering at WashU | date=2006-11-27 | url=http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-06/ftp/traffic_models3/index.html | ref=harv | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1. The number of sources is infinite
2. The traffic arrival pattern is random.
* [[Compound Poisson process|Compound Poisson traffic models]]:
In the compound Poisson model, the base Poisson model is extended to deliver batches of packets at once. The inter-batch arrival times are exponentially distributed, while the batch size is geometric Mathematically, this model has two parameters, λ, the arrival rate, and ρ in (0,1), the batch parameter. Thus, the mean number of packets in a batch is 1/ ρ, while the mean inter-batch arrival time is 1/ λ. Mean packet arrivals over time period t are tλ/ ρ.
The compound Poisson model shares some of the analytical benefits of the pure Poisson model: the model is still memoryless, aggregation of streams is still (compound) Poisson, and the steady-state equation is still reasonably simple to calculate, although varying batch parameters for differing flows would complicate the derivation.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;
* [[Markov model|Markov]] and Embedded Markov Models:
Markov models attempt to model the activities of a traffic source on a network, by a finite number of states. The accuracy of the model increases linearly with the number of states used in the model. However, the complexity of the model also increases proportionally with increasing number of states. An important aspect of the Markov model - the Markov Property, states that the next (future) state depends only on the current state. In other words, the probability of the next state, denoted by some random variable Xn+1, depends only on the current state, indicated by Xn, and not on any other state Xi, where i&lt;n. The set of random variables referring to different states {Xn} is referred to as a Discrete Markov Chain.
* [[Packet train]]s:
Another attempt at providing a bursty traffic model is found in Jain and Routhier’s Packet Trains model.&lt;ref name="Jain Routhier 1986 pp. 986–995"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jain | first=R. | last2=Routhier | first2=S. | title=Packet Trains--Measurements and a New Model for Computer Network Traffic | journal=IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | volume=4 | issue=6 | year=1986 | issn=0733-8716 | doi=10.1109/jsac.1986.1146410 | pages=986–995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was principally designed to recognize that address locality applies to routing decisions; that is, packets that arrive near each other in time are frequently going to the same destination. In generating a traffic model that allows for easier analysis of locality, the authors created the notion of packet trains, a sequence of packets from the same source, traveling to the same destination (with replies in the opposite direction). Packet trains are optionally sub-divided into tandem trailers. Traffic between a source and a destination usually consists of a series of messages back and forth. Thus, a series of packets go one direction, followed by one or more reply packets, followed by a new series in the initial direction. Traffic quantity is then a superposition of packet trains, which generates substantial bursty behavior. This refines the general conception of the compound Poisson model, which recognized that packets arrived in groups, by analyzing why they arrive in groups, and better characterizing the attributes of the group. Finally, the authors demonstrate that packet arrival times are not Poisson distributed, which led to a model that departs from variations on the Poisson theme. The packet train model is characterized by the following parameters and their associated probability distributions:
*mean inter-train arrival time
*mean inter-car arrival time
*mean truck size (in the tandem trailer model)
*mean train size.
The train model is designed for analyzing and categorizing real traffic, not for generating synthetic loads for simulation. Thus, little claim has been made about the feasibility of packet trains for generating synthetic traffic. Given accurate parameters and distributions, generation should be straightforward, but derivation of these parameters is not addressed.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;

==Traffic models today==
[[NS-2]] is a popular network simulator;&lt;ref name="ns and nam Sourceforge home 2010"&gt;{{cite web | title=nsnam | website=ns and nam Sourceforge home | date=2010-04-05 | url=http://nsnam.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page | access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; PackMimeHTTP is a web traffic generator for NS-2, published in 2004. It does take long-range dependencies into account, and uses the [[Weibull distribution]]. Thus, it relies on [[Long tail|heavy tails]] to emulate true [[self-similarity]]. Over most time scales, the effort is a success; only a long-running simulation would allow a distinction to be drawn. This follows suggestions from where it is suggested that self-similar processes can be represented as a superposition of many sources each individually modeled with a heavy-tailed distribution. It is clear that self-similar traffic models are in the mainstream.&lt;ref name=chandra/&gt;

[[File:Infinite.svg|thumb|200px|right|The [[infinity symbol]]]]
'''Infinity''' (symbol: {{math|∞|size=150%}}) is a concept describing something without any bound or larger than any [[natural number]]. Philosophers have speculated about the nature of the infinite, for example [[Zeno of Elea]], who proposed many [[paradox]]es involving infinity, and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], who used the idea of infinitely small quantities in his [[method of exhaustion]]. Modern mathematics uses the general concept of infinity in the solution of many practical and theoretical problems, such as in [[calculus]] and [[set theory]], and the idea is also used in [[physics]] and the other sciences.

In mathematics, "infinity" is often treated as a [[number]] (i.e., it counts or measures things: "an infinite number of terms") but it is not the same sort of number as either a [[natural number|natural]] or a [[real number|real]] number.

[[Georg Cantor]] formalized many ideas related to infinity and [[infinite set]]s during the late&amp;nbsp;19th and early 20th&amp;nbsp;centuries. In the theory he developed, there are infinite sets of different sizes (called [[cardinality|cardinalities]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the set of [[integer]]s is [[Countable set|countably infinite]], while the infinite set of real numbers is [[Uncountable set|uncountable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maddox|2002|loc=pp. 113 –117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Infinity (philosophy)}}
Ancient cultures had various ideas about the nature of infinity. The [[Maurya Empire|ancient Indians]] and [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] did not define infinity in precise formalism as does modern mathematics, and instead approached infinity as a philosophical concept.

===Early Greek===
The earliest recorded idea of infinity comes from [[Anaximander]], a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek philosopher who lived in [[Miletus]]. He used the word [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]] which means infinite or limitless.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wallace|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the earliest attestable accounts of mathematical infinity come from [[Zeno of Elea]] (born {{circa|490 BCE}}), a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek philosopher of southern Italy and member of the [[Eleatics|Eleatic]] School founded by [[Parmenides]]. [[Aristotle]] called him the inventor of the [[dialectic]].&lt;ref name="Zeno's paradoxes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/ |title=Zeno's Paradoxes | author= |date=October 15, 2010 |website=Stanford University |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zeno-elea/|title=Zeno of Elea| author= |date=January 5, 2017 |website=Stanford University |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]],&lt;ref name="Zeno's paradoxes" /&gt; described by [[Bertrand Russell]] as "immeasurably subtle and profound".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the traditional view of Aristotle, the [[Hellenistic]] Greeks generally preferred to distinguish the potential infinity from the [[actual infinity]]; for example, instead of saying that there are an infinity of primes, [[Euclid]] prefers instead to say that there are more prime numbers than contained in any given collection of [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Euclid. [[Euclid's Elements]], Book&amp;nbsp;IX, Proposition&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent readings of the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] have found that [[Archimedes]] had an understanding about actual infinite quantities. According to ''Nonlinear Dynamic Systems and Controls'', Archimedes has been found to be "the first to rigorously address the science of infinity with infinitely large sets using precise mathematical proofs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wassim M. Haddad|author2=VijaySekhar Chellaboina|title=Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Control: A Lyapunov-Based Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8rRb33X-E8C&amp;pg=PAxxv|date=February 17, 2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-13329-8|page=xxv|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404054122/https://books.google.com/books?id=F8rRb33X-E8C&amp;pg=PAxxv|archivedate=April 4, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Indian===
The [[Indian mathematics|Jain mathematical]] text [[Sūryaprajapti|Surya Prajnapti]] (c. 4th–3rd century BCE) classifies all numbers into three sets: [[enumerable]], innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Stewart|title=Infinity: a Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iewwDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|date=March 23, 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-875523-4|page=117|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403200429/https://books.google.com/books?id=iewwDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|archivedate=April 3, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Enumerable: lowest, intermediate, and highest
* Innumerable: nearly innumerable, truly innumerable, and innumerably innumerable
* Infinite: nearly infinite, truly infinite, infinitely infinite

In this work, two basic types of infinite numbers are distinguished. On both physical and [[Ontology|ontological]] grounds, a distinction was made between [[Asaṃkhyeya|{{IAST|''asaṃkhyāta''}}]] ("countless, innumerable") and ''[[Ananta (infinite)|ananta]]'' ("endless, unlimited"), between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded infinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dutta|first1=Bidyarthi|title=Ranganathan's elucidation of subject in the light of 'Infinity (∞)'|journal=Annals of Library and Information Studies|date=December 2015|volume=62 |pages=255–264 |url=http://op.niscair.res.in/index.php/ALIS/article/view/11415/0|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
European mathematicians started using infinite numbers and expressions in a systematic fashion in the 17th century. In 1655 [[John Wallis]] first used the notation &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; for such a number in his ''De sectionibus conicis'' and exploited it in area calculations by dividing the region into [[infinitesimal]] strips of width on the order of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\infty}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1993|loc=Sec. 421, Vol. II, pg. 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in ''Arithmetica infinitorum'' (1655 also) he indicates infinite series, infinite products and infinite continued fractions by writing down a few terms or factors and then appending "&amp;c." For example, "1, 6, 12, 18, 24, &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1993|loc=Sec. 435, Vol. II, pg. 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1699 [[Isaac Newton]] wrote about equations with an infinite number of terms in his work ''[[De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics 1640-1940 |first1=Ivor |last1=Grattan-Guinness |publisher=Elsevier |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-08-045744-4 |page=62 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603085825/https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC |archivedate=2016-06-03 |df= }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC&amp;pg=PA62 Extract of page 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calculus===

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], one of the co-inventors of [[infinitesimal calculus]], speculated widely about infinite numbers and their use in mathematics. To Leibniz, both infinitesimals and infinite quantities were ideal entities, not of the same nature as appreciable quantities, but enjoying the same properties in accordance with the [[Law of Continuity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=continuity |title=Continuity and Infinitesimals |last=Bell |first=John Lane |author-link=John Lane Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Real analysis====

In [[real analysis]], the symbol &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, called "infinity", is used to denote an unbounded [[limit of a function|limit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1955|loc=p. 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notation &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that&amp;nbsp;''x'' grows without bound, and &lt;math&gt;x \to -\infty&lt;/math&gt; means that &amp;nbsp;''x'' decreases without bound. If ''f''(''t'') ≥ 0 for every&amp;nbsp;''t'', then&lt;ref&gt;These uses of infinity for integrals and series can be found in any standard calculus text, such as, {{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|pp=468–510}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f(t)\, dt = \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that ''f''(''t'') does not bound a finite area from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)\, dt = \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that the area under ''f''(''t'') is infinite.
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)\, dt = a&lt;/math&gt; means that the total area under ''f''(''t'') is finite, and equals &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;

Infinity is also used to describe [[infinite series]]:
* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f(i) = a&lt;/math&gt; means that the sum of the infinite series [[convergent series|converges]] to some real value &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f(i) = \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that the sum of the infinite series [[divergent series|diverges]] in the specific sense that the partial sums grow without bound.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Infinity can be used not only to define a limit but as a value in the extended real number system. Points labeled &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; can be added to the [[topological space]] of the real numbers, producing the two-point [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of the real numbers. Adding algebraic properties to this gives us the [[extended real number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; We can also treat &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; as the same, leading to the one-point compactification of the real numbers, which is the [[real projective line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gemignani|1990|loc=p. 177}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Projective geometry]] also refers to a [[line at infinity]] in plane geometry, a [[plane at infinity]] in three-dimensional space, and a [[hyperplane at infinity]] for general [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensions]], each consisting of [[Point at infinity|points at infinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Albrecht|last1=Beutelspacher|first2=Ute|last2=Rosenbaum|title=Projective Geometry / from foundations to applications|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48364-3|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complex analysis====
[[File:Riemann sphere1.svg|thumb|right|250px|By [[stereographic projection]], the complex plane can be "wrapped" onto a sphere, with the top point of the sphere corresponding to infinity. This is called the [[Riemann sphere]].]]

In [[complex analysis]] the symbol &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, called "infinity", denotes an unsigned infinite [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]]. &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that the magnitude&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt; of&amp;nbsp;''x'' grows beyond any assigned value. A [[point at infinity|point labeled &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;]] can be added to the complex plane as a [[topological space]] giving the one-point [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of the complex plane. When this is done, the resulting space is a one-dimensional [[complex manifold]], or [[Riemann surface]], called the extended complex plane or the [[Riemann sphere]]. Arithmetic operations similar to those given above for the extended real numbers can also be defined, though there is no distinction in the signs (therefore one exception is that infinity cannot be added to itself). On the other hand, this kind of infinity enables division by zero, namely &lt;math&gt;z/0 = \infty&lt;/math&gt; for any nonzero complex number&amp;nbsp;''z''. In this context it is often useful to consider [[meromorphic function]]s as maps into the Riemann sphere taking the value of &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; at the poles. The domain of a complex-valued function may be extended to include the point at infinity as well. One important example of such functions is the group of [[Möbius transformation]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Nonstandard analysis===
[[File:Números hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (ε) and infinites (ω) on the hyperreal number line (1/ε = ω/1)]]

The original formulation of [[infinitesimal calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] used [[infinitesimal]] quantities. In the twentieth century, it was shown that this treatment could be put on a rigorous footing through various [[logical system]]s, including [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]] and [[nonstandard analysis]]. In the latter, infinitesimals are invertible, and their inverses are infinite numbers. The infinities in this sense are part of a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal field]]; there is no equivalence between them as with the Cantorian [[transfinite number|transfinites]]. For example, if&amp;nbsp;H is an infinite number, then H&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;H&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2H and H&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 are distinct infinite numbers. This approach to [[non-standard calculus]] is fully developed in {{harvtxt|Keisler|1986}}.

===Set theory===
{{Main|Cardinality|Ordinal number}}

[[File:Infinity paradoxon - one-to-one correspondence between infinite set and proper subset.gif|thumb|One-to-one correspondence between infinite set and proper subset]]

A different form of "infinity" are the [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] and [[cardinal number|cardinal]] infinities of set theory. [[Georg Cantor]] developed a system of [[transfinite number]]s, in which the first transfinite cardinal is [[aleph-null]] (&lt;span style="font-family:'Cambria Math';"&gt;&lt;big&gt;ℵ&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--&lt;math&gt;(\aleph_0)&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;), the cardinality of the set of [[natural number]]s. This modern mathematical conception of the quantitative infinite developed in the late nineteenth century from work by Cantor, [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Richard Dedekind]] and others, using the idea of collections, or sets.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Dedekind's approach was essentially to adopt the idea of [[one-to-one correspondence]] as a standard for comparing the size of sets, and to reject the view of Galileo (which derived from [[Euclid]]) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part (however, see [[Galileo's paradox]] where he concludes that positive integers which are squares and all positive integers are the same size). An infinite set can simply be defined as one having the same size as at least one of its [[proper subset|proper]] parts; this notion of infinity is called [[Dedekind infinite]]. The diagram gives an example: viewing lines as infinite sets of points, the left half of the lower blue line can be mapped in a one-to-one manner (green correspondences) to the higher blue line, and, in turn, to the whole lower blue line (red correspondences); therefore the whole lower blue line and its left half have the same cardinality, i.e. "size".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Cantor defined two kinds of infinite numbers: ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers. Ordinal numbers may be identified with [[well-ordered]] sets, or counting carried on to any stopping point, including points after an infinite number have already been counted. Generalizing finite and the ordinary infinite [[sequence]]s which are maps from the positive [[integers]] leads to [[Map (mathematics)|mappings]] from ordinal numbers, and transfinite sequences. Cardinal numbers define the size of sets, meaning how many members they contain, and can be standardized by choosing the first ordinal number of a certain size to represent the cardinal number of that size. The smallest ordinal infinity is that of the positive integers, and any set which has the cardinality of the integers is [[countable set|countably infinite]]. If a set is too large to be put in one to one correspondence with the positive integers, it is called ''uncountable''. Cantor's views prevailed and modern mathematics accepts actual infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2014}}  Certain extended number systems, such as the [[hyperreal number]]s, incorporate the ordinary (finite) numbers and infinite numbers of different sizes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Cardinality of the continuum====
{{Main|Cardinality of the continuum}}

One of Cantor's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf c&lt;/math&gt; is greater than that of the natural numbers &lt;math&gt;{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;; that is, there are more real numbers '''R''' than natural numbers '''N'''. Namely, Cantor showed that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = 2^{\aleph_0} &gt; {\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] or [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Dauben

The [[continuum hypothesis]] states that there is no [[cardinal number]] between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = \aleph_1 = \beth_1 &lt;/math&gt;  (see [[Beth number#Beth one|Beth one]]).  This hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], even assuming the [[Axiom of Choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|1963|p=1143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cardinal arithmetic]] can be used to show not only that the number of points in a [[real number line]] is equal to the number of points in any [[line segment|segment]] of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any [[finite-dimensional]] space.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[File:Peanocurve.svg|thumb|The first three steps of a fractal construction whose limit is a [[space-filling curve]], showing that there are as many points in a one-dimensional line as in a two-dimensional square.]]
The first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] function, which provides a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] (−π/2, π/2) and&amp;nbsp;'''R''' (see also [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]). The second result was proved by Cantor in&amp;nbsp;1878, but only became intuitively apparent in&amp;nbsp;1890, when [[Giuseppe Peano]] introduced the [[space-filling curve]]s, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or [[cube]], or [[hypercube]], or finite-dimensional space. These curves can be used to define a one-to-one correspondence between the points on one side of a square and the points in the square.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sagan|1994|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry and topology===
{{Main|Dimension (vector space)}}

Infinite-[[dimension]]al spaces are widely used in [[geometry]] and [[topology]], particularly as [[classifying space]]s, such as [[Eilenberg−MacLane space]]s. Common examples are the infinite-dimensional [[complex projective space]] [[K(Z,2)]] and the infinite-dimensional [[real projective space]] K(Z/2Z,1).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Fractals===
The structure of a [[fractal]] object is reiterated in its magnifications. Fractals can be magnified indefinitely without losing their structure and becoming "smooth"; they have infinite perimeters—some with infinite, and others with finite surface areas. One such fractal curve with an infinite perimeter and finite surface area is the [[Koch snowflake]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Mathematics without infinity===
[[Leopold Kronecker]] was skeptical of the notion of infinity and how his fellow mathematicians were using it in the 1870s and 1880s. This skepticism was developed in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] called [[finitism]], an extreme form of mathematical philosophy in the general philosophical and mathematical schools of [[Mathematical constructivism|constructivism]] and [[intuitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kline|1972|pp=1197–1198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics==

In [[physics]], approximations of [[real number]]s are used for [[Continuum (theory)|continuous]] measurements and [[natural number]]s are used for [[countable|discrete]] measurements (i.e. counting). It is therefore assumed by physicists that no [[observable|measurable quantity]] could have an infinite value, {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} for instance by taking an infinite value in an [[extended real number line|extended real number]] system, or by requiring the counting of an infinite number of events. It is, for example, presumed impossible for any type of body to have infinite mass or infinite energy. Concepts of infinite things such as an infinite [[plane wave]] exist, but there are no experimental means to generate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doriclenses.com/administrer/upload/pdf/NOT_AXI_ENG_070212_doricl97_doricle_kvgwQP.pdf Doric Lenses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124011604/http://www.doriclenses.com/administrer/upload/pdf/NOT_AXI_ENG_070212_doricl97_doricle_kvgwQP.pdf |date=2013-01-24 }} – Application Note – Axicons – 2. Intensity Distribution. Retrieved 7 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical applications of physical infinity===
The practice of refusing infinite values for measurable quantities does not come from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or ideological motivations, but rather from more methodological and pragmatic motivations {{Disputed inline|date=November 2015}} {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}. One of the needs of any physical and scientific theory is to give usable formulas that correspond to or at least approximate reality. As an example, if any object of infinite gravitational mass were to exist, any usage of the formula to calculate the gravitational force would lead to an infinite result, which would be of no benefit since the result would be always the same regardless of the position and the mass of the other object. The formula would be useful neither to compute the force between two objects of finite mass nor to compute their motions. If an infinite mass object were to exist, any object of finite mass would be attracted with infinite force (and hence acceleration) by the infinite mass object, which is not what we can observe in reality. Sometimes infinite result of a physical quantity may mean that the theory being used to compute the result may be approaching the point where it fails. This may help to indicate the limitations of a theory.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

This point of view does not mean that infinity cannot be used in physics. For convenience's sake, calculations, equations, theories and approximations often use [[infinite series]], unbounded [[function (mathematics)|functions]], etc., and may involve infinite quantities. Physicists however require that the end result be physically meaningful. In [[quantum field theory]] infinities arise which need to be interpreted in such a way as to lead to a physically meaningful result, a process called [[renormalization]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

However, there are some theoretical circumstances where the end result is infinity. One example is the [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] in the description of [[black holes]]. Some solutions of the equations of the [[general theory of relativity]] allow for finite mass distributions of zero size, and thus infinite density. This is an example of what is called a [[mathematical singularity]], or a point where a physical theory breaks down. This does not necessarily mean that physical infinities exist; it may mean simply that the theory is incapable of describing the situation properly. Two other examples occur in inverse-square force laws of the gravitational force equation of [[Newtonian gravity]] and [[Coulomb's law]] of electrostatics. At&amp;nbsp;r=0 these equations evaluate to infinities.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Cosmology===
The first published proposal that the universe is infinite came from Thomas Digges in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;John Gribbin (2009), ''In Search of the Multiverse: Parallel Worlds, Hidden Dimensions, and the Ultimate Quest for the Frontiers of Reality'', {{isbn|9780470613528}}. p.&amp;nbsp;88&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later, in 1584, the Italian philosopher and astronomer [[Giordano Bruno]] proposed an unbounded universe in ''On the Infinite Universe and Worlds'': "Innumerable suns exist; innumerable earths revolve around these suns in a manner similar to the way the seven planets revolve around our sun. Living beings inhabit these worlds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alien Life Imagined: Communicating the Science and Culture of Astrobiology |edition=illustrated |first1=Mark |last1=Brake |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-521-49129-7 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWGqzfL0snEC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=sWGqzfL0snEC&amp;pg=PA63 Extract of page 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cosmology|Cosmologists]] have long sought to discover whether infinity exists in our physical [[universe]]: Are there an infinite number of stars? Does the universe have infinite volume? Does space [[Shape of the universe|"go on forever"]]? This is an open question of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. The question of being infinite is logically separate from the question of having boundaries. The two-dimensional surface of the Earth, for example, is finite, yet has no edge. By travelling in a straight line with respect to the Earth's curvature one will eventually return to the exact spot one started from. The universe, at least in principle, might have a similar [[topology]]. If so, one might eventually return to one's starting point after travelling in a straight line through the universe for long enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Quest of the Universe |edition=illustrated |first1=Theo |last1=Koupelis |first2=Karl F. |last2=Kuhn |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7637-4387-1 |page=553 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6rTttN4ZdyoC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=6rTttN4ZdyoC&amp;pg=PA553 Extract of page 553]&lt;/ref&gt;

The curvature of the universe can be measured through [[multipole moments]] in the spectrum of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic background radiation]]. As to date, analysis of the radiation patterns recorded by the [[WMAP]] spacecraft hints that the universe has a flat topology. This would be consistent with an infinite physical universe.&lt;ref name="NASA_Shape"&gt;{{cite web| title=Will the Universe expand forever?| url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html| publisher=NASA| date=24 January 2014| accessdate=16 March 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601032707/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html| archivedate=1 June 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fermi_Flat"&gt;{{cite web| title=Our universe is Flat| url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2015/our-flat-universe?email_issue=725| publisher=FermiLab/SLAC| date=7 April 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410200411/http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2015/our-flat-universe?email_issue=725| archivedate=10 April 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unexpected connections|author=Marcus Y. Yoo|journal=Engineering &amp; Science|publisher=[[Caltech]]|volume=LXXIV1|date=2011|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the universe could be finite, even if its curvature is flat. An easy way to understand this is to consider two-dimensional examples, such as video games where items that leave one edge of the screen reappear on the other. The topology of such games is toroidal and the geometry is flat. Many possible bounded, flat possibilities also exist for three-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=Jeffrey|title=The Shape of Space|date=December 12, 2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0824707095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of infinity also extends to the [[multiverse]] hypothesis, which, when explained by astrophysicists such as [[Michio Kaku]], posits that there are an infinite number and variety of universes.&lt;ref&gt;Kaku, M. (2006). Parallel worlds. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic==
In [[logic]] an [[infinite regress]] argument is "a distinctively philosophical kind of argument purporting to show that a thesis is defective because it generates an infinite series when either (form&amp;nbsp;A) no such series exists or (form&amp;nbsp;B) were it to exist, the thesis would lack the role (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;of justification) that it is supposed to play."&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', Second Edition, p.&amp;nbsp;429&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computing==
The [[IEEE&amp;nbsp;floating-point]] standard (IEEE 754) specifies the positive and negative infinity values (and also [[NaN|indefinite]] values). These are defined as the result of [[arithmetic overflow]], [[division by zero]], and other exceptional operations.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The '''Ishango bone''' is a [[bone tool]], dated to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era.  It is a dark brown length of bone, the [[fibula]] of a [[baboon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~schultz/3M3/history.html A very brief history of pure mathematics: The Ishango Bone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721075947/http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~schultz/3M3/history.html |date=2008-07-21 }} [[University of Western Australia]] School of Mathematics - accessed January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  with a sharp piece of [[quartz]] affixed to one end, perhaps for engraving. It was first thought to be a [[tally stick]], as it has a series of what has been interpreted as [[tally marks]] carved in three columns running the length of the tool, though it has also been suggested that the scratches might have been to create a better grip on the handle or for some other non-mathematical reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudman|first=Peter Strom|title=How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years|year=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-59102-477-4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Ishango bone was found in 1960 by Belgian [[Jean de Heinzelin de Braucourt]] while exploring what was then the [[Belgian Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;de Heinzelin, Jean: "Ishango", ''[[Scientific American]]'', 206:6 (June 1962) 105--116.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was discovered in the area of [[Ishango]] near the [[Semliki River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Edward|url=http://ishango.naturalsciences.be/Flash/flash_local/Ishango-04-EN.html|website=Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Edward]] empties into the Semliki which forms part of the headwaters of the [[Nile River]] (now on the border between modern-day [[Uganda]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|D.R. Congo]]). The bone was found among the remains of a small community that fished and gathered in this area of Africa.  The settlement had been buried in a [[Volcano|volcanic eruption]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Scott W.: "[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/ishango.html Mathematicians of the African Diaspora]" The Mathematics Department of The [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Huylebrouck, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p5028653585x380j/fulltext.pdf?page=1 ''The Bone that Began the Space Odyssey''], The [[Mathematical Intelligencer]] vol 18 no. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The artifact was first estimated to have originated between 9,000&amp;nbsp;BC and 6,500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Gerdes, Paulus (1991): [http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/AMU/amu_chma_09.html#beginnings On The History of Mathematics in Africa South of the Sahara]; [[African Mathematical Union]], Commission on the History of Mathematics in Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;  
However, the dating of the site where it was discovered was re-evaluated, and it is now believed to be more than 20,000 years old (between 18,000&amp;nbsp;BC and 20,000&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref name=Marshack&gt;Marshack, Alexander (1991): ''The Roots of Civilization'', Colonial Hill, Mount Kisco, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks,  A.S. and Smith, C.C. (1987): "Ishango revisited: new age determinations and cultural interpretations", ''The African Archaeological Review'', 5 : 65-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ishango bone is on permanent exhibition at the [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]], [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=RBINS_intro&gt;[https://www.naturalsciences.be/expo/old_ishango/en/ishango/introduction.html Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051733/https://www.naturalsciences.be/expo/old_ishango/en/ishango/introduction.html |date=2016-03-04 }}, [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]], Brussels, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RBINS_flash&gt;[http://ishango.naturalsciences.be/Flash/flash_local/Ishango-02-EN.html Flash presentation], [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]], Brussels, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;[http://www2.astronomicalheritage.net/index.php/show-entity?identity=4&amp;idsubentity=1 The Ishango Bone, Democratic Republic of the Congo], on permanent display at the [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]], Brussels, Belgium.

The etchings on the bone are in three columns with marks [[asymmetry|asymmetrically]] grouped into sets, leading to "various tantalizing hypotheses",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Numbers and the Making of Us: Counting and the Course of Human Cultures|first=Caleb|last=Everett|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780674504431|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2f1aDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as that the implement was used as a counting tool for simple mathematical procedures or even to construct a [[numeral system]]. 

The third column has been interpreted as a "table of prime numbers",&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Scott W.: "Mathematicians of the African Diaspora" The Mathematics Department of The State University of New York at Buffalo.[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/ishango.html]&lt;/ref&gt; but it is more likely to be a coincidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Historian of mathematics Peter S. Rudman argues that prime numbers were probably not understood until about 500 BC, and were dependent on the concept of division, which he dates to no earlier than 10,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years|last=Rudman|first=Peter Strom|publisher=Prometheus Books|year=2007|isbn=978-1-59102-477-4|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Alexander Marshack]] speculated that the Ishango bone represents a six-month [[lunar calendar]].&lt;ref name=Marshack /&gt; This has led [[Claudia Zaslavsky]] to suggest that the creator of the tool may have been a woman, tracking the [[lunar phase]] in relation to the [[menstrual cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;Zaslavsky, Claudia: ''Africa Counts: Number and Pattern in African Culture'', L. Hill, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaslavsky, Claudia: "[http://web.nmsu.edu/~pscott/isgem71.htm Women as the First Mathematicians]", ''International Study Group on Ethnomathematics Newsletter'', Volume 7 Number 1, 1992|January 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; This is countered with the argument that Marshack overinterprets the data and that the evidence does not support lunar calendars.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Judy. 1992. Not counting on Marshack: a reassessment of the work of Alexander Marshack on notation in the Upper Palaeolithic. Journal of Mediterranean Studies 2(1): 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second bone==
During earlier excavations at the Ishango site in 1959, another bone was also found. It is lighter in color and was scraped, thinned, polished, and broken on one end, revealing it to be hollow. The artifact possibly held a piece of quartz like the more well-known bone or it could have been a tool handle. The 14-cm long bone has 90 notches on six sides, which are categorized as "major" or "minor" according to their length. Jean de Heinzelin interpreted the major notches as being units or multiples and the minor notches as fractions or subsidiary. He believed the bone to be an "interchange rule between bases 10 and 12."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Second Bone|url=http://ishango.naturalsciences.be/Flash/flash_local/Ishango-24-EN.html|website=Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3490">The '''Lebombo bone''' is a [[bone tool]] made of a baboon [[fibula]] with incised markings discovered in the [[Lebombo Mountains]] located between South Africa and Swaziland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beaumont |first1=Peter B. |year=1973 |title=Border Cave – A Progress Report |journal=S. Afr. J. Science |volume=69 |issue= |pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the section of the notches indicate the use of different cutting edges, which the bone's discoverer, Peter Beaumont, views as evidence for their having been made, like other markings found all over the world, during participation in rituals.

The bone is between 44,200 and 43,000 years old, according to 24 radiocarbon datings.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco d’Errico et al. (2012) Early evidence of San material culture represented by organic artifacts from Border Cave, South Africa. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' '''109'''(33): 13214-13219. It is called a notched bone, illustrated in Fig. 1, ''12'' {{cite journal |title=Early evidence of San material culture represented by organic artifacts from Border Cave, South Africa |doi=10.1073/pnas.1204213109 |volume=109 |issue=33 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |pages=13214–13219 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/33/13214.long|year=2012 |last1=d'Errico |first1=F. |last2=Backwell |first2=L. |last3=Villa |first3=P. |last4=Degano |first4=I. |last5=Lucejko |first5=J.

B. |pmc=3421171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is far older than the [[Ishango bone]] with which it is sometimes confused. Other notched bones are 80,000 years old but it is unclear if the notches are merely decorative or if they 
bear a functional meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Vogelsang et al. (2010) New excavations of Middle Stone Age deposits at Apollo 11 Rockshelter, Namibia: stratigraphy, archaeology, chronology and past environments. ''Journal of African Archaeology'' '''8'''(2): 185–218 {{cite web |last1=Richter |first1=Jürgen |display-authors=etal |title=New Excavations of Middle Stone Age Deposits at Apollo 11 Rockshelter, Namibia: Stratigraphy, Archaeology, Chronology and Past Environments |url=https://www.academia.edu/4106767/New_Excavations_at_Apollo_11_Namibia_Ralf_Vogelsang_et_al._}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Universal Book of Mathematics]]'' the Lebombo bone's 29 notches suggest "it may have been used as a lunar phase counter, in which case African women may have been the first mathematicians, because keeping track of menstrual cycles requires a lunar calendar". However, the bone is clearly broken at one end, so the 29 notches may or may not be a minimum number. In the cases of other notched bones since found globally, there has been no consistent notch tally, many being in the 1–10 range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beaumont |first1=Peter B. |last2=Bednarik |first2=Robert G. |year=2013 |title=Tracing the Emergence of Palaeoart in Sub-Saharan Africa |journal=Rock Art Research |volume=30 |number=1 |pages=33–54 |url=http://www.sahra.org.za/sites/default/files/additionaldocs/2013-01-29%2030-1%20BeaumontBed%20final.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1160">In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], specifically the philosophical foundations of [[set theory]], '''limitation of size''' is a concept developed by [[Philip Jourdain]] and/or [[Georg Cantor]] to avoid [[Cantor's paradox]]. It identifies certain "inconsistent multiplicities", in Cantor's terminology, that cannot be [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] because they are "too large". In modern terminology these are called [[class (set theory)|proper classes]].

==Use==
The [[axiom of limitation of size]] is an axiom in some versions of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] or [[Morse–Kelley set theory]]. This axiom says that any class which is not "too large" is a set, and a set cannot be "too large". "Too large" is defined as being large enough that the class of all sets can be mapped one-to-one into it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6708">'''[[Knot theory]]''' is the study of [[knot (mathematics)|mathematical knot]]s. While inspired by knots which appear in daily life in shoelaces and rope, a mathematician's knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone.  In precise mathematical language, a knot is an [[embedding]] of a [[circle]] in 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; upon itself (known as an [[ambient isotopy]]); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.

* [[intensive quantity|Intensive quantities]] in [[physics]] are usually denoted with [[Lower case|minuscules]]&lt;br /&gt;while [[extensive quantity|extensive]] are denoted with [[capital letter]]s.
* Most symbols are written in [[Italic type|italic]]s.
* [[vector (geometry)|Vector]]s can be denoted in [[boldface]]. 
* Sets of [[number]]s are typically bold or [[blackboard bold]].

The [[language of mathematics]] has a vast [[vocabulary]] of specialist and technical terms. It also has a certain amount of [[jargon]]: commonly used phrases which are part of the culture of mathematics, rather than of the subject. Jargon often appears in lectures, and sometimes in print, as informal shorthand for rigorous arguments or precise ideas. Much of this is common English, but with a specific non-obvious meaning when used in a mathematical sense.

Some phrases, like "in general",  appear below in more than one section.

==Philosophy of mathematics==
; [[abstract nonsense]]{{anchor|abstract nonsense}}: Also ''general abstract nonsense'' or ''generalized abstract nonsense'', a [[tongue-in-cheek]] reference to [[category theory]], using which one can employ arguments that establish a (possibly concrete) result without reference to any specifics of the present problem.
{{quote|[The paper of {{Harvard citations|last2 = Mac Lane|last1 = Eilenberg|year = 1942|txt = yes}}] introduced the very abstract idea of a 'category' &amp;mdash; a subject then called 'general abstract nonsense'!|{{Harvard citations|last = Mac Lane|first = Saunders|year = 1997|txt=yes}}}}
{{quote|[Grothendieck] raised algebraic geometry to a new level of abstraction...if certain mathematicians could console themselves for a time with the hope that all these complicated structures were 'abstract nonsense'...the later papers of Grothendieck and others showed that classical problems...which had resisted efforts of several generations of talented mathematicians, could be solved in terms of...complicated concepts.|{{Harvard citations|last = Monastyrsky|first = Michael|year = 2001|txt = yes}}}}
; [[canonical form|canonical]]{{anchor|canonical}}: A reference to a standard or choice-free presentation of some mathematical object. The term ''canonical'' is also used more informally, meaning roughly "standard" or "classic". For example, one might say that [[Euclid's Theorem#Euclid's proof|Euclid's proof]] is the "canonical proof" of the infinitude of primes.
{{quote|1=There are two canonical proofs that are always used to show non-mathematicians what a mathematical proof is like: {{unbulleted list|item_style=line-height:200%; padding-left:1em;|&amp;mdash;The proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers.|&amp;mdash;The proof of the irrationality of the square root of two.}}|2={{Harvard citations|last = Wiedijk|first = Freek|year = 2006|txt = yes|loc = p.2}}}}
; deep{{anchor|deep}}: A result is called "deep" if its proof requires concepts and methods that are advanced beyond the concepts needed to formulate the result. The [[prime number theorem]], proved with techniques from [[complex analysis]], was thought to be a deep result until [[elementary proof]]s were found.  The fact that [[π]] is irrational is a deep result because it requires considerable development of [[real analysis]] to prove, even though it can be stated in terms of simple number theory and geometry.
; [[mathematical beauty|elegant]]{{anchor|elegant}}: Also ''beautiful''; an aesthetic term referring to the ability of an idea to provide insight into mathematics, whether by unifying disparate fields, introducing a new perspective on a single field, or providing a technique of proof which is either particularly simple, or captures the intuition or imagination as to why the result it proves is true.  [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] distinguished between ''elegance of presentation'' and ''beauty of concept'', saying that for example, some topics could be written about elegantly although the mathematical content is not beautiful, and some theorems or proofs are beautiful but may be written about inelegantly.
{{quote|The beauty of a mathematical theory is independent of the aesthetic qualities...of the theory's rigorous expositions.  Some beautiful theories may never be given a presentation which matches their beauty....Instances can also be found of mediocre theories of questionable beauty which are given brilliant, exciting expositions....[Category theory] is rich in beautiful and insightful definitions and poor in elegant proofs....[The theorems] remain clumsy and dull....[Expositions of [[projective geometry]]] vied for one another in elegance of presentation and in cleverness of proof....In retrospect, one wonders what all the fuss was about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematicians may say that a theorem is beautiful when they really mean to say that it is enlightening.  We acknowledge a theorem's beauty when we see how the theorem  'fits' in its place....We say that a proof is beautiful when such a proof finally gives away the secret of the theorem....|{{Harvard citations|last = Rota|first = Gian-Carlo|year = 1977|loc1 = pp.173&amp;ndash;174|loc2 = pp.181&amp;ndash;182|txt = yes}}}}
; [[elementary proof|elementary]]{{anchor|elementary}}: A proof or result is called "elementary" if it requires only basic concepts and methods, in contrast to so-called [[#deep|deep]] results. The concept of "elementary proof" is used specifically in [[number theory]], where it usually refers to a proof that does not use methods from [[complex analysis]].
; [[mathematical folklore|folklore]] {{anchor|folklore}}: A result is called "folklore" if it is non-obvious, has not been published, and yet is generally known among the specialists in a field. Usually, it is unknown who first obtained the result. If the result is important, it may eventually find its way into the textbooks, whereupon it ceases to be folklore.
{{quote|Many of the results mentioned in this paper should be considered "folklore" in that they merely formally state ideas that are well-known to researchers in the area, but may not be obvious to beginners and to the best of my knowledge do not appear elsewhere in print.|{{Harvard citations |last=Impagliazzo |first=Russell |year=1995 |txt= yes}}}}
; [[natural transformation|natural]]{{anchor|natural}}: Similar to "canonical" but more specific, this term makes reference to a description (almost exclusively in the context of [[transformation (mathematics)|transformation]]s) which holds independently of any choices.  Though long used informally, this term has found a formal definition in category theory.
; [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]]{{anchor|pathological}}: An object behaves pathologically (or, somewhat more broadly used, in a ''degenerated'' way) if it fails to conform to the generic behavior of such objects, fails to satisfy certain regularity properties (depending on context), or simply disobeys mathematical intuition.  These can be and often are contradictory requirements.  Sometimes the term is more pointed, referring to an object which is specifically and artificially exhibited as a counterexample to these properties.
{{quote|Since half a century we have seen arise a crowd of bizarre functions which seem to try to resemble as little as possible the honest functions which serve some purpose....Nay more, from the logical point of view, it is these strange functions which are the most general....to-day they are invented expressly to put at fault the reasonings of our fathers....|{{Harvard citations|last = Poincaré|first = Henri|year = 1913|txt = yes}}}}
{{quote|[The [[Dirichlet function]]] took on an enormous importance...as giving an incentive for the creation of new types of function whose properties departed completely from what intuitively seemed admissible.  A celebrated example of such a so-called 'pathological' function...is [[Weierstrass function|the one provided by Weierstrass]]....This function is continuous but not differentiable.|{{Harvard citations|last = Pinto|first = J. Sousa|year = 2004|txt = yes}}}}
:Note for that latter quote that as the differentiable functions are [[meagre set|meagre]] in the space of continuous functions, as Banach found out in 1931&lt;!-- source: the WP article on meagre sets !--&gt;, differentiable functions are colloquially speaking a rare exception among the continuous ones. Thus it can hardly be defended any-more to call non-differentiable continuous functions pathological.
; [[Rigour#Mathematical rigour|rigor (rigour)]]{{anchor|rigour}}: Mathematics strives to establish its results using indisputable logic rather than informal descriptive argument.  Rigor is the use of such logic in a proof.
; [[well-behaved]]{{anchor|well-behaved}}: An object is well-behaved (in contrast with being ''[[#pathological|pathological]]'') if it ''does'' satisfy the prevailing regularity properties, or sometimes if it conforms to intuition (but intuition often suggests the opposite behavior as well). Similar to ''smooth'' (see below).

Although ultimately every mathematical argument must meet a high standard of precision, mathematicians use descriptive but informal statements to discuss recurring themes or concepts with unwieldy formal statements.  Note that many of the terms are completely rigorous in context.
; [[almost all]]{{anchor|almost all}}: A shorthand term for "all except for a set of [[measure zero]]", when there is a measure to speak of.  For example, "almost all [[real numbers]] are [[transcendental number|transcendental]]" because the [[algebraic numbers|algebraic real numbers]] form a [[countable]] subset of the real numbers with measure zero.  One can also speak of "almost all" [[integers]] having a property to mean "all except finitely many", despite the integers not admitting a measure for which this agrees with the previous usage.  For example, "almost all [[prime number]]s are odd". There is a more complicated meaning for integers as well, discussed in the main article.  Finally, this term is sometimes used synonymously with ''generic'', below.
; [[arbitrarily large]]{{anchor|arbitrarily large}}{{anchor|arbitrarily small}}{{anchor|arbitrarily close}}: Notions which arise mostly in the context of limits, referring to the recurrence of a phenomenon as the limit is approached. A statement such as that predicate ''P'' is satisfied by arbitrarily large values, can be expressed in more formal notation by {{nowrap|∀''x'' : ∃''y'' ≥ ''x'' : ''P''(''y'')}}.  See also ''frequently''. The statement that quantity ''f''(''x'') depending on ''x'' "can be made" arbitrarily large, corresponds to {{nowrap|∀''y'' : ∃''x'' : ''f''(''x'') ≥ ''y''}}.
; [[arbitrary]]{{anchor|arbitrary}}: A shorthand for the [[universal quantifier]].  An arbitrary choice is one which is made unrestrictedly, or alternatively, a statement holds of an arbitrary element of a set if it holds of any element of that set. Also much in general-language use among mathematicians: "Of course, this problem can be arbitrarily complicated".
; [[Eventually (mathematics)|eventually]]{{anchor|eventually}}: In the context of limits, this is shorthand meaning ''for sufficiently large arguments''; the relevant argument(s) are implicit in the context.  As an example, the function log(log(''x'')) ''eventually'' becomes larger than 100"; in this context, "eventually" means "for [[#sufficiently large|sufficiently large]] ''x''.
; [[Lift (mathematics)|factor through]]{{anchor|factor through}}&lt;!-- This anchor is linked from [[Exact category]] --&gt;: A term in [[category theory]] referring to composition of morphisms.  If we have three objects ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' and a map &lt;math&gt;f \colon A \to C&lt;/math&gt; which is written as a composition &lt;math&gt;f = h \circ g&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g \colon A \to B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h \colon B \to C&lt;/math&gt;, then ''f'' is said to ''factor through'' any (and all) of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;.
; finite{{anchor|finite}}: Next to the usual meaning of "not infinite", in another more restrictive meaning that one may encounter, a value being said to be "finite" also excludes [[infinitesimal]] values and the value 0. For example, if the [[variance]] of a random variable is said to be finite, this implies it is a positive real number.
; frequently{{anchor|frequently}}: In the context of limits, this is shorthand for ''[[#arbitrarily large|arbitrarily large]] arguments'' and its relatives; as with ''eventually'', the intended variant is implicit.  As an example, the sequence &lt;math&gt;(-1)^n&lt;/math&gt; is frequently in the interval (1/2, 3/2), because there are arbitrarily large ''n'' for which the value of the sequence is in the interval. 

; [[Generic property|generic]]{{anchor|generic}}: This term has similar connotations as ''almost all'' but is used particularly for concepts outside the purview of [[measure theory]].  A property holds "generically" on a set if the set satisfies some (context-dependent) notion of density, or perhaps if its complement satisfies some (context-dependent) notion of smallness.  For example, a property which holds on a [[Dense set|dense]] '''G'''&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; (intersection of countably many open sets) is said to hold generically.  In [[algebraic geometry]], one says that a property of points on an [[algebraic variety]] that holds on a dense [[Zariski topology|Zariski open]] set is true generically; however, it is usually not said that a property which holds merely on a dense set (which is not Zariski open) is generic in this situation.
; in general{{anchor|in general}}: In a descriptive context, this phrase introduces a simple characterization of a broad class of objects, with an eye towards identifying a unifying principle.  This term introduces an "elegant" description which holds for "[[#arbitrary|arbitrary]]" objects.  Exceptions to this description may be mentioned explicitly, as "[[#pathological|pathological]]" cases.
{{quote|Norbert A’Campo of the University of Basel once asked Grothendieck about something related to the [[Platonic solid]]s.  Grothendieck advised caution. The Platonic solids are so beautiful and so exceptional, he said, that one cannot assume such exceptional beauty will hold in more general situations.|{{Harvard citations|last=Jackson|first = Allyn|year=2004|loc = p.1197|txt = yes}}}}
; [[Sides of an equation|left-hand side, right-hand side]] (LHS, RHS){{anchor|LHS|RHS}}: Most often, these refer simply to the left-hand or the right-hand side of an equation; for example, &lt;math&gt;x = y + 1&lt;/math&gt; has ''x'' on the LHS and ''y'' + 1 on the RHS.  Occasionally, these are used in the sense of [[Value (computer science)|lvalue]] and rvalue: an RHS is primitive, and an LHS is derivative.
; nice{{anchor|proper}}: A mathematical object is colloquially called ''nice'' or ''sufficiently nice'' if it satisfies hypotheses or properties, sometimes unspecified or even unknown, that are especially desirable in a given context. It is an informal antonym for [[Mathematical jargon#pathological|pathological]]. For example, one might conjecture that a differential operator ought to satisfy a certain boundedness condition "for nice test functions," or one might state that some interesting topological invariant should be computable "for nice spaces ''X''."
; onto{{anchor|onto}}: A function (which in mathematics is generally defined as mapping the elements of one set A to elements of another B) is called "A onto B" (instead of "A to B") only if it is [[surjective]]; it may even be said that "f is onto" (i. e. surjective). Not translatable (without circumlocutons) to languages other than English.
; proper{{anchor|proper}}: If, for some notion of substructure, objects are substructures of themselves (that is, the relationship is reflexive), then the qualification ''proper'' requires the objects to be different. For example, a ''proper'' subset of a set ''S'' is a [[subset]] of ''S'' that is different from ''S'', and a ''proper'' divisor of a number ''n'' is a divisor of ''n'' that is different from ''n''.  This [[Operator overloading|overloaded]] word is also non-jargon for a [[proper morphism]].
; regular {{anchor|regular}}: A function is called ''regular'' if it satisfies satisfactory continuity and differentiability properties, which are often context-dependent. These properties might include possessing a specified number of derivatives, with the function and its derivatives exhibiting some ''nice'' property (see ''nice'' above), such as [[Hölder continuity]]. Informally, this term is sometimes used synonymously with ''smooth'', below. These imprecise uses of the word ''regular'' are not to be confused with the notion of a [[Regular space|regular topological space]], which is rigorously defined.
; resp.{{anchor|resp.}}: (Respectively) A convention to shorten parallel expositions. "A (resp. B) [has some relationship to] X (resp. Y)" means that A [has some relationship to] X and also that B [has (the same) relationship to] Y. For example, squares (resp. triangles) have 4 sides (resp. 3 sides); or compact (resp. Lindelöf) spaces are ones where every open cover has a finite (resp. countable) open subcover.
; sharp{{anchor|sharp}}: Often, a mathematical theorem will establish constraints on the behavior of some object; for example, a function will be shown to have an upper or lower bound.  The constraint is ''sharp'' (sometimes ''optimal'') if it cannot be made more restrictive without failing in some cases. For example, for [[#arbitrary|arbitrary]] nonnegative real numbers ''x'', the exponential function ''e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''e''&amp;nbsp;= 2.7182818..., gives an upper bound on the values of the quadratic function ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is not sharp; the gap between the functions is everywhere at least 1. Among the exponential functions of the form α&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, setting α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sup&gt;2/''e''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 2.0870652... results in a sharp upper bound; the slightly smaller choice α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 fails to produce an upper bound, since then α&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 8&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In applied fields the word "tight" is often used with the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyd|first=Stephen|title=Convex Optimization|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521833787}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
; [[smooth function|smooth]]{{anchor|smooth}}: ''Smoothness'' is a concept which mathematics has endowed with many meanings, from simple differentiability to infinite differentiability to analyticity, and still others which are more complicated.  Each such usage attempts to invoke the physically intuitive notion of smoothness.
; strong, stronger{{anchor|strong|stronger}}&lt;!-- This anchor is linked from [[Intransitivity]] --&gt;: A theorem is said to be ''strong'' if it deduces restrictive results from general hypotheses. One celebrated example is [[Donaldson's theorem]], which puts tight restraints on what would otherwise appear to be a large class of manifolds.  This (informal) usage reflects the opinion of the mathematical community: not only should such a theorem be strong in the descriptive sense (below) but it should also be definitive in its area.  A theorem, result, or condition is further called ''stronger'' than another one if a proof of the second can be easily obtained from the first but not conversely. An example is the sequence of theorems: [[Fermat's little theorem]], [[Euler's theorem]], [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]], each of which is stronger than the last; another is that a sharp upper bound (see ''sharp'' above) is a stronger result than a non-sharp one.  Finally, the adjective ''strong'' or the adverb ''strongly'' may be added to a mathematical notion to indicate a related stronger notion; for example, a [[strong antichain]] is an [[antichain]] satisfying certain additional conditions, and likewise a [[strongly regular graph]] is a [[regular graph]] meeting stronger conditions. When used in this way, the  stronger notion (such as "strong antichain") is a technical term with a precisely defined meaning; the nature of the extra conditions cannot be derived from the definition of the weaker notion (such as "antichain").
; [[sufficiently large]], suitably small, sufficiently close{{anchor|sufficiently large|suitably small|sufficiently close}}: In the context of limits, these terms refer to some (unspecified, even unknown) point at which a phenomenon prevails as the limit is approached. A statement such as that predicate ''P'' holds for sufficiently large values, can be expressed in more formal notation by ∃''x'' : ∀''y'' ≥ ''x'' : ''P''(''y'').  See also ''eventually''.
; upstairs, downstairs{{anchor|upstairs|downstairs}}: A descriptive term referring to notation in which two objects are written one above the other; the upper one is ''upstairs'' and the lower, ''downstairs''.  For example, in a [[fiber bundle]], the total space is often said to be ''upstairs'', with the base space ''downstairs''.  In a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]], the numerator is occasionally referred to as ''upstairs'' and the [[denominator]] ''downstairs'', as in "bringing a term upstairs".
; [[up to]], modulo, mod out by{{anchor|up to|modulo|mod out by}}: An extension to mathematical discourse of the notions of [[modular arithmetic]].  A statement is true ''up to'' a condition if the establishment of that condition is the only impediment to the truth of the statement. Also used when working with members of equivalence classes, esp. in [[category theory]], where the equivalence relation is (categorical) isomorphism; for example, "The tensor product in a weak monoidal category is associative and unital up to a natural isomorphism."
; vanish{{anchor|vanish}}: To assume the value 0. For example, "The function sin(''x'') vanishes for those values of ''x'' that are integer multiples of π." This can also apply to limits: see [[Vanish at infinity]].
; weak, weaker{{anchor|weak|weaker}}: The converse of [[Mathematical jargon#strong|strong]].
; well-defined{{anchor|well-defined}}: Accurately and precisely described or specified. For example, sometimes a definition relies on a choice of some object; the result of the definition must then be independent of this choice.

==Proof terminology==
The formal language of [[proof (mathematics)|proof]] draws repeatedly from a small pool of ideas, many of which are invoked through various lexical shorthands in practice.
; aliter{{anchor|aliter}}: An obsolescent term which is used to announce to the reader an alternative method, or proof of a result. In a proof, it therefore flags a piece of reasoning that is superfluous from a logical point of view, but has some other interest.
; [[proof by contradiction|by way of contradiction]] (BWOC), or "for, if not, ..."{{anchor|by way of contradiction|BWOC}}: The rhetorical prelude to a [[proof by contradiction]], preceding the negation of the statement to be proved. Also, starting a proof or a sub-proof with ''Assume...'' indicates that a proof by contradiction will be employed.
; [[Iff#More general usage|if and only if]] (iff){{anchor|if and only if|iff}}: An abbreviation for [[logical equivalence]] of statements.
; in general{{anchor|in general}}&lt;!-- [[In general]] redirects here --&gt;: In the context of proofs, this phrase is often seen in [[mathematical induction|induction]] arguments when passing from the base case to the "induction step", and similarly, in the definition of [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]]s whose first few terms are exhibited as examples of the formula giving every term of the sequence.
; [[necessary and sufficient]]{{anchor|necessary and sufficient}}: A minor variant on "if and only if"; "A is ''necessary'' (''sufficient'') for B" means "A if (only if) B".  For example, "For a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' to be [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] it is necessary and sufficient that it have no finite [[field extension]]s" means "''K'' is algebraically closed if and only if it has no finite extensions".  Often used in lists, as in "The following conditions are necessary and sufficient for a field to be algebraically closed...".
; need to show (NTS), required to prove (RTP), wish to show, want to show (WTS){{anchor|need to show}}: Proofs sometimes proceed by enumerating several conditions whose satisfaction will together imply the desired theorem; thus, one ''needs to show'' just these statements.
; [[one and only one]]{{anchor|one and only one}}: A statement of the uniqueness of an object; the object exists, and furthermore, no other such object exists.
; [[Q.E.D.]]{{anchor|Q.E.D.}}: (''Quod erat demonstrandum''): A Latin abbreviation, meaning "which was to be demonstrated", historically placed at the end of proofs, but less common currently, having been supplanted by the [[Tombstone (typography)|Halmos end-of-proof mark]], a square sign ∎.
; sufficiently nice{{anchor|sufficiently nice}}: A condition on objects in the scope of the discussion, to be specified later, that will guarantee that some stated property holds for them. When [[heuristics|working out]] a theorem, the use of this expression in the statement of the theorem indicates that the conditions involved may be not yet known to the speaker, and that the intent is to collect the conditions that will be found to be needed in order for the proof of the theorem to go through.
; the following are equivalent (TFAE){{anchor|the following are equivalent|TFAE}}&lt;!-- [[TFAE]] redirects here --&gt;: Often several equivalent conditions (especially for a definition, such as [[normal subgroup]]) are equally useful in practice; one introduces a theorem stating an equivalence of more than two statements with TFAE.
; [[transport of structure]]{{anchor|transport of structure}}: It is often the case that two objects are shown to be equivalent in some way, and that one of them is endowed with additional structure.  Using the equivalence, we may define such a structure on the second object as well, via ''transport of structure''.  For example, any two [[vector space]]s of the same dimension are isomorphic; if one of them is given an [[inner product]] and if we fix a particular isomorphism, then we may define an inner product on the other space by ''factoring through'' the isomorphism.
{{quote|1=Let ''V'' be a finite-dimensional vector space over ''k''....Let (''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be a basis for ''V''....There is an isomorphism of the polynomial algebra ''k''[''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''i'',''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; onto the algebra Sym&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V''&amp;nbsp;&amp;otimes;&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)....It extends to an isomorphism of ''k''['''GL'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] to the localized algebra Sym&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V''&amp;nbsp;&amp;otimes;&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;det(''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;otimes;&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)....We write ''k''['''GL'''(''V'')] for this last algebra.

; [[Without loss of generality|without (any) loss of generality]] (WLOG, WOLOG, WALOG), we may assume (WMA){{anchor|WLOG|WOLOG|WALOG|we may assume|WMA}}: Sometimes a proposition can be more easily proved with additional assumptions on the objects it concerns.  If the proposition as stated follows from this modified one with a simple and minimal explanation (for example, if the remaining special cases are identical but for notation), then the modified assumptions are introduced with this phrase and the altered proposition is proved.

==Proof techniques==
Mathematicians have several phrases to describe proofs or proof techniques. These are often used as hints for filling in tedious details.

; angle chasing{{anchor|angle chasing}}: Used to describe a geometrical proof that involves finding relationships between the various angles in a diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Elementary Geometry|first=John|last=Roe
|publisher=Oxford science publications|year=1993|isbn=0-19-853456-6|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[back-of-the-envelope calculation]]{{anchor|back-of-the-envelope calculation}}: An informal computation omitting much rigor without sacrificing correctness.  Often this computation is "proof of concept" and treats only an accessible special case.
; brute force{{anchor|brute force}}: Rather than finding underlying principles or patterns, this is a method where one would evaluate as many cases as needed to sufficiently prove or provide convincing evidence that the thing in question is true. Sometimes this involves evaluating every possible case.
; by example{{anchor|by example}}: A ''proof by example'' is an argument whereby a statement is not proved but instead illustrated by an example. If done well, the specific example would easily generalize to a general proof.
; by inspection{{anchor|by inspection}}: A rhetorical shortcut made by authors who invite the reader to verify, at a glance, the correctness of a proposed expression or deduction. If an expression can be evaluated by straightforward application of simple techniques and without recourse to extended calculation or general theory, then it can be evaluated ''by inspection''. It is also applied to solving equations; for example to find roots of a [[quadratic equation]] by inspection is to 'notice' them, or mentally check them. 'By inspection' can play a kind of ''[[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]]'' role: the answer or solution simply clicks into place.
; [[proof by intimidation|by intimidation]]{{anchor|by intimidation}}: Style of proof where claims believed by the author to be easily verifiable are labelled as 'obvious' or 'trivial', which often results in the reader being confused.
; clearly, can be easily shown{{anchor|clearly}}: A term which shortcuts around calculation the mathematician perceives to be tedious or routine, accessible to any member of the audience with the necessary expertise in the field; [[Pierre Laplace|Laplace]] used ''obvious'' ([[French language|French]]: ''évident'').
; complete intuition {{anchor|complete intuition}}: commonly reserved for jokes (puns on [[complete induction]]).
; [[diagram chasing]]{{anchor|diagram chasing|diagram chase}}:&lt;ref&gt;Numerous examples can be found in {{Harvard citations|last = Mac Lane|year = 1998}}, for example on p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a [[commutative diagram]] of objects and morphisms between them, if one wishes to prove some property of the morphisms (such as [[injectivity]]) which can be stated in terms of [[element (category theory)|element]]s, then the proof can proceed by tracing the path of elements of various objects around the diagram as successive morphisms are applied to it.  That is, one ''chases'' elements around the diagram, or does a ''diagram chase''.
; [[handwaving]]{{anchor|handwaving}}: A non-technique of proof mostly employed in lectures, where formal argument is not strictly necessary.  It proceeds by omission of details or even significant ingredients, and is merely a plausibility argument.
; in general{{anchor|in general (informal proof technique)}}: In a context not requiring rigor, this phrase often appears as a labor-saving device when the technical details of a complete argument would outweigh the conceptual benefits.  The author gives a proof in a simple enough case that the computations are reasonable, and then indicates that "in general" the proof is similar.
; index battle{{anchor|index battle}}: for proofs involving objects with multiple indices which can be solved by going to the bottom (if anyone wishes to take up the effort). Similar to diagram chasing.
; [[trivial (mathematics)|trivial]]{{anchor|trivial}}: Similar to ''clearly''.  A concept is trivial if it holds by definition, is immediate corollary to a known statement, or is a simple special case of a more general concept.

A '''[[prime number]]''' (or a '''prime''') is a [[natural number]] greater than 1 that has no positive [[divisor]]s other than 1 and itself. By [[Euclid's theorem]], there are an infinite number of prime numbers. Subsets of the prime numbers may be generated with various [[formulas for primes]]. The first 1000 primes are listed below, followed by lists of notable types of prime numbers in alphabetical order, giving their respective first terms. 1 is neither prime nor [[composite number|composite]].

== The first 1000 prime numbers ==
The following table lists the first 1000 primes, with 20 columns of consecutive primes in each of the 50 rows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Lehmer | first = D.

This article itemizes the various '''lists''' of '''[[mathematics]] topics'''. Some of these lists link to hundreds of articles; some link only to a few. The template to the right includes links to alphabetical lists of all mathematical articles. This article brings together the same content organized in a manner better suited for browsing.

The purpose of this list is ''not'' similar to that of the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] formulated by the [[American Mathematical Society]]. Many mathematics journals ask authors of research papers and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The subject codes so listed are used by the two major reviewing databases, ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' and ''[[Zentralblatt MATH]]''. This list has some items that would not fit in such a classification, such as [[list of exponential topics]] and [[list of factorial and binomial topics]], which may surprise the reader with the diversity of their coverage.

As a rough guide this list is divided into pure and applied sections although in reality these branches are overlapping and intertwined.

===Pure mathematics===

====Algebra====
[[Algebra]] includes the study of algebraic structures, which are sets and operations defined on these sets satisfying certain axioms. The field of algebra is further divided according to which structure is studied; for instance, group theory concerns an algebraic structure called ''group''.

====Combinatorics====
[[Combinatorics]] concerns the study of [[Countable set|discrete]] (and usually [[Finite set|finite]]) objects. Aspects include "counting" the objects satisfying certain criteria (''[[enumerative combinatorics]]''), deciding when the criteria can be met, and constructing and analyzing objects meeting the criteria (as in ''[[combinatorial design]]s and [[matroid]] theory''), finding "largest", "smallest", or "optimal" objects (''[[extremal combinatorics]]'' and ''[[combinatorial optimization]]''), and finding [[algebra]]ic structures these objects may have (''[[algebraic combinatorics]]'').
* [[Outline of combinatorics]]
* [[List of graph theory topics]]

====Logic====
[[File:Venn A intersect B.svg|thumb|200px|right|[[Venn diagram]]s are illustrations of set theoretical, mathematical or logical relationships.]]

===Applied mathematics===

====Dynamical systems and differential equations====
[[File:Limitcycle.svg|right|200px|thumb|Phase portrait of a continuous-time dynamical system, the [[Van der Pol oscillator]].]]
A [[differential equation]] is an equation involving an unknown function and its derivatives.

In a [[dynamical system]], a fixed rule describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space. The mathematical models used to describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, or the number of fish each spring in a lake are examples of dynamical systems.
* [[List of dynamical systems and differential equations topics]]
* [[List of partial differential equation topics]]
* [[List of nonlinear partial differential equations]]

[[Signal processing]] is the analysis, interpretation, and manipulation of [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]s. Signals of interest include [[audio signal processing|sound]], [[image processing|images]], biological signals such as [[ECG]], [[radar]] signals, and many others. Processing of such signals includes [[filter (signal processing)|filtering]], storage and reconstruction, separation of information from [[noise]], [[data compression|compression]], and [[feature extraction]].

{{Main|Lists of statistics topics}}
[[Probability theory]] is the formalization and study of the mathematics of uncertain events or knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3792">'''Logical harmony''', a name coined by [[Michael Dummett]], is a supposed constraint on the [[rules of inference]] that can be used in a given [[logical system]].

==Overview&lt;!--'Prior's tonk' redirects here--&gt;==
The logician [[Gerhard Gentzen]] proposed that the meanings of logical [[Logical connective|connective]]s could be given by the rules for introducing them into discourse. For example, if one believes that ''the sky is blue'' and one also believes that ''grass is green'', then one can introduce the connective ''[[logical conjunction|and]]'' as follows: ''The sky is blue AND grass is green.''  Gentzen's idea was that having rules like this is what gives meaning to one's words, or at least to certain words. The idea has also been associated with [[Wittgenstein]]'s dictum that in many cases we can say, ''[[meaning is use]]''. Most contemporary logicians prefer to think that the [[introduction rule]]s and the [[elimination rule]]s for an expression are equally important.  In this case, ''and'' is  characterized by the following rules:
{| border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" align="center"
|-
! Intro
! colspan="2" | Elim
|-
|
{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|-
| colspan="4" style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| colspan="4" align="center" | &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; and &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|}
|
{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; and &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| align="center"| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt;
|}
|
{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; and &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| align="center"| &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|}
|}

An apparent problem with this was pointed out by [[Arthur Prior]]: Why can't we have an expression (call it "'''tonk'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;") whose introduction rule is that of OR (from "p" to "p tonk q") but whose elimination rule is that of AND (from "p tonk q" to "q")?  This lets us deduce anything at all from any starting point.  Prior suggested that this meant that inferential rules could ''not'' determine meaning.  He was answered by [[Nuel Belnap]], that even though introduction and elimination rules can constitute meaning, not just any pair of such rules will determine a meaningful expression—they must meet certain constraints, such as not allowing us to deduce any new truths in the old vocabulary.  These constraints are what Dummett was referring to.

Harmony, then, refers to certain constraints that a proof theory must let hold between introduction and elimination rules for it to be meaningful, or in other words, for its inference rules to be meaning-constituting.

The application of harmony to logic may be considered a special case; it makes sense to talk of harmony with respect to not only inferential systems, but also conceptual systems in human cognition, and to type systems in programming languages.

Semantics of this form has not provided a very great challenge to that sketched in Tarski's [[semantic theory of truth]], but many philosophers interested in reconstituting the semantics of logic in a way that respects [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s ''meaning is use'' have felt that harmony holds the key.

[[File:Pythagorean proof (1).svg|300px|right|thumb|An example of "beauty in method"—a simple and elegant proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].]]

'''Mathematical beauty''' describes the notion that some [[mathematician]]s may derive [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] pleasure from their work, and from [[mathematics]] in general. They express this pleasure by describing mathematics (or, at least, some aspect of mathematics) as ''beautiful''. Mathematicians describe mathematics as an [[art]] form or, at a minimum, as a [[creativity|creative activity]]. Comparisons are often made with [[music]] and [[poetry]].

[[Bertrand Russell]] expressed his sense of mathematical beauty in these words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|title=Mysticism and Logic: And Other Essays|publisher=[[Longman]]|year=1919|page=60|chapter=The Study of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zwMQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Mathematics+rightly+viewed+possesses+not+only+truth+but+supreme+beauty+a+beauty+cold+and+austere+like+that+of+sculpture+without+appeal+to+any+part+of+our+weaker+nature+without+the+gorgeous+trappings+inauthor:Russell|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Paul Erdős]] expressed his views on the [[ineffability]] of mathematics when he said, "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I ''know'' numbers are beautiful. If they aren't beautiful, nothing is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devlin|first=Keith|title=The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved And Why Numbers Are Like Gossip|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=2000|page=140|chapter=Do Mathematicians Have Different Brains?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJdmfYEaLG4C|accessdate=2008-08-22|isbn=978-0-465-01619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beauty in method==
Mathematicians describe an especially pleasing method of [[Mathematical proof|proof]] as ''[[Elegance|elegant]]''. Depending on context, this may mean:

* A proof that uses a minimum of additional assumptions or previous results.
* A proof that is unusually succinct.
* A proof that derives a result in a surprising way (e.g., from an apparently unrelated [[theorem]] or collection of theorems).
* A proof that is based on new and original insights.
* A method of proof that can be easily generalized to solve a family of similar problems.

In the search for an elegant proof, mathematicians often look for different independent ways to prove a result—the first proof that is found may not be the best. The theorem for which the greatest number of different proofs have been discovered is possibly the [[Pythagorean theorem]], with hundreds of proofs having been published.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elisha Scott Loomis]] published over 360 proofs in his book Pythagorean Proposition ({{isbn|0-873-53036-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Another theorem that has been proved in many different ways is the theorem of [[quadratic reciprocity]]—[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] alone published eight different proofs of this theorem.

Conversely, results that are logically correct but involve laborious calculations, over-elaborate methods, very conventional approaches, or that rely on a large number of particularly powerful [[axiom]]s or previous results are not usually considered to be elegant, and may be called ''ugly'' or ''clumsy''.

==Beauty in results==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fermat's last theorem]] --&gt;
[[File:EulerIdentity2.svg|thumb|right|Starting at ''e''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, travelling at the velocity ''i'' relative to one's position for the length of time π, and adding 1, one arrives at 0. (The diagram is an [[Argand diagram]])]]
Some mathematicians{{sfnp|Rota|1997|p=173}} see beauty in mathematical results that establish connections between two areas of mathematics that at first sight appear to be unrelated. These results are often described as ''deep''.

While it is difficult to find universal agreement on whether a result is deep, some examples are often cited. One is [[Euler's identity]]:&lt;ref name=Gallagher2014&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=James|title=Mathematics: Why the brain sees maths as beauty|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26151062|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=BBC News online|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math display=block&gt;\displaystyle e^{i \pi} +1 = 0\, .&lt;/math&gt;

This is a special case of [[Euler's formula]], which the physicist [[Richard Feynman]] called "our jewel" and "the most remarkable formula in mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard P.|last= Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics |volume=I|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1977|isbn=0-201-02010-6|pages=22–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern examples include the [[modularity theorem]], which establishes an important connection between [[elliptic curve]]s and [[modular form]]s (work on which led to the awarding of the [[Wolf Prize]] to [[Andrew Wiles]] and [[Robert Langlands]]), and "[[monstrous moonshine]]", which connects the [[Monster group]] to [[modular function]]s via [[string theory]] for which [[Richard Borcherds]] was awarded the [[Fields Medal]].

Other examples of deep results include unexpected insights into mathematical structures. For example, Gauss's [[Theorema Egregium]] is a deep theorem which relates a local phenomenon ([[curvature]]) to a global phenomenon ([[area]]) in a surprising way. In particular, the area of a triangle on a curved surface is proportional to the excess of the triangle and the proportionality is curvature. Another example is the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] (and its vector versions including [[Green's theorem]] and [[Stokes' theorem]]).

The opposite of ''deep'' is ''trivial''. A trivial theorem may be a result that can be derived in an obvious and straightforward way from other known results, or which applies only to a specific set of particular objects such as the [[empty set]]. Sometimes, however, a statement of a theorem can be original enough to be considered deep, even though its proof is fairly obvious.

In his ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'', [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] suggests that a beautiful proof or result possesses "inevitability", "unexpectedness", and "economy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Mathematician's Apology|author=Hardy, G.H. | chapter = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gian-Carlo Rota|Rota]], however, disagrees with unexpectedness as a sufficient condition for beauty and proposes a counterexample:
{{quote|A great many theorems of mathematics, when first published, appear to be surprising; thus for example some twenty years ago [from 1977] the proof of the existence of [[Exotic sphere|non-equivalent differentiable structures]] on spheres of high dimension was thought to be surprising, but it did not occur to anyone to call such a fact beautiful, then or now.{{sfnp|Rota|1997|p=172}} }}
Perhaps ironically, Monastyrsky writes:
{{quote|It is very difficult to find an analogous invention in the past to [[Milnor]]'s beautiful construction of the different differential structures on the seven-dimensional sphere... The original proof of Milnor was not very constructive, but later E. Briscorn showed that these differential structures can be described in an extremely explicit and beautiful form.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last = Monastyrsky|title=Some Trends in Modern Mathematics and the Fields Medal|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This disagreement illustrates both the subjective nature of mathematical beauty and its connection with mathematical results: in this case, not only the existence of exotic spheres, but also a particular realization of them.

==Beauty in experience==
[[File:Compound of five cubes.png|thumb|222px|A "cold and austere beauty" has been attributed to the [[compound of five cubes]]]]
{{tone|section|date=March 2013}}
Interest in [[pure mathematics]] separate from [[Empirical research|empirical]] study has been part of the experience [[History of mathematics|of various civilizations]], including that of the [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greeks]], who "did mathematics for the beauty of it".&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic pleasure that [[mathematical physicist]]s tend to experience in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] has been attributed (by [[Paul Dirac]], among others) to its "great mathematical beauty".&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; The beauty of mathematics is experienced when the [[reality|physical reality]] of objects are represented by [[mathematical models]]. [[Group theory]], developed in the early 1800s for the sole purpose of solving [[polynomial]] equations, became a fruitful way of categorizing [[elementary particle]]s—the building blocks of matter. Similarly, the study of [[knot theory|knots]] provides important insights into [[string theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]].

Some believe that in order to appreciate mathematics, one must engage in doing mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=George|title=Mathematics Is Not a Spectator Sport|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=2005|chapter=Preface|isbn=0-387-25528-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=psFwdN6V6icC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=there+is+nothing+in+the+world+of+mathematics+that+corresponds+to+an+audience+in+a+concert+hall,+where+the+passive+listen+to+the+active.+Happily,+mathematicians+are+all+doers,+not+spectators.|accessdate=2008-08-22|quote="...there is nothing in the world of mathematics that corresponds to an audience in a concert hall, where the passive listen to the active. Happily, mathematicians are all ''doers'', not spectators.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are some teachers that encourage [[student engagement]] by teaching mathematics in a kinesthetic way (see [[kinesthetic learning]]). For example, [[Math Circle]] is an afterschool enrichment program where students do mathematics through games and activities; in a general Math Circle lesson, students use pattern finding, observation, and exploration to make their own mathematical discoveries. For example, mathematical beauty arises in a Math Circle activity on [[symmetry]] designed for 2nd and 3rd graders. In this activity, students create their own snowflakes by folding a square piece of paper and cutting out designs of their choice along the edges of the folded paper. When the paper is unfolded, a symmetrical design reveals itself. In a day to day elementary school mathematics class, symmetry can be presented as such in an artistic manner where students see aesthetically pleasing results in mathematics.

Some teachers prefer to use [[mathematical manipulatives]] to present mathematics in an aesthetically pleasing way. Examples of a manipulative include [[algebra tiles]], [[cuisenaire rods]], and [[pattern blocks]]. For example, one can teach the method of [[completing the square]] by using algebra tiles. Cuisenaire rods can be used to teach fractions, and pattern blocks can be used to teach geometry. Using mathematical manipulatives helps students gain a conceptual understanding that might not be seen immediately in written mathematical formulas.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, E. (1989). Effects of Manipulative Materials in Mathematics Instruction. Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, 20, 498–505.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another example involves [[origami]]. Origami, the art of paper folding, has aesthetic qualities and many mathematical connections. One can study the [[mathematics of paper folding]] by observing the [[crease pattern]] on unfolded origami pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Thomas. "Project Origami: Activities for Exploring Mathematics". Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Combinatorics]] (the study of counting) has artistic representations that some find mathematically beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Brualdi, Richard. "Introductory Combinatorics." Pearson, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many visual examples that illustrate combinatorial concepts. Here are some topics and objects seen in combinatorics courses with visual representations:
* [[Four color theorem]]
* [[Young tableau]]
* [[Permutohedron]]
* [[Graph theory]]
* [[Partition of a set]]

==Beauty and philosophy==
Some mathematicians are of the opinion that the doing of mathematics is closer to discovery than invention, for example:
{{quote|There is no scientific discoverer, no poet, no painter, no musician, who will not tell you that he found ready made his discovery or poem or picture – that it came to him from outside, and that he did not consciously create it from within.
|[[William Kingdon Clifford]], from a lecture to the Royal Institution titled "Some of the conditions of mental development"}}
These mathematicians believe that the detailed and precise results of mathematics may be reasonably taken to be true without any dependence on the universe in which we live. For example, they would argue that the theory of the [[natural numbers]] is fundamentally valid, in a way that does not require any specific context. Some mathematicians have extrapolated this viewpoint that mathematical beauty is truth further, in some cases becoming [[mysticism]].

[[Pythagoras#Mathematics|Pythagorean mathematicians]] believed in the literal reality of numbers. The discovery of the existence of [[irrational number]]s was a shock to them, since they considered the existence of numbers not expressible as the ratio of two natural numbers to be a flaw in nature (the Pythagorean [[world view]] did not contemplate the [[Limit of a sequence|limits of infinite sequences]] of ratios of natural numbers—the modern notion of a [[real number]]). From a modern perspective, their mystical approach to numbers may be viewed as [[numerology]].

In [[Plato]]'s philosophy there were two worlds, the physical one in which we live and another abstract world which contained unchanging truth, including mathematics. He believed that the physical world was a mere reflection of the more perfect abstract world.

[[Hungary|Hungarian]] mathematician [[Paul Erdős]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Schechter, Bruce | title=My brain is open: The mathematical journeys of Paul Erdős | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | location=New York | year=2000 | pages=70–71 | isbn = 0-684-85980-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoke of an imaginary book, in which God has written down all the most beautiful mathematical proofs. When Erdős wanted to express particular appreciation of a proof, he would exclaim "This one's from The Book!"

Twentieth-century French philosopher [[Alain Badiou]] claims that [[ontology]] is mathematics. Badiou also believes in deep connections between mathematics, poetry and philosophy.

In some cases, natural philosophers and other scientists who have made extensive use of mathematics have made leaps of inference between beauty and physical truth in ways that turned out to be erroneous. For example, at one stage in his life, [[Johannes Kepler]] believed that the proportions of the orbits of the then-known planets in the [[Solar System]] have been arranged by [[God]] to correspond to a concentric arrangement of the five [[Platonic solid]]s, each orbit lying on the [[Circumscribed sphere|circumsphere]] of one [[polyhedron]] and the [[Inscribed sphere|insphere]] of another. As there are exactly five Platonic solids, Kepler's hypothesis could only accommodate six planetary orbits and was disproved by the subsequent discovery of [[Uranus]].

==Beauty and mathematical information theory==
In the 1970s, [[Abraham Moles]] and [[Frieder Nake]] analyzed links between beauty, [[information processing]], and [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Moles: ''Théorie de l'information et perception esthétique'', Paris, Denoël, 1973 ([[Information Theory]] and aesthetical perception)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F Nake (1974). Ästhetik als Informationsverarbeitung. ([[Aesthetics]] as information processing). Grundlagen und Anwendungen der Informatik im Bereich ästhetischer Produktion und Kritik. Springer, 1974, {{isbn|3-211-81216-4}}, {{isbn|978-3-211-81216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] formulated a mathematical theory of observer-dependent subjective beauty based on [[algorithmic information theory]]: the most beautiful objects among subjectively comparable objects have short [[algorithmic information theory|algorithmic]] descriptions (i.e., [[Kolmogorov complexity]]) relative to what the observer already knows.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmidhuber. [[Low-complexity art]]. [[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]], Journal of the International Society for the Arts, Sciences, and Technology ([[Leonardo, The International Society of the Arts, Sciences and Technology|Leonardo/ISAST]]), 30(2):97–103, 1997. {{doi|10.2307/1576418}}. {{JSTOR|1576418}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmidhuber. Papers on the theory of beauty and [[low-complexity art]] since 1994: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/beauty.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmidhuber. Simple Algorithmic Principles of Discovery, Subjective Beauty, Selective Attention, Curiosity &amp; Creativity. Proc. 10th Intl. Conf. on Discovery Science (DS 2007) pp. 26–38, LNAI 4755, Springer, 2007. Also in Proc. 18th Intl. Conf. on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2007) p. 32, LNAI 4754, Springer, 2007. Joint invited lecture for DS 2007 and ALT 2007, Sendai, Japan, 2007. {{arXiv|0709.0674}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidhuber explicitly distinguishes between beautiful and interesting. The latter corresponds to the [[first derivative]] of subjectively perceived beauty:
the observer continually tries to improve the [[predictability]] and [[Data compression|compressibility]] of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and [[symmetries]] and [[fractal]] [[self-similarity]]. Whenever the observer's learning process (possibly a predictive artificial [[neural network]]) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer [[bit]]s than before, the temporary interestingness of the data corresponds to the compression progress, and is proportional to the observer's internal curiosity reward.&lt;ref&gt;.J. Schmidhuber. Curious model-building control systems. International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, Singapore, vol 2, 1458–1463.

==Mathematics and the arts==
 {{Main|Mathematics and art|Mathematics and music|Mathematics and architecture}}

===Music===
Examples of the use of mathematics in music include the [[stochastic music]] of [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci]] in [[Tool (band)|Tool]]'s [[Lateralus (song)|Lateralus]], counterpoint of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[polyrhythm]]ic structures (as in [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''), the [[Metric modulation]] of [[Elliott Carter]], [[permutation]] theory in [[serialism]] beginning with [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and application of Shepard tones in [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s ''[[Hymnen]]''.

===Visual arts===
[[File:Della Pittura Alberti perspective pillars on grid.jpg|thumb|Diagram from [[Leon Battista Alberti]]'s 1435 ''[[Della Pittura]]'', with pillars in [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] on a grid]]

Examples of the use of mathematics in the visual arts include applications of [[chaos theory]] and [[fractal]] [[geometry]] to [[digital art|computer-generated art]], [[symmetry]] studies of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[projective geometry|projective geometries]] in development of the [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] theory of [[Renaissance]] art, [[grid (page layout)|grids]] in [[Op art]], optical geometry in the [[camera obscura]] of [[Giambattista della Porta]], and multiple perspective in analytic [[cubism]] and [[futurism]].

The Dutch graphic designer [[M. C. Escher]] created mathematically inspired [[woodcut]]s, [[lithograph]]s, and [[mezzotint]]s. These feature impossible constructions, explorations of [[infinity]], [[architecture]], visual [[paradox]]es and [[tessellation]]s. British constructionist artist [[John Ernest]] created reliefs and paintings inspired by group theory.&lt;ref&gt;John Ernest's use of mathematics and especially group theory in his art works is analysed in ''John Ernest, A Mathematical Artist'' by Paul Ernest in ''Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal'', No. 24 Dec. 2009 (Special Issue on Mathematics and Art): http://people.exeter.ac.uk/PErnest/pome24/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other British artists of the constructionist and systems schools also draw on mathematics models and structures as a source of inspiration, including [[Anthony Hill (artist)|Anthony Hill]] and [[Peter Lowe (artist)|Peter Lowe]]. Computer-generated art is based on mathematical [[algorithm]]s.

'''Mathematical fiction''' is a genre of creative fictional work in which mathematics and mathematicians play important roles. The form and the medium of the works are not important. The genre may include short stories, novels or plays; comic books; films, videos, or audios. One of the earliest, and much studied, work of this genre is [[Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions]], an 1884 satirical novella by the English schoolmaster [[Edwin Abbott Abbott]]. Mathematical fiction may have existed since ancient times, but it was recently rediscovered as a genre of literature; since then there has been a growing body of literature in this genre, and the genre has attracted a growing body of readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janice Padula|title=Mathematical fiction for  senior students and undergraduates: Novels, plays, and film|journal=Australian Senior Mathematics Journal|volume=20|issue=2|pages=36–44|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ744036.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darren Glass|title=MAA REview of The Shape of Content: Creative Writing in Mathematics and Science|url=http://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/the-shape-of-content-creative-writing-in-mathematics-and-science|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Abbot's Flatland spawned a sequel in the 21st century: a novel titled ''[[Flatterland]]'', authored by [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and published in 2001.

==A database of mathematical fiction==
Alex Kasman, a Professor of Mathematics at [[College of Charleston]], who maintains a database of works that could possibly be included in this genre, has a broader definition for the genre: Any work "containing mathematics or mathematicians" has been treated as mathematical fiction. Accordingly, ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]], ''[[War and Peace]]'' by [[Lev Tolstoy]], ''[[Mrs. Warren's Profession]]'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]], and several similar literary works appear in Kasman's database because these works contain references to mathematics or mathematicians, even though mathematics and mathematicians are not important in their plots. According to this broader approach, the oldest extant work of mathematical fiction is ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'', a comedy by the Ancient Greek playwright [[Aristophanes]] performed in 414 BCE. Kasman's database has a list of more than one thousand items of diverse categories like literature, comic books and films.&lt;ref name="Kasman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alex Kasman|title=Mathematical Fiction|url=http://kasmana.people.cofc.edu/MATHFICT/|publisher=Alex Kasman|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathematical Fiction Website Achieves Milestone|url=http://www.ams.org/gnews#!news_id=1171|publisher=American Mathematical Society|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maya Sharma|title=Stories for Mathematicians: The Mathematical Fiction Homepage|url=http://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2012/09/30/stories-mathematicians-mathematical-fiction-homepage/#sthash.cLdHW0QU.dpbs|website=AMS Blogs|publisher=American Mathematical Society|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mathematical practice''' comprises the working practices of professional [[mathematician]]s: selecting [[theorem]]s to prove, using informal notations to persuade themselves and others that various steps in the final proof are convincing, and seeking [[peer review]] and [[publication]], as opposed to the end result of [[mathematical proof|proven]] and published [[theorem]]s.

[[Philip Kitcher]] has proposed a more formal definition of a mathematical practice, as a quintuple. His intention was primarily to document mathematical practice through its historical changes.&lt;ref name="Ernest1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ernest|first=Paul|title=Social Constructivism as a Philosophy of Mathematics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TYeEjbRSAvQC&amp;pg=PA139|accessdate=19 September 2018|year=1998|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791435885|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical tradition==
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2018}}

The evolution of mathematical practice was slow, and some contributors to modern mathematics did not follow even the practice of their time.  For example, [[Pierre de Fermat]] was infamous for withholding his proofs, but nonetheless had a vast reputation for correct assertions of results.

One motivation to study mathematical practice is that, despite much work in the 20th century, some still feel that the [[foundations of mathematics]] remain unclear and ambiguous. One proposed remedy is to shift focus to some degree onto 'what is meant by a proof', and other such questions of method.

If mathematics has been informally used throughout history, in numerous cultures and continents, then it could be argued that "mathematical practice" is the practice, or use, of mathematics in everyday life.  One definition of mathematical practice, as described above, is the "working practices of professional mathematicians."  However, another definition, more in keeping with the predominant usage of mathematics, is that mathematical practice is the everyday practice, or use, of math.  Whether one is estimating the total cost of their groceries, calculating miles per gallon, or figuring out how many minutes on the treadmill that chocolate éclair will require, math as used by most people relies less on proof than on practicality (i. e., does it answer the question?).

==Teaching practice==
[[Mathematical teaching]] usually requires the use of several important teaching [[pedagogy|pedagogies]] or components.  Most [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]], [[A-Level]] and [[undergraduate]] mathematics require the following components: 
# [[Textbook]]s or lecture notes which display the mathematical material to be covered/taught within the context of the teaching of mathematics.  This requires that the mathematical content being taught at the (say) undergraduate level is of a well documented and widely accepted nature that has been unanimously verified as being correct and meaningful within a mathematical context.
# Workbooks.  Usually, in order to ensure that students have an opportunity to learn and test the material that they have learnt, workbooks or question papers enable mathematical understanding to be tested.  It is not unknown for exam papers to draw upon questions from such test papers, or to require [[prerequisite]] knowledge of such test papers for mathematical progression.
# Exam papers and standardised (and preferably apolitical) testing methods.  Often, within countries such as the US, the UK (and, in all likelihood, China) there are standardised qualifications, examinations and workbooks that form the concrete teaching materials needed for secondary-school and pre-university courses (for example, within the UK, all students are required to sit or take Scottish Highers/Advanced Highers, A-levels or their equivalent in order to ensure that a certain minimal level of mathematical competence in a wide variety of topics has been obtained).  Note, however, that at the undergraduate, [[post-graduate]] and [[doctoral]] levels within these countries, there need not be any standardised process via which mathematicians of differing ability levels can be tested or examined. Other common test formats within the UK and beyond include the [[British Mathematical Olympiad|BMO]] (which is a multiple-choice test competition paper used in order to determine the best candidates that are to represent countries within the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]).

A '''network automaton''' (plural '''network automata''') is a mathematical system consisting of a [[graph theory|network of nodes]] that evolves over [[time]] according to predetermined rules.  It is similar in concept to a [[cellular automaton]], but much less studied.

[[Stephen Wolfram]]'s book ''[[A New Kind of Science]]'', which is primarily concerned with cellular automata, briefly discusses network automata, and suggests (without positive evidence) that the [[universe]] might at the very lowest level be a network automaton.

The '''Open Energy Modelling Initiative''' ('''openmod''') is a [[Grassroots|grass roots]] community of [[energy system]] modellers from universities and research institutes across Europe and elsewhere.  The initiative promotes the use of [[open-source software]] and [[open data]] in [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|modelling]] for research and policy advice.  The Open Energy Modelling Initiative documents a variety of open-source energy models and addresses practical and conceptual issues regarding their development and application.  The initiative runs an [[Electronic mailing list|email list]], an [[internet forum]], and a [[wiki]] and hosts occasional academic workshops.  A statement of aims is available.&lt;ref name="openmod-manifesto"/&gt;

== Context ==

The application of [[open-source software development|open-source development]] to energy modelling dates back to around 2010.  This section provides some background for the growing interest in open methods.

=== Growth in open energy modelling ===

Just two active open energy modelling projects were cited in a 2011 paper: OSeMOSYS and TEMOA.&lt;ref name="howells-etal-2011"/&gt;{{rp|5861}}  Balmorel was also open at that time, having been made public in 2001.{{efn|
NEMO was also under development in 2011 but it is unclear whether its codebase was public at that point.
}}
{{as of|November 2016}}, the openmod wiki lists 24 such undertakings.&lt;ref name="openmod-models-page"/&gt;

=== Academic literature ===

An innovative 2012 paper presents the case for using "open, publicly accessible software and data as well as [[crowdsourcing]] techniques to develop robust energy analysis tools".&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"/&gt;{{rp|149}}  The paper claims that these techniques can produce high-quality results and are particularly relevant for developing countries.

There is an increasing call for the energy models and [[dataset]]s used for [[energy policy]] analysis and advice to be made public in the interests of transparency and quality.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"/&gt;  A 2010 paper concerning energy efficiency modeling argues that "an open peer review process can greatly support model verification and validation, which are essential for model development".&lt;ref name="mundaca-etal-2010a"/&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref name="mundaca-etal-2010b"/&gt;  One 2012 study argues that the [[source code]] and datasets used in such models should be placed under publicly accessible [[version control]] to enable third-parties to run and check specific models.&lt;ref name="DeCarolisEtal2012"/&gt;  Another 2014 study argues that the public trust needed to underpin a rapid transition in energy systems can only be built through the use of transparent open-source energy models.&lt;ref name="wiese-etal-2014"/&gt;  The UK TIMES project (UKTM) is open source, according to a 2014 presentation, because "energy modelling must be replicable and verifiable to be considered part of the scientific process" and because this fits with the "drive towards clarity and quality assurance in the provision of policy insights".&lt;ref name="strachan-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|8}}  In 2016, the [[Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project]] (DDPP) is seeking to improve its modelling methodologies, a key motivation being "the intertwined goals of transparency, communicability and policy credibility."&lt;ref name="pye-and-bataille-2016"/&gt;{{rp|S27}}  A 2016 paper argues that model-based energy scenario studies, wishing to influence decision-makers in government and industry, must become more comprehensible and more transparent.  To these ends, the paper provides a checklist of transparency criteria that should be completed by modelers.  The authors note however that they "consider open source approaches to be an extreme case of transparency that does not automatically facilitate the comprehensibility of studies for policy advice."&lt;ref name="cao-etal-2016"/&gt;{{rp|4}}  An editorial from 2016 opines that closed energy models providing public policy support "are inconsistent with the open access movement [and] {{sic|public|ally|expected=publicly}} funded research".&lt;ref name="strachan-etal-2016"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  A 2017 paper lists the benefits of open data and models and the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.  The paper makes a number of recommendations for projects wishing to transition to a more open approach.  The authors also conclude that, in terms of openness, energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;  Moreover:

{{quote|Given the importance of rapid global coordinated action on climate mitigation and the clear benefits of shared research efforts and transparently reproducible policy analysis, openness in energy research should not be for the sake of having some code or data available on a website, but as an initial step towards fundamentally better ways to both conduct our research and engage decision-makers with [our] models and the assumptions embedded within them.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|214}}}}

A one-page opinion piece in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature News]]'' from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for scrutiny, currently only ''[[Energy Economics (journal)|Energy Economics]]'' makes this practice mandatory within the energy domain.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"/&gt;

=== Copyright and open energy data ===

Issues surrounding [[copyright]] remain at the forefront with regard to open energy data.  Most energy datasets are collated and published by official or semi-official sources, for example, [[Official statistics|national statistics offices]], [[transmission system operator]]s, and [[Electricity market|electricity market operators]].  The doctrine of open data requires that these datasets be available under [[Copyright#Free licenses|free licenses]] (such as [[Creative Commons license|{{nowrap|CC BY 4.0}}]]) or be in the [[public domain]].  But most published energy datasets carry proprietary licenses, limiting their reuse in numerical and statistical models, open or otherwise.  Measures to enforce [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] have not helped because the associated information is normally licensed to preclude downstream usage.  Recent transparency measures include the 2013 European energy market transparency regulation 543/2013{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="ec-regulation-543-2013"/&gt; and a 2016 amendment to the German Energy Industry Act{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="enwg-111d-2016"/&gt; to establish a nation energy information platform, slated to launch on 1{{nbsp}}July 2017.  Energy databases are protected under general [[Sui generis database right|database law]], irrespective of the copyright status of the information they hold.&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"/&gt;

In December 2017, participants from the Open Energy Modelling Initiative and allied research communities made a written submission to the [[European Commission]] on the {{nowrap|re-use}} of [[public sector information]].&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2017"/&gt;  The document provides a comprehensive account of the data issues faced by researchers engaged in open energy system modeling and energy market analysis and quoted extensively from a German legal opinion.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"/&gt;

=== Public policy support ===

In May 2016 the [[European Union]] announced that "all scientific articles in Europe must be freely accessible as of 2020".&lt;ref name="hendrikx-2016"/&gt;  This is a step in the right direction, but the new policy makes no mention of open software and its importance to the scientific process.&lt;ref name="albers-2016"/&gt;  In August 2016, the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] announced a new federal [[source code]] policy which mandates that at least 20% of custom source code developed by or for any agency of the federal government be released as [[open-source software]] (OSS).&lt;ref name="scott-and-rung-2016"/&gt;  The [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] (DOE) is participating in the program.  The project is hosted on a dedicated website and subject to a three-year pilot.&lt;ref name="scott-and-rung-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="code-gov-website"/&gt;  Open-source campaigners are using the initiative to advocate that European governments adopt similar practices.&lt;ref name="new-2016"/&gt;  In 2017 the [[Free Software Foundation Europe]] (FSFE) issued a [[position paper]] calling for free software and open standards to be central to European science funding, including the flagship [[European Union|EU]] program [[Horizon 2020|Horizon{{nbsp}}2020]].  The position paper focuses on open data and open data processing and the question of open modeling is not traversed per{{nbsp}}se.&lt;ref name="gkotsopoulou-etal-2017"/&gt;

{{distinguish|text=the symbol denoting a [[mathematical operation]] or [[mathematical symbol]]}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''operator''' is generally a [[Map_(mathematics)|mapping]] that acts on elements of a [[space (mathematics)|space]] to produce other elements of the same space. The most common operators are [[linear map]]s, which act on [[vector space]]s. However, when using "linear operator" instead of "linear map", mathematicians often mean actions on vector spaces of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, which also preserve other properties, such as [[continuous function|continuity]]. For example, [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] and [[indefinite integration]] are linear operators; operators that are built from them are called [[differential operator]]s, [[integral operator]]s or [[integro-differential operator]]s.

'''Operator''' is also used for denoting the symbol of a [[mathematical operation]]. This is related with the meaning of "operator" in [[computer programming]], see [[operator (computer programming)]].

== Linear operators ==
{{Main|Linear operator}}

The most common kind of operator encountered are ''linear operators''. Let ''U'' and ''V'' be vector spaces over a field ''K''. A [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] ''A'': ''U'' → ''V'' is linear if
:&lt;math&gt;A(\alpha \mathbf{x} + \beta \mathbf{y}) = \alpha A \mathbf{x} + \beta A \mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;
for all '''x''', '''y''' in ''U'' and for all ''α, β'' in ''K''.  
This means that a linear operator preserves vector space operations, in the sense that it does not matter whether you apply the linear operator before or after the operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In more technical words, linear operators are [[morphism]]s between vector spaces.

In finite-dimensional case linear operators can be represented by [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] in the following way. Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a field, and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be finite-dimensional vector spaces over &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. Let us select a basis &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{u}_n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_m&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Then let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = x^i \mathbf{u}_i&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary vector in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; (assuming [[Einstein convention]]), and &lt;math&gt;A: U \to V&lt;/math&gt; be a linear operator. Then
: &lt;math&gt;A\mathbf{x} = x^i A\mathbf{u}_i = x^i (A\mathbf{u}_i)^j \mathbf{v}_j &lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;a_i^j := (A\mathbf{u}_i)^j \in K&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of the operator &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in fixed bases. &lt;math&gt;a_i^j&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the choice of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;a_i^j x^i = y^j&lt;/math&gt;. Thus in fixed bases n-by-m matrices are in bijective correspondence to linear operators from &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

The important concepts directly related to operators between finite-dimensional vector spaces are the ones of [[Matrix rank|rank]], [[determinant]], [[inverse operator]], and [[eigenspace]].

Linear operators also play a great role in the infinite-dimensional case. The concepts of rank and determinant cannot be extended to infinite-dimensional matrices. This is why very different techniques are employed when studying linear operators (and operators in general) in the infinite-dimensional case. The study of linear operators in the infinite-dimensional case is known as [[functional analysis]] (so called because various classes of functions form interesting examples of infinite-dimensional vector spaces).

The space of [[sequence]]s of real numbers, or more generally sequences of vectors in any vector space, themselves form an infinite-dimensional vector space. The most important cases are sequences of real or complex numbers, and these spaces, together with linear subspaces, are known as [[sequence space]]s. Operators on these spaces are known as [[sequence transformation]]s.

Bounded linear operators over [[Banach space]] form a [[Banach algebra]] in respect to the standard operator norm. The theory of Banach algebras develops a very general concept of [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectra]] that elegantly generalizes the theory of eigenspaces.

== Bounded operators==
{{Main|bounded operator|operator norm|Banach algebra}}

Let ''U'' and ''V'' be two vector spaces over the same [[ordered field]] (for example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;), and they are equipped with [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s. Then a linear operator from ''U'' to ''V'' is called '''bounded''' if there exists ''C &gt; 0'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;||A\mathbf{x}||_V \leq C||\mathbf{x}||_U&lt;/math&gt;
for all '''x''' in ''U''.

Bounded operators form a vector space. On this vector space we can introduce a norm that is compatible with the norms of ''U'' and ''V'':
:&lt;math&gt;||A|| = \inf\{C: ||A\mathbf{x}||_V \leq C||\mathbf{x}||_U\}&lt;/math&gt;.

In case of operators from ''U'' to itself it can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;||AB|| \leq ||A||\cdot||B||&lt;/math&gt;.

Any unital [[normed algebra]] with this property is called a [[Banach algebra]]. It is possible to generalize [[spectral theory]] to such algebras. [[C*-algebra]]s, which are [[Banach algebras]] with some additional structure, play an important role in [[quantum mechanics]].

== Examples ==
=== Geometry ===
{{Main|general linear group|isometry}}

In [[geometry]], additional structures on [[vector space]]s are sometimes studied. Operators that map such vector spaces to themselves bijectively are very useful in these studies, they naturally form [[group (mathematics)|group]]s by composition.

For example, bijective operators preserving the structure of a vector space are precisely the [[invertible]] [[linear operator]]s. They form the [[general linear group]] under composition. They ''do not'' form a vector space under the addition of operators, e.g. both ''id'' and ''-id'' are invertible (bijective), but their sum, 0, is not.

Operators preserving the Euclidean metric on such a space form the [[isometry group]], and those that fix the origin form a subgroup known as the [[orthogonal group]]. Operators in the orthogonal group that also preserve the orientation of vector tuples form the [[special orthogonal group]], or the group of rotations.

=== Probability theory ===
{{Main|Probability theory}}

Operators are also involved in probability theory, such as [[expected value|expectation]], [[variance]],  and [[covariance]].{{clarify|reason = Why these are operators?|date=February 2018}}
&lt;!-- if you know it and you know it please expand... --&gt;

=== Calculus ===
{{Main|differential operator|integral operator}}
From the point of view of [[functional analysis]], [[calculus]] is the study of two linear operators: the [[differential operator]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[Volterra operator|indefinite integral operator]] &lt;math&gt;\int_0^t&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Fourier series and Fourier transform ====

{{Main|Fourier series|Fourier transform}}

The Fourier transform is useful in applied mathematics, particularly physics and signal processing. It is another integral operator; it is useful mainly because it converts a function on one (temporal) domain to a function on another (frequency) domain, in a way effectively [[invertible]]. No information is lost, as there is an inverse transform operator. In the simple case of [[periodic function]]s, this result is based on the theorem that any continuous periodic function can be represented as the sum of a series of [[sine wave]]s and cosine waves:
:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = {a_0 \over 2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{ a_n \cos ( \omega n t ) + b_n \sin ( \omega n t ) } &lt;/math&gt;
The tuple ''(a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...)'' is in fact an element of an infinite-dimensional vector space [[Sequence space|ℓ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], and thus Fourier series is a linear operator.

When dealing with general function '''R''' → '''C''', the transform takes on an [[integral]] form:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = {1 \over \sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{- \infty}^{+ \infty}{g( \omega )e^{ i \omega t } \,d\omega }. &lt;/math&gt;

==== Laplace transform ====

{{Main|Laplace transform}}
The ''Laplace transform'' is another integral operator and is involved in simplifying the process of solving differential equations.

Given ''f'' = ''f''(''s''), it is defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f\}(s) =\int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Fundamental operators on scalar and vector fields ===
{{Main|vector calculus|vector field|scalar field|gradient|divergence|curl (mathematics)|l6=curl}}

Three operators are key to [[vector calculus]]:
* Grad ([[gradient]]), (with operator symbol [[Del|&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;]]) assigns a vector at every point in a scalar field that points in the direction of greatest rate of change of that field and whose norm measures the absolute value of that greatest rate of change.
* Div ([[divergence]]), (with operator symbol [[Del#Divergence|&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot&lt;/math&gt;]]) is a vector operator that measures a vector field's divergence from or convergence towards a given point.
* [[Curl (mathematics)|Curl]], (with operator symbol [[Del#Curl|&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times&lt;/math&gt;]]) is a vector operator that measures a vector field's curling (winding around, rotating around) trend about a given point.

As an extension of vector calculus operators to physics, engineering and tensor spaces, Grad, Div and Curl operators also are often associated with [[Tensor calculus]] as well as vector calculus.&lt;ref name="Vector and Tensor Operators"&gt;{{cite book |isbn= 0-393-92516-1 |url= https://www.amazon.com/Div-Grad-Curl-All-That/dp/0393925161/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388768941&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=div+grad+curl |title=Div Grad Cural and All that |author=h.m. schey |location=New York|publisher=W W Norton|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7663">'''[[Probability]]''' is a measure of the likeliness that an event will occur. Probability is used to quantify an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth we are not certain. The proposition of interest is usually of the form "A specific event will occur." The attitude of mind is of the form "How certain are we that the event will occur?" The certainty we adopt can be described in terms of a numerical measure and this number, between 0 and 1 (where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty), we call probability. Probability theory is used extensively in [[statistics]], [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[philosophy]] to draw conclusions about the likelihood of potential events and the underlying mechanics of complex systems.

A '''Penrose tiling''' is an example of non-periodic [[tessellation|tiling]] generated by an [[aperiodic set of prototiles|aperiodic set]] of [[prototile]]s. Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Sir [[Roger Penrose]], who investigated these sets in the 1970s. The aperiodicity of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match the original. A Penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both [[reflection symmetry]] and fivefold [[rotational symmetry]], as in the diagram at the right.

Penrose tiling is non-periodic, which means that it lacks any [[translational symmetry]]. It is [[self-similarity|self-similar]], so the same patterns occur at larger and larger scales. Thus, the tiling can be obtained through "inflation" (or "deflation") and every finite patch from the tiling occurs infinitely many times. It is a [[quasicrystal]]: implemented as a physical structure a Penrose tiling will produce [[Bragg diffraction]] and its diffractogram reveals both the fivefold symmetry and the underlying long range order.

Various methods to construct Penrose tilings have been discovered, including matching rules, [[substitution tiling|substitutions]] or [[finite subdivision rule|subdivision rule]]s, cut and project schemes and coverings.

==Background and history==

===Periodic and aperiodic tilings===

{{anchor|Figure 1}}[[File:RegularRhombs.svg|right|thumb|150px|Figure 1. Part of a periodic tiling|alt=]]
Penrose tilings are simple examples of [[aperiodic tiling]]s of the [[plane (geometry)|plane]].&lt;ref&gt;General references for this article include {{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|pp=1&amp;ndash;30}}, {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|pp=520&amp;ndash;548 &amp;amp; 558&amp;ndash;579}}, and {{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|pp=170&amp;ndash;206}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[tessellation|tiling]] is a covering of the plane by tiles with no overlaps or gaps; the tiles normally have a [[finite set|finite]] number of shapes, called ''[[prototile]]s'', and [[set (mathematics)|a set]] of prototiles is said to ''admit a tiling'' or ''tile the plane'' if there is a tiling of the plane using only tiles [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to these prototiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|pp=20, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most familiar tilings (e.g., by squares or triangles) are [[periodic tiling|periodic]]: a perfect copy of the tiling can be obtained by [[translation (mathematics)|translating]] all of the tiles by a fixed distance in a given direction. Such a translation is called a ''period'' of the tiling; more informally, this means that a finite region of the tiling repeats itself in periodic intervals. If a tiling has no periods it is said to be ''non-periodic''. A set of prototiles is said to be ''aperiodic'' if it tiles the plane but every such tiling is non-periodic; tilings by aperiodic sets of prototiles are called aperiodic tilings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of aperiodic tilings received new interest in the 1960s when logician [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] noted connections between [[decision problem]]s and tilings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wang|1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he introduced tilings by square plates with colored edges, now known as ''[[Wang domino]]es'' or ''tiles'', and posed the "''[[Domino Problem]]''": to determine whether a given set of Wang dominoes could tile the plane with matching colors on adjacent domino edges. He observed that if this problem were [[recursive set|undecidable]], then there would have to exist an aperiodic set of Wang dominoes. At the time, this seemed implausible, so Wang conjectured no such set could exist.

[[File:Robinson tiles.svg|thumb|right|Robinson's six prototiles|alt=]]
Wang's student [[Robert Berger (mathematician)|Robert Berger]] proved that the Domino Problem was undecidable (so Wang's conjecture was incorrect) in his 1964 thesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=114475|title=Robert Berger}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained an aperiodic set of 20426 Wang dominoes.&lt;ref name="AMSa"&gt;{{Harvnb|Austin|2005a}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also described a reduction to 104 such prototiles; the latter did not appear in his published monograph,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berger|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1968, [[Donald Knuth]] detailed a modification of Berger's set requiring only 92 dominoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The color matching required in a tiling by Wang dominoes can easily be achieved by modifying the edges of the tiles like [[jigsaw puzzle]] pieces so that they can fit together only as prescribed by the edge colorings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raphael Robinson]], in a 1971 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; which simplified Berger's techniques and undecidability proof, used this technique to obtain an aperiodic set of just six prototiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of the Penrose tilings===
{{anchor|Figure 2}}[[File:Penrose Tiling (P1 over P3).svg|250px|thumb|left|Figure 2. The pentagonal Penrose tiling (P1) drawn in black on a colored rhombus tiling (P3) with yellow edges.&lt;ref name="S:173-174"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|pp=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=]]

The first Penrose tiling (tiling P1 below) is an aperiodic set of six prototiles, introduced by [[Roger Penrose]] in a 1974 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Penrose|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is based on pentagons rather than squares. Any attempt to tile the plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps, but [[Johannes Kepler]] showed, in his 1619 work ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'', that these gaps can be filled using [[pentagram]]s ([[star polygon]]s), [[decagon]]s and related shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=section 2.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of these ideas can also be found in the work of [[Albrecht Dürer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luck|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging inspiration from Kepler, Penrose found matching rules (which can be imposed by decorations of the edges) for these shapes, obtaining an aperiodic set. His tiling can be viewed as a completion of Kepler's finite ''Aa'' pattern.&lt;ref name="S:171"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penrose subsequently reduced the number of prototiles to two, discovering the kite and dart tiling (tiling P2 below) and the rhombus tiling (tiling P3 below).&lt;ref name="G:6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhombus tiling was independently discovered by [[Robert Ammann]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="G:19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penrose and [[John H. Conway]] investigated the properties of Penrose tilings, and discovered that a substitution property explained their hierarchical nature; their findings were publicized by [[Martin Gardner]] in his January 1977 "[[Mathematical Games column]]" in ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref name="G1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|loc=chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn|De Bruijn]] explained a method to construct Penrose tilings&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Bruijn|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; from five families of parallel lines as well as a "cut and project method", in which Penrose tilings are obtained as two-dimensional projections from a five-dimensional cubic structure. In this approach, the Penrose tiling is viewed as a set of points, its vertices, while the tiles are geometrical shapes obtained by connecting vertices with edges.

==The Penrose tilings==
[[File:Penrose Tiling (P1).svg|thumb|right|200px|A P1 tiling using Penrose's original set of six prototiles|alt=]]

The three types of Penrose tiling, P1&amp;ndash;P3, are described individually below.&lt;ref name="P1-P3"&gt;The P1&amp;ndash;P3 notation is taken from {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=section 10.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have many common features: in each case, the tiles are constructed from shapes related to the pentagon (and hence to the [[golden ratio]]), but the basic tile shapes need to be supplemented by ''matching rules'' in order to tile aperiodically; these rules may be described using labeled vertices or edges, or patterns on the tile faces &amp;ndash; alternatively the edge profile can be modified (e.g. by indentations and protrusions) to obtain an aperiodic set of prototiles.&lt;ref name="AMSa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GS10.3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=section 10.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The original pentagonal Penrose tiling (P1)===
Penrose's first tiling uses pentagons and three other shapes: a five-pointed "star" (a pentagram), a "boat" (roughly 3/5 of a star) and a "diamond" (a thin rhombus).&lt;ref name="P:32"/&gt; To ensure that all tilings are non-periodic, there are matching rules that specify how tiles may meet each other, and there are three different types of matching rule for the pentagonal tiles. It is common to indicate the three different types of pentagonal tiles using three different colors, as in the figure above right.&lt;ref&gt;"However, as will be explained momentarily, differently colored pentagons will be considered to be different types of tiles." {{Harvnb|Austin|2005a}}; {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=figure 10.3.1}}, shows the edge modifications needed to yield an aperiodic set of prototiles.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kite and dart tiling (P2)===

[[File:Step7wPaper600DPI.png|thumb|Part of the plane covered by Penrose [[tessellation|tiling]] of type P2 (kite and dart). Created by applying several deflations, see section below.]]

Penrose's second tiling uses quadrilaterals called the "kite" and "dart", which may be combined to make a rhombus. However, the matching rules prohibit such a combination.&lt;ref&gt;"The rhombus of course tiles periodically, but we are not allowed to join the pieces in this manner." {{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|pp=6&amp;ndash;7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the kite and dart are composed of two triangles, called ''[[Golden triangle (mathematics)#Golden gnomon|Robinson triangles]]'', after 1975 notes by Robinson.&lt;ref name="GS-R"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|pp=537&amp;ndash; 547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|image1=Kite Dart.svg|image2=Penrose vertex figures.svg|width=225|footer=Kite and dart tiles (top) and the seven possible [[vertex figure]]s in a P2 tiling.}}

*The ''kite'' is a quadrilateral whose four interior angles are 72, 72, 72, and 144 degrees. The kite may be bisected along its axis of symmetry to form a pair of acute Robinson triangles (with angles of 36, 72 and 72 degrees).
*The ''dart'' is a non-convex quadrilateral whose four interior angles are 36, 72, 36, and 216 degrees. The dart may be bisected along its axis of symmetry to form a pair of obtuse Robinson triangles (with angles of 36, 36 and 108 degrees), which are smaller than the acute triangles.

The matching rules can be described in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices.&lt;ref name="S:173"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.&lt;ref name="G:6"/&gt;

These rules often force the placement of certain tiles: for example, the [[concave polygon|concave]] vertex of any dart is necessarily filled by two kites. The corresponding figure (center of the top row in the lower image on the left) is called an "ace" by Conway; although it looks like an enlarged kite, it does not tile in the same way.&lt;ref name="G:8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the concave vertex formed when two kites meet along a short edge is necessarily filled by two darts (bottom right). In fact, there are only seven possible ways for the tiles to meet at a vertex; two of these figures &amp;ndash; namely, the "star" (top left) and the "sun" (top right) &amp;ndash; have 5-fold [[dihedral symmetry]] (by rotations and reflections), while the remainder have a single axis of reflection (vertical in the image).&lt;ref name="G:10=11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|pp=10&amp;ndash;11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the ace and the sun, all of these vertex figures force the placement of additional tiles.&lt;ref name="G:12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhombus tiling (P3)===
[[File:Penrose rhombs matching rules.svg|right|thumb|Matching rule for Penrose rhombs using circular arcs or edge modifications|alt=]]
The third tiling uses a pair of [[rhombus]]es (often referred to as "[[wikt:rhomb|rhombs]]" in this context) with equal sides but different angles.&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt; Ordinary rhombus-shaped tiles can be used to tile the plane periodically, so restrictions must be made on how tiles can be assembled: no two tiles may form a parallelogram, as this would allow a periodic tiling, but this constraint is not sufficient to force aperiodicity, as [[#Figure 1|figure 1 above]] shows.

There are two kinds of tile, both of which can be decomposed into Robinson triangles.&lt;ref name="GS-R"/&gt;
*The thin rhomb '''t''' has four corners with angles of 36, 144, 36, and 144 degrees. The '''t''' rhomb may be bisected along its short diagonal to form a pair of acute Robinson triangles.
*The thick rhomb '''T''' has angles of 72, 108, 72, and 108 degrees. The '''T''' rhomb may be bisected along its long diagonal to form a pair of obtuse Robinson triangles; in contrast to the P2 tiling, these are larger than the acute triangles.

The matching rules distinguish sides of the tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these matching rules are shown in the image on the right. In one form, tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt;

There are 54 cyclically ordered combinations of such angles that add up to 360 degrees at a vertex, but the rules of the tiling allow only seven of these combinations to appear (although one of these arises in two ways).&lt;ref name="S:178"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various combinations of angles and facial curvature allow construction of arbitrarily complex tiles, such as the ''[http://www.murderousmaths.co.uk/books/BKMM7xpc.htm Penrose chickens]''.

==Features and constructions==

===The golden ratio and local pentagonal symmetry===
Several properties and common features of the Penrose tilings involve the [[golden ratio]] {{φ}} = (1+{{radic|5}})/2 (approximately 1.618).&lt;ref name="GS-R" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S:173"/&gt; This is the ratio of [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] lengths to side lengths in a [[regular pentagon]], and satisfies {{φ}} = 1 + 1/{{φ}}.

[[File:Rhomb pentagon.svg|left|thumb|Pentagon with an inscribed thick rhomb (light), acute Robinson triangles (lightly shaded) and a small obtuse Robinson triangle (darker). Dotted lines give additional edges for inscribed kites and darts.|alt=]]

Consequently, the ratio of the lengths of long sides to short sides in the ([[isosceles]]) Robinson triangles is {{φ}}:1. It follows that the ratio of long side lengths to short in both kite and dart tiles is also {{φ}}:1, as are the length ratios of sides to the short diagonal in the thin rhomb '''t''', and of long diagonal to sides in the thick rhomb '''T'''. In both the P2 and P3 tilings, the ratio of the [[Triangle#Computing the area of a triangle|area]] of the larger Robinson triangle to the smaller one is {{φ}}:1, hence so are the ratios of the areas of the kite to the dart, and of the thick rhomb to the thin rhomb. (Both larger and smaller obtuse Robinson triangles can be found in the pentagon on the left: the larger triangles at the top &amp;ndash; the halves of the thick rhomb &amp;ndash; have linear dimensions scaled up by {{φ}} compared to the small shaded triangle at the base, and so the ratio of areas is {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:1.)

Any Penrose tiling has local pentagonal symmetry, in the sense that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold [[rotational symmetry]] about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of [[reflection symmetry]] passing through the point, a [[dihedral group|dihedral]] symmetry [[group (mathematics)|group]].&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt; This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.&lt;ref name="G:9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be at most one center point of global fivefold symmetry: if there were more than one, then rotating each about the other would yield two closer centers of fivefold symmetry, which leads to a mathematical contradiction.&lt;ref name="G:27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are only two Penrose tilings (of each type) with global pentagonal symmetry: for the P2 tiling by kites and darts, the center point is either a "sun" or "star" vertex.&lt;ref name="GS:543"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflation and deflation===
[[File:Pentagon with half dodecahedral net.svg|right|thumb|A pentagon decomposed into six smaller pentagons (half a dodecahedral net) with gaps|alt=]]
Many of the common features of Penrose tilings follow from a hierarchical pentagonal structure given by ''[[Substitution tiling|substitution rules]]'': this is often referred to as ''inflation'' and ''deflation'', or ''composition'' and ''decomposition'', of tilings or (collections of) tiles.&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GS-Terms"&gt;In {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987}}, the term "inflation" is used where other authors would use "deflation" (followed by rescaling). The terms "composition" and "decomposition", which many authors also use, are less ambiguous.&lt;/ref&gt; The substitution rules decompose each tile into smaller tiles of the same shape as those used in the tiling (and thus allow larger tiles to be "composed" from smaller ones). This shows that the Penrose tiling has a scaling self-similarity, and so can be thought of as a [[fractal]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandrarao P.,
''On the fractal nature of Penrose tiling'', Current Science '''79'''(2000) p364 [http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/aug102000/rc80.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Penrose originally discovered the P1 tiling in this way, by decomposing a pentagon into six smaller pentagons (one half of a [[Net (polyhedron)|net]] of a [[dodecahedron]]) and five half-diamonds; he then observed that when he repeated this process the gaps between pentagons could all be filled by stars, diamonds, boats and other pentagons.&lt;ref name="P:32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Penrose|1978|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; By iterating this process indefinitely he obtained one of the two P1 tilings with pentagonal symmetry.&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S:171"/&gt;

====Robinson triangle decompositions====
[[File:Robinson triangle decompositions.svg|left|thumb|Robinson triangles and their decompositions|alt=]]
The substitution method for both P2 and P3 tilings can be described using Robinson triangles of different sizes. The Robinson triangles arising in P2 tilings (by bisecting kites and darts) are called A-tiles, while those arising in the P3 tilings (by bisecting rhombs) are called B-tiles.&lt;ref name="GS-R"/&gt; The smaller A-tile, denoted A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, is an obtuse Robinson triangle, while the larger A-tile, A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, is acute; in contrast, a smaller B-tile, denoted B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, is an acute Robinson triangle, while the larger B-tile, B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, is obtuse.

Concretely, if A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; has side lengths (1, 1, {{φ}}), then A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; has side lengths ({{φ}}, {{φ}}, 1). B-tiles can be related to such A-tiles in two ways:
* If B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; has the same size as A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; then B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is an enlarged version {{φ}}A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; of A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, with side lengths ({{φ}}, {{φ}}, {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{φ}}) &amp;ndash; this decomposes into an A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tile and A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; tile joined along a common side of length 1.
* If instead B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is identified with A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, then B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is a reduced version (1/{{φ}})A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; of A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; with side lengths (1/{{φ}},1/{{φ}},1) &amp;ndash; joining a B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; tile and a B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tile along a common side of length 1 then yields (a decomposition of) an A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tile.

In these decompositions, there appears to be an ambiguity: Robinson triangles may be decomposed in two ways, which are mirror images of each other in the (isosceles) axis of symmetry of the triangle. In a Penrose tiling, this choice is fixed by the matching rules &amp;ndash; furthermore, the matching rules ''also'' determine how the smaller triangles in the tiling compose to give larger ones.&lt;ref name="GS-R"/&gt;

{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|image1=Penrose tilings P2 and P3.svg|image2=Penrose tilings P3 and P2.svg|width=200|footer=Partial inflation of star to yield rhombs, and of a collection of rhombs to yield an ace.}}
It follows that the P2 and P3 tilings are ''mutually locally derivable'': a tiling by one set of tiles can be used to generate a tiling by another &amp;ndash; for example a tiling by kites and darts may be subdivided into A-tiles, and these can be composed in a canonical way to form B-tiles and hence rhombs.&lt;ref name="S:173-174"/&gt; The P2 and P3 tilings are also both mutually locally derivable with the P1 tiling (see [[#Figure 2|figure 2 above]]).&lt;ref name="GS:546"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decomposition of B-tiles into A-tiles may be written
: B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;
(assuming the larger size convention for the B-tiles), which can be summarized in a ''substitution [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]'' equation:&lt;ref name="S:157-158"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|pp=157&amp;ndash;158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} B_L \\ B_S\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ A_S \end{pmatrix}\, .&lt;/math&gt;
Combining this with the decomposition of enlarged {{φ}}A-tiles into B-tiles yields the substitution
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} \varphi A_L \\ \varphi A_S\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} B_L \\ B_S\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ A_S \end{pmatrix}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
so that the enlarged tile {{φ}}A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; decomposes into two A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tiles and one A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; tiles. The matching rules force a particular substitution: the two A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tiles in a {{φ}}A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tile must form a kite &amp;ndash; thus a kite decomposes into two kites and a two half-darts, and a dart decomposes into a kite and two half-darts.&lt;ref name="AMSb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S:183"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enlarged {{φ}}B-tiles decompose into B-tiles in a similar way (via {{φ}}A-tiles).

Composition and decomposition can be iterated, so that, for example
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^n\begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ A_S\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}^n\begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ A_S \end{pmatrix}\, .&lt;/math&gt;
The number of kites and darts in the ''n''th iteration of the construction is determined by the ''n''th power of the substitution matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}^n = \begin{pmatrix} F_{2n+1} &amp; F_{2n} \\ F_{2n} &amp; F_{2n-1} \end{pmatrix}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''n''th [[Fibonacci number]]. The ratio of numbers of kites to darts in any sufficiently large P2 Penrose tiling pattern therefore approximates to the golden ratio {{φ}}.&lt;ref name="G:7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar result holds for the ratio of the number of thick rhombs to thin rhombs in the P3 Penrose tiling.&lt;ref name="AMSb"/&gt;

====Deflation for P2 and P3 tilings====

[[File:AnimSun2k.gif|thumb|Consecutive deflations of the 'sun' vertex in a Penrose [[tessellation|tiling]] of type P2]]

[[File:AnimSun 13.png|thumb|8th deflation of the 'sun' vertex in a Penrose [[tessellation|tiling]] of type P2]]

Starting with a collection of tiles from a given tiling (which might be a single tile, a tiling of the plane, or any other collection), deflation proceeds with a sequence of steps called generations. In one generation of deflation, each tile is replaced with two or more new tiles that are scaled-down versions of tiles used in the original tiling. The [[substitution tiling|substitution rules]] guarantee that the new tiles will be arranged in accordance with the matching rules.&lt;ref name="AMSb"/&gt; Repeated generations of deflation produce a tiling of the original axiom shape with smaller and smaller tiles. &lt;!--Given sufficiently many generations, the tiling will contain a scaled-down version of the axiom that does not touch the boundary of the tiling. The axiom can then be surrounded by full-size tiles corresponding to tiles that appear in the scaled-down version. This extended tiling can be used as a new axiom, producing larger and larger extended tilings and ultimately covers the entire plane.--&gt;
&lt;!--This is an example of successive generations of deflation starting from different axioms. In the case of the 'Sun' and 'Star', the scaled-down interior version of the axiom appears in generation 2. The 'Sun' also appears in the interior of its generation 3.--&gt;

This rule for dividing the tiles is a [[subdivision rule]].

====Consequences and applications====
Inflation and deflation yield a method for constructing kite and dart (P2) tilings, or rhombus (P3) tilings, known as ''up-down generation''.&lt;ref name="G:8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AMSb"&gt;{{Harvnb|Austin|2005b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S:183"/&gt;

The Penrose tilings, being non-periodic, have no translational symmetry &amp;ndash; the pattern cannot be shifted to match itself over the entire plane. However, any bounded region, no matter how large, will be repeated an infinite number of times within the tiling. Therefore, a finite patch cannot differentiate between the uncountably many Penrose tilings, nor even determine which position within the tiling is being shown.&lt;ref&gt;"... any finite patch that we choose in a tiling will lie inside a single inflated tile if we continue moving far enough up in the inflation hierarchy. This means that anywhere that tile occurs at that level in the hierarchy, our original patch must also occur in the original tiling. Therefore, the patch will occur infinitely often in the original tiling and, in fact, in every other tiling as well." {{Harvnb|Austin|2005a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This shows in particular that the number of distinct Penrose tilings (of any type) is [[uncountably infinite]]. Up-down generation yields one method to parameterize the tilings, but other methods use Ammann bars, pentagrids, or cut and project schemes.&lt;ref name="AMSb"/&gt;

[[File:Gummelt decagon.svg|300px|thumb|right|Gummelt's decagon (left) with the decomposition into kites and darts indicated by dashed lines; the thicker darker lines bound an inscribed ace and thick rhomb; possible overlaps (right) are by one or two red aces.&lt;ref name="LR"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lord|Ranganathan|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=]]

In 1996, German mathematician Petra Gummelt demonstrated that a covering (so called to distinguish it from a non-overlapping tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gummelt|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) tiling. Similarly, a P3 tiling can be obtained by inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.

These coverings have been considered as a realistic model for the growth of [[quasicrystals]]: the overlapping decagons are 'quasi-unit cells' analogous to the [[unit cell]]s from which crystals are constructed, and the matching rules maximize the density of certain atomic clusters.&lt;ref name="LR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steinhardt|Jeong|1996}}; see also {{cite web|first=Paul J.|last=Steinhardt|title=A New Paradigm for the Structure of Quasicrystals|url=http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~steinh/quasi/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related tilings===
[[File:Tie and Navette Tiling.png|300px|left|thumb|Tie and Navette tiling (in red on a Penrose background)]]
The three variants of the Penrose tiling are mutually locally derivable. Selecting some subsets from the vertices of a P1 tiling allows to produce other non-periodic tilings. If the corners of one pentagon in P1 are labeled in succession by ''1,3,5,2,4'' an unambiguous tagging in all the pentagons is established, the order being either clockwise or counterclockwise.
Points with the same label define a tiling by Robinson triangles while points with the numbers 3 and 4 on them define the vertices of a Tie-and-Navette tiling.&lt;ref&gt;Luck R., "Penrose Sublattices", ''Journal of Non Crystalline Solids'' 117-8 (90)832-5&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also other related unequivalent tilings, such as the hexagon-boat-star and Mikulla&amp;ndash;Roth tilings. For instance, if the matching rules for the rhombus tiling are reduced to a specific restriction on the angles permitted at each vertex, a binary tiling is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lançon|Billard|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its underlying symmetry is also fivefold but it is not a quasicrystal. It can be obtained either by decorating the rhombs of the original tiling with smaller ones, or by applying substitution rules, but not by de Bruijn's cut-and-project method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godrèche|Lançon|1992}}; see also {{cite web|url=http://tilings.math.uni-bielefeld.de/substitution/binary|title=Binary|author= D. Frettlöh, F. Gähler, and E. Harriss|work=Tilings Encyclopedia |publisher= Department of Mathematics, University of Bielefeld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penrose tilings and art===
[[File:Salesforce Transit Center main entrance.jpg|thumb|left|[[Salesforce Transit Center]] in San Francisco.  The outer "skin", made of white aluminum, is perforated in the pattern of a Penrose tiling.]]
The aesthetic value of tilings has long been appreciated, and remains a source of interest in them; here the visual appearance (rather than the formal defining properties) of Penrose tilings has attracted attention. The similarity with [[girih tiles|some decorative patterns]] used in the Middle East has been noted;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaslavskiĭ|Sagdeev|Usikov|Chernikov|1988}}; {{Harvnb|Makovicky|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Sebastian R. |last=Prange |author2=Peter J. Lu |title=The Tiles of Infinity |date=2009-09-01 |publisher=Aramco Services Company |url =http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200905/the.tiles.of.infinity.htm |work =Saudi Aramco World |pages =24–31 |accessdate = 2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the physicists [[Peter J. Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt]] have presented evidence that a Penrose tiling underlies some examples of medieval [[Islamic geometric patterns]], such as the [[girih]] (strapwork) tilings at the [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine in [[Isfahan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lu|Steinhardt|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Drop City]] artist Clark Richert used Penrose rhombs in artwork in 1970 - derived by projecting the rhombic triacontahedron shadow onto a plane observing the embedded "fat" rhombi and "skinny" rhombi which tile together to produce the non-periodic tessellation. Art historian [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Martin Kemp]] has observed that [[Albrecht Dürer]] sketched similar motifs of a rhombus tiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kemp|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

San Francisco's new $2.2 billion [[Transbay Transit Center]] features perforations in its exterior's undulating white metal skin in the Penrose pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://sf.curbed.com/archives/2013/07/11/check_out_the_proposed_skin_for_the_transbay_transit_center.php |title=Check Out the Proposed Skin for the Transbay Transit Center |date=11 July 2013 |first=Sally |last=Kuchar |journal=[[Curbed]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The floor of the atrium of the [[Noel Bayliss|Bayliss]] Building at The University of Western Australia is tiled with Penrose tiles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treasures.uwa.edu.au/treasures/66/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 [[Miami University]] used a Penrose tiling executed in terrazzo to decorate the Bachelor Hall courtyard in their Department of Mathematics and Statistics.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.lib.miamioh.edu/epub/tilings/david.pdf The Penrose Tiling at Miami University]'' by David Kullman, Presented at the [[Mathematical Association of America]] Ohio Section Meeting [[Shawnee State University]], 24 October 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Andrew Wiles]] Building, the location of the Mathematics Department at the [[University of Oxford]] as of October 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/new-building |title=New Building Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes a section of Penrose tiling as the paving of its entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/865 |title=Penrose Pavinge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pedestrian part of the street Keskuskatu in central Helsinki is paved using a form of Penrose tiling. The work was finished in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hs.fi/tiede/a1407209514060&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Q.E.D.''' (also written QED and in italics: ''QED'') is an [[initialism]] of the [[List of Latin phrases (full)|Latin phrase]] {{lang|la|'''"quod erat demonstrandum"'''}} meaning "what was to be demonstrated" or "what was to be shown."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quod%20erat%20demonstrandum|title=Definition of QUOD ERAT DEMONSTRANDUM|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some may also use a less direct translation instead: "thus it has been demonstrated." Traditionally, the phrase is placed in its abbreviated form at the end of a [[mathematical proof]] or [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[Logical argument|argument]] when the original proposition has been restated exactly, as the conclusion of the demonstration or completion of the proof.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Euclid's Elements translated from Greek by Thomas L. Heath. 2003 Green Lion Press pg. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and early use ==
The phrase, ''quod erat demonstrandum'', is a translation into [[List of Latin phrases|Latin]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὅπερ ἔδει δεῖξαι}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|hoper edei deixai}}; abbreviated as ''ΟΕΔ''). Translating from the Latin into English yields, "what was to be demonstrated", however, translating the Greek phrase {{lang|grc|ὅπερ ἔδει δεῖξαι}} produces a slightly different meaning. Since the verb {{lang|grc|"δείκνυμι"}} also means ''to show'' or ''to prove'',&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddei%2Fknumi δείκνυμι] at [[LSJ]].&lt;/ref&gt; a better translation from the Greek would read, "The very thing it was required to have shown."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The Greek phrase was used by many early Greek mathematicians, including [[Euclid]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Euc.+2&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0085 Elements 2.5] by Euclid (ed. J. L. Heiberg), retrieved 16 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Archimedes]].

[[File:Philippe van Lansberge 1604 QED.png|right|thumb|Philippe van Lansberge's 1604 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fg9KAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=quod-erat-demonstrandum+date:0-1700&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#PPA3,M1 ''Triangulorum Geometriæ''] used {{lang|la|quod erat demonstrandum}} to conclude some proofs; others ended with phrases such as {{lang|la|sigillatim deinceps demonstrabitur}}, {{lang|la|magnitudo demonstranda est}}, and other variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Triangulorum Geometriæ|author=Philippe van Lansberge|year=1604|pages=1–5|publisher=Apud Zachariam Roman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fg9KAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PT4&amp;dq=quod-erat-demonstrandum+date:0-1700}}&lt;/ref&gt;|418x418px]]

During the European [[Renaissance]], scholars often wrote in Latin, and phrases such as ''Q.E.D.'' were often used to conclude proofs.

[[File:Spinoza Ethica Pars1 Prop1.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]'s original text of ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', Part 1,  ''Q.E.D.'' is used at the end of ''Demonstratio'' of ''Propositio III'' on the right hand page]]
Perhaps the most famous use of ''Q.E.D.'' in a philosophical argument is found in the ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' of [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[List of works published posthumously|published posthumously]] in 1677. Written in Latin, it is considered by many to be Spinoza's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. The style and system of the book are, as Spinoza says, "demonstrated in [[Geometry|geometrical]] order", with [[axiom]]s and definitions followed by [[proposition (mathematics)|propositions]]. For Spinoza, this is a considerable improvement over [[René Descartes]]'s writing style in the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]]'', which follows the form of a [[diary]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Chief Works of Benedict De Spinoza'', translated by R. H. M. Elwes, 1951. {{isbn|0-486-20250-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference from Q.E.F. ==
There is another Latin phrase with a slightly different meaning, usually shortened similarly, but being less common in use. {{lang|la|Quod erat faciendum}}, originating from the Greek geometers' closing {{lang|grc|ὅπερ ἔδει ποιῆσαι}} ({{transl|grc|hoper edei poiēsai}}), meaning "which had to be done". Because of the difference in meaning, the two phrases should not be confused.

[[Euclid]] used the phrase, Quod Erat Faciendum (Q.E.F.), to close propositions that were not proofs of theorems, but constructions. For example, Euclid's first proposition showing how to construct an [[equilateral triangle]], given one side, is concluded this way.

There is no common formal English equivalent, although the end of a proof may be announced with a simple statement such as "this completes the proof", "as required", "hence proved", "ergo", or by using a similar locution. WWWWW or W&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; – an abbreviation of "Which Was What Was Wanted" – has been used similarly. Often this is considered to be more tongue-in-cheek than the usual Halmos symbol ''(see below)'' or ''Q.E.D.''

== Typographical forms used symbolically ==
{{Main|Tombstone (typography)}}
Due to the paramount importance of [[Mathematical proof|proofs in mathematics]], mathematicians since the time of [[Euclid]] have developed conventions to demarcate the beginning and end of proofs. In printed English language texts, the formal statements of [[theorem]]s, [[lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]], and propositions are set in italics by tradition. The beginning of a proof usually follows immediately thereafter, and is indicated by the word "proof" in boldface or italics. On the other hand, several symbolic conventions exist to indicate the end of a proof.

While some authors still use the classical abbreviation, Q.E.D., this practice is increasingly viewed as archaic or even pretentious.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Paul Halmos]] pioneered the use of a solid black square at the end of a proof as a Q.E.D symbol, a practice which has become standard, although not universal. Halmos adopted this use of a symbol from magazine typography customs in which simple geometric shapes had been used to indicate the end of an article. This symbol was later called the ''[[Tombstone (typography)|tombstone]]'' or ''Halmos symbol'' or even a ''halmos'' by mathematicians. Often the Halmos symbol is drawn on chalkboard to signal the end of a proof during a lecture, although this practice is not so common as its use in printed text.

The tombstone symbol appears in [[TeX]] as the character &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; (filled square, \blacksquare) and sometimes, as a &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; (hollow square, \square). In the AMS Theorem Environment for LaTeX, the hollow square is the default end-of-proof symbol. [[Unicode]] explicitly provides the "End of proof" character, U+220E (∎). Some authors use other Unicode symbols to note the end of a proof, including, ▮ (U+25AE, a black vertical rectangle), and ‣ (U+2023, a triangular bullet). Other authors have adopted two forward slashes (//) or four forward slashes (////).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Real and Complex Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1987|isbn=0-07-100276-6|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, authors have elected to segregate proofs typographically by displaying them as indented blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=0-07-054235-X|location=New York|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern humorous use ==
In [[Joseph Heller]]'s book ''[[Catch-22]]'', [[Chaplain Tappman|the Chaplain]], having been told to examine a forged letter allegedly signed by him (which he knew he didn't sign), verified that his ''name'' was in fact there. His investigator replied, "Then you wrote it. Q.E.D." The chaplain said he didn't write it and that it wasn't his handwriting, to which the investigator replied, "Then you signed your name in somebody else's handwriting again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6k30_63q08C&amp;pg=PA84|title=Catch-22|work=|last=Heller|first=Joseph|date=|accessdate=15 July 2011|isbn=978-0-573-60685-4|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1978 science-fiction radio comedy, and later in the television and novel adaptations of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', "Q.E.D." is referred to in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (fictional)|the Guide's]] entry for the [[Babel fish (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|babel fish]], when it is claimed that the babel fish – which serves the "mind-bogglingly" useful purpose of being able to translate any spoken language when inserted into a person's ear – is used as evidence for existence and non-existence of God. The exchange from the novel is as follows: "'I refuse to prove I exist,' says God, 'for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.' 'But,' says Man, 'The babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.' 'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas Adams|title=[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]|publisher=[[Pan Macmillan]]|series=[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]|edition=Film tie-in|date=2005|location=Basingstoke and Oxford|pages=62–64|isbn=0-330-43798-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Neal Stephenson]]'s 1999 novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'', Q.E.D. is used as a punchline to several humorous anecdotes in which characters go to great lengths to prove something non-mathematical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephenson|first1=Neal|title=Cryptonomicon|date=1999|publisher=Avon Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-06-051280-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer-songwriter [[Thomas Dolby]]'s 1988 song "Airhead" includes the lyric, "Quod erat demonstrandum, baby," referring to the self-evident vacuousness of the eponymous subject; and in response, a female voice squeals, delightedly, "Oooh... you speak French!" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/music/preview/Titfyr7lz4lzc67o5yrek7drnaq|title=Airhead – Thomas Dolby|website=play.google.com|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11678">A [[scientific society]], the '''Quaternion Society''' was an "International Association for Promoting the Study of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics". At its peak it consisted of about 60 mathematicians spread throughout the academic world that were experimenting with [[quaternion]]s and other [[hypercomplex number]] systems. The guiding light was [[Alexander Macfarlane]] who served as its Secretary initially, and became President in 1909. The Association published a ''Bibliography'' in 1904 and a ''Bulletin'' (annual report) from 1900 to 1913.

The ''Bulletin'' became a [[review journal]] for topics in [[vector analysis]] and [[abstract algebra]] such as the theory of [[equipollence (geometry)|equipollence]]. The mathematical work reviewed pertained largely to [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] and [[linear algebra]] as the methods were in rapid development at the time.
==Genesis==
In 1895, Professor P. Molenbroek of The Hague, Holland, and Shinkichi Kimura studying at Yale put out a call for scholars to form the society in widely circulated journals: [[Nature (journal)|Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Kimura &amp; P. Molenbroek (1895) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v52/n1353/pdf/052545a0.pdf Friends and Fellow Workers in Quaternions] [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 52:545–6 (#1353)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science (journal)|Science]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Kimura &amp; P. Molenbroek (1895) ''To those Interested in Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics'' [[Science (journal)|Science]] 2nd Ser, 2:524&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;"Notes" [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] 2:53,&amp;nbsp;182; 5:317&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giuseppe Peano]] also announced the society formation in his ''Rivista di Matematica''. 

The call to form an Association was encouraged by Macfarlane in 1896:
:The logical harmony and unification of the whole of mathematical analysis ought to be kept in view. The algebra of space ought to include the algebra of the plane as a special case, just as the algebra of the plane includes the algebra of the line…When vector analysis is developed and presented...we may expect to see many zealous cultivators, many fruitful applications, and, finally, universal diffusion...May the movement initiated by Messrs. Molenbroek and Kimura hasten the realization of this happy result.&lt;ref&gt;A. Macfarlane (1896) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1624707 Quaternions] [[Science (journal)|Science]] (2) 3:99–100, link from [[Jstor]] early content&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897 the [[British Association]] met in [[Toronto]] where vector products were discussed:
:Professor [[Olaus Henrici|Henrici]] proposed a new notation to denote the different products of vectors, which consists in using square brackets for vector products and round brackets for scalar products. He likewise advocated adoption of Heaviside’s term "ort" for vector, the [[tensor of a quaternion|tensor]] of which is the number 1. Prof. A. Macfarlane read a communication on the solution of the cubic equation in which he explained how the two binomials in [[cubic function#Cardano’s method|Cardano’s formula]] may be treated as complex quantities, either circular or hyperbolic, all the roots of the cubic can then be deduced by a general method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v56/n1454/pdf/056461a0.pdf "Physics at the British Association"]  [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 56:461,2 (# 1454)&lt;/ref&gt;

A system of national secretaries was announced in the AMS Bulletin in 1899: [[Alexander MacAulay]] for Australasia, [[Victor Schlegel]] for Germany, Joly for Great Britain and Ireland, Giuseppe Peano for Italy, Kimura for Japan, [[Aleksandr Kotelnikov]] for Russia, [[F. Kraft]] for Switzerland, and [[Arthur Stafford Hathaway]] for the USA. For France the national secretary was Paul Genty, an engineer with the division of Ponts et Chaussees, and a quaternion collaborator with [[Charles-Ange Laisant]], author of ''Methode des Quaterniones'' (1881).

[[Victor Schlegel]] reported&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Schlegel]] (1899) "Internationaler Verein zur Beförderung des Studiums der Quaternionen und verwandter Systeme der Mathematik", [[Monatshefte für Mathematik]] 10(1):376&lt;/ref&gt; on the new institution in the [[Monatshefte für Mathematik]].

==Officers==
When the Society was organized in 1899, [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] was chosen as president, but he declined for reasons of poor health.

The first President was [[Robert Stawell Ball]] and [[Alexander Macfarlane]] served as Secretary and Treasurer. In 1905 [[Charles Jasper Joly]] took over as President and L. van Elfrinkhof as Treasurer while Macfarlane continued as Secretary. In 1909 Macfarlane became President, James Byrnie Shaw became Secretary, and van Elfrinkhof continued as Treasurer. The next year Macfarlane and Shaw continued in their posts while Macfarlane also absorbed the office of Treasurer. When Macfarlane died in 1913 after nearly completing the issue of the Bulletin, Shaw completed it and wound up the Association.

The rules state that the President had the power of veto.

==Bulletin==
The ''Bulletin of the Association Promoting the Study of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics'' was issued nine times under the editorship of Alexander Macfarlane. Every issue listed the officers of the Association, governing council, rules, members, and a [[financial statement]] from the [[treasurer]]. Today [[HathiTrust]] provides access to these publications that are mainly of historical interest:

==Bibliography==
Published in 1904 at Dublin, cradle of quaternions, the 86 page ''Bibliography of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics''&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Macfarlane]] (1904) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=03030001 Bibliography of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics], weblink from [[Cornell University]] ''Historical Math Monographs''.
*[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v69/n1800/pdf/069604a0.pdf Review:''Bibliography of Quaternions''] in ''Nature'' 69:604&lt;/ref&gt; cited some one thousand references. The publication set a professional standard; for instance the ''Manual of Quaternions'' (1905) of Joly has no bibliography beyond citation of Macfarlane.
Furthermore, in 1967 when M.J. Crowe published ''[[A History of Vector Analysis]]'', he wrote in the preface (page ix) :
:''Concerning bibliography''. No formal bibliographical section has been included with this book. ... the need for a bibliography is greatly diminished by the existence of a book that lists nearly all relevant primary documents published to about 1912, this is Alexander Macfarlane’s ''Bibliography'' ...

Every year more papers and books appeared that were of interest to Association members so it was necessary to update the ''Bibliography'' with supplements in the ''Bulletin''. The categories used to group the items in the supplements give a sense of the changing focus of the Association:

==Aftermath==

In 1913 Macfarlane died, and as related by [[Dirk Struik]], the Society "became a victim of the first World War".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dirk Struik]] (1967) ''A Concise History of Mathematics'', 3rd edition, page 172, [[Dover Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

James Byrnie Shaw, the surviving officer, wrote 50 book notices for American mathematical publications.&lt;ref&gt;See author=Shaw, James Byrnie at [[Mathematical Reviews]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The final article review in the ''Bulletin'' was [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498;view=1up;seq=490 The Wilson and Lewis Algebra of Four-Dimensional Space] written by J. B. Shaw. He summarizes,
:This algebra is applied to the representation of the Minkowski time-space world.  It enables all analytical work to be with reals, although the geometry becomes non-Euclidean.
The article reviewed was "The space-time manifold of relativity, the non-euclidean geometry of mechanics, and electromagnetics".&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Wilson &amp; G. N. Lewis (1912) Proceedings of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] 48: 389–507&lt;/ref&gt;
However, when the [[textbook]] ''The Theory of Relativity'' by [[Ludwik Silberstein]] in 1914 was made available as an English understanding of [[Minkowski space]], the algebra of [[biquaternion]]s was applied, but without references to the British background or Macfarlane or other quaternionists of the Society. The language of quaternions had become international, providing content to [[set theory]] and expanded [[mathematical notation]], and expressing [[mathematical physics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1496">In [[computational learning theory]], '''sample exclusion dimensions''' arise in the study of exact [[concept learning]] with queries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Algorithmic Learning Theory: 12th International Conference, ALT 2001, Washington, DC, USA, November 2001, Proceedings |editor=N. Abe |editor2=R. Khardon |editor3=T. Zeugmann |author=D. Angluin |chapter=Queries Revisited |year=2001 |publisher=Springer |pages=26–28 |isbn=3-540-42875-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[algorithmic learning theory]], a '''concept''' over a domain ''X'' is a [[Boolean function]] over ''X''. Here we only consider finite domains. A '''partial approximation''' ''S'' of a concept ''c'' is a Boolean function over &lt;math&gt;Y\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; such that ''c'' is an extension to ''S''.

Let ''C'' be a class of concepts and ''c'' be a concept (not necessarily in ''C''). Then a '''specifying set''' for c w.r.t. ''C'', denoted by ''S'' is a partial approximation ''S'' of ''c'' such that ''C'' contains at most one extension to ''S''. If we have observed a specifying set for some concept w.r.t. ''C'', then we have enough information to verify a concept in ''C'' with at most one more mind change.
 
The '''exclusion dimension''', denoted by ''XD''(''C''), of a concept class is the maximum of the size of the minimum specifying set of ''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; with respect to ''C'', where ''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a concept not in ''C''.

There is also a two-fluid model which helps explain the behavior of [[superfluid]] [[helium]].  This model states that there will be two components in liquid helium below its [[lambda point]] (the temperature where superfluid forms).  These components are a normal fluid and a superfluid component.  Each liquid has a different density and together their sum makes the total density, which remains constant.  The ratio of superfluid density to the total density increases as the temperature approaches absolute zero.
