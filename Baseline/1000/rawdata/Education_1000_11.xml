'''AP Russian Language and Culture''' is a proposed [[Advanced Placement]] course and examination, in development since 2005.&lt;ref name="APPG2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap05_programguide_46836.pdf|title=AP Program Guide, 2005–06|publisher=The College Board|accessdate=August 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is being developed through the [[American Council of Teachers of Russian]], in collaboration with the [[College Board]] and with funding from the [[U.S. Department of Education]] and the [[National Security Education Program]].&lt;ref name="CBAPRHome"&gt;{{cite web|deadurl=yes |title=AP Russian Language and Culture Course Home Page |publisher=College Board |url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/37220.html |archivedate=January 13, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113231114/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/37220.html |accessdate=August 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AP Russian Language is equivalent to a second-year college-level [[Russian language]] course. Students enrolling in AP Russian Language and Culture are typically in their fourth or fifth year of language study, or have had equivalent experience with the language.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

The exam is reported with a score of 1 to 5. A prototype exam was administered to students in 2010.&lt;ref name="Marshall RLJ"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Camelot|title=Examining the Validity of the 2010 Prototype AP Russian Exam through a College Comparability Study|journal=Russian Language Journal|volume=60|pages=319–331|url=http://rlj.americancouncils.org/issues/60/files/Marshall_2010.pdf|accessdate=August 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Academic administration''' is a branch of [[university]] or [[college]] employees responsible for the maintenance and supervision of the institution and separate from the [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] or [[academics]], although some personnel may have joint responsibilities.  Some type of separate administrative structure exists at almost all [[academic]] institutions, as fewer and fewer schools are governed by employees who are also involved in academic or scholarly work. Many senior administrators are academics who have advanced degrees and no longer teach or conduct research.

==Key responsibilities==

Key broad administrative responsibilities (and thus administrative units) in academic institutions include:
* Admissions
* Supervision of academic affairs such as hiring, promotion, [[tenure]], and evaluation (with faculty input where appropriate);
* Maintenance of official records (typically supervised by a [[Registrar (education)|registrar]]);
* Maintenance and audit of financial flows and records;
* Maintenance and construction of campus buildings (the ''physical plant'');
* Maintenance of the campus grounds;
* Safety and security of people and property on the campus (often organized as an office of [[public safety]] or [[campus police]]);
* Maintenance and construction 
* Supervision and support of campus [[computer]]s and [[local area network|network]] ([[information technology]]).
* Fundraising from private individuals and foundations ("development" or "advancement")
* Research administration (including grants and contract administration, and institutional compliance with federal and state regulations)
* Public affairs (including relations with the media, the community, and local, state, and federal governments)
* Student services such as disability services, career counselling and library staff.

==Administrative titles==
The chief executive, the administrative and educational head of a university, depending on tradition and location, may be termed the [[Chancellor (education)#University president|university president]], the [[Provost (education)|provost]], the [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] (the United States), the [[Chancellor (education)#Vice-chancellor|vice-chancellor]] (many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries), [[Principal (academia)|principal]] (Scotland and Canada), or [[Rector (academia)|rector]] (Europe, Russia, Asia and the Middle East).

An administrative executive in charge of a university department or of some schools, may be termed a [[Dean (education)|dean]] or some variation, such as dean emeritus. The chief executive of academic establishments other than universities, may be termed headmaster or [[head teacher]] (schools), director (used to reflect various positions ranging from the head of an institution to the head of a program), or principal, as used in [[primary education]].

==By country==
{{globalize|date=December 2012}}
Academic administrations are structured in various ways at different institutions and in different countries.

===Australia===
Full-time [[tertiary education]] administrators emerged as a distinct role in Australia from the mid-1970s, as institutions sought to deal with their increasing size and complexity, along with a broadening of their aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Maree.  'Defining administrators and new professionals.' PERSPECTIVES, VOLUME 4, NUMBER 1, 2000: pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; As the professionalism of tertiary administrators has developed, there has been a corresponding push to recognise the uniqueness and validity of their role in the academic environment.&lt;ref&gt;GORNALL, L. (1988) `New professionals’: changes and occupational roles in higher education. perspectives, 3(2), pp. 44-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Maree and Ian Dobson. 'Fear and Loathing in University Staffing: The Case of Australian Academic and General Staff.' Journal of Higher Education Management and Policy, Volume 15, No. 3,: pp. 123.133.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2004}}, general staff comprised over half the employees at Australian universities.&lt;ref name=Szerkerez2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szekeres|first=Judy|title=Professional staff carve out a new space|journal=Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management|year=2011|volume=33|issue=6|pages=679–691|doi=10.1080/1360080X.2011.621193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 65% of these are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Michelle|author2=Marchant, Teresa|title=Female administrative managers in Australian universities: not male and not academic|journal=Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management|year=2011|volume=33|issue=6|pages=567–581|doi=10.1080/1360080X.2011.621184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There has recently been a shift in the preferred nomenclature for non-academic staff at Australian universities, from "general staff" to "professional staff".&lt;ref name=Szerkerez2011/&gt;  It has been argued that the changing in role of the professional staff has been due to the changing work that they are performing, as professional staff assist students with technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=C.|title=Changing technologies, changing identities: A case study of professional staff and their contributions to learning and teaching|journal=Perspectives: Policy and Practice in Higher Education|date=2013|volume=17|issue=2|pages=62–70|doi=10.1080/13603108.2012.716376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overarching body for all staff working in administration and management in Australia is the [[Association for Tertiary Education Management]].

===United Kingdom===

====Administrative structures====

The structures for administration and management in higher education in the United Kingdom vary significantly between institutions. Any description of a general structure will therefore not apply to some or even many institutions, and therefore any general statement of structures may be misleading. Not all UK universities have the post of Registrar.

The Director of Finance may report to the Registrar or directly to the Vice-Chancellor, whilst other senior posts may or may not report to the Registrar. This next tier of senior positions might include Directors of Human Resources, Estates, and Corporate Affairs. The Academic Registrar is often included in this next tier. Their role is mostly to accomplish student-facing administrative processes such as admissions, student records, complaints, and graduation.

====Professional associations====

The overarching body for all staff working in administration and management in the UK is the [[Association of University Administrators]].

===United States===

====Presidents and chancellors====

In the [[United States]], a college or university is typically supervised by a [[University President|President]] or [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] who reports regularly to a [[Board of Trustees]] (made up of individuals from outside the institution) and who serves as [[Chief Executive Officer]]. Most large colleges and universities now use an administrative structure with a tier of vice presidents, among whom the [[Provost (education)|Provost]] (or Vice President for Academic Affairs, or Academic Dean) serves as the chief academic officer.

==== Deans ====

[[Dean (education)|Deans]] may supervise various and more specific aspects of the institution, or may be CEOs of entire campuses.  They may report directly to the president or chancellor. The division of responsibility among deans varies widely among institutions; some are chiefly responsible for clusters of academic fields (such as the [[humanities]] or [[natural sciences]]) or whole academic units (such as a [[graduate school]] or [[college]]), while others are responsible for non-academic but campus-wide concerns such as [[minority group|minority]] affairs.  In some cases a [[provost (education)|provost]] supervises the institution's entire academic staff, occupying a position generally superior to any dean.  In other instances the Dean of a College may be the equivalent to a Provost or Vice Chancellor or Vice President for Academic Affairs.  Below deans in the administrative hierarchy are heads of individual [[academic department]]s and of individual administrative departments from groundskeeping to libraries to registrars of records.  These heads (commonly styled "chairs" or "directors") then supervise the faculty and staff of their individual departments.

==== Departmental Chairs ====

The Chair of a department is typically a tenured or at least tenure-track faculty member, supported by administrative staff.

==== Administrative staff ====

All levels of the university have administrative staff, reporting to Chancellors, Presidents, Provosts, Deans, and Departmental Chairs. Each department is typically led by a Management Services Officer (MSO), the departmental head of administrative staff, who reports to the Chair of the department. Front Desk staff, Admissions staff, Graduate and Undergraduate Student Counselors, and other staff report to the MSO.

An '''academic equivalency evaluation''' is an analytical report which determines the equivalency in the [[United States]] [[educational system]] of a potential US [[immigrant]]'s foreign academic and professional credentials. This evaluation determines the level of [[education]] and number of years completed, as well as the field of [[Academic specialization|specialization]]. Academic evaluations consider the educational system of the foreign country, the quality of the [[university]] attended by the candidate, the [[credit hour]]s and number of years of [[coursework]], the nature of the courses, and the grades attained in the courses.

==Uses==
An academic equivalency evaluation is primarily required for [[H-1B visa]] applicants who have not earned an [[academic degree]] at a university or college in the United States, but have acquired a degree from another country. H-1B visas require a [[bachelor's degree]] or its equivalent as a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/08/1184- 8 U.S.C. 1184(i)(1)(B)]&lt;/ref&gt; Academic equivalency evaluations provide the equivalent basis the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] accepts in order to apply for an H-1B visa. Academic equivalency evaluations can also be used towards other visas such as [[TN status]], [[E-3 visa|E-3]], [[L-1B]], [[Permanent residence (United States)|Green Card]], and [[United States Permanent Resident Card#Application process for employment-based visa|I-140]].

==Documents Required==
Companies that provide academic equivalency evaluations typically require copies of any diplomas, transcripts, and post-graduate degrees, that a candidate may have.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trustfortecorp.com/academic.html Requirements for an academic equivalency evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt; Academic degrees that can be evaluated may include, but not limited to; bachelor's degrees, [[master's degrees]], or [[Ph.D.]], etc.

'''Adolescent egocentrism''' is a term that [[David Elkind]] used to describe the phenomenon of adolescents' inability to distinguish between their perception of what others think about them and what people actually think in reality.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;  David Elkind's theory on adolescent egocentrism is drawn from [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|Piaget's theory on cognitive developmental stages]], which argues that formal operations enable adolescents to construct imaginary situations and abstract thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Inhelder &amp; Piaget|title=The growth of logical thinking from childhood to adolescence|date=1958|publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Accordingly, adolescents are able to conceptualize their own thoughts and conceive of other people's thoughts.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elkind|first=David|title=Egocentrism in Adolescence|journal=Child Development|date=1967|volume=38 | issue = 4|pages=1025–1034|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1967.tb04378.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Elkind pointed out that adolescents tend to focus mostly on their own perceptions – especially on their behaviors and appearance – because of the "physiological metamorphosis" they experience during this period. This leads to adolescents' belief that other people are as attentive to their behaviors and appearance as they are of themselves.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; According to Elkind, adolescent egocentrism results in two consequential mental constructions, namely [[imaginary audience]] and [[personal fable]].

==Mental constructions==

===Imaginary audience===
{{main article|Imaginary audience}}
Imaginary audience is a term that Elkind used to describe the phenomenon that an adolescent anticipates the reactions of other people to him/herself in actual or impending social situations. Elkind argued that this kind of anticipation could be explained by the adolescent's preoccupation that others are as admiring or as critical of him as he is of himself. As a result, an audience is created, as the adolescent believes that he/she will be the focus of attention.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

However, more often than not the audience is imaginary because in actual social situations always being the focus of public attention is not usually the case.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; Elkind believed that the construction of imaginary audiences would partially account for a wide variety of typical adolescent behaviors and experiences; and imaginary audiences played a role in the self-consciousness that emerges in early adolescence. However, since the audience is usually the adolescent's own construction, it is privy to his or her own knowledge of him/herself.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

According to Elkind, the notion of imaginary audience helps to explain why adolescents usually seek privacy and feel reluctant to reveal themselves – it is a reaction to the feeling that one is constantly under the critical scrutiny of others.

===Personal fable===
{{main article|Personal fable}}
Elkind addressed that adolescents have a complex set of beliefs that their own feelings are unique and they are special and immortal. '''Personal fable''' is the term Elkind created to describe this notion, which is the complement of the construction of imaginary audience. Since an adolescent usually fails to differentiate his focus on his own perceptions and that of others, he tends to believe that he is of importance to so many people (the imaginary audiences) that he comes to regard his feelings as something special and unique.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; This belief in personal uniqueness and invincibility becomes an illusion that he can be above some of the rules, disciplines and laws that apply to other people; even consequences such as death {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. Due to the existence of personal fable at some point, an adolescent tends to substitute the roles of an idol, a hero or even a god with his own image.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

==Passing==
Elkind believed that adolescent [[egocentrism]] was a temporary phenomenon that will gradually diminish as adolescents grow older. The reason of this, Elkind argued, was because after entering the formal operational stage, no new mental systems would develop. Therefore, the mental structures formed during adolescence would continue to function for the rest of the life span.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; Accordingly, the two mental constructions that result from egocentrism, imaginary audience and personal fable, will gradually be overcome and disappear as formal operations become mature and stable.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

===Passing of imaginary audience===
The imaginary audience, Elkind said, could be regarded as "a series of hypotheses" that an adolescent "tests against reality". Because the imaginary audience is usually constructed based on an adolescent's attention on his own perception, it will be gradually modified through communicating and reacting with real audiences. Eventually, adolescents will be able to recognize the difference between his own preoccupations and concerns of others.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

===Passing of personal fable===
As to the passing of personal fable, Elkind's idea was drawn from Erikson's (1959) stages of psychosocial development. An establishment of what Erikson called "intimacy"&lt;ref name=Erikson1959&gt;{{cite book|last=Erik.H|first=Erikson|title=Identity and the life cycle|date=1959|publisher=New York: International Universities Press|location=Psychological issues v. 1, no. 1, monograph 1.|isbn=0393012468|pages=181–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  could account for the elimination of personal fable, because during the process of establishing "intimacy", adolescents have to constantly adjust their imaginary audiences to the real ones. As a result, adolescents are able to see themselves in a more realistic way and to establish meaningful interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

==Discussions==
A lot of research has examined different dimensions of Elkind's concept of adolescent egocentrism, however, the findings have not well supported the concept.&lt;ref name=Maholmes&amp;Lomonaco&gt;{{cite book|author=Smetana, J.G. |author2=VillaLobos M. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Applied Research in Child &amp; Adolescent Development: A practical guide, edited by Maholmes&amp;Lomonaco|date=2010|publisher=New York :Psychology Press|pages=187–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this research, the manifestation of adolescent egocentrism is not a normative developmental phenomenon that occurs only during adolescence, but varies across different contexts.&lt;ref name=Maholmes&amp;Lomonaco /&gt; Main discussions from current literature focus on three aspects: whether adolescent egocentrism is age-related; whether adolescent egocentrism has association with formal operations; whether adolescent egocentrism weigh equally across genders.

===Not being age-related===
In his 1967 work, Elkind claimed that adolescent egocentrism emerges during early adolescence (age 11–12) and gradually dissipates throughout middle and late adolescence.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; However, some findings from later studies indicate that this statement is not necessarily to be accurate. In 1986, Lapsley and his colleagues conducted two studies to examine the theoretical assumptions brought up by Elkind.&lt;ref name=Lapsley1986&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lapsley, D.K.|title=Adolescent egocentrism and formal operations: Tests of a Theorectical Assumption|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1986|volume=22|pages=800–807|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.22.6.800|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their first study they collected data from a sample that included 45 sixth graders, 39 eighth graders, 50 tenth graders and 49 twelfth graders. They used the Adolescent Egocentrism Scale (AES) developed by Enright et al. (1979, 1980)&lt;ref name=Enright1979&gt;{{cite journal|last=Enright, R. |author2=Lapsley, D. |author3=Shukla, D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Adolescent egocentrism in early and late adolescence|journal=Adolescence|date=1979|volume=14|pages=687–695}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Enright1980&gt;{{cite journal |author=Enright, R. |author2=Shukla, D. |author3=Lapsley, D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Adolescent egocentrism-sociocentrism and self-consciousness|journal=Journal of youth and Adolescence|date=1980|volume=9|pages=101–116|doi=10.1007/bf02087929}}&lt;/ref&gt; and paper-and-pencil battery of formal operations tasks developed by Lunzer (1965)&lt;ref name=Lunzer1965&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lunzer, E.|title=Problems of formal reasoning in test situations. In P. Mussen(Ed.), European research in cognitive development [Special issue]|journal=Monographs for the Society for Research in Child Development|date=1965|volume=30(2, Serial No. 100)|pages=19–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; as measuring instruments to examine the correlation between adolescent egocentrism and formal operational thought. 

If Elkind's assumption were right, the correlation was supposed to change from positive to negative as the grade increased and the magnitude of the correlation should decrease with age. The results of the study obtained only significant negative correlation in late adolescence and non-significant change in the magnitude of the correlation. The results didn't support the Elkind's claim that adolescent egocentrism emerges in early adolescence and decreases linearly throughout middle and late adolescence.  In other words, adolescents aged 11 or 12 could experience adolescent egocentrism of the same magnitude as those aged 15 or 16 do. Another study by Frankenberger (2000) also provides evidence that adolescent egocentrism is not age-related.&lt;ref name=Frankenberger2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankenberger, K.D.|title=Adolescent egocentrism: a comparison among adolescents and adults|journal=Journal of Adolescence 2000|date=2000|volume=23|pages=343–354|doi=10.1006/jado.2000.0319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In this study, a survey was conducted for data collection from 223 adolescents and 131 adults. The survey contained measures of three aspects: adolescent egocentrism, self-consciousness, and interpersonal reactivity. The result revealed that scores of egocentrism were not, on average, significantly different between adolescents and young adults (19-30), which indicates that egocentrism in adolescence may continue into adulthood.

===Little association with formal operations===
An important theoretical assumption in Elkind's theory is that the emergence of adolescence egocentrism is a result of the development of formal operational thoughts.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; Nevertheless, some studies had findings that were contrast to Elkind's position. Lapsley and his colleagues conducted two studies to examine the theoretical assumptions in 1986.&lt;ref name=Lapsley1986 /&gt; In the second study, they analyzed the data obtained from two samples: a sample of 7th-, 9th-and 11th-graders and another sample of college undergraduate students. They used Adolescent Egocentrism Scale (AES) (Enright et al., 1979, 1980),&lt;ref name=Enright1979 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Enright1980 /&gt; Lunzer (1965)&lt;ref name=Lunzer1965 /&gt; formal operations measure and Imaginary Audience Scale (IAS) (Elkind &amp; Bowen, 1979)&lt;ref name=Elkind1979&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elkind, D. |author2=Bowen, R. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Imaginary audience behavior in children and adolescents|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1979|volume=15|pages=38–44|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.15.1.38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the instruments. 

The result of a grade-by-grade analysis of inter-correlations between adolescence egocentrism and formal operational thoughts showed modest to non-significant differences among all the measures, which implies that there is little association between adolescent egocentrism and formal operations. Some more recent studies got similar findings. Heather et al. (1993) found that formal operations were not an effective indicator of both imaginary audience and personal fable.&lt;ref name=Heather1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heather, C.J. |author2=Fredda B. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Formal operation: A test of two models of adolescent egocentrism|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=1993|volume=22|pages=313–326|doi=10.1007/bf01537795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galanaki (2012) performed a research to investigate the association of adolescent egocentrism with age, gender, pubertal development and formal operational thoughts.

===Gender differences===
A considerable amount of studies have found gender differences in egocentrism (Smetana, J.G.&amp;VillaLobos M., 2010).&lt;ref name=Maholmes&amp;Lomonaco /&gt; Kimberly A Schonert-Reichl's (1994) study on the relationship between depressive symptomatology and adolescent egocentrism recruited 62 adolescents (30 males, 32 females) aged from 12 to 17. The study used Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS),&lt;ref name=Reynolds1987&gt;{{cite book|last=W.M.|first=Reynolds|title=Reynolds adolescent depression scale: Professional manual|date=1987|publisher=Psychological Assessment Resources|location=Odessa, FL:}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaginary Audience Scale (IAS)&lt;ref name=Elkind1979 /&gt; and the New Personal Fable Scale (NPFS)&lt;ref name=LapsleyNPFS&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapsley, D.K. |author2=Rice, K.G. |last-author-amp=yes|title=The "new look" at the imaginary audience and personal fable: Toward a general model of adolescent ego development. In D.K. Lapsley &amp; F.C. Power(eds.), Self, ego, and identity: Integrative approaches|date=1988|publisher=Springer|location=New York|pages=109–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; as measuring tools. The results revealed significantly higher scores obtained by females compared with males in the Transient Self subscale in IAS.&lt;ref name=Schonert1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schonert-Reichl|first=Kimberly A.|title=Gender differences in Depressive Symptomatology and Egocentrism in Adolescence|journal=The Journal of Early Adolescence|date=1994|volume=14|pages=49–65|doi=10.1177/0272431694014001004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Transient Self, as defined by Elkind and Bowen in 1979, refers to impermanent image of self that is mainly relative to one-time behaviors and temporary appearance.&lt;ref name=Elkind1979 /&gt; Thus, adolescent females have a higher tendency to consider themselves to be different from others, and tend to be more self-conscious in situations that involve momentary embarrassments (e.g. going to a party with a bad haircut), than their male peers.&lt;ref name=Schonert1994 /&gt; Another study conducted by Goossens and Beyers (1992) using similar measuring instruments found that boys have stronger beliefs that they are unique, invulnerable and sometimes omnipotent, which are typical characteristics of personal fable.&lt;ref name=Goossens1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goossens, L. |author2=Beyers, W. |last-author-amp=yes |title=The imaginary audience and personal fable: factor analyses and concurrent validity of the "New Look" measures|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|date=1992|volume=12 | issue = 2|pages=193–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artful Learning''' is an educational philosophy model that is concept-based and interdisciplinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.ucla.edu/products/reports/R760.pdf |title=Evaluation of the Artful Learning Program |work=cse.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627172329/http://www.cse.ucla.edu/products/reports/R760.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artful Learning was initiated by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and is rooted in using the arts to enhance all areas of education.

==History==
In 1990, Leonard Bernstein received the [[Praemium Imperiale]], an international prize awarded by the Japan Arts Association for lifetime achievement in the arts. Bernstein used the $100,000 prize to establish The Bernstein Education Through
the Arts (BETA) Fund, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leonardbernstein.com/pfr/pfr_FALL05_rev2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard Bernstein provided this grant to develop an arts-based education program. The Leonard Bernstein Center&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leonardbernstein.com/lbcenter.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was established in April 1992, and initiated extensive school-based research, resulting in the Bernstein Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webadrenaline.com/artful-2-3-04/about/mission.html |title=History of the Leonard Bernstein Center for Learning |work=webadrenaline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After six years of association with the Grammy Foundation, the Leonard Bernstein Center for Learning moved to [[Gettysburg College]], PA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettysburg.edu/news_events/press_release_detail.dot?id=cfc1e09f-506b-4cc0-ba24-aa67803f635c |title=Leonard Bernstein Center for Learning moves to Gettysburg College |work=gettysburg.edu |date= |accessdate=2005-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==

Artful Learning is based on Bernstein's philosophy that the arts can strengthen learning and be incorporated in all academic subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.nl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=dp2013 |title=THE LEONARD BERNSTEIN ARTFUL LEARNING MODEL: A CASE STUDY OF AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL |work=digitalcommons.nl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is based on "units of study," which each consist of four core elements: experience, inquire, create, and reflect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexander-bernstein/leonard-bernsteins-artsba_b_3427779.html |title=Leonard Bernstein's Arts-Based Education Revolution |work=huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Research shows that participation in the arts plays a vital role in influencing brain development and performance. Arts which are considered enrichment in education programs, may in fact be central to the way humans neurologically process and learn.&lt;ref&gt;http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED507091.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/65g5z7wp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irma-international.org/chapter/artful-learning/106314/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=iakFqWZGvhkC&amp;pg=PA1059&amp;lpg=PA1059&amp;dq=research+%2B+%22artful+learning%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IBo6GMysV6&amp;sig=CjaivsVuLUaBhpDD5QQK6VV61t4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0ZeoVIbtD9eJuASxg4KQCQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=research%20%2B%20%22artful%20learning%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, The [[President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities]] teamed up with the Arts Education Partnership to publish a comprehensive study on the inclusion of the [[arts in education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~bcec/events/RFKS/RFKS2011/artful.html |title=Artful Learning |work=indiana.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the city of [[Hyderabad, Sindh]] to facilitate examinations for high schools and higher secondary schools (also called intermediate colleges).

==History==
A commission on national education was appointed on 30 December 1958 which recommended the four years of education from grade IX to XII as part of the intermediate and secondary education curricula thus forming the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education in Hyderabad in 1961.&lt;ref name="CITEREFIntro1"/&gt;

The move came as part of the [[West Pakistan]] Intermediate and Secondary Education Ordinance, 1961 (alternatively for [[East Pakistan]], it was the East Pakistan Ordinance No. XXXIII of 1961). The ordinance was further amended in Act no. XVI of 1962 and Act no. XVII of 1977. Under the acts, it was responsible for the organization to regulate, supervise, control and develop the levels and status of Intermediate and Secondary level public examinations in educational institutions.&lt;ref name="CITEREFIntro1"/&gt;

The board started acting under the guidance of Dr G. A. Jafri, appointed as the board's [[chairman]]. Soon afterwards, the board was further bifurcated into a board for [[Sukkur]] and recently for [[Mirpur Khas]].&lt;ref name="CITEREFIntro1"/&gt;

==Administration==
The board is run by a group of directors who appoint a chairperson (currently Dr Muhammad Memon), a secretary (currently ) and a controller (Dr.Masroor Ahmed Zai).&lt;ref name="CITEREFMessages1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
As an organisation, the board has developed in the recent years a 202 members strong staff and is equipped with offices in [[Latifabad|Latifabad U8]].&lt;ref name="CITEREFIntro1"/&gt; The board also owns a stadium in [[Latifabad]] used for league, inter-club and -city [[hockey]] tournaments. But sporting events  The District Hockey Association (DHA) for the [[Hyderabad District, Pakistan]] had allocated a budget of 1.6 million rupees for renovations for the betterment of hockey arenas but were reluctant to give the board their share. However, recent endeavours towards bringing the National Hockey Championship back to Hyderabad have been welcomed by quite a few government officials.&lt;ref name="CITEREFTDTNatHockeyChamp1"&gt;{{cite web

Recently enough the 54th National Hockey Championships were brought to the stadium and the DHA officials pronounced better conditions.

L. |authorlink= Ernest Boyer |year= 1990 |title= Scholarship reconsidered: Priorities of the professoriate. |publisher= Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching |url= https://depts.washington.edu/gs630/Spring/Boyer.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Boyer, traditional research, or the scholarship of discovery, had been the center of academic life and crucial to an institution's advancement but it needed to be broadened and made more flexible to include not only the new social and environmental challenges beyond the campus but also the reality of contemporary life. His vision was to change the research mission of universities by introducing the idea that scholarship needed to be redefined.

He proposed that scholarship include these four different categories:

* The scholarship of discovery that includes original research that advances knowledge (i.e., [[basic research]]);
* The scholarship of integration that involves synthesis of information across disciplines, across topics within a discipline, or across time (i.e., [[interprofessional education]], or [[science communication]]);
* The scholarship of application (also later called the [[engaged scholarship|scholarship of engagement]]) that goes beyond the service duties of a faculty member to those within or outside the University and involves the rigor and application of disciplinary expertise with results that can be shared with and/or evaluated by peers (i.e., [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service]], or [[science diplomacy]]; and
* The [[scholarship of teaching and learning]] that the systematic study of teaching and learning processes. It differs from scholarly teaching in that it requires a format that will allow public sharing and the opportunity for application and evaluation by others.

Boyer's model has been embraced across academia{{cn|date=March 2016}} with occasional refinement, such as specific applications for different disciplines.

'''Certified software manager (CSM)''' is a professional designation for [[IT asset management]].  The course was developed by the [[Software Publishers Association]] (now SIIA) in 1994 as a component of one of the first global anti-piracy efforts, led by [[Ken Wasch]].  In 2004, administration of the CSM, and its successor class the [[Advanced Software Manager]], moved to Washington, DC-based LicenseLogic.

The course syllabus walks the attendee through from the beginnings of "What is [[Software Asset Management|Software Asset Management (SAM)]]?" through to developing a basic asset management program for their organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.licenselogic.com/syllabus.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703182650/http://www.licenselogic.com/syllabus.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CSM is the basis for various other ITAM courses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33232">'''Children’s rights education''' (or children’s human rights education) is the teaching and practice of children’s rights in schools and educational institutions, as informed by and consistent with the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. When fully implemented, a children's rights education program consists of both a curriculum to teach children their human rights, and framework to operate the school in a manner that respects children's rights. Articles [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29 29] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42 42] of the Convention on the Rights of the Child require children to be educated about their rights.

In addition to meeting legal obligations of the Convention to spread awareness of children’s rights to children and to adults, teaching children about their rights has the benefits of improving their awareness of rights in general, making them more respectful of other people's rights, and empowering them to take action in support of other people's rights. Early programs to teach children about their rights, in Belgium, Canada, England and New Zealand have provided evidence of this.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt;&lt;ref name=dead /&gt;&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=belgium /&gt;&lt;ref name=wallberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp6 /&gt; Children's rights in schools were taught and practiced as an ethos of 'liberating the child' well before the UN Convention was written, and that this practice helped to inform the values and philosophy of the Convention, the IBE and UNESCO, though sadly these practices, and this history are not really acknowledged or built-upon by the UN. This is one reasons that children's rights have not become a foundation of schools despite 100 years of struggle.&lt;ref name="newman movement"&gt;Newman, Michael (2015) Children’s Rights in our Schools – the movement to liberate the child, an introduction to the New Ideals in Education Conferences 1914-1937, [https://www.academia.edu/14081708/Regaining_the_History_of_Childrens_Rights_in_Schools_Through_the_New_Ideals_in_Education_Conferences_1914-37 www.academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of children’s human rights education==
Children’s human rights education refers to education and educational practices in schools and educational institutions that are consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.&lt;ref name=empower&gt;Howe, R.B. and Covell, K. (2007). ''Empowering Children: Children’s Rights Education as a Pathway to Citizenship''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krappman&gt;Krappman, L. (2006). "The rights of the child as a challenge to human rights education." ''Journal of Social Science Education.'' Retrieved from: http://www.jsse.org/2006-1/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=osler&gt;Osler, A., and Starkey, H. (2006). "Education for democratic citizenship: A review of research, policy and practice 1995-2005." ''Research Papers in Education,'' 21 (4), 433-466.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of education that takes seriously the view that children are bearers of human rights, that children are citizens in their own right, that schools and educational institutions are learning communities where children learn (or fail to learn) the values and practices of human rights and citizenship, and that educating children about their own basic human rights is a legal obligation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 

Children's rights education is education where the rights of the child, as described in the Convention, is taught and practiced in individual classrooms. But in its most developed form, children’s rights are taught and practiced in a systematic and comprehensive way across grade levels, across the school, and across school districts. With full-blown children’s rights education, children’s rights are not simply an addition to a particular subject or classroom. Rather, the rights of the child are incorporated into the school curricula, teaching practices, and teaching materials across subjects and grade levels and are the centerpiece of school mission statements, behavior codes, and school policies and practices.&lt;ref name=implement&gt;Covell, K., Howe, R.B., and McNeil, J.K. (2010). "Implementing children’s human rights education in schools." ''Improving Schools,'' 13 (2), 117-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully developed children’s rights education means that all members of the school community receive education on the rights of the child. The Convention serves as a values framework for the life and functioning of the school or educational institution and for efforts to promote a more positive school climate and school culture for learning.

A core belief in children’s rights education is that when children learn about their own basic human rights, this learning serves as an important foundation for their understanding and support of human rights more broadly.

==Education and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child==
The Convention on the Rights of the child has important implications for the education of children. Approved by the [[United Nations]] in 1989, the Convention is the most widely ratified and most quickly ratified country in world history. Only two countries – the [[United States]] and [[South Sudan]] – have yet to ratify the [[treaty]].&lt;ref name=CRIN&gt;Child Rights Information Network (2008).  [http://www.crin.org/resources/treaties/CRC.asp?catName=International+Treatie ''Convention on the Rights of the Child''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103092514/http://www.crin.org/resources/treaties/CRC.asp?catName=International+Treatie# |date=2012-11-03 }}. Retrieved 26 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amnesty&gt;Amnesty International USA (2007).

(1999). ''A Commentary on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verhellen&gt;Verhellen, E. (1994). ''Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' Kessel-Lo, Belgium: Garant&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bueren&gt;Van Bueren, G. (1992). ''The international Law on the Rights of the Child.'' Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the Convention, a legally binding treaty, states parties have the obligation to make their laws, policies, and practices consistent with the provisions of the Convention, if not immediately, then over time.

In the Convention are numerous articles that deal with education and with children’s rights education. Eugeen Verhellen has divided the Convention’s provisions on education along three tracks.&lt;ref name=verhellen2&gt;Verhellen, E. (1993). "Children’s rights and education." ''School Psychology International,'' 14 (3), 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt; First is the child’s right to education on the basis equal opportunity ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art28 article 28]). This includes the right to free primary education and to accessible secondary and higher education. Second are the child’s rights in education (articles [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art2 2], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art12 12], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art13 13], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art14 14], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art15 15], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art19 19]). This includes the right to non-discrimination, participation, protection from abuse and violence, and freedom of thought, expression, and religion. Third are the child’s rights through education (article [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29 29] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42 42]). This refers to education where children are able to know and understand their rights and to develop respect for human rights, including their own human rights.

This third track of education spells an obligation by countries and education authorities to provide for children’s human rights education. Article 29 of the Convention requires that 'the education of the child shall be directed to the development of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.' This presumes knowledge and understanding of rights. Article 42 requires that countries 'undertake to make the principles of the Convention widely known, by appropriate and active means, to adults and children alike.'

Mindful of this duty of disseminating knowledge and recognizing its importance, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the UN body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Convention, has repeatedly urged countries to incorporate children’s rights into the school curricula and ensure that children know and understand their rights on a systematic and comprehensive basis.&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=un&gt;United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (1991). ''General Guidelines Regarding the Form and Content of Initial Reports.'' CRC/C/5. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hodgkin&gt;Hodgkin, R., and Newell, P. (1998). ''Implementation handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' New York: UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value of children’s human rights education==
Children’s rights education in schools has value because it fulfills the obligations of countries to respect the rights of the child and implement the provisions of the Convention. But beyond the fulfillment of a legal obligation, children’s rights education has value for children. Felisa Tibbitts has suggested that child rights education can be expected to affect learners in three ways.&lt;ref name=tibbitts&gt;Tibbitts, F. (1997). ''An Annotated Primer for Selecting Democratic and Human Rights Education Teaching Materials.'' Amsterdam: Open Society Institute/Human Rights education Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  First is in the providing of basic information and knowledge on the nature of rights and the specific rights that children are to enjoy. Children can be expected to have a more accurate and deeper understanding of rights. Second is in attitudes, values, and behaviors consistent with the understanding of rights. Children can be expected to have greater respect for the rights of others as shown in their attitudes and behaviors. Third is in empowering children to take action in support of the rights of others. Tibbitts refers to this as the 'transformational model' of rights education. Children here are more likely to take a stand in preventing or redressing human rights abuses. An example would be to support a victim of [[bullying]] and stand up against a bully in the school playground.

Research by Katherine Covell and R. Brian Howe&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130405010253/http://www.cbu.ca/crc/ Katherine Covell and R. Brian Howe]&lt;/ref&gt; (see the section on evaluations of children’s human rights education) shows evidence of the above effects.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (1999). "The Impact of Children’s Rights Education: A Canadian study." ''International Journal of Children’s Rights,'' 7, 171-183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moral&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (2001). "Moral Education through the 3 Rs: Rights, Respect and Responsibility." ''Journal of Moral Education,'' 30, 31-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dead&gt;Covell, K., Howe, R.B., and McNeil, J.K. (2008). "'If there’s a dead rat, don’t leave it.' Young children's understanding of their citizenship rights and responsibilities." ''Cambridge Journal of Education,'' 38 (3), 321-339.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to children who have not received children’s rights education, children who have received children's rights education are more likely to have an accurate and adult-like understanding of rights, to understand that rights and responsibilities are related, and to display socially responsible behaviors in support of the rights of others.

==Implementation of children’s human rights education==

===Early initiatives===
Including Janusz Korczak and his rights based Warsaw orphanage, Homer Lane and his Little Commonwealth (1913) of delinquent 'prisoners', A.S. Neill's Summerhill School (1921) there have been many schools and children's communities around the world that have been founded on the rights of children. Indeed, inspired by Montessori, Homer Lane and Harriet Finley Johnson, a community of teachers, educationalists, suffragists, politicians, inspectors and cultural contributors formed a community called the  New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/New-Ideals-in-Education-Conferences-386690128169894/?ref=bookmarks New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newman movement"/&gt; Their founding value was 'the liberation of the child' and they sought, shared and celebrated examples of practice in schools, prisons and child communities. They contributed to the 'child centred' primary school.&lt;ref&gt;Selleck, R.J.W. (1972) English Primary Education and the Progressives, 1914-1939, p156 Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul London and Boston {{ISBN|0710072082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been an overlooked history of the culture of the rights of the child, one that needs to be shared and celebrated to help empower children and those adults who work with them. &lt;!-- (Commenting this out for now, as it's a non sequitur. If you can add some context as to why this is pertinent to the topic, please do. Thanks!) The autobiographical novel by A.S. Neill, ''[[A Dominie's Log]]'' (1915), is a diary of a headteacher trying to liberate his children as the First World War begins.--&gt;

Since the approval by the United Nations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989, various efforts have been made to provide children's rights education in schools.&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=educate&gt;Howe, R.B., and Covell, K. (2013). ''Education in the Best Interests of the Child: A Children’s Rights Perspective on Closing the Achievement Gap.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives have been undertaken mainly at the level of individual classrooms and schools. Among the earliest initiatives was one in a primary school in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=belgium&gt;DeCoene, J., and  De Cock, R. (1996). "The Children's Rights Project in the Primary School 'De vrijdagmarkt' in Bruges. In E. Verhellen (Ed.), ''Monitoring children’s rights.'' (pp. 627-636). The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a comprehensive child rights education project that was introduced in the early 1990s at De Vrijdagmarkt Primary School. It involved children ages 3 to 12 with the objective of educating them about the contents of the Convention, using democratic [[pedagogy]] and ensuring child participation in the learning process. Children were taught about their rights under the Convention through a variety of media including art and poetry. Art activities included newspaper collages representing examples of rights violations. Allowance was made for child-initiated and small group activities, role-play, and group discussion. Activities that were selected were ones of relevance and interest to the children. Younger children, for example, learned about the right to food by creating a very large doll with illustrations of food. Older children engaged in discussions and role-play regarding rights to [[adoption]], education, and family.

Further examples of early initiatives were in classrooms in [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]], [[Canada]], in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt; [[Curriculum]] materials based on the Convention were developed in collaboration with children and their teachers for three grade levels. At the grade 6 level (children aged 11 to 13 years), education focused on introducing child rights in terms of their relevance to the individual child. Issues included healthy living, personal safety, families and family life, drug use, and decision-making. For example, to learn about their right to protection from [[narcotics]], students role-played children and drug dealers and examined ways of dealing with pressure to try or sell drugs. At the grade 8 level (ages 13 to 15 years), the focus was on relationships of relevance to the child. The curriculum included units on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Youth justice in Canada|youth justice]], [[child abuse]], and exploitation. For example, students analyzed popular song lyrics to discuss how rights in sexuality are represented in music, and they completed cartoons that involved the competing considerations of freedom of speech and rights against [[discrimination]].  The grade 12 curriculum (for ages 17 to 19) expanded the sphere of children’s rights knowledge with application to global issues. These issues included war-affected children and [[child labor]]. At this level, activities included holding a mock UN Conference on war-affected children where small groups had responsibility for representing the players at the conference, and a [[sweatshop]] talk show in which groups researched child labor and then held a talk show to discuss their findings.

===Hampshire, England===
Writings about the initiative in Cape Breton schools inspired a major initiative in [[Hampshire|Hampshire County]], [[England]], called Rights, Respect and Responsibility or the RRR initiative. It is among the best known and most promising models of children’s human rights education to date.&lt;ref name=implement /&gt;&lt;ref name=rrr&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (2008). "Rights, Respect and Responsibility: Final Report on the County of Hampshire Rights Education Initiative." Available at:  {{cite web |url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/education/childrensrights/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106212258/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/childrensrights/ |archivedate=2012-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an initiative that features not only individual classrooms and schools but a whole school district. The RRR initiative was impelled by the recognition among senior education administrators in Hampshire of the need for a shared values framework and positive school climate for improved learning and educational outcomes. They also were motivated by their reading of the success of the rights education project in Cape Breton.

After study leave in Cape Breton, a group of Hampshire administrators and teachers decided to pilot test and then launch their own version of child rights education in Hampshire. After successful pilot testing in 2002, they officially launched RRR in 2004.&lt;ref name=hants&gt;Hampshire Education Authority (2003). "The case for RRR." Available at: {{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/hias/childrensrights/rrrthecase.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121223170331/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/hias/childrensrights/rrrthecase.htm |archivedate=2012-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To put the objectives of RRR into effect, Hampshire authorities—with funding from the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]]—devised a three-year strategic plan of implementation. This included provisions for teacher training, development of resources, and monitoring of developments. The plan was that the initiative would first be introduced in infant, primary, and junior schools and then over time, as children went into higher grades, it would be introduced in secondary schools. By 2012, in varying degrees of implementation, the majority of Hampshire schools were participating in RRR.

The overall objective of RRR was to improve educational outcomes for children by transforming school cultures, building a shared values framework based on the Convention, and promoting educational practices consistent with the Convention. Knowledge and understanding of rights, respect, and social responsibility were to provide the values framework for all school policies, classroom practices, codes of conduct, mission statements, school regulations, and school curricula. The framework was to be put into effect across the whole school – across classrooms, across grade levels, across curricula, and across school practices. Of particular importance, consistent with children’s participation rights as described in article 12 of the Convention, behavior codes, rules, and regulations were to be developed in collaboration with the children, classroom teaching was to be democratic, and children were to be provided with numerous meaningful opportunities to participate in all aspects of school functioning.

===New Zealand===
Initiatives in Cape Breton and Hampshire have influenced developments in other schools, school districts, and even countries. Among the more ambitious developments have been seen in [[New Zealand]] where efforts are underway to make children’s human rights education a nationwide initiative. The context for the initiative is favorable. A strong human rights theme runs through New Zealand’s Education Act, national education goals, and national administrative guidelines.  In the early 2000s, initial discussions about incorporating children’s rights education into the New Zealand curriculum were given momentum by the evidence provided from the Cape Breton and Hampshire County initiatives.&lt;ref name=hrie&gt;HRiE., (2009).  "Human Rights in Education, 2009 Report." Available at: http://www.rightsined.org.nz {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029140555/http://www.rightsined.org.nz/ |date=2012-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like elsewhere, educators and human rights advocates in New Zealand had been concerned with poor achievement levels, bullying, and violent behaviors that are observed among a significant minority of children in schools. And also like elsewhere, teachers and administrators have been frustrated by the range of difficult demands in schools, the fragmentation of efforts to address common problems, and the disappointing results of those efforts. Learning about successes in the Cape Breton and Hampshire initiatives, the collaborative initiative Human Rights in Education/Mana Tika Tangata (HRiE) was formed. Its aim was to develop positive school cultures on the basis of the rights of the child and to improve achievement for all children through having schools and early childhood education centers become learning communities that know, promote, and live human rights and responsibilities.
 
To achieve this goal, HRiE has been following the Hampshire model in using children’s rights as an overarching and integrating values framework for teaching, learning, and school management and organization. All members of the school community – school leadership, teachers and other staff, students, boards of trustees, and parents – learn about children’s rights and the responsibilities that go with them. They recognize that every member of the school community has the right to be treated with dignity and to participate in effective education. Students are formally recognized as citizens of the school and country with explicit rights and responsibilities. They participate in decision-making across the school, and rights are embedded across the curriculum, school practices, and policies.

===Initiatives with preschool===
Children's rights education initiatives also have occurred at the preschool level. For example, Canadian educators Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn introduced rights education to an early childhood program group of 3 and 4 year-old children in [[British Columbia]] over a three-month period.&lt;ref name=wallberg&gt;Wallberg, P., and  Kahn, M. (2011). "The Rights Project: How rights education transformed a classroom." ''Canadian Children,'' 36 (1), 31-35.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of "The Rights Project" was motivated in large part by observations of the children’s self-focus and disregard for the feelings of their peers. Using a coloring book designed to teach very young children about their rights, the teachers hoped to shift the children’s focus from individual wants to community needs – to increase levels of cooperation, altruism, and empathy.

==Evaluations of children’s human rights education==
The earliest reported evaluation of a child rights education project was that of the initiative in Bruges.&lt;ref name=belgium /&gt; Involving children ages 3 to 12, the primary focus of the evaluation was on the students’ social behavior. Gains in social understanding, respectful behaviors, concern for others, and pro-social action were the key observed changes. For example, the children became more interested in social justice and rights-related issues such as peace, war, injustice, and hunger. And they wanted to discuss the rights of marginalized children – those living with disabilities, in institutions, and of ethnic minority status.

Similar outcomes were found in evaluations of the effects of children’s rights education in Cape Breton schools. Evaluations conducted on students in grades 6 and 8 (ages 12 and 14 years) showed improved [[classroom climate]], engagement, and behavior.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt; At the grade 6 level differences were found in children’s understanding of rights, their acceptance of minority children, and their perceived levels of peer and teacher support. Teachers reported improved behavior and more positive classroom climate. In addition at the grade 8 level, children in rights-based classes showed increases in their self-esteem. Similar child-initiated projects to those reported from Bruges were seen also.  For example, at one school upon realizing that not every child in the area was assured their right to nutritious food, the students initiated a breakfast program by obtaining cooperation and donations from the local community. In a different school, the class decided to work at a local [[food bank]] to help children whose families were unable to provide sufficient nutritious food.

Anecdotal data from the teachers who used the grade 12 curriculum described how engaged their students were in the activities, and noted improvements in their students’ appreciation of global problems, and of the complexity and importance of respecting human rights. Students who had participated in the project completed a survey. The results showed them to be three times more likely than their peers to understand humanitarian assistance for children in difficult circumstances as a fundamental human right.

The most comprehensive evaluation data are of the Hampshire RRR initiative.&lt;ref name=dead /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp6&gt;Covell, K., McNeil, J.K, and  Howe, R.B. (2009). "Reducing teacher burnout by increasing student engagement."

(2011) "Rights, Respect and Responsibility in Hampshire County RRR and Resilience Report."

(2011). "Children’s human rights education as a counter to social disadvantage: A case study from England." ''Educational Research,'' 53,(2), 193- 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp3&gt;Howe, R.B., and Covell, K., (2010). "Miseducating children about their rights." ''Education, Citizenship and Social Justice,'' 5 (2), 91-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp5&gt;Covell, K. (2010). "School engagement and rights-respecting schools." ''Cambridge Journal of Education,'' 40 (1), 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Annual assessments over six years were conducted to assess the effects of the RRR. Included were children ages 4 – 14. Children and teachers in schools where RRR had been fully implemented were compared with those in demographically equivalent schools without RRR.  These comparisons showed the following effects of RRR. Across ages, children showed a greater understanding of rights and their relation to responsibilities, increased levels of self-regulation, confidence, effort and motivation, participation and engagement in school, and achievement. These cognitive and attitudinal changes were reflected in significant improvements in behaviors. Children were reported by both their classroom teachers and the school principal to be more respectful, cooperative, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of other children. Incidents of bullying were reduced dramatically with disagreements being resolved using the discourse of rights rather than through physical or verbal aggression.

Teaching in RRR schools also led to changes in the teachers. School administrators noted significant changes in teachers use of democratic teaching and positive classroom management, and in less confrontational dealings with their students. Teachers were listening to children and taking their views into account. And the greater the level of student engagement and participation, the more teachers showed gains in a sense of personal achievement and significant decreases in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.

Among all the positive findings of the evaluation of the RRR, the most intriguing was that at each time of measure the most disadvantaged school showed the greatest positive changes.&lt;ref name=comp2 /&gt; Improvements in engagement, behavior and academic achievement were remarkable, and have been attributed to how the RRR transformed the culture of the school. The evidence suggests that schools that are fully consistent with the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child can mediate the effects of a challenging environment of rearing and help close the achievement gap between disadvantaged children and their more advantaged peers.&lt;ref name=educate /&gt;

==Other evaluations==
Although no formal evaluation has yet been published on the New Zealand initiative, anecdotal evidence suggests the outcomes are comparable to those reported from Hampshire.&lt;ref name=hrie /&gt; Teachers report improved learning environments and decreased stress.  "Makes me think critically about some of the things I do in my classroom", a teacher reported, "especially some of the aspects of my behavior management." Another stressed that she has "had fabulous response from the children."

Evaluation data from Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn show that their preschool rights project was highly successful.&lt;ref name=wallberg /&gt; They found that teaching young children about their Convention rights in an age-appropriate way transformed the learning environment. As classroom rules were replaced with rights, less adult control was needed and group conversations changed from chaotic chatter to the respectful exchange of ideas. The children’s behavior toward each other changed markedly. Their interactions reflected an understanding of the universality of rights and the importance of protecting the rights of others. And even at this very young age, rights discourse replaced arguing; for example, "you are hurting my right to play" became an effective problem solver that replaced tears and fighting. Wallberg and Kahn conclude that the children’s recognition of the relationship between rights and responsibilities shifted their focus "from 'me' to 'we'."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16032">'''Classwide Peer Tutoring''' ('''CWPT''') is a variation of [[peer-mediated instruction]] that has been used in elementary, middle school, and high school classrooms. In CWPT students form pairs and take turns in the roles of tutor and student. Students earn points for their teams by participating in the tutoring and the winning team is recognized. Researchers have investigated CWPT's effectiveness in several different academic areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/?q=instruction/classwide_peer_tutoring&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Classwide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) is a form of [[peer-mediated instruction]] where the teacher creates pairs of students that alternately fill the roles of tutor and student. The tutor asks questions, records points, and provides feedback on whether the student's response matches the correct response designated by the teacher. The student responds orally and/or in writing to the questions and practices the correct answer three times if he or she makes an error.&lt;ref name=Terry&gt;{{cite web|last=Terry|first=Barbara|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring|url=http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/~kucrl/cgi-bin/drupal/?q=instruction/classwide_peer_tutoring|work=University of Kansas Special Connections|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher supervises the tutoring and awards points for good tutoring.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; A classroom's student pairs are divided into two teams, and they earn points for their respective teams by answering questions correctly, correcting their incorrect answers, and tutoring appropriately.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenwood|first=Charles|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring|journal=Behavior and Social Issues|year=1997|volume=7|issue=1|page=52-57|doi=10.5210/bsi.v7i1.299}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of a week, the team that has earned the most points is recognized as the winning team.&lt;ref name="Best Evidence Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Program Overview: Classwide Peer Tutoring|url=http://www.bestevidence.org/overviews/C/classwide.htm|work=Best Evidence Encyclopedia|publisher=Johns Hopkins University School of Education|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CWPT has been used to help students learn [[spelling]], math facts, basic word reading, reading fluency, [[vocabulary]], and facts related to an area of study.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; There appear to be more published studies of CWPT with positive outcomes in the area of spelling than in other areas. The CWPT technique has been used with several different age levels: pre-school, elementary, middle school, and high school.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; CWPT was initially developed and researched in the early 1980s at the Juniper Gardens Children's Project at the [[University of Kansas]].&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network"&gt;{{cite web|title=Programs that Work: Classwide Peer Tutoring Program|url=http://www.promisingpractices.net/program.asp?programid=99|publisher=Promising Practices Network|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==
The developers of CWPT suggest that this technique provides students more opportunities to practice content or skills, encourages them to engage in [[active learning]], and lets them receive immediate feedback.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; CWPT is also thought to provide students with practice using [[social skills]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamps Barbetta Leonard &amp; Delquadri"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kamps|first=Debra|author2=Barbetta, Patricia |author3=Leonard, Betsy |author4= Delquadri, Joseph |title=Classwide Peer Tutoring: An Integration Strategy To Improve Reading Skills And Promote Peer Interactions Among Students With Autism And General Education Peers|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|year=1994|volume=27|page=49-61|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-49|pmc=1297776}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research findings ===
CWPT has been effective for teaching spelling to both students in [[curriculum|general education]] and students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ([[ADHD]]), mild [[intellectual disabilities]], and [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name="Chun &amp;

=== Evaluation as an evidence-based practice ===
==== What Works Clearinghouse rating ====
The [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[What Works Clearinghouse]] has evaluated CWPT for effectiveness in the areas of General Reading Achievement and [[English language learning and teaching|English Language Learning]] (ELL). These evaluations resulted in a "potentially positive" effectiveness rating in the area of General Reading Achievement for elementary school students, and no rating for ELL due to the fact that no existing studies met What Works Clearinghouse criteria for evaluation.&lt;ref name="WWC reading"&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Department of Education|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring Beginning Reading|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=81|work=What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WWC ELL"&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Department of Education|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring English Language Learners|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=83|work=What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Works Clearinghouse does not currently provide reports for CWPT's effectiveness in any other areas.

==== Promising Practices Network rating ====
Promising Practices Network considers CWPT a "Proven Program".&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network" /&gt; The website states that CWPT meets full criteria for a "Proven Program" by having research outcomes that fall in the category of the website's target areas, having at least one outcome that is changed by at least 20% or .25 [[standard deviation]]s, having at least one outcome with a statistically significant and meaningful [[effect size]], having studies that use comparison groups, having studies with sample sizes of 30 or more, and by having research findings publicly available.&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
A few studies have shown CWPT to have few advantages over more traditional methods of classroom instruction with middle or high school students, such as teacher-centered instruction or independent practice.&lt;ref name="Allsopp 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allsopp|first=David|title=Using classwide peer tutoring to teach beginning algebra problem-solving skills in heterogeneous classrooms.|journal=Remedial and Special Education|year=1997|volume=18|issue=6|page=367-379|doi=10.1177/074193259701800606}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman-Perrott 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowman-Perrott|first=Lisa|author2=Greenwood, Charles R |author3=Tapia, Yolanda |title=The efficacy of CWPT used in secondary alternative school classrooms with small teacher/pupil ratios and students with emotional and behavioral disorders.|journal=Education &amp; Treatment of Children|year=2007|volume=30|issue=3|page=65-87|doi=10.1353/etc.2007.0014}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also found that while CWPT may increase the positive social interactions of students with ADHD during the tutoring, it does not necessarily affect their social behavior in other settings.&lt;ref name="Plumer 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plumer|first=Pamela|author2=Stoner, Gary|title=The relative effects of classwide peer tutoring and peer coaching on the positive social behaviors of children with ADHD.|journal=Journal of Attention Disorders|year=2005|volume=9|issue=1|page=290-300|doi=10.1177/1087054705280796}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

These individual outcomes also lead to collective outcomes by building knowledge, capacity and expertise in diverse communities.&lt;ref name="Itoetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CronwellCronwell" /&gt;  Environments that support connected learning are generally characterized as having a sense of shared purpose, a focus on production, and openly networked infrastructures.

Cronwell and Cronwell created the first "framework and an organizing set of principles to guide educational research and development," (p.&amp;nbsp;17).&lt;ref name="CronwellCronwell" /&gt; This research was supported by the Center for Internet Research. This connected learning framework is based on the following set of principles:
* The education process must become learner-centered.
* Assessment – diagnostic, formative, and summative – must be improved and deeply integrated into the learning and teaching process.
* National and state academic standards must be met or exceeded.
* Ethnic academic achievement "gaps" must be addressed and eliminated.
* Learning must become more active.
* The formation of lifelong learning behaviors must be facilitated.
* Education reform must be guided by empiricism.
* Well-designed, technology-enabled education reform will be self-improving, self-reforming and self-documenting.
* Teaching and learning content must be of the highest possible quality, current and relevant.
* Proven pedagogical methodologies and the best research from all field with a bearing on learning and teaching must be integrated into education.
* The needs of all stakeholders (students, teachers, parents, administration, government, business, etc.) must be served.
* Reform must also address the need to improve the formation and achievement of vocational goals by students.
* Where minimum standards exist, the goal must be near-universal mastery rather than a standard distribution of achievement. (pp.&amp;nbsp;19)&lt;ref name="CronwellCronwell" /&gt;
This idea of connected learning is supposed to be an alternative to traditional in-school instruction. They label this connected learning framework as a work in progress that needs more research to support it. However, no further research has been completed on this framework.

== Examples ==
Examples of learning environments that integrate peer, interest, and academic pursuits including athletics programs that are tied to in-school recognition, certain arts and civic learning programs, and interest-driven academic programs such as math, chess, or robotics competitions. These connected learning environments embody values of equity, social belonging, and participation. Connected learning environments include a sense of shared purpose, a focus on production, and openly networked infrastructures.&lt;ref name="Itoetal" /&gt; Learning environments that embody principles of connected learning include:

* Connected learning is "yet another buzz word for the corporatization of education."&lt;ref name="CollegeLevel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bedfordstmartins.com/bits/uncategorized/can-connected-learning-work-at-the-college-level/ |title=Can connected learning work at the college level?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Connected learning is devoid of critical thinking as it relies on "a formula for students getting what they already want to find . . . . . [rather than] broadening horizons to discover what is not already known."&lt;ref name="Threattoconnectedlearning"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalis.nwp.org/site-blog/threat-connected-learning/3698|title=The Threat to Connected Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The model gives no mention of key K-12 educators who have been pushing for similar types of networked/connected learning for the past decade.&lt;ref name="Whathavetheydone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2012/03/03/connected-learning-what-have-they-done-with-alec-will-vicki/
|title=Connected Learning: What have they done with Alec, Will, Vicki?
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increased workload for those who support learners is also a concern&lt;ref name="7Things"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/7-things-you-should-know-about-connected-learning|title= 7 Things you should know about connected learning }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://clrn.dmlhub.net/ Connected Learning Research Network] chair [[Mizuko Ito|Mimi Ito]] responded to the criticism pointing out that, "the connected learning principles were developed with a very diverse range of practitioners in K-12 and other learning institutions like museums and libraries, as well as people working in popular culture/media, technology, and university researchers. So while the research network hopes to provide a research component to feed the broader connected learning effort, we are by no means the driving force behind it.”&lt;ref name="EducatorsTechnology" /&gt;

'''Counselor Education''' is a field focused on the preparation of students to professionally apply the theory and principles of guidance and counseling for the personal, social, educational, and vocational development of others.&lt;ref&gt;https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/cipdetail.aspx?y=55&amp;cipid=88130&lt;/ref&gt; The primary focus of counselor education is the training and preparation of professional counselors; this includes recruiting and training the future generations of academic professionals who will teach the curriculum of counseling theory and practice.  

In order to acquire licensure, counselors are generally required to complete an accredited graduate program along with a minimum number of documented hours in supervised clinical fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;https://onlinecounselingprograms.com/become-a-counselor/&lt;/ref&gt; Counselor Education degree programs can become accredited by The Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs. Rehabilitation Counselor Education degree programs can become accredited by The National Council on Rehabilitation Education.

Scholarship within counselor education centers on the training and education of master's or doctoral-level counseling graduate students, novel applications of counseling theory including competencies across cultural groups, and best practice guidelines in both academic and clinical or applied settings. Counselor educators as a professional group are trained in multiple methodological approaches to research including both qualitative and quantitative methods.

{{Italic title}}
'''''Deschooling Society''''' (1971) is a critical discourse on education as practised in modern economies. It is a book that brought [[Ivan Illich]] to public attention. Full of detail on programs and concerns, the book gives examples of the ineffectual nature of institutionalized education. Illich posited self-directed education, supported by intentional social relations in fluid informal arrangements:

{{Quote|Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools. Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education. The current search for new educational ''funnels'' must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational ''webs'' which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring. We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education – and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction", ''Deschooling Society''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The last sentence makes clear what the title suggests—that the institutionalization of education is considered to institutionalize society and conversely that ideas for de-institutionalizing education may be a starting point for a de-institutionalized society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/DESCHOOLING.pdf arvindguptatoys, pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.webster.edu/corbetre/philosophy/education/illich/schooling.html Faculty Webster edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique &amp; Proposal ==

The book is more than a critique—it contains suggestions for changes to learning in society and individual lifetimes. Particularly striking is his call (in 1971) for the use of advanced technology to support "learning webs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://infed.org/mobi/ivan-illich-deschooling-conviviality-and-lifelong-learning/ Infed , Ivan Illich: deschooling, conviviality and lifelong learning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibe.unesco.org/sites/default/files/illiche.PDF ibe Unesco.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/DeschoolingSociety Fulltext at Web archive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://infonomics-society.org/wp-content/uploads/ijcdse/published-papers/special-issue-1/Revisiting-the-critiques-of-Ivan-Illichs-Deschooling-Society.pdf Infonomicd Society.org, Revisiting the critiques of Ivan Illich’s Deschooling Society, Jon Igelmo Zaldívar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natural-learning.net/000154.html Natural learning]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The operation of a peer-matching network would be simple. The user would identify himself by name and address and describe the activity for which he sought a peer. A computer would send him back the names and addresses of all those who had inserted the same description. It is amazing that such a simple utility has never been used on a broad scale for publicly valued activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Deschooling Society'', chapter six&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Illich argued that the use of technology to create decentralized webs could support the goal of creating a good educational system:

{{Quote|A good educational system should have three purposes: it should provide all who want to learn with access to available resources at any time in their lives; empower all who want to share what they know to find those who want to learn it from them; and, finally, furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their challenge known.&lt;ref&gt;''Deschooling Society'', chapter six, 'General Characteristics of New Formal Educational Institutions&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Learning Networks ==

Developing this idea Illich proposes four ''Learning Networks''.
# ''Reference Service to Educational Objects'' - An open directory of educational resources and their availability to learners.  
# ''Skills Exchange'' - A database of people willing to list their skills and the basis on which they would be prepared to share or swap them with others.
# ''Peer-Matching'' - A network helping people to communicate their learning activities and aims in order to find similar learners who may wish to collaborate.
# ''Directory of Professional Educators'' - A list of professionals, paraprofessionals and free-lancers detailing their qualifications, services and the terms on which these are made available.

The '''Diploma Supplement''' is a document accompanying a [[Europe|European]] higher education diploma, providing a standardised description of the nature, level, context, content and status of the studies completed by its holder.

==Overview==
The Diploma Supplement is designed to provide a description of the nature, level, context, content and status of the studies that were successfully completed by the individual named on the original qualification to which the supplement is appended. It should be free from any [[value-judgement]]s, equivalence statements or suggestions about recognition. The Diploma Supplement provides a common structure to translate qualifications across the EU. It is a flexible, non-prescriptive tool which has been shown to save time, money and workload by an EU [[working party]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aic.lv/ENIC/ds/wpreport.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Diploma Supplements were gradually implemented at European universities as part of the Bologna Process, since approximately 1999. Students graduating from European Universities since this date, and depending on what year the country in which their university is located became signatory to his Process, typically will have received a Diploma Supplement. However, even as late as 2013 there were still some European universities, who despite their country's years-old membership of the Bologna Process, had not yet finished the necessary procedures for issuing Diploma Supplements to their graduates. 

It is important for countries and educational institutions located outside of the European Higher Education Area to realize that Diploma Supplements cannot be retroactively issued, hence why students who graduated before their institution's country became signatory to the Bologna Convention cannot possibly have a diploma supplement for that degree. Consequently, requesting a Diploma Supplement from a student who graduated from a European university in 1995 or earlier is nonsensical since the Bologna Process was not even in place before that date.

The '''Early College High School Initiative''' in the United States allows students to receive a [[high school diploma]] and an [[associate degree]], or up to two years of [[college credit]], by taking a mixture of [[high school]] and [[college]] classes. This differs from [[dual enrollment]], where students are enrolled in a traditional high school and take college classes, whereas early college students take high school classes in preparation for full college workloads. At early colleges, students also have fewer high school classes because some of their college classes replace their high school classes. Early colleges differ from closely related middle colleges. ECHS students spend their school day at college, and go to their home school occasionally for events such as football games, homecoming, and prom. 

The ECHS Initiative began in 2002 with funding from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], among others. The first early college in the United States, Bard College at Simon's Rock, was founded in 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/national-directories/gifted-school/bard-college-simons-rock|title=Bard College at Simon's Rock {{!}} K12 Academics|date=2018-02-24|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Today, more than 230 early colleges across 28 states serve 50,000+ students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview &amp; FAQ|url=http://www.earlycolleges.org/overview.html|publisher=Early College High School Initiative|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 92% of early college students graduate from high school,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=Michael|title=Early College High School Initiative, Student Information System|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; versus the national rate of 69 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diplomas Count|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/toc/2009/06/11/index.html|accessdate=5 May 2011|newspaper=Education Week|date=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 86% of graduates enroll in college the next semester after high school graduation.&lt;ref&gt;Webb &amp; Mayka (2011), p.9&lt;/ref&gt;
* 91% of early college graduates earn transferable college credit.&lt;ref name="Webb8"&gt;Webb &amp; Mayka (2011), p.8&lt;/ref&gt;
* 44% of graduates at schools open 4+ years earn at least one year of college credit.&lt;ref name="Webb8"/&gt;
* 24% of graduates at schools open 4+ years earn two years of college credit or an associate degree.&lt;ref name="Webb8"/&gt;
* 70% of early college students are students of color.&lt;ref name="Webb3"&gt;Webb &amp; Mayka (2011), p.3&lt;/ref&gt;
* 59% of early college students are classified as eligible for free or reduced lunch (used as a conservative estimate of how many students' families are low-income).&lt;ref name="Webb3"/&gt; Most early colleges are funded to target first generation college, low-income families, and/or academically gifted students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17596">'''Educator effectiveness''' is a [[K–12 (education)|K-12 school system]] education policy initiative that measures the quality of an [[Teacher|educator]] performance in terms of improving student learning. It describes a variety of methods, such as observations, student assessments, student work samples and examples of teacher work, that education leaders use to determine the effectiveness of a K-12 educator.

The drive for educator effectiveness programs stem from [[Race to the top]] where states were awarded points for meeting educational policies based on the teacher's effectiveness. This policy was the basis of the emergence of statewide educator effectiveness programs.

Educator effectiveness programs vary from state to state.  Typically, an educator effectiveness program describes a cycle of observations and assessments that apply to different groups of teachers during an academic year. New teachers are evaluated more frequently, and veteran teachers are evaluated across multiple year cycles. Evaluated teachers have multiple scheduled classroom observations and conferences with the evaluator in addition to unannounced classroom observations. A controversial aspect of  The purpose of evaluations is to help educators determine what is effective in their practices and provides them a medium to reflect upon and change their practice to help teachers become more effective.

== Definition ==
Educator effectiveness is a method used in the K-12 school system that uses multiple measures of assessments including classroom observations, student work samples, assessment scores and teacher artifacts, to determine the impact a particular teacher has on student's learning outcomes. While schools have used teacher evaluation practices and policies for many years, the emergence of educator effectiveness policies combines these existing practices with rubrics and test scores to provide more robust perspectives on the work of teachers. Educator effectiveness initiatives often use descriptions of effective teaching practices, such as [[Charlotte Danielson]]'s "Framework for Teaching", to organize teaching separate domains for assessment. Danielson's domains include: Planning and Preparation, Classroom Environment, Professional Responsibilities, and Instruction.

== Purpose ==
Teacher evaluations have changed over time and have had different standards across the United States. Evaluation systems often have been comprised an administrator observing a teacher a couple times per year. In some locations, teacher observations were only done on a three-year or longer cycle. In the past, a Widget Effect, as described by [[The New Teacher Project]] has been established that has developed a culture where all teachers feel as though they deserve the highest marks on evaluations. Schools used to see their job as filling positions and thought that any teacher who was given a license was high quality, and thus scored them according to that thought process. Therefore, all teachers were getting scores that were good or great and no variation was able to be determined between any two teachers.

Today, federal and state policies have encouraged school systems to design more comprehensive evaluation systems that rely on multiple measures of how a teacher performs by looking at items such as student performance gains, classroom observations, teacher reflections, content specific knowledge and student reflections. Some policy makers and researchers encourage the design of systems to identify and sort good and bad teachers; others are designed to provide meaningful feedback and professional development to teachers in order to enhance their skills.

Overall, the purpose of educator effectiveness is to build the capacity for teachers to enhance their skills. The effective teachers have an effect on student's ability to have a higher level of conceptual understanding of a topic and have displayed the ability to think more abstractly than peers taught by less effective teachers. Quality teaching also has been identified as a key influence for positive learning outcomes for the diverse body of students in the classroom.

== How it is being used ==
As of 2013, US schools United States had very little cohesiveness in their teacher effectiveness requirements and implementations. In 2013, 25 states required that student achievement is a big or the biggest part of teacher evaluations. Twenty-seven states required teacher evaluations be based on a variety of student assessments and work samples and 44 states required classroom observations to be put into teacher evaluations. Overall, 11 states require a statewide teacher evaluation system; 10 states gave a statewide evaluation model that districts can either do or decide to do a similar model. To date only a small handful of states have adopted policies connecting the performance of students to their teachers and the colleges where the teachers were trained.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, K.M &amp; Jacobs, S. (2013).  State of the States 2013: Connect the Dots – Using evaluations of teacher effectiveness to inform policy and practice. Washington, D.C. The National Council on Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have national policies that decide what teacher evaluation systems that schools will have to follow. Some countries such as [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], Iceland, Norway and [[Sweden]] provide annual feedback on teaching practices. Other countries, such as Norway and Iceland leave the decision about how the teacher evaluations systems will be done to be determined at a local level. The quality of teaching in these countries is compared to the curriculum they follow and with the school instructional plan. Finland does not use any standardized testing as a measure of teacher effectiveness. Singapore is another country that does not use test scores but rather focuses on how teachers work together as a main part of their evaluation system. Singapore also focuses heavily on professional development around evaluation, coaching, mentoring and collaborating with other educators with an overall goal of getting a high quality teaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, T. (2013, March 25). How Do High-Performing Nations Evaluate Teachers? - NEA Today. Retrieved April 22, 2015, from http://neatoday.org/2013/03/25/how-do-high-performing-nations-evaluate-teachers/&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant debate in the U.S. about how to reward teachers for performance as measured by educator effectiveness policies. Some schools rewards teachers by paying them more based upon their student's test scores, which is linked to the Race to the Top funding in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, J. (2004). Pay based on test scores? What educators need to know about linking teacher pay to student achievement. National Education Association.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other reward systems are being created based on the idea that improving a teacher's capacity to learn and improve upon their practice will have a direct impact on student achievement. These schools increase pay for teachers who have a  National Board Certification using [[National Board for Professional Teaching Standards]], advanced degrees, engaging in professional development, mentor new colleagues and paying more for these qualified teachers in hard to staff schools &lt;ref&gt;Flannery, M.E. &amp; Jehlen, A. (2008). Where is your pay plan heading? National Education Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection of teacher effectiveness and merit pay varies in different countries. In Finland and Canada, they do not to use merit-pay approaches but encourage conversations between the evaluator and teacher about student progress and success. In contrast, Chinese and Singaporean teachers, get financial bonuses and promotions for high performance. High-performing countries have a strong system of professional and school-level accountability but look at success on things such as school improvement goals, professional contributions, and indicators of student well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, V. (2010). Raising Teacher Quality Around the World. Educational Leadership, 68(4), 16-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods of evaluating teachers ===
Most educator effectiveness programs rely two kinds of data: observations of teaching practices and student outcomes data. There are four main sources of observational data collected by schools:
# Classroom observations happen when someone comes into a teacher's classroom to observe their teaching practice, typically done by a school administrator. The methods of commenting on teaching practice within classroom observations varies from district created to purchased evaluation forms.&lt;ref&gt;Goe, L. &amp; Croft, A. (2008). Methods of Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness. Research-to-Practice Brief. National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some schools use Self-Evaluation as a reflective tool for teachers to look at their current practice and change what they are doing to have a greater educational impact on students. Teachers often use a variety of tools to reflect and change their practice including self-monitoring, recording their own practice, and student's feedback through survey's and questionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M. (2015). Self-Evaluation of Teaching. Ryerson University: The Learning and Teaching Office.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Teacher Portfolios are used to compile a variety of evidence of teacher practices for the purpose of showing development of teaching over time. It is often used in conjunction with self-reflection or peer-reviewing of teaching practices.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Teaching. (2015) Teaching Portfolios from http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/teaching-portfolios/&lt;/ref&gt;
# Peer-Review of Teaching is a method for teaching to discuss their practice with another teacher or group of teachers that gives feedback about teaching and learning. Often an evaluation of the teaching materials is done with the purpose of providing feedback to change teaching practices.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Teaching and Learning (2015). Peer Review of Teaching.  University of Minnesota from http://www1.umn.edu/ohr/teachlearn/resources/peer/&lt;/ref&gt;

The new part of educator effectiveness policies is the integration of outcome data into the evaluation process. The biggest component of the outcome data is growth of student learning as measured by standardized tests. Most educator effectiveness programs rely on some form of value-added measures to determine student growth. Value-added measure use longitudinal measures of student achievement to estimate the growth in student learning that can be attributed to individual teachers. If the students of a specific teacher demonstrate growth in learning better than predicated on standardized tests, the teacher is said to be effective; if the students score below the predicted scores, the teacher is said to be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Goe, L. &amp; Croft, A. (2008). Methods of Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness. Research-to-Practice Brief. National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;  Parent and student surveys are another method of collecting data on teachers and their educational practices.&lt;ref&gt;Teaching and Learning Center (2015).  General Education Improvement. University of the Science from http://www.usciences.edu/teaching/tips/improvement.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Many argue that it is difficult to measure the effect that teachers have on student learning. Many teachers who are in the K-12 system, teach subjects that are not assessed on state mandated testing. In order to effectively implement an educator effectiveness system, some argue that states need to create different evaluation systems for the teachers who teach students in non-tested areas such as submitted portfolios of student work, lesson logs, video clips of them teaching and reflective commentaries on lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Darling-Hammond, . (2012). Creating a comprehensive system for evaluating and supporting effective teaching. Stanford, CA. Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue about the methodology as some districts are using value added models to determine the effectiveness to teachers. They state that it is an unreliable measurement tool because the makeup of classes differ greatly from teacher to teacher and from year to year. Some say that it ends up penalizing teachers who traditionally do not score well on standardized assessments such as students who receive free and reduce lunch and students with disabilities. They state that this may cause the highly effective teachers to work at schools with a low disability rate and a middle to high socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;Darling-Hammond, . (2012). Creating a comprehensive system for evaluating and supporting effective teaching. Stanford, CA. Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different ways to calculate the value-added effect of teachers that changes depending on how they define value-added and what they use to calculate it.  It typically does not account for the expectations put on students who go into a classroom reading below grade level and are expected to have a much higher growth rate than their peers.  Through many research studies, it has shown that the estimates of teacher effectiveness were not through the same throughout different years or content areas  such as reading and math and may be difficult to compare gains from tests from year to year when they don't measure the same content &lt;ref&gt;David, J.L ( 2010). What research says about using value-added measures to evaluate teachers. Educational Leadership (67)8&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have commented that evaluators in states with teacher evaluation systems do not have through enough training. Furthermore, these evaluators often do not have to prove themselves as effective teachers themselves. As of 2013, only 13 states require a certification for their evaluators that require evaluators are effective teachers. Furthermore, often the same evaluator is observing students every time. In order to have high quality teacher feedback, some would argue that multiple perspectives by highly effective educators would create the dialogue and feedback that would help teachers to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, K.M &amp; Jacobs, S.

The '''End of Course Test (EOCT, EOC, or EOC Test)''' is an academic assessment conducted in many states by the State Board of Education. [[Georgia Department of Education|Georgia]], for example, tests from the ninth to twelfth grades, and North Carolina tests for any of the four core class subjects (math, science, social studies, and English). 

[[North Carolina]] schools administer an EOCT in English II, Math I (Algebra I), and Biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncpublicschools.org/accountability/testing/eoc/ |title=NC BOE Accountability Services |website=Ncpublicschools.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The official purpose of the test is to assess both individual and group knowledge and skills.  EOCTs are mandatory and require a minimum score for [[graduation]] eligibility. Additionally, a North Carolina student's EOCT score must account for at least 25% of the student's final grade in the relevant course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/accountability/testing/briefs/opereocassessmentbrief2005.pdf|format=PDF|title=Understanding the North Carolina End-of-Course Tests|website=Ncpublicschools.org|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]] [[high schools]] are required to administer a [[standardized test|standardized]], [[multiple-choice]] EOCT, in each of eight core subjects including Algebra I, Geometry, U.S. History, Economics, Biology, Physical Science, Ninth Grade Literature and Composition, and American Literature and Composition.  The official purpose of the tests is to assess "specific content knowledge and skills."  Although a minimum test score is not required for the student to receive [[Carnegie Unit and Student Hour|credit]] in the course or to graduate from high school, completion of the test is mandatory.  The EOCT score comprises 20% of a student's grade in the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.doe.k12.ga.us/ci_testing.aspx?PageReq=CI_TESTING_EOCT |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502005611/http://www.doe.k12.ga.us/ci_testing.aspx?PageReq=CI_TESTING_EOCT |archive-date=2010-05-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the EOCT is an official, state-administered test, any violation or interference can result in the invalidation of scores of all students taking the exam on that subject. Interferences can include [[cellphone]]s, [[mp3 player]]s, reading books on the same subject as the exam, and talking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Georgia EOCT Examiner's Manual |publisher=Georgia Department of Education |url=http://www.doe.k12.ga.us/DMGetDocument.aspx/EOCT%20Examiner%20Manual%20Spring%202008.pdf?p=6CC6799F8C1371F6311D72520557EC57DC180675F2092EB5D87627264AA65391&amp;Type=D |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, E.O.C tests can be taken in middle schools.For example in the state of Florida it is mandatory for 7th graders (Middle school) to take a Civics EOC Test. A student can pass only if he attains a level of 3, 4 or 5.

'''''Experience and Education''''' is a short book written in 1938 by [[John Dewey]], a pre-eminent educational theorist of the 20th century.  It provides a concise and powerful analysis of [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Experience &amp; Education|year=1938|publisher=Kappa Delta Pi|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-684-83828-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this and his other writings on education, Dewey continually emphasizes experience, experiment, purposeful learning, freedom, and other concepts of [[progressive education]]. Dewey argues that the quality of an educational experience is critical and stresses the importance of the social and interactive processes of learning.

==Summary==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2014}}
Dewey was critical of both traditional and progressive education, that is he saw challenges within both educational approaches because they lacked a carefully developed philosophy of experience. Dewey's progressive learning theory is based on the idea that people, even young people, are not just blank slates waiting to be filled with knowledge from kinder through college. Instead, Dewey suggested that students organize fact-based comprehension through meta-cognition, or by building onto prior experiences, preconceptions, and knowledge, and therefore, the educator's role is in creating an educative experience.

===Traditional vs. Progressive Education===
Experience and Education opens by saying that humans organize thoughts, and ideas as "either-ors" and argues that this is mirrored in educational philosophy, namely in what Dewey labels as [[Traditional education|traditional]] vs. progressive education.&lt;ref&gt;^ Dewey, John (1938). Experience &amp; Education. New York, NY: Kappa Delta Pi. {{ISBN|0-684-83828-1}}. p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey conceptualizes education as being focused on bodies of information and skills that are passed from one generation to another.
Dewey does not put traditional vs. progressive education against each other; instead, he is critical of teaching methods that are "static"&lt;ref&gt;^ Dewey, John (1938). Experience &amp; Education. New York, NY: Kappa Delta Pi. {{ISBN|0-684-83828-1}}. p.19&lt;/ref&gt; and not incorporating enough [[experiential learning]], which he notes young learners are more accustomed to. In addition, Dewey is critical of the old structure and its organization of educational philosophy.

===The Need of a Theory of Experience===
In Chapter 2, The Need of a Theory of Experience, Dewey argues that not all experiences are educative and that, in fact, some experiences can be mis-educative. The central challenge to experience-based learning is to create fruitful experiences and organize them in progression to guide students’ learning. A mis-educative experience stymies the growth of further experiences.  Enjoyable experiences may be mis-educative if they are disconnected and promote dispersive, disintegrated and centrifugal habits.  In traditional schools, people associated boredom with the learning process. The experiences had by teachers and students were of the “wrong kind.” It Is not the absence of experiences in traditional schooling that Dewey finds troubling, but the defective nature of these experiences. Therefore, the educator’s duty is to determine the quality of an experience.  Each experience has two aspects:  the immediate agreeableness or disagreeableness and its later impact on further experience.  Educators must think about the experiential continuum—continuity of experiences.

===Criteria of Experience===
In Chapter 3, Criteria of Experience, Dewey delves more deeply into defining what constitutes experience for educational purposes and introduces the concept of directionality on the "experiential continuum". He argues growth can happen in an undesirable direction, as with that of burglars who become proficient at their professions. In this chapter, Dewey also raises questions about the built learning environment and critiques how traditional schools are insular environments rather than interacting with the world, which would promote an understanding of the world and provide a context.  Dewey posits that everything must have a context to be able to draw from it and have it be educational.

===Social Control===
In Chapter 4, Dewey argues that the teacher in a traditional classroom, by nature of the social setting, was concerned mainly with "keeping order."  In a progressive education classroom, social conventions would be enforced by the students who felt a part of the community and not forced on students by the teacher.  Dewey uses the example of children playing games at recess, as he explains "The games involve rules, and these rules order their conduct...As long as the game goes on with a reasonable smoothness, the players do not feel that they are submitting to external imposition, but that they are playing the game."  When things do not go smoothly, the player "may even get angry, but he is not objecting to a rule, but to what he claims is a violation of it." The teacher, in this instance, could act as the umpire or referee to which students would look to arbitrate disputes. In those few instances which the teacher had to intervene directly, as long as the teacher acted on behalf of the interest of the group, children would accept the teacher doing so. Dewey notes that traditional schools, which did not rely upon the establishment of a social learning community, tended to lack this social control, and therefore the teacher only had the option of "direct intervention" to "keep order."

===The Nature of Freedom===
In Chapter 5, Dewey asserts that the freedom of intelligence—the act of freely thinking, observing and judging—is the only freedom of enduring importance.  Unlike traditional schools that enforce quiet and stillness, progressive learning allows teachers to assess their students on a deeper level because of the outward freedom they afford students.  Freedom of movement is also an integral component of physical and mental health.  Although freedom of movement is important, Dewey states outward movement does not always lead to progressive learning.  Instead, Dewey believes that freedom of outer-movement is a means, not an end.  Teachers therefore should address the need for external freedom on an individual basis with each student.  Allowing students’ freedom of intelligence gives them the power to frame purposes, judge wisely, and evaluate their desires.  Students need time to make observations of the world.  Cultivating this freedom of intelligence or power means allowing students ample opportunity to reflect on their natural impulses by “stopping and thinking.”

===The Meaning of Purpose===
In Chapter 6, Dewey maintains that students must feel a sense of purpose in their learning to avoid mental slavery.  Dewey describes a slave as someone who “executes the purpose of another or is enslaved to his own blind desires.”   A genuine purpose consists of impulses, desires that are measured against perceived consequences.  A purpose involves thinking about future consequences resulting from acting upon impulse.  Schooling should not just concern itself with appealing to a student’s desires or impulses.  Educators must help students foresee the consequences of enacted impulses and desires.  More importantly educators must help drive the direction of the purpose.  The formation of purposes involves: observation of objective conditions; an assessment of past experiences with similar conditions; and judgment of observation combined with memory to determine significance.

===Educator's role in creating educative experience&lt;!--not a chapter title--&gt;===
An experience-based model of education implies students learning new material must find a way to ground unfamiliar concepts and ideas within the scope of ordinary life-experience. Progressive education with an emphasis on experience-linked learning relies on the role of the educator to structure material being studied in a manner that facilitates this.

Conversely, students' diverse backgrounds create an infinitely diverse range of experiences for the educator to consider. It is his/her responsibility to organize learning experiences to allow assimilation of new material in a context appreciable by and beneficial to the student. Developing this structure first requires acknowledgement of experience as a vehicle of learning. Subsequently the educator's discretion is important in selecting the material for a course of study and a sensitivity to weaving connections between the students' previous experiences and new material, such that the lesson learned is of greater value.

One of Dewey's preeminent concerns was the educator's role in creating an environment of education that provides continuity within this contextualized experience-based assimilative model of student learning. The difficulty in this challenge lies in continually adapting subject matter to the growing sphere of individual experiences as students progress.

'''Female education in STEM''' includes child and adult [[female]] represented in the fields of [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM ). In 2017, 33% of students in STEM fields were women.

The organization [[UNESCO]] has stated that this gender disparity is due to [[discrimination]], [[Bias|biases]], [[Norm (social)|social norms]] and expectations that influence the quality of [[education]] women receive and the subjects they study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; UNESCO also believes that having more women in STEM fields is desirable because it would help bring about [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002534/253479e.pdf|title=Cracking the code: Girls' and womens' education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100233-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender differences in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] education participation are already visible in [[Early childhood education|early childhood care and education]] in science- and math-related play, and become more pronounced at higher levels of [[education]]. Girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age, particularly between early and late adolescence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This decreased interest affects participation in advanced studies at the secondary level and in [[higher education]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Female students represent 35% of all students enrolled in STEM-related fields of study at this level globally &lt;!-- Needs clear source --&gt;. Differences are also observed by disciplines, with female enrollment lowest in engineering, manufacturing and construction, natural science, mathematics and statistics and ICT{{fix|text=what?}} fields. Significant regional and country differences in female representation in STEM studies can be observed, though, suggesting the presence of contextual factors affecting girls’ and women’s engagement in these fields. Women leave STEM disciplines in disproportionate numbers during their higher education studies, in their transition to the world of work and even in their career cycle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/priority-areas/gender-and-science/improving-%20measurement-of-gender-equality-in-stem/stem-and-gender-advancement-saga/|title=STEM and Gender Advancement (SAGA) {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PISA 2015 Results (Volume I): Excellence and Equity in Education|last=|first=|publisher=OECD|year=2016|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-results/advanced/|title=TIMSS ADVANCED 2015 INTERNATIONAL RESULTS REPORT – TIMSS 2015 INTERNATIONAL RESULTS REPORT|website=timssandpirls.bc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/|title=UIS Statistics|last=UIS|website=data.uis.unesco.org|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Engineering Indicators 2014|last=|first=|publisher=National Science Board|year=2014|isbn=|location=Arlington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning achievement in STEM education ===
Data on gender differences in learning achievement present a complex picture, depending on what is measured (subject, knowledge acquisition against knowledge application), the level of education/age of students, and geographic location. Overall, women's participation has been increasing, but significant regional variations exist. For example, where data are available in [[Africa]], [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], the gender gap is largely in favour of boys in mathematics achievement in secondary education. In contrast, in the Arab States, girls perform better than boys in both subjects in primary and secondary education. As with the data on participation, national and regional variations in data on learning achievement suggest the presence of contextual factors affecting girls’ and women’s engagement in these fields. Girls’ achievement seems to be stronger in science than mathematics and where girls do better than boys, the score differential is up to three times higher than where boys do better.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} girls tend to outperform boys in certain sub-topics such as [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] but do less well in [[physics]] and [[earth science]].

The gender gap has fallen significantly in science in secondary education among [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMSS trend countries]]: 14 out of 17 participating countries had no gender gap in science in 2015, compared to only one in 1995. However, the data is less well known outside of these 17 countries. The gender gap in boys' favour is slightly bigger in mathematics but improvements over time in girls’ favour are also observed in certain countries, despite the important regional variations. Gender differences are observed within mathematic sub-topics with girls outperforming boys in topics such as [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] but doing less well in "number". Girls’ performance is stronger in assessments that measure knowledge acquisition than those measuring knowledge application. Country coverage in terms of data availability is quite limited while data is collected at different frequency and against different variables in the existing studies. There are large gaps in our knowledge of the situation in low- and middle-income countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], Central [[Asia]], and South and West Asia, particularly at secondary level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Trends in Mathematics and Science Achievement, Curriculum and Instruction|last=Mullis, I.

== Factors influencing girls' and women's participation and achievement in STEM education ==
[[File:Expectations of a ICT career, by gender (PISA 2015).svg|thumb|upright=2|According to [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] 2015 results 4.8% of boys and 0.4% of girls expect a ICT career&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Catherine André/VoxEurop/EDJNet |author2=Marzia Bona/OBC Transeuropa/EDJNet |title=The ICT sector is booming.

According to UNESCO, there are multiple and overlapping factors which influence girls' and women's participation, achievement and progression in STEM studies and careers, all of which interact in complex ways, including: 
* '''Individual level:''' biological factors that may influence individuals’ abilities, skills, and [[Behavior|behaviour]] such as brain structure and function, [[Hormone|hormones]], [[genetics]], and cognitive traits like spatial and linguistic skills. It also considers psychological factors, including self-efficacy, interest and motivation.
* '''Family and peer level:''' parental beliefs and expectations, parental [[education]] and socioeconomic status, and other household factors, as well as peer influences.
* '''School level:''' factors within the [[learning environment]], including teachers’ profile, experience, beliefs and expectations, [[Curriculum|curricula]], learning materials and resources, [[Teaching method|teaching strategies]] and student teacher interactions, assessment practices and the overall school environment.
* '''Societal level:''' social and cultural [[norm (social)|norm]]s related to [[gender equality]], and gender stereotypes in the media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Individual level ===
{{see also|Sex differences in psychology|Sex differences in intelligence}}
The question of whether there are differences in cognitive ability between men and women has long been a topic of debate among researchers and scholars. Some studies have found no differences in the neural mechanism of learning based on sex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spearman, J. and Watt, H.|first=|date=2013|title=Perception shapes experience: The influence of actual and perceived classroom environment dimensions on girls’  motivations for science|url=|journal=Learning Environment Research|volume=16|pages=217-238|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolmos, A., Mejlgaard, N., Haase, S. and Holgaard, J.E.|first=|date=2013|title=Motivational factors, gender and engineering in education|url=|journal=European Journal of Engineering Education|volume=38|pages=340-358|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDaniel, A.|first=|date=2015|title=The role of cultural contexts in explaining cross-national gender gaps in STEM Expectations|url=|journal=European Sociological Review|volume=32|pages=122-133|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Su, R., Rounds, J. and Armstrong, P.I.|first=|date=2009|title=Men and things, women and people: A meta-analysis of sex differences in interests|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=135|pages=859|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of interest has been the major reason cited for girls opting out of STEM. However, some have stated that this choice is influenced heavily by the socialization process and stereotyped ideas about gender roles, including stereotypes about gender and STEM. Gender stereotypes that communicate the idea that STEM studies and careers are male domains can negatively affect girls’ interest, engagement and achievement in STEM and discourage them from pursuing STEM careers. Girls who assimilate such stereotypes have lower levels of self-efficacy and confidence in their ability than boys. Self-efficacy affects both STEM education outcomes and aspirations for STEM careers to a considerable extent. Some studies have shown that girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Family and peer level ===
Parents, including their beliefs and expectations, play an important role in shaping girls’ attitudes towards, and interest in, STEM studies. Parents with traditional beliefs about gender roles and who treat girls and boys unequally can reinforce stereotypes about gender and ability in STEM. Parents can also have a strong influence on girls' STEM participation and learning achievement through the family values, environment, experiences and encouragement that they provide. Some research finds that parents’ expectations, particularly the mother’s expectations, have more influence on the [[higher education]] and career choices of girls than those of boys&lt;!-- Needs source if referring to "some research" --&gt;. Higher socio-economic status and parental educational qualifications are associated with higher scores in [[mathematics]] and science for both girls and boys. Girls’ science performance appears to be more strongly associated with mothers’ higher educational qualifications, and boys’ with their fathers’. Family members with STEM careers can also influence girls’ STEM engagement. The broader socio-cultural context of the family can also play a role. Factors such as ethnicity, the language used at home, immigrant status and family structure may also have an influence on girls’ participation and performance in STEM. Peers can also impact on girls’ motivation and feeling of belonging in STEM education. Influence of female peers is a significant predictor of girls’ interest and confidence in mathematics and science.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== School level ===
Qualified teachers with specialization in STEM can positively influence girls’ performance and engagement with STEM education and their interest in pursuing STEM careers. Female STEM teachers often have stronger benefits for girls, possibly by acting as role models and by helping to dispel stereotypes about sex-based STEM ability. Teachers’ beliefs, attitudes, behaviours and interactions with students, as well as [[Curriculum|Curricula]] and learning materials, can all play a role as well. Opportunities for real-life experiences with STEM, including hands-on practice, apprenticeships, career counselling and mentoring can expand girls’ understanding of STEM studies and professions and maintain interest. Assessment processes and tools that are gender-biased or include gender [[stereotype]]s may negatively affect girls’ performance in STEM. Girls’ learning outcomes in STEM can also be compromised by psychological factors such as mathematics or test anxiety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A 2018 study found that while girls perform better or equal to boys in two out of three countries, in nearly all countries more girls were qualified to college-level{{Clarify|reason=is university level STEM study meant? Native English speaker help needed.|date=March 2018}} study than had enrolled. Researchers found that female enrolment to STEM subjects was relatively lower in countries with a high degree of gender equality – a [[gender-equality paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719|title=The Gender-Equality Paradox in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education|last=G. Stoet, D. C. Geary|first=|date=14 February 2018|website=SAGE Publishing|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180214150132.htm|title=Countries with greater gender equality have a lower percentage of female STEM graduates: Findings could help refine education efforts and policies geared toward girls and science, technology, engineering and mathematics|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Societal level ===
Cultural and [[Norm (social)|social norms]] influence girls’ perceptions about their abilities, role in society and career and life aspirations.The degree of gender equality in wider society influences girls’ participation and performance in STEM. In countries with greater gender equality, girls tend to have more positive attitudes and confidence about mathematics and the gender gap in achievement in the subject is smaller. Targeted measures to promote gender equality, such as gender mainstreaming legislation or policies such as quotas, financial incentives or other, can increase girls’ and women’s participation in STEM education and careers. Gender stereotypes portrayed in the media are internalized by children and [[Adult|adults]] and affect the way they see themselves and others. Media can perpetuate or challenge [[gender stereotypes]] about STEM abilities and careers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Global education''' is a set of ideas taught to enhance one's perception of the world. It is taught within the curriculum where teachers integrate multiple dimensions, perspectives, and citizenships into everyday lessons. It began as an undertaking to restructure education and society in the 1960s and 1970s, through the initiatives of educationalists, NGOs and intergovernmental organizations. This global approach seeks to break an educational program that is stuck in subject knowledge and national culture, and instead, seeks to discover alternative motivations for education and alternate futures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Standish|first=Alex|date=2014|title=What is global education and where is it taking us?|journal=The Curriculum Journal|volume=25|issue=2|pages=166–186|doi=10.1080/09585176.2013.870081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, it is perceived to enable young people to participate in shaping a better, shared future for the world. It emphasizes the unity and interdependence of human society, developing a sense of self and appreciation of cultural diversity, affirmation of social justice and human rights, as well as building peace and actions for a sustainable future at different times and places. This approach is also believed to promote positive values and prods students to take responsibility for their actions and see themselves as global citizens who can contribute to a more peaceful, just and sustainable world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globaleducation.edu.au/global-education/what-is-global-ed.html|title=What is global education? {{!}} Global Education|website=www.globaleducation.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It is not a subject but a dimension that runs through the curriculum, an extra filter to help children make sense of all the information and opinions the world throws at them. It combines methodology - active and experiential discussion based activities, a caring, co-operative and open outlook on the classroom experience, and core concerns- finding out about all the world's cultures and groups, about the causes of poverty and inequality and about the environment.
* It is a way of approaching everything being taught and how it is taught. It broadens horizons and encourages exploration of all subjects from a global perspective.

== Children's literature ==
Evidence based practices have shown that literature can help children learn about global issues. By exploring diversity in text, connecting the literature to service learning and activism, promote critical thinking about themselves in the global community, and develop their global awareness with literacy elements. Literature introduced in the classroom can teach multiple skills that prepare for further learning within the global community.&lt;ref&gt;'''ERIC - Breaking Boundaries with Global Literature: Celebrating Diversity in K-12 Classrooms, International Reading Association (NJ3), 2007.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
Technology is a key provider in learning about globalization and participating in the global community. Technology can be used in the classroom to communicate around the world, establish global relationships, learn more about global current events, and developing global research. The advancements of technology will have a positive impact of global education in primary schools and higher education schools.&lt;ref&gt;'''Mapping the future: The future of education. (n.d.).

== Service learning ==
Service learning or local volunteer service work are included in conceptualized [[global citizenship]] programs. This approach is criticized because global relations are dramatically split into rich and poor, or oppressor and oppressed, respectively. Experiences of oppression are more complex than experiences of oppressing. [[Global citizenship education]] includes connecting nearby and worldwide issues and points of view and may incorporate such themes as human rights, social equity, and citizenship instruction, economic improvement, and globalization. Service learning can carry the possibility to recreate social disparities and advance, instead of dissipate, stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Aktas, Fatih, et al. “Institutionalizing Global Citizenship.” Journal of Studies in International Education, vol. 21, no. 1, 2016, pp. 65–80., doi:10.1177/1028315316669815.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''great books''' are [[book]]s that constitute an essential foundation in the [[literature]] of [[Western culture]]. Specified sets of great books typically range from 100 to 150, though they differ according to purpose and context. For instance, some lists are built to be read by undergraduates in a college semester system (130 books, Torrey Honors Institute),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academics.biola.edu/torrey/academics/reading/ |title=The Reading List &amp;#124; Torrey Honors Institute, Biola University}}&lt;/ref&gt; some are compiled to be sold as a single set of volumes ([[Great Books of the Western World|500 books]], [[Mortimer Adler]]), while some lists aim at a thorough literary criticism (2,400 books, [[Harold Bloom]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Teeter|first=Robert|url=http://sonic.net/~rteeter/grtbloom.html |title=Bloom. Western Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The great books are those that tradition, and various institutions and authorities, have regarded as constituting or best expressing the foundations of [[Western culture]] (the [[Western canon]] is a similar but broader designation); derivatively the term also refers to a curriculum or method of education based around a list of such books. [[Mortimer Adler]] lists three criteria for including a book on the list:
* the book has contemporary significance; that is, it has relevance to the problems and issues of our times;
* the book is inexhaustible; it can be read again and again with benefit; "This is an exacting criterion, an ideal that is fully attained by only a small number of the 511 works that we selected. It is approximated in varying degrees by the rest."&lt;ref name="Selecting Works for 1990 Edition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberspacei.com/greatbooks/h2/criteria.htm |title=Selecting Works for the 1990 Edition of the Great Books of the Western World|author=Adler, Mortimer J. |accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the book is relevant to a large number of the great ideas and great issues that have occupied the minds of thinking individuals for the last 25 centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, "Second Look", p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.john-uebersax.com/plato/reading2.htm |title=Thomas Jefferson's Reading Lists |publisher=John-uebersax.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; well known for his interest in higher education, frequently composed great books lists for his friends and correspondents, for example, for Peter Carr in 1785&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr  (An honest heart, a knowing head; Paris, August 19, 1785). In: Merril D. Peterson (ed.), Thomas Jefferson Works, 1984. (pp. 814–818)&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr (The homage to Reason; Paris, August 10, 1787). In: Merril D. Peterson (ed.), Thomas Jefferson Works, 1984. (pp. 900–906).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Harvard University published a 51-volume great books series, titled the [[Harvard Classics]].  These volumes are now in the public domain.

The [[Great Books of the Western World]] came about as the result of a discussion among American academics and educators, starting in the 1920s and 1930s and begun by Prof. [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]] of [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radicalacademy.com/adlerlowelllec.htm |title=radicalacademy.com |publisher=radicalacademy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907054422/http://radicalacademy.com/adlerlowelllec.htm |archive-date=2011-09-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; about how to improve the higher education system by returning it to the western [[liberal arts]] tradition of broad cross-disciplinary learning. These academics and educators included [[Robert Hutchins]], [[Mortimer Adler]], [[Stringfellow Barr]], [[Scott Buchanan]], [[Jacques Barzun]], and [[Alexander Meiklejohn]]. The view among them was that the emphasis on narrow specialization in American colleges had harmed the quality of [[higher education]] by failing to expose students to the important products of Western civilization and thought.

They were at odds both with much of the existing educational establishment and with contemporary educational theory. Educational theorists like [[Sidney Hook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hook|first=Sidney|title=Education for Modern Man|year=1946|publisher=The Dial Press|location=New York, NY|url=http://www.ditext.com/hook/hook.html|authorlink=Sidney Hook|chapter=A Critical Appraisal of the St. John's College Curriculum|quote=Reprinted with some minor changes from ''[[The New Leader]]'', May 26 and June 4, 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Dewey]] (''see [[pragmatism]]'') disagreed with the premise that there was [[educational crossover|crossover]] in education.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Program==
The Great Books Program is a curriculum that makes use of this list of texts. As much as possible, students rely on primary sources. The emphasis is on open discussion with limited guidance by a professor, facilitator, or tutor. Students are also expected to write papers.

In 1920, Professor Erskine taught the first course based on the "great books" program, titled "General Honors", at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=col&gt;{{cite web |title=The Beginnings of the Great Books Movement at Columbia |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/Magazine/Winter2001/greatBooks.html |date=Winter 2001 |publisher=Columbia Magazine |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faculty&gt;{{cite web |title= An Oasis of Order: The Core Curriculum at Columbia College:Faculty Profiles:John Erskine|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/oasis/profiles/erskine.php |date= |publisher=Columbia College |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped mold its core curriculum. It initially failed, however, shortly after its introduction due to fallings-out between the senior faculty over the best ways to conduct classes and due to concerns about the rigor of the courses. Thus junior faculty including [[Mark Van Doren]]  and [[Mortimer Adler]] after 1923, taught a part of the course. The course was discontinued in 1928, though later reconstituted. Adler left for the [[University of Chicago]] in 1929, where he continued his work on the theme, and along with the University president, [[Robert M. Hutchins]], held an annual seminar of great books. In 1937, when Mark Van Doren redesigned the course, it was already being taught at [[St. John's College, Annapolis]], besides University of Chicago. This course later became Humanities A for freshmen, and subsequently evolved into Literature Humanities.&lt;ref name=col/&gt;  Survivors, however, include [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Columbia's Core Curriculum]], the Common Core at Chicago, and the Core Curriculum at [[Boston University]], each heavily focused on the "great books" of the Western canon.

A university or college Great Books Program is a program inspired by the Great Books movement begun in the United States in the 1920s. The aim of such programs is a return to the Western [[Liberal Arts]] tradition in education, as a corrective to the extreme disciplinary specialisation common within the academy. The essential component of such programs is a high degree of engagement with whole primary texts, called the Great Books. The curricula of Great Books programs often follow a canon of texts considered more or less essential to a student's education, such as Plato's ''Republic'', or Dante's ''Divine Comedy''. Such programs often focus exclusively on Western culture. Their employment of primary texts dictates an interdisciplinary approach, as most of the Great Books do not fall neatly under the prerogative of a single contemporary academic discipline. Great Books programs often include designated discussion groups as well as lectures, and have small class sizes. In general students in such programs receive an abnormally high degree of attention from their professors, as part of the overall aim of fostering a community of learning.

There are only a few true "Great Books Programs" still in operation.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} These schools focus almost exclusively on the Great Books Curriculum throughout enrollment and do not offer classes analogous to those commonly offered at other colleges. The first and best known of these schools is [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)#Great Books program|St. John's College]] in Annapolis and Santa Fe (program established in 1937);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |title=St. John’s College &amp;#124; Academic Program &amp;#124; The Reading List |publisher=Stjohnscollege.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527090156/http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was followed by [[Shimer College]] in Chicago, the Integral Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarys-ca.edu/the-integral-program|title=The Integral Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Saint Mary's College of California (1955), [[Thomas More College of Liberal Arts]] in Merrimack, New Hampshire (est. 1978), [[Northeast Catholic College]] in Warner, New Hampshire,  and [[Thomas Aquinas College]] in Santa Paula, California. More recent schools with this type of curriculum include [[New Saint Andrews College]] in Moscow, Idaho (est. 1994), [[Gutenberg College]] in Eugene, Oregon (est. 1994), [[Harrison Middleton University]] in Tempe, Arizona (est. 1998), [[Wyoming Catholic College]] in Lander, Wyoming (est. 2005), and [[Imago Dei College]] in Oak Glen, California (est. 2010). Fordham University's Honors Program at Rose Hill incorporates the Great Books curriculum into a rigorous first four semesters in the program. The [[University of Notre Dame]]'s Program of Liberal Studies, established in 1950, is a highly regarded Great Books Program that operates as a separate institution within the College of Liberal Arts. [[Dharma Realm Buddhist University]] is the first Great Books school to offer curriculum combining Eastern and Western classics.&lt;ref name="drbu.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dharma Realm Buddhist University Accepting Applications for Undergraduate Program|url=http://www.drbu.org/news/dharma-realm-buddhist-university-accepting-applications-undergraduate-program|website=Dharma Realm Buddhist University|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for the Study of the Great Ideas advances the Great Conversation found in the great books by providing Adler's guidance, and resource materials through both live and on-line seminars, educational and philosophical consultation, international presence on the Internet, access to the Center's library collection of books, essays, articles, journals and audio/video programs. Center programs are unique in that they do not replicate other existing programs either started or developed by Adler.

=== Universities ===
Over 100 institutions of higher learning in the United States, Canada, and Europe maintain some version of a Great Books Program as an option for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casement|first=William|title=College Great Books Programs|url=http://www.coretexts.org/college-great-books-programs/#tz|publisher=The Association for Core Texts and Courses (ACTC)|accessdate=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are:

==Controversy==
In contemporary scholarship, the great books curriculum was drawn into the popular debate about [[multiculturalism]], traditional education, the "culture war," and the role of the intellectual in American life. Much of this debate centered on reactions to the publication of ''[[The Closing of the American Mind]]'' in 1987 by [[Allan Bloom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ditext.com/searle/searle1.html John Searle, "The Storm Over the University," ''The New York Review of Books'', December 6, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series==
{{main article|Great Books of the Western World}}

The ''Great Books of the Western World'' is a hardcover 60-volume collection (originally 54 volumes) of the books on the great books list (about 517 individual works). Many of the books in the collection were translated into English for the first time.{{fact|date=February 2017}} A prominent feature of the collection is a two-volume [[Syntopicon]] that includes essays written by Mortimer Adler on 102 "great ideas." Following each essay is an extensive outline of the idea with page references to relevant passages throughout the collection. Familiar to many Americans, the collection is available from [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]], which owns the copyright.

Shortly after Adler retired from the [[Great Books Foundation]] in 1989, a second edition (1990) of the ''Great Books of the Western World'' was published; it included more Hispanic and female authors and, for the first time, works by black authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010701/ai_n13916438 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104001606/http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010701/ai_n13916438 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-11-04 |author=Sabrina Walters |title=Great Books won Adler fame, scorn |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=2001-07-01 |accessdate=2007-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as president of the Foundation, Adler had resisted such additions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010703/ai_n13917760 |author=Peter Temes |title=Death of a Great Reader and Philosopher |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=2001-07-03 |accessdate=2007-07-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104012348/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010703/ai_n13917760 |archivedate=2007-11-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We did not base our selections on an author's nationality, religion, politics, or field of study; nor on an author's race or gender. Great books were not chosen to make up quotas of any kind; there was no "affirmative action" in the process&amp;nbsp;... we chose the great books on the basis of their relevance to at least 25 of the 102 great ideas. Many of the great books are relevant to a much larger number of the 102 great ideas, as many as 75 or more great ideas, a few to all 102 great ideas. In sharp contrast are the good books that are relevant to less than 10 or even as few as 4 or 5 great ideas. We placed such books in the lists of Recommended Readings to be found in the last section in each of the 102 chapters of the "Syntopicon". Here readers will find many twentieth-century female authors, black authors, and Latin American authors whose works we recommended but did not include in the second edition of the great books.&lt;ref name="Selecting Works for 1990 Edition"/&gt;}}
{{quote|In the course of history&amp;nbsp;... new books have been written that have won their place in the list. Books once thought entitled to belong to it have been superseded; and this process of change will continue as long as men can think and write. It is the task of every generation to reassess the tradition in which it lives, to discard what it cannot use, and to bring into context with the distant and intermediate past the most recent contributions to the Great Conversation.&lt;ref&gt;''Great Books – The Foundation of a Liberal Education'', New York – Simon &amp; Schuster, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Television==
{{Main article| The Learning Channel's Great Books}}
In 1954 Mortimer Adler hosted a live weekly television series in San Francisco, comprising 52 half-hour programs, entitled ''The Great Ideas''. These programs were produced by the Institute for Philosophical Research and were carried as a public service by the [[American Broadcasting Company]], presented by National Educational Television (NET), the precursor to what is now PBS. Adler bequeathed these films to the Center for the Study of the Great Ideas, where they are available for purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreatideas.org/mortimer_adler_videos/index.html|title=Mortimer Adler Videos on The Great Ideas|website=www.thegreatideas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 and 1994, The [[Learning Channel]] created a series of one-hour programs discussing many of the great books of history and their impact on the world. It was narrated by [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Morgan Freeman]], amongst others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5152">An '''honor student''' is a student recognized for achieving high [[grading (education)|grades]] or high marks in their coursework at school.

==United States==

In the US honors students may refer to:
# Students recognized for their academic achievement on lists published periodically throughout the school year, known as honors roll, varying from school to school, shows the student going above and beyond and from enlarged different levels of education.
# Students enrolled in designated honors courses or honors program.
# Students who are members of the [[National Honor Society]] or other [[honor society]].

Honors students are often recognized for their achievements. A student who has made numerous appearances on the honor roll may be awarded some form of [[Varsity letter|academic letter]], or any other form of notification.&lt;ref name="letterwinners" /&gt; A similar concept to honor rolls exists in colleges and universities in the United States, known as the [[Dean's List]].

==Elsewhere in the world==

In other countries, the meaning of honours can refer either to a specific type of [[academic degree]] or to the level of distinction with which an undergraduate degree was earned.

[[Honours degrees]] are usually four-year programs (sometimes also three-year programs, e.g., in England). A student who holds a ''de jure'' Honours degree is eligible for direct entry either to a Doctorate (Ph.D.) or to a two- to three years very-high-research Master's degree program.

'Honours' can also mean that students have achieved their degree with a high overall average [[GPA]] and typically have undertaken a small final project, paper or essay (also known in the UK as a dissertation). See [[British undergraduate degree classification]].

A third meaning is a postgraduate ''with Honours'' or ''cum honored'' degree, which is (part of) an academic degree itself, e.g. the one-year Bachelor with Honours degree in Australia, the one-year Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree in Canada or the four-year integrated Master with Honours degree in Scotland. Postgraduate Honours degree programs generally involve completion of master's level courses and the submission of a long high-research [[thesis]].

== Criticism ==
Some researchers have questioned the validity of the honor roll as an effective form of [[positive reinforcement]]. It is argued that the pursuit of extrinsic reward is not an accurate reflection of intrinsic interest in course material.&lt;ref name="fx" /&gt; There are also questions on the effectiveness of separating high-achieving students from their peers, in the form of [[magnet school]]s or honors courses.&lt;ref name="effectiveness" /&gt;

== Honors courses ==
An honors course is a class in which the most advanced students are placed. Most students placed in honors courses are highly motivated and dedicated to their educational experience.&lt;ref name="courses" /&gt; Honors classes also cover advanced material, permit more in-depth study than a standard course of study and may require independent research.

Motivation is the main quality that characterizes an honors student. In addition to being committed to academics, they are encouraged and many participate in volunteer work, organizations and clubs, cooperative education, research, study abroad and cultural activities.&lt;ref name="mission" /&gt;

[[Honors programs]] have specific entrance requirements and completion criteria in order to graduate with Honors, or [[cum laude]].

'''Invitational Education (IE)''' is an [[Education theory|educational theory]] of practice introduced by co-founders Dr. William Watson Purkey and Dr. [[Betty Siegel]] of the International Alliance for Invitational Education (IAIE).&lt;ref name="zeeman2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeeman|first=Roger D.|title=Glasser's Choice Theory and Purkey's Invitational Education-Allied Approaches to Counseling and Schooling|journal=Journal of Invitational Theory and Practice|date=2006|volume=12|pages=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purkey is professor emeritus of [[counselor education]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] and writes prolifically as a catalyst for [[school improvement]]. In addition, Dr. John Novak, professor emeritus at [[Brock University]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], is a primary contributor to the development of Invitational Theory and Practice, authoring numerous books on the subject and lecturing internationally.
[[File:Betty Siegel.jpeg|thumbnail|Dr. Betty Siegel]]

IE emphasizes the importance of internal knowledge in relation to external connections to the outside world and existing educational systems.&lt;ref name="zeeman2006" /&gt; A key feature of IE is positive [[self-concept]] developed through a school environment that leads to more [[productivity]].&lt;ref name="zeeman2006" /&gt;

Purkey writes, "At its heart, Invitational Education is an imaginative act of hope that explains how human potential can be realized. It identifies and changes the forces that defeat and destroy people. Invitational Education is designed to create and enhance human environments that cordially summon people to realize their potential in all areas of worthwhile human endeavor." &lt;ref name="Purkey 2015"&gt;Purkey, William Watson and Novak, John Michael. Fundamentals of Invitational Education. New York: The International Alliance for Invitational Education, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; "Invitational Education asserts that organizations are never neutral. Everything and everybody either adds to or subtracts from an existing culture. Invitational Education offers concrete, practice, safe, successful and democratic solutions for problems that routinely harm organizations and the people within them."

Invitational Education recognizes five Domains which comprise everyone and every thing in an '''organization'''. The Domains include People, Places, Policies, Programs and Processes. These domains will either build or destroy intellectual, social, physical, emotional and moral potential for stakeholders. Adjusting these domains, Invitational Education's theory and practices have been embedded in schools around the world at all levels, from [[nursery school]]s to universities. In addition, Invitational Education has strengthened [[health care]] facilities, businesses, non-profits, worship centers and families.&lt;ref name="Purkey 2015"/&gt;

In ''[[Visible Learning]]'', [[John Hattie]]'s meta-analysis of school improvement research, Hattie writes, "[Invitational Education] is not 'niceness' at work, but an approach that places much reliance on the teachers and schools to make learning exciting, engaging, and enduring. Where there are school differences, it is these types of effects that are the most powerful." Hattie's research determined that many of the most hotly debated [[school reform]] efforts had little effect on school improvement, but those which provide in invitation to learn had the most profound effect.&lt;ref&gt;Hattie, John. Visible Learning: A Synthesis of Over 800 Meta-Analyses Relating to Achievement, (pp.&amp;nbsp;33–34). New York: Routledge, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also applying Invitational Education are authors [[Harry Wong|Harry]] and Rosemary Wong. In their book, ''The First Days of School'', the Wongs explain that effective teachers invite their students and their colleagues to learn together. "An invitation makes a person feel able, responsible and valuable. Effective teachers have the power and the ability to maintain an inviting stance in the classroom." &lt;ref&gt;Wong, Harry K. &amp; Rosemary T. (2009). ''The First Days of School''. (4th ed.) Harry K.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kharkiv school of psychology''' (''Харьківска психологічна школа'') is a tradition of developmental psychological research conducted in the paradigm of [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s "sociocultural theory of mind" and [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|Leontiev's]] psychological [[activity theory]].

== Kharkiv group: the beginning of the school ==
The school was founded by its leader [[Alexander Luria]], who—along with [[Mark Lebedinsky]] and [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|Alexei Leont'ev]]—moved from Moscow to [[Kharkiv]], the capital of Soviet [[Ukraine]] at that time. The core of the group was formed by Luria, Lebedinsky and Leontiev and their Moscow colleagues, [[Alexander Zaporozhets|Zaporozhets]] and Bozhovich, along with a group of such local researchers as Gal'perin, [[Vladimir Asnin|Asnin]], [[Pyotr Zinchenko|P. Zinchenko]], Lukov, Khomenko, Kontsevaya, Rozenblyum, etc. The group conducted a wide range of psychological studies on concept formation in children, voluntary and involuntary memory, development of visual-operational thinking, voluntary behaviour, and reasoning, the role of orientation in thought and activity, etc. that laid the foundation for the psychological [[activity theory|theory of activity]].

== P. I. Zinchenko and the Kharkiv school of developmental psychology ==
In the postwar period, the scientific work of the school developed under informal leadership of [[Pyotr Zinchenko]] in the field of the psychology of memory. The major achievement of the school is the systematic analysis of the phenomenon of [[involuntary memory]] from the standpoint of the [[activity theory|activity approach]] in psychology. Soviet studies of involuntary memory carried out by the representatives of the Kharkiv school influenced psychological research both nationally and worldwide (e.g., memory research by [[Ann Brown|A. Brown]], Murphy, Meacham, Sophian, Hagen, etc.).

The [[information processing]] or [[engineering psychology]] approach to memory and cognition was developed in the research by Zinchenko, Bocharova, Nevel'skii, Repkina. On the other hand, research on the role of involuntary memory in education and memory in thinking and personality development was conducted by Sereda, Ivanova, and associates.

Another major area of research is the theory and practice of developmental teaching (or the system of El'konin-Davydov) associated with such representatives of the Kharkiv school as Repkin, Bodanskii, Dusavitskii.

== Selected publications of the school ==

'''Kindergarten''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|n|d|ər|ˌ|g|ɑːr|t|ən}}, {{IPAc-en|audio=GT Kindergarten AE.ogg|US|-|d|ən}}; from [[German language|German]] {{IPA-de|ˈkɪndɐˌɡaːɐ̯tn̩||GT Kindergarten deutsch.ogg}}, literally meaning 'garden for the children')&lt;ref&gt;The term was coined in the metaphorical sense of "place where children can grow in a natural way", not in the literal sense of having a "garden".&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[preschool]] educational approach based on playing, singing, practical activities such as drawing, and social interaction as part of the transition from home to school. Such institutions were originally created in the late 18th century in [[Bavaria]] and [[Strasbourg]] to serve children whose parents both worked outside home. The term was coined by the German [[Friedrich Fröbel]], whose approach globally influenced early-years education. Today, the term is used in many countries to describe a variety of [[educational institution]]s and [[learning space]]s for children ranging from two to seven years of age, based on a variety of teaching methods.
==History==
[[File:Max_Liebermann_Kleinkinderschule_in_Amsterdam_1880.jpg|thumb|Kindergarten in Amsterdam 1880, by [[Max Liebermann]]]]In 1779, [[Johann Friedrich Oberlin]] and Louise Scheppler founded in [[Strasbourg]] an early establishment for caring for and educating pre-school children whose parents were absent during the day.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Lorenzo Knapp (1843), ''Female biography; containing notices of distinguished women, in different nations and ages''.

[[Samuel Wilderspin]] opened his first infant school in London in 1819,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGYWAAAAIAAJ&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=The Importance of Educating the Infant Poor|year=1823|first=Samuel|last=Wilderspin|place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to establish hundreds more. He published many works on the subject, and his work became the model for infant schools throughout England and further afield. Play was an important part of Wilderspin's system of education. He is credited with inventing the [[playground]]. In 1823, Wilderspin published ''On the Importance of Educating the Infant Poor'', based on the school. He began working for the Infant School Society the next year, informing others about his views. He also wrote ''The Infant System, for developing the physical, intellectual, and moral powers of all children from 1 to seven years of age''.

[[File:Frederick-Froebel-Bardeen.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|[[Friedrich Fröbel]] was one of the most influential founders of kindergartens, and he coined the name in 1840.]]
Countess [[Theresa Brunszvik]] (1775–1861), who had known and been influenced by [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], was influenced by this example to open an ''Angyalkert'' ("angel garden" in Hungarian) on May 27, 1828, in her residence in [[Budapest|Buda]], the first of eleven care centers that she founded for young children.&lt;ref&gt;Budapest Lexikon, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public Preschool Education In Hungary: A Historical Survey, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836 she established an institute for the foundation of preschool centers. The idea became popular among the nobility and the middle class and was copied throughout the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

[[Friedrich Fröbel]] (1782–1852) opened a "play and activity" institute in 1837 in the village of [[Bad Blankenburg]] in the [[principality]] of [[Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]], Thuringia, as an experimental social experience for children entering school. He renamed his institute ''{{lang|de|Kindergarten}}'' on June 28, 1840, reflecting his belief that children should be nurtured and nourished "like plants in a garden".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fi/books?id=QfBV-nd1bqAC&amp;q=p%C3%A4dagogischen+n%C3%A4hrbodens#v=snippet&amp;q=p%C3%A4dagogischen%20n%C3%A4hrbodens&amp;f=false Kinder bilden Sprache - Sprache bildet Kinder], p. 24 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Women trained by Fröbel opened kindergartens throughout Europe and around the world. The [[First Kindergarten|first kindergarten]] in the US was founded in [[Watertown, Wisconsin]] in 1856 and was conducted in German by Margaretha Meyer-Schurz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watertownhistory.org Watertown Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Peabody]] founded the first English-language kindergarten in the US in 1860. The first free kindergarten in the US was founded in 1870 by [[Conrad Poppenhusen]], a German industrialist and philanthropist, who also established the [[Poppenhusen Institute]]. The first publicly financed kindergarten in the US was established in [[St. Louis]] in 1873 by [[Susan Blow]].

Canada's first private kindergarten was opened by the [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyan Methodist Church]] in [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]], in 1870.

===Afghanistan===
{{see also|Education in Afghanistan}}
[[File:AF-kindergarten.jpg|frame|A kindergarten classroom in Afghanistan]]

In [[Afghanistan]], children between the ages of 3 and 6 attend kindergartens ({{lang-prs|کودکستان}}; {{lang-ps|وړکتون}}). Although kindergartens in Afghanistan are not part of the school system, they are often run by the government.

Early Childhood Development programs were first introduced during the Soviet occupation with the establishment in 1980 of 27 urban preschools, or kodakistan. The number of preschools grew steadily during the 1980s, peaking in 1990 with more than 270 in Afghanistan. At this peak, there were 2,300 teachers caring for more than 21,000 children in the country. These facilities were an urban phenomenon, mostly in Kabul, and were attached to schools, government offices, or factories. Based on the Soviet model, these Early Childhood Development programs provided nursery care, preschool, and kindergarten for children from 3 months to 6 years of age under the direction of the Department of Labor and Social Welfare.

The vast majority of Afghan families were never exposed to this system, and many of these families were in opposition to these programs due to the belief that it diminishes the central role of the family and inculcates children with Soviet values. With the onset of civil war after the Soviet withdrawal, the number of kindergartens dropped rapidly. By 1995, only 88 functioning facilities serving 2,110 children survived, and the Taliban restrictions on female employment eliminated all of the remaining centers in areas under their control. In 2007, there were about 260 kindergarten/pre-school centers serving over 25,000 children. Though every government center is required to have an early childhood center,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} at present, no governmental policies deal with early childhood and no institutions have either the responsibility or the capacity to provide such services.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Australia===
{{See also|Education in Australia}}
In each state of Australia, ''kindergarten'' (frequently referred to as "kinder" or "kindy") means something slightly different. In [[Tasmania]], New South Wales and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], it is the first year of primary school. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], kindergarten is a form of [[preschool]] and may be referred to interchangeably as preschool or kindergarten. In Victoria and Tasmania, the phrase for the first year of primary school is called ''Prep'' (short for "preparatory"), which is followed by grade 1. 

In Queensland, kindergarten is usually an institution for children around the age of 4 and thus it is the precursor to preschool and primary education. In recent years though, Kindergartens have been taking children as young as 6 months old. 

The year preceding the first year of primary school education in Western Australia, South Australia or the [[Northern Territory]] is referred to respectively as ''pre-primary'', ''reception'' or ''transition''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.det.wa.edu.au/education/ece/enrolments.html#compare&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
{{see also|Education in Bangladesh}}
In [[Bangladesh]], the term "kindergarten", or "KG School" (Kindergarten School), is used to refer to the schooling children attend from 3 to 6 years of age. The names of the levels are nursery, ''shishu'' (children), etc. But the view of kindergarten education has changed much from previous years. Almost every rural area now has at least one Kindergarten School, with most being run in the [[Bengali language]]. They also follow the textbooks published by the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) with a light modification, adding some extra books in syllabus. The grades generally start from Nursery (sometimes "Play"), "KG" afterwards, and ends with the 5th grade. Separate from the National Education System, kindergarten is contributing greatly toward achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal]] of universal primary education in Bangladesh.

===Bulgaria===
{{see also|Education in Bulgaria}}
In [[Bulgaria]], the term ''detska gradina'' (деτска градина) refers to the schooling children attend from 3 to 7 (in some cases 6) years of age. Since 2012, two years of pre-school education are compulsory. These two years of mandatory pre-school education may be attended either at kindergarten or in preparatory groups at primary schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eli-net.eu/fileadmin/ELINET/Redaktion/user_upload/Bulgarian_Short_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{See also|Education in Canada}}
[[File:Student teachers Kindergarten 1898.jpg|thumb|Student teachers training in a kindergarten class in 1898 in Toronto, Canada]]

Schools outside of Ontario and the Northwest Territories generally provide one year of kindergarten, except some private schools offer junior kindergarten for 4-year-olds (school before kindergarten is most commonly referred to as pre-school). After kindergarten, the child begins grade one. The province of [[Nova Scotia]] refers to Kindergarten as Grade Primary.

The province of Ontario and the Northwest Territories provide two years of kindergarten. Within the province of [[Quebec]], junior kindergarten is called ''prématernelle'' (which is not mandatory), is attended by 4-year-olds, and senior kindergarten is called ''maternelle'', which is also not mandatory by the age of 5, this class is integrated into primary schools. Within the French school system in the province of [[Ontario]], junior kindergarten is called ''maternelle'' and senior kindergarten is called ''jardin d'enfants'', which is a [[calque]] of the German word ''Kindergarten''.

===Chile===
{{see also|Education in Chile}}
In Chile, the term equivalent to Kindergarten is "''Educación parvularia''", sometimes also called "''Educación Preescolar''". It is the first level of the [[Education in Chile|Chilean educational system]]. It meets the needs of boys and girls integrally from their birth until their entry to the ''Educación Básica'' (Primary education), without being considered as compulsory. Generally, schools imparting this level, the JUNJI (National Council of Kindergarten Schools) and other private institutions have the following organization of groups or subcategories of levels:
*'''Low nursery:''' It addresses babies from 85 days to 1 year old.
*'''High nursery:''' It addresses children from 1 to 2 years old.
*'''Low Middle Level:''' It addresses children from 2 to 3 years old.
*'''High Middle Level:''' It addresses children from 3 to 4 years old.
*'''First level of transition:''' Often called "''Pre-kinder''", it addresses children from 4 to 5 years old.
*'''Second level of transition''': Usually called "''Kinder''", it addresses children from 5 to 6 years old. It is the last phase of this type of education, by finishing it, children go to "''Primero Básico''" ([[First grade]] of primary education).&lt;ref&gt;[http://600.mineduc.cl/docs/informacion/info_guia/guia_parv.pdf Chilean Ministry of Education – Help Guide, Educación Parvularia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707011709/http://600.mineduc.cl/docs/informacion/info_guia/guia_parv.pdf |date=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:北京师范大学实验幼儿园 - Experimental Kindergarten of Beijing Normal University - 2010.11 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Chinese kindergarten, primary, and secondary schools are sometimes affiliated with tertiary institutions, e.g. Experimental Kindergarten of [[Beijing Normal University]], [[Beijing]], [[China]]]]
In China, pre-school education, before the child enters formal schooling at 6 years of age, is generally divided into a "nursery" or "preschool" stage and a "kindergarten" (幼儿园 (yòu'éryuán) stage. These can be two separate institutions, or a single combined one in different areas. Where there are two separate institutions, it is common for the kindergarten to consist of the two upper years, and the preschool to consist of one lower year. Common names for these three years are:
# Nursery (or "preschool" or "playgroup")  (小班/xiăo bān): 3- to 4-year-old children
# Lower Kindergarten (中班/zhōng bān): 4- to 5-year-old children
# Upper Kindergarten (大班/dà bān): 5- to 6-year-old children.

In some places, children at 5-6 years may in addition or instead attend "reception" or "preparatory" classes (学前班/xué qián bān) focusing on preparing children for formal schooling.

State (public) kindergartens only accept children older than 3 years, while private ones do not have such limitations.

===Denmark===
{{Main|Danish pre-school education}}

Kindergarten is a day-care service offered to children from age three until the child starts attending school. Kindergarten classes (grade 0) are voluntary and are offered by primary schools before a child enters 1st grade.

Two-thirds of established day-care institutions in [[Denmark]] are municipal day-care centres while the other third are privately owned and are run by associations of parents or businesses in agreement with local authorities. In terms of both finances and subject-matter, municipal and private institutions function according to the same principles.

Denmark is credited with pioneering (although not inventing) [[forest kindergarten]]s, in which children spend most of every day outside in a natural environment.

===Egypt===
{{see also|Education in Egypt}}

In Egypt, children may go to kindergartens for two years (KG1 and KG2) between the ages of four and six.

===France===
[[File:Trondes Salle d'asile.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The wording ''{{lang|fr|salle d'asile}}'' was the former name of current ''{{lang|fr|école maternelle}}'']]
{{see also|Education in France}}
In France, pre-school is known as ''{{lang|fr|école maternelle}}'' (French for "nursery school", literally "maternal school"). Free ''{{lang|fr|maternelle}}'' schools are available throughout the country, welcoming children aged from 3 to 6 (although in many places, children under three may not be granted a place). The ages are divided into ''{{lang|fr|grande section}}'' (GS: 5-year-olds), ''{{lang|fr|moyenne section}}'' (MS: 4-year-olds), ''{{lang|fr|petite section}}'' (PS: 3-year-olds) and ''{{lang|fr|toute petite section}}'' (TPS: 2-year-olds). It is not compulsory, yet almost all children aged 3 to 5 attend. It is regulated by the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of National Education]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-37156-0001, Beentz, Erntekindergartengruppe.jpg|thumb|(East) German Kindergarten, 1956]]

In Germany, a ''{{lang|de|Kindergarten}}'' (masculine: ''der'' Kindergarten, plural ''{{lang|de|Kindergärten}}'') is a facility for the care of pre-school children who are typically at least three years old. By contrast, ''{{lang|de|Kinderkrippe}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Krippe}}'' refers to a crèche for the care of children before they enter ''{{lang|de|Kindergarten}}'' (9 weeks to about three years), ''{{lang|de|Kindertagesstätte}}''—literally "children's day site", usually shortened to ''{{lang|de|Kita}}''—is an [[umbrella term]] for any day care facility for pre-schoolers.

Attendance is voluntary, and usually not free of charge. Pre-school children over the age of one are entitled to receive local and affordable daycare.&lt;ref name="SGBVIII24"&gt;Achtes Buch Sozialgesetzbuch, §24;  children under the age of one are entitled to daycare if the caretaker is working, seeking work or attending school (section one); children from one to three years (section two) and from over three until they enter school (section three) are unconditionally entitled to receive day care.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the federal system, {{lang|de|Kindergärten}} fall under the responsibility of the [[States of Germany|states]],&lt;ref name="GG30"&gt;Grundgesetz Artikel 30, "Kulturhoheit der Länder"&lt;/ref&gt; which usually delegate a large share of the responsibility to the municipalities. Due to the [[subsidiarity principle]] stipulated by §4 [[:de:Achtes Buch Sozialgesetzbuch|SGB VIII]], there are a multitude of operators, from municipalities, churches and welfare societies to parents' initiatives and profit-based corporations. Many {{lang|de|Kindergärten}} follow a certain educational approach, such as [[Montessori]], [[Reggio Emilia approach|Reggio Emilia]], "{{lang|de|Berliner Bildungsprogramm}}" or [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]]; [[forest kindergarten]]s are well established. Most ''{{lang|de|Kindergärten}}'' are subsidised by the community councils, with the fees depending on the income of the parents.

Even in smaller townships, there are often both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] kindergartens available. Places in crèches and kindergarten are often difficult to secure and must be 'reserved' in advance, although the situation has improved with a new law in effect August 2013. The availability of childcare, however, varies greatly by region. It is usually better in eastern regions, and in big cities in the north, such as Berlin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesslocationcenter.de/en/welcome-to-berlin/family-friendly-city/daycare|title=Child care in Berlin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Hamburg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbez.org/news/germanys-child-care-law-aims-get-more-moms-back-work-111198|title=Germany’s child care law aims to get more moms back to work  - WBEZ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poorest in parts of [[Southern Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/law-goes-into-effect-requiring-child-care-for-most-german-children-a-914320.html|title=Law Goes into Effect Requiring Child Care for Most German Children|author=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany|date=August 1, 2013|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All caretakers in ''{{lang|de|Kita}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Kindergarten}}'' must have a three-year qualified education, or are under special supervision during training.

''{{lang|de|Kindergärten}}'' can be open from 7am to 5pm or longer and may also house a crèche (''{{lang|de|Kinderkrippe}}'') for children between the ages of eight weeks and three years, and possibly an afternoon ''{{lang|de|Hort}}'' (often associated with a primary school) for school-age children aged 6 to 10 who spend the time after their lessons there. Alongside nurseries, there are day-care nurses (''{{lang|de|Tagesmütter}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Tagespflegepersonen}}'') working independently of any pre-school institution in individual homes and looking after only three to five children, typically up to the age of three. These nurses are supported and supervised by local authorities.

The term ''{{lang|de|Vorschule}}'' ("pre-school") is used both for educational efforts in ''{{lang|de|Kindergärten}}'' and for a mandatory class that is usually connected to a primary school. Both systems are handled differently in each [[States of Germany|German state]]. The ''{{lang|de|Schulkindergarten}}'' is a type of ''{{lang|de|Vorschule}}''.

===Hong Kong===
{{see also|Education in Hong Kong}}
Pre-primary Services in [[Hong Kong]] refers to provision of education and care to young children by kindergartens and child care centres. Kindergartens, registered with the Education Bureau, provide services for children from three to six years old. Child care centres, on the other hand, are registered with the Social Welfare Department and include nurseries, catering for children aged two to three, and creches, looking after infants from birth to two.

At present, most of the kindergartens operate on half-day basis offering upper, lower kindergarten classes and nursery classes. Some kindergartens operate full-day kindergarten classes too. Child care centres also provide full-day and half-day services with most centres providing full-day services.

The aim of pre-primary education in Hong Kong is to provide children with a relaxing and pleasurable learning environment to promote a balanced development of different aspects necessary to a child's development such as the physical, intellectual, language, social, emotional and aesthetic aspects.

To help establish the culture of self-evaluation in kindergartens and to provide reference for the public in assessing the quality and standard of pre-primary education, the Education Bureau has developed Performance Indicators for pre-primary institutions in Hong Kong. Commencing in the 2000/01 school year, Quality Assurance Inspection was launched to further promote the development of quality Early Childhood Education.

===Hungary===
{{see also|Education in Hungary}}
[[File:OVODA.jpg|thumb|A [[Hungary|Hungarian]] pre-school class having outdoor activities, March 2007]]
In [[Hungary]] a kindergarten is called an ''{{lang|hu|óvoda}}'' ("place for caring"). Children attend kindergarten between ages 3–6/7 (they go to school in the year in which they have their 7th birthday). Attendance in kindergarten is compulsory from the age of 3 years, though exceptions are made for developmental reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caboodle.hu/nc/news/news_archive/single_page/?tx_ttnews&amp;#91;tt_news&amp;#93;=9571 Hungary lowers mandatory school age to three] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222936/http://www.caboodle.hu/nc/news/news_archive/single_page/?tx_ttnews&amp; |date=December 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though kindergartens may include programs in subjects such as foreign languages and music, children spend most of their time playing. In their last year, children begin to be prepared to attend elementary school.

Most kindergartens are state-funded. Kindergarten teachers are required to have a diploma.

===India===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Baroda High School, Alkapuri]] --&gt;
{{see also|Education in India}}
In [[India]], there are only informal directives pertaining to pre-primary education, for which pre-primary schools and sections need no affiliation. Directives state that children who are three years old on 30 May in the given academic year are eligible to attend Nursery and Kindergarten classes. Typically, children spend 3 to 4 years of their time in pre-primary school after which they are eligible to attend 1st Standard in Primary School which falls under HRD ministry norms. Primary education is now compulsory in India, and accompanied with mid-day meals, in most parts of the country run by the government. Pre-primary is not mandatory, however preferred. All government schools and affiliated private schools allow children who are 5 years of age as of 30 May to enroll to standard 1 of a primary school.

===Italy===
{{see also|Education in Italy}}
[[File:Nursery school classroom.jpg|thumb|Typical classroom layout in an [[:it:Asilo nido|Italian nursery school]]. From left to right: restroom, bathroom, playroom, and outdoor playground.]]

In [[Italy]], pre-school education refers to two different grades:
* Nursery schools, called ''{{lang|it|[[:it:Asilo nido|asili-nido]]}}'' for children between 3 and 36 months;
* [[:it:Scuola dell'infanzia|Maternal schools]] formerly ''{{lang|it|scuola materna}}'' and now ''{{lang|it|scuola dell'infanzia}}'', for children 3 to 5 years old.

Italian ''{{lang|it|asili-nido}}'' were officially instituted in a 1971 State Law (L. 1044/1971), and may be ruled by either private or public institutions. They were originally established to allow mothers a chance to work out of their homes, and were therefore seen as a social service. Today, they mostly serve the purpose of general education and social interaction. In Italy, much effort has been spent on developing a pedagogical approach to children's care: well known is the so-called [[Reggio Emilia approach]], named after the city of Reggio Emilia, in [[Emilia-Romagna]].

''{{lang|it|Asili-nido}}'' normally occupy small one-story buildings, surrounded by gardens; usually suitable for no more than 60 or 70 children. The heart of the ''{{lang|it|asili-nido}}'' are the classrooms, split into playroom and restroom; the playroom always has windows and doors leading to the outside playground and garden.

Maternal schools (''{{lang|it|scuola materna}}'') were established in 1968 after State Law n. 444 and are a full part of the official Italian education system, though attendance is not compulsory. Like ''{{lang|it|asili-nido}}'' (nursery schools), maternal schools may be held either by public or private institutions.

Early childhood education begins at home, and there are numerous books and television shows aimed at helping mothers &amp; fathers of preschool children to educate their children and to parent more effectively. Much of the home training is devoted to teaching manners, proper social behavior, and structured play, although verbal and number skills are also popular themes. Parents are strongly committed to early education and frequently enroll their children in preschools.
Kindergartens (幼稚園 yōchien), predominantly staffed by young female junior college graduates, are supervised by the Ministry of Education but are not part of the official education system. The 58% of kindergartens that are private accounted for 77% of all children enrolled. In addition to kindergartens, there exists a well-developed system of government-supervised day-care centers (保育園 hoikuen), supervised by the Ministry of Labor. Whereas kindergartens follow educational aims, preschools are predominantly concerned with providing care for infants and toddlers. Just as there are public and private kindergartens, there are both public and privately run preschools. Together, these two kinds of institutions enroll well over 90 percent of all preschool-age children prior to their entrance into the formal system at [[first grade]]. The Ministry of Education's 1990 Course of Study for Preschools, which applies to both kinds of institutions, covers such areas as human relationships, health, environment, language, and expression. Starting from March 2008 the new revision of curriculum guidelines for kindergartens as well as for preschools came into effect.

===South Korea===
{{see also|Education in South Korea}}
In [[South Korea]], children normally attend kindergarten ({{lang-ko|유치원}} ''yuchi won'') between the ages of three or four and six or seven in the Western age system. (Korean ages are calculated differently from Western ages: when they are born they are considered one-year-olds, rather than one day old. Additionally, every January 1, everyone's age increases by one year regardless of when their birthday is. Hence in Korea, kindergarten children are called five-, six- and seven-year-olds.) The school year begins in March. It is followed by primary school. Normally the kindergartens are graded on a three-tier basis.

Korean kindergartens are private schools, and monthly costs vary. Korean parents often send their children to English kindergartens to give them a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] in English. Such specialized kindergartens can be mostly taught in Korean with some English lessons, mostly taught in English with some Korean lessons, or completely taught in English. Almost all middle-class parents send their children to kindergarten.

Kindergarten programs in South Korea attempt to incorporate much academic instruction alongside more playful activities. Korean kindergartners learn to read, write (often in English as well as Korean) and do simple arithmetic. Classes are conducted in a traditional classroom setting, with the children focused on the teacher and one lesson or activity at a time. The goal of the teacher is to overcome weak points in each child's knowledge or skills.

Because the education system in Korea is very competitive, kindergartens are becoming more intensely academic. Children are pushed to read and write at a very young age. They also become accustomed to regular and considerable amounts of [[homework]]. These very young children may also attend other specialized afternoon schools, taking lessons in art, piano or violin, [[taekwondo]], ballet, soccer or mathematics.

===Kosovo===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
In [[Kosovo]], kindergarten is known as ''Çerdhe'' or ''Kopshti i fëmijëve'', and they serve as Day Care Centers. There are public and private kindergartens, and they are for children under the age of 3. Children between 3–6 years old go to ''Institucione parashkollore'', which are different from the Day Care Centers, because here children start the basic learning process, and they serve as preparatory institutions for the Primary School. After the age of 6, children continue in Primary School. However, neither the Day Care Centers nor the Preparatory Institutions are mandatory.

===Kuwait===
{{see also|Education in Kuwait}}
In [[Kuwait]], Kuwaiti children may go to free government kindergartens for two years (KG1 and KG2) between the ages of four and six.

===Luxembourg===

In Luxembourg, a Kindergarten is called ''Spillschoul'' (literally "Playschool", plural ''Spillschoulen''). It is a public education facility which is attended by children between the age of 4 (or 5) and 6 when they advance to the ''Grondschoul'' (elementary school).

===Macedonia===
{{see also|Education in Macedonia}}
The [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] equivalent of kindergarten is ''detska gradinka'' ({{lang|mk|детска градинка}}), sometimes called ''zabavishte'' ({{lang|mk|забавиште}}) when the kids are younger than 4 years. ''Detska gradinka'' is not part of the state's mandatory education, because the educational process in the country begins at the age of 5 or 6, i.e. first grade.

===Malaysia===
{{see also|Education in Malaysia}}
In [[Malaysia]], kindergarten is known as ''{{lang|zsm|tadika}}''. Most kindergartens are available to children of ages five and six (and some are available to children as young as four). For children up to the age of three (or four), there are [[pre-school playgroup]]s. There are no fixed rules for when a child needs to go to a kindergarten, but the majority will when the child turns 5 years old. The child will usually attend kindergarten for two years, before proceeding to [[primary school]] at age 7.&lt;ref name="Malaysia"&gt;[[Education in Malaysia#School grades|Education in Malaysia - School grades]], view Malaysian school grades here.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
{{see also|Education in Mexico}}
In [[Mexico]], kindergarten is called ''kínder'', with the last year sometimes referred to as ''preprimaria'' (''primaria'' is the name given to grades 1 through 6, so the name literally means "prior to elementary school"). The kindergarten system in Mexico was developed by professor [[Rosaura Zapata]], who received the country's highest honor for her contribution. It consists of three years of pre-school education, which are mandatory before elementary school. Previous nursery is optional and may be offered in either private schools or [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].

At private schools, kinders usually consist of three grades, and a fourth one may be added for nursery. The fourth one is called maternal. It goes before the other three years and is not obligatory. While the [[first grade]] is a [[pre-school playgroup|playgroup]], the other two are of classroom education.

In 2002, the [[Congress of Mexico|Congress of the Union]] approved the ''Law of Obligatory Pre-schooling'', which made pre-school education for three to six-year-olds obligatory, and placed it under the auspices of the federal and state ministries of education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senado.gob.mx/internacionales/assets/docs/relaciones_parlamentarias/america/foros/parla_latino/salud5.pdf Senado.gob.mx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012114537/http://www.senado.gob.mx/internacionales/assets/docs/relaciones_parlamentarias/america/foros/parla_latino/salud5.pdf |date=October 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/16/20/37423645.pdf OECD.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mongolia===
{{see also|Education in Mongolia}}
In [[Mongolia]], kindergarten is known as "цэцэрлэг" or ''tsetserleg''. As of September 2013, there are approximately 152 kindergartens registered in the country. From those 152 kindergartens, 142 are state owned. Children begin kindergarten at the age of 2 and finish it by 5. The education system before kindergarten in Mongolia is called "ясль", which accepts children between 0 and 2 years of age.

===Morocco===
{{see also|Education in Morocco}}
In [[Morocco]], pre-school is known as ''école maternelle'', ''kuttab'', or ''ar-rawd''. State-run, free ''maternelle'' schools are available throughout the kingdom, welcoming children aged from 2 to 5 (although in many places, children under 3 may not be granted a place). It is not compulsory, yet almost 80% of children aged 3 to 5 attend. It is regulated by the Moroccan department of education.

===Nepal===
{{see also|Education in Nepal}}
In [[Nepal]], kindergartens are run as private institutions, with their lessons conducted in English. The kindergarten education in Nepal is most similar to that of Hong Kong and India. Children start attending kindergarten from the age of 2 until they are at least 5 years old.

The kindergartens in Nepal have the following grades:
#Nursery/playgroup: 2- to 3-year-olds
#Lower Kindergarten: 3- to 4-year-olds
#Upper Kindergarten: 4- to 5-year-olds

===Netherlands===
{{see also|Education in Netherlands}}
In the [[Netherlands]], the equivalent term to kindergarten was ''{{lang|nl|kleuterschool}}''. From the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century the term ''{{lang|nl|Fröbelschool}}'' was also common, after [[Friedrich Fröbel]]. However, this term gradually faded in use as the verb ''{{lang|nl|Fröbelen}}'' gained a slightly derogatory meaning in everyday language. Until 1985, it used to be a separate non-compulsory form of education (for children aged 4–6 years), after which children (aged 6–12 years) attended the primary school (''lagere school''). After 1985, both forms were integrated into one, called ''{{lang|nl|basisonderwijs}}'' (Dutch for primary education). For children under 4, the country offers private, subsidized daycares (''{{lang|nl|kinderdagverblijf}}''), which are noncompulsory but nevertheless very popular.

=== New Zealand ===
{{See also|Education in New Zealand}}
In New Zealand, kindergarten can refer to education in the 2 years preceding primary school, from age 3 to 4. Primary Education starts at age 5. 

===Norway===
{{see also|Education in Norway}}
In [[Norway]], ''barnehage'' (children garden) is the term equivalent to kindergarten, used for children in the ages between 10 months and 6 years. The first ''barnehager'' were founded in Norway in the late 19th century. Although they have existed for 120 years, they are not considered part of the education system. They are both publicly and privately owned and operated. The staff, at minimum the manager, should be educated as ''barnehagelærer'' (kindergarten teacher), previously known as ''førskolelærer'' (pre-school teachers). The children spend most of the time outdoors. There is also an institution called ''barnepark'' (children's park), which does not need to have certified staff.

===Peru===
{{see also|Education in Peru}}
In [[Peru]], the term ''nido'' refers to the schooling children attend from 3 to 6 years of age. It is followed by primary school classes, which last for six years. Some families choose to send their children to primary school at the age of 6. In 1902 the teacher Elvira Garcia and Garcia co-founder of the Society cited above, organized the first kindergarten for children 2 to 8 years old, Fanning annex to the Lyceum for ladies. Her studies and concern for children led her to spread through conferences and numerous documents, the importance of protecting children early and to respond to the formation of a personality based on justice and understanding, as well as the use of methods Fröbel and from Montessori and participation of parents in this educational task.

===Philippines===
{{see also|Education in the Philippines}}
In the [[Philippines]], education officially starts at the Elementary level and placing children into early childhood education through kindergarten is optional to parents. Early childhood education in the Philippines is classified into:
* '''Center-based programs''', such as the [[Barangay]] daycare service, public and private pre-schools, kindergarten or school-based programs, community or church-based early childhood education programs initiated by nongovernment organizations or people's organizations, workplace-related child care and education programs, child-minding centers, health centers and stations; and
* '''Home-based programs''', such as the neighborhood-based playgroups, family day care programs, parent education and home visiting programs.

Early childhood education was strengthened through the creation of the Early Childhood Care and Development Act of 2000 (Republic Act No. 8980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2000/ra_8980_2000.html|title=R.A. 8980|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Department of Education disseminated copies of the Kindergarten Education Act through Republic Act No. 10157 making it compulsory and mandatory in the entire nation. As a provision in this law, children under five years old are required to enroll in a kindergarten in any public elementary school in the country. This goes with the implementation of the K-12 system in the Basic Education Curriculum.

{{see also|Education in Romania}}
In [[Romania]], ''{{lang|ro|grădiniţă}}'', which means "little garden", is the favored form of education for preschool children usually aged 3–6. The children are divided in three groups: "little group" (''{{lang|ro|grupa mică}}'', age 3–4), "medium group" (''{{lang|ro|grupa mijlocie}}'', age 4-5) and "big group" (''{{lang|ro|grupa mare}}'', age 5-6). In the last few years, private kindergartens have become popular, supplementing the state preschool education system. Kindergarten is optional. The "preparatory school year" (''clasa pregătitoare'') is for children aged 6–7, and since it became compulsory in 2012,&lt;ref name="Mediafax"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediafax.ro/social/clasa-pregatitoare-obligatorie-din-septembrie-ce-vor-invata-copiii-si-cum-vor-fi-evaluati-9167096 |title=Clasa pregătitoare, obligatorie din septembrie.

===South Africa===
{{see also|Education in South Africa}}
Kindergartens (commonly known as creche) in [[South Africa]] provide from 0-6 years of age spent of preschool programs for children of all ages up to six. The one to three-year program, known as ''nursery'', ''kindergarten 1'' (K1), and ''kindergarten 2'' (K2), prepares children for their first year in primary school education. Some kindergartens further divide nursery into N1 and N2.

===Spain===
In Spain, kindergarten is called ''{{lang|es|infantil}}'', ''{{lang|es|ciclo infantil}}'' or ''{{lang|es|guardería}}'', and serves children from 3 to 6 years of age. It's commonly known by some people as ''{{lang|es|parvulitos}}''.

===Taiwan===
{{see also|Education in Taiwan}}
While many public kindergartens and preschools exist in [[Taiwan]], private kindergartens and preschools are also quite popular. Many private preschools offer accelerated courses in various subjects to compete with public preschools and capitalize on public demand for academic achievement. Curriculum at such preschools often encompasses subject material such as science, art, physical education and even mathematics classes. The majority of these schools are part of large school chains, which operate under franchise arrangements. In return for annual fees, the chain enterprises may supply advertising, curriculum, books, materials, training, and even staff for each individual school.

There has been a huge growth in the number of privately owned and operated English immersion preschools in Taiwan since 1999. These English immersion preschools generally employ native English speaking teachers to teach the whole preschool curriculum in an "English only" environment. The legality of these types of schools has been called into question on many occasions, yet they continue to prosper. Some members of Taiwanese society have raised concerns as to whether local children should be placed in English immersion environments at such a young age, and have raised fears that the students abilities in their mother language may suffer as a result. The debate continues, but at the present time, the market for English Immersion Preschools continues to grow.

===United Kingdom===
{{see also|Education in the United Kingdom}}
&lt;!-- The opening paragraph covers both nursery and reception/first year(s) of primary education, because "kindergarten" is used in either sense in other English-speaking countries. --&gt;
The term kindergarten is rarely used in the UK to describe modern pre-school education or the first year(s) of compulsory primary school education. Pre-schools are usually known as creche, nursery schools or [[pre-school playgroup|playgroups]], while the first year of compulsory schooling is known as [[Reception (school)|Reception]] in England, ''Dosbarth Derbyn'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ("reception class") and Primary One in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Nursery forms part of the [[Foundation Stage]] of education. In the 1980s, England and [[Wales]] officially adopted the [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] system whereby children start school either in the term or year in which they will become five depending on the policy of the [[local education authority]]. In Scotland, schooling becomes compulsory between the ages of 4½ and 5½ years, depending on their birthday (school starts in August for children who were 4 by the end of the preceding February).

However, the word "kindergarten" is used for more specialist organisations such as [[forest kindergarten]]s and is sometimes used in the naming of private nurseries that provide full-day child care for working parents. Historically the word was used during the nineteenth century when activists like [[Adelaide Manning]] were introducing educators to the work of [[Friedrich Fröbel]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Sutherland, ‘Manning, (Elizabeth) Adelaide (1828–1905)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48424, accessed 26 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, parents have the option of nursery for their children at the ages of three or four years, before compulsory education begins. Before that, less structured childcare is available privately. The details vary between England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

Some nurseries are attached to state [[infant school|infant]] or primary schools, but many are provided by the private sector.

In the US, kindergarten is usually part of the [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] educational system. In most state and private schools, children begin kindergarten at age 5 and attend for one year. They do activities such as [[addition]] (+), [[subtraction]] (-), and playing outside on the [[playground]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecs.org/clearinghouse/86/62/8662.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-three states require their school districts to offer a kindergarten year.&lt;ref name="nces53"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kindergarten requirements, by state: 2010 |url=http://nces.ed.gov/programs/statereform/tab5_3.asp|work=Table 5.3|publisher=[[National Center for Education Statistics]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a typical US kindergarten [[classroom]], resources like [[toy]]s, [[picture book]]s, and [[crayon]]s are available for children's use. The daily schedule varies from town to town, but there are some similarities.  In the [[morning]], the children usually do [[circle time]]. This includes saying the [[pledge of allegiance]], looking at the [[calendar]], and discussing the [[weather]] and [[season]] that day. Next, the children work on different subjects:

In [[math]], kindergartners usually do single digit [[addition]] and [[subtraction]], learn to count with "more or less" games, become acquainted with a [[clock]], and learn [[skip counting]] to prepare them for one digit [[multiplication]]. 

In [[language arts]] (English), children learn [[sight word]]s, (cat, fun), [[rhyming]], blends, and silent e. They then learn how to write, form sentences, and are required to write three complete sentences by the end of the year.

In [[social studies]], kindergartners learn about the [[month]]s, [[U.S. state]]s, the [[continent]]s, and sometimes about people performing community functions (e.g. [[Physician|doctor]], [[barber]], [[teacher]]) and places (e.g."You go to a [[hospital]] when you're sick or to have [[surgery]]." "You go to a [[park]] to [[play (activity)|play]].")

After a few lessons, there is a break for [[lunch]]. Children either fetch their own [[Lunch box|lunchboxes]] brought from home or get a lunch from the [[cafeteria]] and eat it (or take) there or in the classroom. Sometimes after lunch the children have [[recess (break)|recess]], some students' favorite part of the day, when they can go outside to [[Play (activity)|play]] on [[swing (seat)|swings]], [[playground slide|slides]],  play [[ basketball]], or socialize. After recess kindergartners go back inside to do more learning. Some schools let children take a nap or do free choice (blocks, [[tic tac toe]], [[play doh]], etc.)
When kindergarten is over for the day, parents or guardians come to pick up their child or the children ride a bus home.

'''Knowledge transfer''' refers to sharing or disseminating of knowledge and providing inputs to [[problem solving]].&lt;ref name=know&gt;{{cite web|title=THE KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY|url=https://www.oecd.org/sti/sci-tech/1913021.pdf|publisher=ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT|accessdate=29 January 2017|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[organizational theory]], knowledge transfer is the practical problem of transferring knowledge from one part of the organization to another. Like [[knowledge management]], knowledge transfer seeks to organize, create, capture or distribute knowledge and ensure its availability for future users. It is considered to be more than just a [[communication]] problem. If it were merely that, then a [[memorandum]], an [[e-mail]] or a meeting would accomplish the knowledge transfer. Knowledge transfer is more complex because:

* knowledge resides in organizational members, tools, tasks, and their subnetworks&lt;ref name="Argote_Ingram_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Argote |first=L. |author2=Ingram, P.  |year=2000

|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=150–169 |doi=10.1006/obhd.2000.2893}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 
* much knowledge in organizations is [[tacit knowledge|tacit]] or hard to articulate.&lt;ref name="Nonaka_Takeuchi_1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nonaka |first=I. |author2=Takeuchi, H.  |year=1995 |title=The Knowledge-Creating Company |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject has been taken up under the title of knowledge management since the 1990s. The term has also been applied to the transfer of knowledge being transferred at the international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Languages create barrier in scientific knowledge transfer - The Economic Times|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/languages-create-barrier-in-scientific-knowledge-transfer/articleshow/56258399.cms|newspaper=The Economic Times|accessdate=29 January 2017|date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERNATIONAL KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER - Investigations of European Practices|url=https://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/pdf/ikt_expert_report.pdf|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In business, knowledge transfer now has become a common topic in [[Mergers and acquisitions]]. It focuses on transferring technological platform, market experience, managerial expertise, advance corporate culture, and other intellectual capital that can improve the companies' competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fong Boh|first=Wai|last2=Nguyen|first2=T.T.|last3=Xu|first3=Yun|date=2013-02-15|title=Knowledge transfer across dissimilar cultures|journal=Journal of Knowledge Management|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=29–46|doi=10.1108/13673271311300723|issn=1367-3270|citeseerx=10.1.1.1026.6945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since technical skills and knowledge are very important assets for firms' competence in the global competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calipha|first=Rachel|last2=Brock|first2=David M.|last3=Rosenfeld|first3=Ahron|last4=Dvir|first4=Dov|date=2018-08-20|title=Acquired, transferred and integrated knowledge: a study of M&amp;A knowledge performance|journal=Journal of Strategy and Management|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=282–305|doi=10.1108/jsma-07-2017-0049|issn=1755-425X}}&lt;/ref&gt; unsuccessful knowledge transfer will have a negative impact to the corporations and leads to the expensive and time-consuming M&amp;A not creating values to the firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ng|first=Artie W.|last2=Chatzkel|first2=Jay|last3=Lau|first3=K.F.|last4=Macbeth|first4=Douglas|date=2012-07-20|title=Dynamics of Chinese emerging multinationals in cross‐border mergers and acquisitions|journal=Journal of Intellectual Capital|language=en|volume=13|issue=3|pages=416–438|doi=10.1108/14691931211248963|issn=1469-1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Argote &amp; Ingram (2000) define knowledge transfer as "the process through which one unit (e.g., group, department, or division) is affected by the experience of another"&lt;ref name="Argote_Ingram_2000" /&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;151). They further point out the transfer of organizational knowledge (i.e., routine or best practices) can be observed through changes in the knowledge or performance of recipient units. The transfer of organizational knowledge, such as best practices, can be quite difficult to achieve.

Szulanski's doctoral dissertation ("Exploring internal stickiness: Impediments to the transfer of best practice within the firm") proposed that knowledge transfer within a firm is inhibited by factors other than a lack of incentive. How well knowledge about best practices remains broadly accessible within a firm depends upon the nature of that knowledge, from where (or whom) it comes, who gets it, and the organizational context within which any transfer occurs. "Stickiness" is a metaphor that comes from the difficulty of circulating fluid around an oil refinery (including effects of the fluid's native viscosity). It is worth noting that his analysis does not apply to scientific theories, where a different set of dynamics and rewards apply.&lt;ref name="Szulanski_1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Szulanski |first=Gabriel |year=1996
|title=Exploring internal stickiness: Impediments to the transfer of best practice within the firm
|journal=Strategic Management Journal |volume=17 |pages=27–43 | doi = 10.1002/smj.4250171105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three related concepts are "knowledge utilization", "research utilization" and "implementation", which are used in the health sciences to describe the process of bringing a new idea, practice or technology into consistent and appropriate use in a clinical setting.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh_et_al_2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greenhalgh |first=T. |author2=Robert, G. |author3=Macfarlane, F. |author4=Bate, P. |author5= Kyriakidou, O.  |year=2004
|title=Diffusion of innovations in service organizations: Systematic review and recommendations
|journal=Milbank Quarterly |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=581–629 |doi=10.1111/j.0887-378x.2004.00325.x|pmid=15595944 |pmc=2690184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of knowledge utilization/implementation (KU/I) is a direct outgrowth of the movement toward [[evidence-based medicine]] and research concluding that health care practices with demonstrated efficacy are not consistently used in practice settings.

Knowledge transfer within organisations and between nations also raises ethical considerations particularly where there is an imbalance in power relationships (e.g. employer and employee) or in the levels of relative need for knowledge resources (e.g. developed and developing worlds).&lt;ref name="Harman_Brelade_2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harman |first=C. |author2=Brelade, S.  |year=2003 |title=Doing the Right Thing in a Knowledge Transfer
|journal=Knowledge Management Review |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=28–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge transfer includes, but encompasses more than, [[technology transfer]].

== Knowledge transfer mechanisms ==
Two kinds of knowledge transfer mechanisms have been noticed in practice: [[Personalization]] and [[Explicit knowledge|Codification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Hansen|first1=T.N|last2=Nohria|first2=N|last3=Tierney|first3=T|title=What's your strategy for managing knowledge?|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=1999|volume=77|issue=2|pages=106–116|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCGH3EvRwnUC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22What%27s+your+strategy+for+managing+knowledge%3F%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22What's%20your%20strategy%20for%20managing%20knowledge%3F%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9781136005459}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Personalization refers to the one-to-one transfer of [knowledge] between two entities in person.  A very good example of this is the act of teaching a person how to ride a bicycle.  On the other hand, codification refers to the act of converting knowledge into knowledge artifacts such as documents, images and videos that are consumed by the knowledge recipients asynchronously.

Personalized knowledge transfer results in better assimilation of knowledge by the recipient when knowledge tacitness is higher and/or when information content in a knowledge object is high &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sudhindra|first1=S|last2=Ganesh|first2=L.S|last3=Arshinder|first3=Kaur|title=Knowledge transfer: An information theory perspective|journal=Knowledge Management Research and Practice|date=2017|volume=15|issue=3|pages=400–412|doi=10.1057/s41275-017-0060-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  On the other hand, codification is driven by the need to transfer knowledge to large number of people and results in better knowledge reuse.  [[Entropy]] of the knowledge objects can provide a measure of their information content or tacitness.

== Between public and private domains ==
With the move of advanced economies from a resource-based to a knowledge-based production,&lt;ref&gt;OECD (1999), Managing national innovation systems, OECD publications service, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; many national governments have increasingly recognized "[[knowledge]]" and "[[innovation]]" as significant driving forces of [[economic growth]], [[Social change|social development]], and [[Unemployment|job creation]]. In this context the promotion of 'knowledge transfer' has increasingly become a subject of [[Public policy|public]] and [[economic policy]]. However, the long list of changing global, national and regional government programmes indicates the tension between the need to conduct 'free' research – that is motivated by interest and by private sector 'short term' objectives - and research for public interests and general common good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H.Rubin|first=Tzameret|year=2014|title=The Achilles Heel of a Strong Private Knowledge Sector: Evidence from Israel|url=http://nimbusvault.net/publications/koala/inimpact/papers/inkt14-011.pdf|journal=The Journal of Innovation Impact|volume= 7|pages=88–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying assumption that there is a potential for increased collaboration between industry and universities is also underlined in much of the current innovation literature.  In particular the Open Innovation approach to developing business value is explicitly based on an assumption that Universities are a "vital source for accessing external ideas". Moreover, Universities have been deemed to be "the great, largely unknown, and certainly underexploited, resource contributing to the creation of wealth and economic competitiveness."&lt;ref name="Holland_1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Holland |first=G. |year=1999 |chapter=Foreword
|title=University and the creation of wealth |editors= Gray, H.; the Society for Research into Higher Education; and Open University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universities and other public sector research organisations (PSROs) have accumulated much practical experience over the years in the transfer of knowledge ''across'' the divide between the domains of publicly produced knowledge and the private exploitation of it. Many colleges and PSROs have developed processes and policies to discover, protect and exploit intellectual property (IP) rights, and to ensure that IP is successfully transferred to private corporations, or vested in new companies formed for the purposes of exploitation. Routes to commercialization of IP produced by PSROs and colleges include licensing, joint venture, new company formation and royalty-based assignments.

Organisations such as [[AUTM]] in the US, the [[Institute of Knowledge Transfer]] in the UK, [http://www.snitts.se SNITTS] in Sweden and the [[Association of European Science and Technology Transfer Professionals]] in Europe have provided a conduit for knowledge transfer professionals across the public and private sectors to identify best practice and develop effective tools and techniques for the management of PSRO/college produced IP. On-line [[Communities of Practice]] for knowledge transfer practitioners are also emerging to facilitate connectivity (such as [http://www.ginnn.com The Global Innovation Network] and the knowledge Pool).

Business-University Collaboration was the subject of the [[Lambert Review]] in the UK in 2003.

==In the knowledge economy==
{{Expand section|date=January 2017}}
In the [[knowledge-based economy]], learning becomes extremely important in determining the fate of individuals, firms and national economies.&lt;ref name=know/&gt;

Knowledge transfer can also be achieved through investment programme, both intentionally and unintentionally in the form of [[skills]], [[technology]], and ‘[[tacit knowledge]]’ including [[management]] and organisational practices.  For example, foreign investment in African countries have shown to provide some knowledge transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Calabrese|first1=Linda|title=Chinese investment and knowledge transfer in Africa|url=https://degrp.odi.org/publication/chinese-investment-and-knowledge-transfer-in-africa/|website=DEGRP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In landscape ecology==
By knowledge transfer in [[landscape ecology]], means a group of activities that increase the understanding of landscape ecology with the goal of encouraging application of this knowledge. Five factors will influence knowledge transfer from the view of forest landscape ecology: the generation of research capacity, the potential for application, the users of the knowledge, the infrastructure capacity, and the process by which knowledge is transferred (Turner, 2006).

== Types of knowledge ==

Knowledge is a dominant feature in our [[post-industrial society]], and [[knowledge worker]]s are important in many enterprises. [[Blackler]]&lt;ref name="Blackler_1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blackler |first=F. |year=1995
|title=Knowledge, Knowledge Work and Organizations: An Overview and Interpretation
|journal=Organization Studies |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=1021–1046 |doi=10.1177/017084069501600605}}&lt;/ref&gt; expands on a categorization of knowledge types that were suggested by Collins (1993):

* '''Embrained knowledge''' is that which is dependent on conceptual skills and cognitive abilities. We could consider this to be practical, high-level knowledge, where objectives are met through perpetual recognition and revamping. Tacit knowledge may also be embrained, even though it is mainly subconscious.
* '''[[Tacit knowledge|Embodied knowledge]]''' is action oriented and consists of contextual practices. It is more of a social acquisition, as how individuals interact in and interpret their environment creates this non-explicit type of knowledge.
* '''Encultured  knowledge''' is the process of achieving shared understandings through socialization and acculturation. Language and negotiation become the discourse of this type of knowledge in an enterprise.
* '''Embedded knowledge''' is tacit and resides within systematic routines. It relates to the relationships between roles, technologies, formal procedures and emergent routines within a complex system. In order to initiate any specific line of business knowledge transition helps a lot.
* '''Encoded knowledge''' is information that is conveyed in signs and symbols (books, manuals, data bases, etc.) and decontextualized into codes of practice. Rather than being a specific type of knowledge, it deals more with the transmission, storage and interrogation of knowledge.

== Challenges ==
What complicates knowledge transfer? There are many factors, including:
* The inability to recognize &amp; articulate "compiled" or highly intuitive competencies - tacit knowledge idea&lt;ref name="Nonaka_Takeuchi_1995" /&gt;
* Different views on explicitness of knowledge &lt;ref name="Dubickis and Gaile-Sarkane (2017)"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dubickis |first=M. |author2=Gaile-Sarkane, E. |year=2017

Knowledge transfer is often used as a synonym for [[training]]. Furthermore, [[information]] should not be confused with [[knowledge]], nor is it, strictly speaking, possible to "transfer" experiential knowledge to other people.&lt;ref name="Stake_2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stake |first=Robert E. |chapter=Qualitative Case Studies |title=The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research |editor=Denzin, Norman K. |editor2=Lincoln Yvonna S. eds. |publisher=Thousand Oaks: Sage |year=2005 |pages=456 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Information]] might be thought of as [[facts]] or understood [[data]]; however, [[knowledge]] has to do with flexible and adaptable [[skills]]—a person's unique ability to wield and apply [[information]]. This fluency of application is in part what differentiates [[information]] from [[knowledge]]. Knowledge tends to be both tacit and personal; the knowledge one person has is difficult to [[:wikt:quantify|quantify]], store, and retrieve for someone else to use.

Knowledge transfer (KT) and knowledge sharing (KS) are sometimes used interchangeably or are considered to share common features. Since some KM researchers assume that these two concepts are rather similar and have overlapping content, there is often confusion, especially among researchers and practitioners, about what a certain concept means. For this reason, terms such as KM and KT get used incorrectly without any respect to their real meaning and these meanings can change from paper to paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tangaraja, G., Mohd Rasdi, R., Abu Samah, B. &amp; Ismail, M.|date=20 April 2016|title=Knowledge sharing is knowledge transfer: a misconception in the literature|url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.tut.fi/docview/1826809483?pq-origsite=summon|journal=Journal of Knowledge Management|volume=20|issue=4|pages=653–670|via=ProQuest|doi=10.1108/jkm-11-2015-0427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12332">'''''Last in First Out''''' (LIFO) (or otherwise known as "Last One Hired is the First One Fired" is a policy often used by school districts and other employers to prioritize [[layoff]]s by [[seniority]].  Under LIFO layoff rules, junior teachers and other employees lose their jobs before senior ones.  Laying off junior employees first is not exclusive to the education sector or to the United States, but is perhaps most controversial there.  LIFO's proponents claim that it protects teachers with [[tenure]] and gives them job stability, and that it is an easily administered way of accomplishing layoffs following a budget cut.  LIFO's critics respond that it is bad for students. They prefer that the best teachers remain regardless of how long they have been teaching.

LIFO and tenure were originally intended to provide college [[professor|professors]] with [[academic freedom]] and ensure that they could research topics of their own choosing. In the K-12 sector, tenure was introduced to lower high teacher turnover rates. In 1932, over 20% of teachers were dismissed due to personal disagreements and difference of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Butsch, R. (1937). Tenure of teachers. Teacher Personnel, 7(3), 292-295.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2010, LIFO was criticized on grounds that "seniority based layoffs result in promising, inexperienced teachers losing their positions, while their less effective, but more senior, peers continue to teach."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, D. J., Lankford, H., Loeb, S., &amp; Wyckoff, J. H. (2010). Teacher layoffs: An empirical illustration of seniority vs. measures of effectiveness. brief 12.National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/864940729&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 2014, 2 states provided that seniority could not be considered when deciding which teachers to layoff, 18 states and the District of Columbia left the layoff criteria to school district discretion, 20 states provided that seniority could be considered among other factors, and 10 states provided that seniority was the sole factor, or one that had to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara v. California - Judgment | court = Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles |date = August 27, 2014 |pinpoint = page 14, lines 10-14 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of seniority-prioritized layoffs ==

LIFO has a more severe impact in poor or high minority schools, since those schools tend to have newer and less experienced teachers. In schools where 34% or less of the students receive [[Reduced price meal|Free and Reduced meals]], more than 82% of teachers have 4 or more years of experience. However, in schools where more than 75% of the student body receives Free and Reduced meals,  only 77% of the teachers have more than 4 years of experience.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey, "Public School Teacher, BIE School Teacher, and Private School Teacher Data Files," 2007-2008&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in California, it was seen that in schools in the lowest quartile of minority students, only 8 of every 100 teachers had two or less years of teaching whereas in schools with the highest [[quartile]] of minority students, 13 of every 100 teachers had two or less years of teaching, meaning that under LIFO-based layoffs, schools with larger minority populations would lose 60% more teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Sepe, Cristina, and Marguerite Roza. The Disproportionate Impact of Seniority Based Layoffs on Poor, Minority Students. Rep. Seattle: Center on Reinventing Public Education, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, teachers in high need areas, such as secondary math and special education, are often less experienced due to the difficulty of recruiting these positions, and districts who adhere strictly to seniority based systems for layoffs face the added burden of recruiting teachers in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, Dan and Theobold, Roddy (2010). "Assessing the Determinants and Implications of Teacher Layoffs." Center for Education Data &amp; Research, University of Washington-Bothell.&lt;/ref&gt; In Los Angeles, it was noted that of the hundreds of promising new teachers cut in from the district in 2010 due to LIFO, 190 were in the top fifth overall of teachers in raising math and reading scores.&lt;ref&gt;Felch, Jason; Song, Jason; and Smith, Doug (2010). "When layoffs come to L.A. schools, performance doesn't count." Los Angeles Times, December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that the effectiveness of teachers does not change after the first few years in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hanushek]] and Steven G. Rivkin, "The Distribution of Teacher Quality and Implications for Policy." Annual Review of Economics 4 (2012): 7.1-7.27.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the implications of using LIFO rules for layoffs instead of basing layoffs on classroom effectiveness appear huge.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, Dan and Theobold, Roddy (2010). "Assessing the Determinants and Implications of Teacher Layoffs." Center for Education Data &amp; Research, University of Washington-Bothell; Steven Glazerman, Susanna Loeb, Dan Goldhaber, Douglas Staiger, Stephen Raudenbush, and Grover Whitehurst, ''Evaluating Teachers: The Important Role of Value-Added'' (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 2010); Donald Boyd, Hamilton Lankford, Susanna Loeb, and James Wyckoff, "Teacher Layoffs: An Empirical Illustration of Seniority versus Measures of Effectiveness." ''Education Finance and Policy'' 6, no. 3 (Summer 2011): 439-454.&lt;/ref&gt;{{elucidate|date=November 2015}}  With LIFO, more teachers must be dismissed to meet budgetary targets than with effectiveness-based layoffs because the youngest teachers are the least paid, but the teachers dismissed under the LIFO policy are only slightly below average in effectiveness.  An effectiveness-based policy on the other hand leads to dramatic improvements in average teacher quality, and these improvements have lasting effects on students throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hanushek]], "Valuing teachers: How much is a good teacher worth?"

Rockoff, "The Long-Term Impacts of Teachers: Teacher Value-Added and Student Outcomes in Adulthood," WP17699 (Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research, December 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==LIFO and value-added economic modeling==
{{POV-section|date=July 2017}}
In many states, tenure is given to teachers after 3 years, without much indication of job performance. A [[Value-added modeling|value added model]] (VAM) could be used in tenure decisions for teachers in order to estimate teacher quality. A VAM would predict how well a teacher would do based on his or her previous experience teaching. Data shows that the VAM based on standardized test scores, is a better indicator of teacher performance than any observable attributes.

The American Economic Review, 100(2), 250-250-255. {{doi|10.1257/aer.100.2.250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In using a VAM to evaluate teachers for a tenure decision, school districts can ensure that the teachers they retain (and the teachers who in turn become the most senior) are effective educators, thereby eliminating some of the discrepancy between LIFO and performance-based layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, D. (2003). Evaluating value-added models for teacher accountability. Santa Monica: Rand Publishing.Retrieved from https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2004/RAND_MG158.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy and the overhaul of LIFO ==

Since less experienced teachers typically have lower salaries, it is estimated that if districts in the [[United States]] cut 5% of their budget through seniority based layoffs, approximately 79,000 more teachers would lose their jobs versus seniority neutral layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;The Case Against Quality Blind Teacher Layoffs. Publication. The New Teacher Project, Feb. 2011. Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://tntp.org/files/TNTP_Case_Against_Quality_Blind_Layoffs_Feb2011.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of New York State parents regarding teacher quality versus seniority,  voters said they did not care how long a teacher had taught so long as the teacher was effective and produced good results.&lt;ref&gt;New York voters oppose "last-in, first-out" for teacher layoffs - NYPOST.com.

Starting with Arizona in 2009, certain states and districts have been passing laws which prohibit seniority from being the deciding factor in layoff decisions. Maine, Louisiana, and District of Columbia use multiple criteria in determining layoffs, and numerous other states are trending towards performance based over seniority based layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;Teacher Layoffs: Rethinking "Last-Hired, First Fired" Policies.

Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.studentsfirst.org/lifo&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 court case of ''[[Vergara v. California]]'' struck down California's LIFO layoff rules as having a disproportionately negative impact on poor and minority public school students, thus violating the California Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara v. California - Judgment | court = Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles |date = August 27, 2014 |pinpoint = page 3, lines 19-27 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Vergara'' trial judge noted that teacher layoffs prioritized solely by seniority prevented senior and ineffective teachers from being laid off before junior but effective teachers.  In this situation, "[n]o matter how gifted the junior teacher, and no matter how grossly ineffective the senior teacher, the junior gifted one . . . is separated from [the students] and a senior grossly ineffective one . . . is left in place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 13, lines 19-23 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge concluded that "[t]he logic of [this scheme] is unfathomable and therefore constitutionally unsupportable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 14, lines 4-5 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many, or perhaps most, [[law school in the United States|law schools in the United States]] grade on a [[grading curve|curve]]. The process generally works within each class, where the instructor grades each exam, and then ranks the exams against each other, adding to and subtracting from the initial grades so that the overall grade distribution matches the school's specified curve (usually a bell curve).  "The curve" is the permitted range of each letter grade that can be awarded, for example, 0-3% A+, 3-7% A, etc.  Curves vary between different law schools, as do the rules for when the curve is mandatory versus suggestive.  It is common for the curve to be mandatory for first year ("1L") courses, and for classes above a certain size.

Grading on a curve contributes to the notoriously competitive atmosphere within law schools. "The main source of this competition is the mandatory curve you will likely encounter once you enter law school. The curve affects the class rank, affects the chances of making law review, affects the chances of scoring that big job/externship."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://calis_pre-law_blog.classcaster.org/blog/archives/2006/04/18 Competition and the Mandatory Curve in Law School]," Apr. 18, 2006, CALI's Pre-Law Blog ("The main source of this competition is the mandatory curve you will likely encounter once you enter law school. The curve affects the class rank, affects the chances of making law review, affects the chances of scoring that big job/externship.")    See also, Barbara Glesner Fines, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, "[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/profiles/glesnerfines/competition.htm Competition and the Curve]&lt;/ref&gt; Some law schools set their curve lower to retain scholarship funding; others set their curve higher to make their students more competitive in the job market.

The following list shows where law schools set the 50% mark for an individual class subject to the curve.  Because not all classes are curved and because professors still have discretion within the curve's ranges, where a law school sets its curve is not necessarily revealing of that school's average student GPA (whether after 1L or upon graduation).

==Irregular grading systems==
The following law schools have adopted a grading system which does not allow for the calculation of a comparable median GPA on a 4.0 scale, if any GPA is recorded at all:
* [[University of California, Berkeley School of Law|Berkeley Law (aka Boalt Hall)]], University of California, Berkeley, Law School – pass/no pass system with 10% of first-years receiving pass with high honors and 30% of first-year students receiving pass with honors in each class; for upper division classes (2L and 3L years) up to 15% of in a class may receive high honors and up to 45% may receive either honors or high honors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.berkeley.edu/students/career_services/foremployers/grading.html Grading Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524011202/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/students/career_services/foremployers/grading.html |date=2007-05-24 }}, law.berkeley.edu, accessed June 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the top student in a course may be awarded the American Jurisprudence Award. The second-highest performing student in a course may be awarded the Prosser Prize.
* [[Campbell Law School]] – mandatory median (82, or a C)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.campbell.edu/employers/class-rank-percentages.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712180724/http://law.campbell.edu/employers/class-rank-percentages.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Harvard Law School]] – The current grading system of dean's scholar, honors, pass, low pass, and fail had at one time a recommended curve of 37% honors, 55% pass, and 8% low pass in classes with over 30 JD and LLM students,&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Law School Handbook of Academic Policies 2009–2010&lt;/ref&gt; but the curve is no longer enforced. Between 1970 and 2008 Harvard established a GPA cut-off required in order to obtain the summa cum laude distinction.  During that time, only 5 students achieved the GPA required for the distinction of summa cum laude (33 out of the 38 years, the top student only managed to obtain the magna cum laude distinction, for example, there was a 15-year hiatus until Lisa Ann Grow managed to obtain summa cum laude).  Those who have managed to obtain the summa cum laude distinction include [[Lewis Sargentich]] ('70), Isaac Pachulski ('74), [[Peter W. Huber|Peter Huber]] ('82), Kristen Chiger ('86), Lisa Ann Grow/Sun ('97), Julian Poon ('99).  Since 2008, to address the difficulty of obtaining the summa cum laude distinction, in a year where no student manages to meet the GPA cut-off, Harvard will now award summa cum laude to the top student of the year (a rank that did not guarantee summa cum laude in the past).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/current/careers/ocs/employers/about-our-students/grading.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503201241/http://www.law.harvard.edu/current/careers/ocs/employers/about-our-students/grading.html |archivedate=2012-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Howard University School of Law]] – uses a scale of 72–100; the mandatory mean range for first-year courses is 81–83.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.howard.edu/dictator/media/1224/Law_School_Student_Handbook__Revision_August_2012_1.pdf Student Handbook], law.howard.edu, accessed July 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Below are the class rankings:

'''Songs about school''' have probably been composed and sung by students for as long as there have been schools. Examples of such [[literature]] can be found dating back to Medieval England.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Orme]], [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;se=gglsc&amp;d=5001883320 "Children and Literature in Medieval England"], ''[[Medium Aevum]]'', '''68''', 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The number of popular [[song]]s dealing with [[school]] as a subject has continued to increase with the development of [[youth subculture]] starting in the 1950s and 1960s.

Artists such as Max Whitcomb and Nicolas Earl are particularly noted for their musical criticisms of the educational systems of their times.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;&lt;ref name =cooper&gt;B. Lee Cooper, [http://www.bookrags.com/researchtopics/american-teenagers/sub17.html (Intro to) "Popular Music Reflects Teens' Attitudes About School"] from ''American Teenagers''&lt;/ref&gt; Many songs dealing with school related themes also tend to focus on other subjects of interest within youth subculture such as [[drug]]s and [[Human sexual behavior|sexuality]]. Meanwhile, others reflect a [[nostalgia]] for one's younger days.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;

The list of [[song]]s that follows include songs that deal with [[school]]ing as a primary subject as well as those that make significant use of schools, [[classroom]]s, [[student]]s or [[teacher]]s as [[image]]ry, or are used in school-related activities. The songs are examples of the types of themes and issues addressed by such songs.

'''LogoVisual thinking''' (also '''LogoVisual technology''' and '''LVT''') is a practical methodology that helps people think.  It is used by management teams, project leaders, teachers and students as a means of tapping the diversity of groups and enabling many people to participate in effective thinking processes.  It makes thinking visible and tactile by making ideas into moveable objects displayed on writeable surfaces – for instance magnetic dry-wipe shapes on whiteboards.  Structured processes guide people's thinking to achieve their intended outcomes.

LVT is both an overall concept and a methodology.  It developed out of [[structural communication]], systematics (the study of multi-term systems), and other work of [[J. G. Bennett]] in the 1960s, recent development being sponsored by Centre for Management Creativity.  As a general concept it covers the region of learning and communication in which three modes of intelligence are combined for understanding: verbal, visual and [[Haptic perception|haptic]].  It is thus related to [[multiple intelligences]]. The structure of the process supports [[metacognition]].

==Description==

LVT evolved independently but in parallel with Tony Buzan's [[mindmapping]], Edward de Bono's [[lateral thinking]], Japanese affinity diagrams, Robert Horn's [[visual language]], Gabriele Rico's 'clustering' and many other emergent trends from the 1960s onwards. It makes the '''making of meaning''' the main focus of its technology. The technology extends verbal expression to visual arrangement and brings into play physical manipulation of 'meaning objects'. The [[Haptic perception|haptic]] component of physical contact and action is a primary distinguishing feature of LVT.

It emphasises the [[logos]] or meaning of words in statements that are 'molecules of meaning', which can be understood autonomously and in combinations. Each molecule of meaning (MM) exists on a separate object. MMs can be placed on a visual display and moved around in relation to each other. Meaningful aggregates of MMs are replaced by higher order MMs. Use of MMs distinguishes LVT from other current techniques of display such as [[mindmapping]] because (a) MMs are statements and not single words (b) they are free to be moved about and are not fixed in position (c) they can form into any kind of pattern and not just hierarchical ones. In principle, every MM can be seen in the context of any of the other MMs in a given set.

The technological freedom of MMs enables people to suspend collapse into set forms and/or conclusions (convergent thinking), while providing [[structure]] to their explorations (divergent thinking). A complex process of thinking by a group can easily be tracked and recorded.

LVT supports process of [[democracy]] because it enables people to think together. It articulates thinking in a public shared space, in which structure is given equal attention to content. It relates strongly to [[dialogue]] and can be called a 'technology of dialogue'.

There are five standard stages in the process.

# Focus – identifying a question or theme that provides a basis for a common act of [[attention]]
# Gather – generating, articulating and displaying separate MMs as a relevant set as in a gathering
# Organise – arranging and aggregating MMs to form (separate) higher order MMs
# Integrate – systematic or aesthetic unification of these MMs into a whole system 
# Realise – creative or 'willed' outcome

LVT emphasises the importance of articulate statement. Each MM is symbolic of an individual in a social setting, capable of finding many complex relations with other individuals; rather than a 'thing' that has to be fixed into a mechanical order.

In the stage of Gathering, the assembly of MMs is deliberately chaotic. This allows for complexity in aggregations.

In stage three, [[Organising]] can be of different kinds but in particular explore the tensions between using prefigured forms – classifications, hierarchies, etc. – and allowing the MMs to [[self-organise]]. The flexibility and range of Organise in LVT distinguishes it from the use of set forms as in [[mindmapping]]. The capacity to insert, remove and rearrange MMs in organising is a  totally new dimension of thinking technology.

The fourth stage of Integrating draws on structural insights into complex texts, in particular the principles of [[ring composition]]  as discovered by the English anthropologist [[Mary Douglas]].

The stages move from [[contemplation]] to [[decision making]].

'''Mainstreaming''', in the context of [[education]], is the practice of placing students with special education services in a general education classroom during specific time periods based on their skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/mainstreaming.html] Definition of mainstreaming, accessed October 11, 2007. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5OWiMG?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/mainstreaming.html Archived] 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;  This means general education classes are combined with [[special education]] classes. Schools that practice mainstreaming believe that students with special needs who cannot function in a general education classroom to a certain extent belong in the special education environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weac.org/resource/june96/speced.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014004553/http://www.weac.org/resource/june96/speced.htm |archivedate=2007-10-14 |df= }} Mainstreaming: "Special needs students "belong" in the special classroom", accessed October 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to a special education classroom, often called a "self-contained classroom or [[resource room]]", is valuable to the student with a disability. Students have the ability to work one-to-one with special education teachers, addressing any need for remediation during the school day. Many researchers, educators and parents have advocated the importance of these classrooms amongst political environments that favor their elimination.&lt;ref&gt;The Effectiveness of Resource Programming
Sindelar and Deno ''J Spec Educ''.1978; 12: 17-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of both philosophy of [[inclusion (education)|educational inclusion]] assert that educating children with disabilities alongside their non-disabled peers fosters understanding and tolerance, better preparing students of all abilities to function in the world beyond school.&lt;ref&gt;IDEA Funding Coalition, "IDEA Funding: Time for a New Approach," Mandatory Funding Proposal, Feb. 20 2001, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Children with special needs may face social stigma as a result of being mainstreamed, but also may help them socially develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theclassroom.com/advantages-disadvantages-mainstreaming-special-education-children-25659.html|title=Advantages &amp; Disadvantages to Mainstreaming Special Education Children|website=The Classroom.com|author=Carissa Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

===Benefits to students with disabilities===


*''Higher academic achievement:'' Mainstreaming has shown to be more academically effective than exclusion practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weac.org/resource/june96/speced.htm Special Education Inclusion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014004553/http://www.weac.org/resource/june96/speced.htm |date=2007-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, The National Research Center on Learning Disabilities found that graduation rates of all students with disabilities in the U.S. increased by 14% from 1984 to 1997, although this report does not differentiate between students enrolled in mainstreaming, inclusive, or segregated programs.&lt;ref&gt;(2006). Mainstreaming Deaf Students. Independent School, 66, 6. Retrieved November 29, 2007, from EBSCOhost database.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to a [[resource room]] for direct instruction has shown to be effective in increasing students academic skills and thus increasing the abilities applied by students in a general education setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = B.J.F. | last2 = Poon | first2 = L.W. | year = 2001 | title = Effects of structure strategy training and signalling on recall of text | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 93 | issue = 1| pages = 140–160 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.93.1.141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to full-time placement in a special education class or [[special school]], both part-time and full-time placement in the regular classroom have been shown to improve academic achievement in students with mild academic disabilities, as well as to improve their long-term behavior.&lt;ref&gt;NA Madden, RE Slavin (1983). ''Review of Educational Research'', Vol. 53, No. 4, 519-569&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Higher self-esteem:'' By being included in a regular-paced education setting, students with disabilities have shown to be more confident and display qualities of raised self-efficacy. All students in California who went to a different school prior to attending a mainstreaming program were asked to fill out an assessment of their old school as compared to inclusion program. The assessments showed that out of all students with disabilities 96% felt they were more confident, 3% thought they had the same experience as an excluded student, and 1% felt they had less self-esteem. Overall, students felt that they were equal to their peers and felt that they should not be treated any differently.&lt;ref&gt;(2007). Twenty-five years of progress in educating children with disabilities through IDEA. National Research Center on Learning Disabilities. Retrieved November 29, 2007, from http://www.nrcld.org/resources/osep/historyidea.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Better social skills:'' Any kind of inclusion practice, including mainstreaming, allows students with disabilities to learn social skills through observation, gain a better understanding of the world around them, and become a part of the "regular" community. Mainstreaming is particularly beneficial for children with autism and ADHD. By interacting with same-aged non-disabled children, children with autism were observed to be six times more likely to engage in social relations outside of the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wolfberg | first1 = P.J. | last2 = Schuler | first2 = A.L. | year = 1999 | title = Fostering peer interaction, imaginative play and spontaneous language in children with autism | url = | journal = Child Language Teaching &amp; Therapy | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 41–52 | doi=10.1191/026565999667036164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because children with autism spectrum disorders have severely restricted interests and abnormalities in communication and social interaction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tidmarsh | first1 = L. | last2 = Volkmar | first2 = F. | year = 2003 | title = Diagnosis and epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders | url = https://ww1.cpa-apc.org/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/tidmarsh.asp | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the increased interaction with typical children may be beneficial to them. The same 1999 study showed that students with Down's syndrome were three times more likely to communicate with other people.

Mainstreaming also benefits other children.  It opens the lines of communication between those students with disabilities and their peers.  If they are included into classroom activities, all students become more sensitive to the fact that these students may need extra assistance.

===Benefits to non-disabled students===
Some people believe that educating non-disabled students and students with disabilities together creates an atmosphere of understanding and tolerance that better prepares students of all abilities to function in the world beyond school. Students without disabilities who engaged in an inclusive physical education program reported increases in self-concept, tolerance, self-worth, and a better understanding of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suomi | first1 = J. | last2 = Collier | first2 = D. | last3 = Brown | first3 = L. | year = 2003 | title = Factors affecting the social experiences of students in elementary physical education classes | url = | journal = Journal of Teaching in Physical Education | volume = 22 | issue = 2| page = 186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The students also reported that the inclusion program was important because it prepared them to deal with disability in their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Block | first1 = M. E. | year = 1999 | title = Are children with disabilities receiving appropriate physical education?. | url = | journal = Teaching Exceptional Children | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 18–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive aspects that come from inclusion are often attributed to contact theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = L. | last2 = James | first2 = A. | last3 = Ludwa | first3 = N. | year = 2004 | title = The impact of inclusion in general physical education for all students | url = | journal = Journal of Physical Education | volume = 75 | issue = 5| pages = 37–55 | doi=10.1080/07303084.2004.10607238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contact theory asserts that frequent, meaningful, and pleasant interactions between people with differences tend to produce changes in attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chu | first1 = D. | last2 = Griffey | first2 = D. | year = 1985 | title = The contact theory of racial integration: The case of sport | url = | journal = Sociology of Sport Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 323–333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Although mainstreaming in education has been shown to provide benefits, there are also disadvantages to the system.

===Tradeoff with non-disabled students's academic education===
One potentially serious disadvantage to mainstreaming is that a mainstreamed student may require much more attention from the teacher than non-disabled students in a general class.  Time and attention may thus be taken away from the rest of the class to meet the needs of a single student with special needs.  The effect that a mainstreamed student has on the whole class depends strongly on the particular disabilities in question and the resources available for support.  In many cases, this problem can be mitigated by placing an aide in the classroom to assist the student with special needs, although this raises the costs associated with educating this child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peertuition.com Manzitti, Edward T.;]&lt;/ref&gt; The added cost of an aide in a classroom to meet needs of special education students can be offset by not funding a teacher in a wholly separate classroom when mainstreaming does not occur.

Teachers are encouraged to teach the entire class differently.  This includes being less abstract and more concrete in content, changing lighting, simplifying the design of the classroom, and having a predictable structure and routine rather than novelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Sue|title=A List of Typical Special Ed. Accommodations|url=http://specialed.about.com/od/iep/a/accomod.htm|website=About.com|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effective Accommodations for IEPs|url=https://www.teachervision.com/special-education/printable/5596.html|website=teachervision.com|publisher=The Council for Exceptional Children|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harm to academic education of students with disabilities===
Parents{{Who|date=October 2015}} fear that general education teachers do not have the training and skills to accommodate special needs students in a general education classroom setting.  However, professional training and supportive services can usually address these concerns{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}. Some research has suggested teachers who are not aware of—and later may choose not to adopt—modifications needed for students with special needs are also more resistant to having these students in class.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, B.,&amp; Weil, M. (1986). Models of teaching (3rd ed.) Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead to regression of the students with disabilities as well as overall decreased classroom productivity.

=== Teacher-student interactions ===
It has been seen that general educators provide 98.7% of their teaching time doing whole class interactions. Students with disabilities have been known to require a significant more amount of individual attention with the classroom teacher. Children with disabilities spend twice as much time in whole-class activities as in one-to-one activities due to the amount of whole-class teaching, yet these students are half as likely to engage in whole-class learning activities such as writing, reading and participating showing that whole group activities do not  meet the needs of students with disabilities as much as individual work would.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=David Lansing|date=2014-10-01|title=An examination of teacher–student interactions in inclusive classrooms: teacher interviews and classroom observations|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-3802.12021/abstract|journal=Journal of Research in Special Educational Needs|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=264–273|doi=10.1111/1471-3802.12021|issn=1471-3802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social issues===
Compared to fully included students with disabilities, those who are mainstreamed for only certain classes or certain times may feel conspicuous or socially rejected by their classmates.  They may become targets for bullying.  Mainstreamed students may feel embarrassed by the additional services they receive in a regular classroom, such as an aide to help with written work or to help the student manage behaviors.  Some students with disabilities may feel more comfortable in an environment where most students are working at the same level or with the same supports.  In the United States, students with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s are [[disability bullying|more frequently the target of bullying]] than non-autistic students, especially when their educational program brings them into regular contact with non-autistic students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As seen above, there are many social issues; however, a buddy system has been shown to improve these issues. Through having a buddy system an upper school student will be paired with a younger child preferable with a disability by doing this the younger student is provided with a positive relationship with a fellow student even though they are older. Through the buddy system the younger student will learn the benefits of having and sustaining a positive and supportive friendship, learns to value opinion just by having the upper school student around. These social issues are improved due to the upper school student helping to alter the social experiences of the younger child through this formed friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rider|first=Louise|date=2000-12-01|title=Peer Education in Mainstream Secondary Education: Using ‘Buddying’ to Address Social and Behavioural Issues|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0122.00173/abstract|journal=Pastoral Care in Education|language=en|volume=18|issue=4|pages=3–7|doi=10.1111/1468-0122.00173|issn=1468-0122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costs ===
Schools are required to provide special education services but may not be given additional financial resources.  The per-student cost of special education is high.  The U.S.'s 2005 Special Education Expenditures Program (SEEP) indicates that the cost per student in special education ranges from a low of $10,558 for students with learning disabilities to a high of $20,095 for students with multiple disabilities. The average cost per pupil for a regular education with no special education services is $6,556. Therefore, the average expenditure for students with learning disabilities is 1.6 times that of a general education student.

Careful attention must be given as well to combinations of students with disabilities in a mainstreamed classroom.  For example, a student with [[conduct disorder]] may not combine well with a student with [[autism]], while putting many children with dyslexia in the same class may prove to be particularly efficient.

===Special consequences for deaf students===
Deafness is a low-incidence disability, which means that a deaf child will often be the only student in the classroom with hearing loss.&lt;ref name="Stinson 1999 163–174"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stinson|first=Michael|author2=Antia, Shirin|title=Considerations in Educating Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students in Inclusive Settings|journal=Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|date=Summer 1999|volume=4|issue=3|pages=163–174|url=http://jdsde.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/3/163.full.pdf+html|accessdate=2011-04-04|doi=10.1093/deafed/4.3.163}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a special set of issues in the mainstream classroom. While students with other disabilities may experience isolation and bullying by their non-disabled peers, they often share a common language. This is not the case for deaf students. Very few people in the mainstream academic setting know sign language, which means the communication barrier is large and can have negative effects on both academic achievement and social development.  
* ''Social skills'' are key to a child's healthy development and later success as an adult.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Wyatte|title=Decrease of Deaf Potential in a Mainstreamed Environment|url=http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/hall.html|publisher=Rochester Institute of Technology|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many studies find good academic results for deaf children placed in a mainstream classroom, research also shows that mainstreamed deaf children experience higher degrees of isolation and psychological problems in comparison to deaf students who associate with other deaf peers.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; In order for friendships to form, communication is a necessity.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; For deaf children unable to use effective communication methods with the people around them, the difficulty in acquiring new friendships typically leads to isolation and a decrease in self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; A study of preschool children showed that hearing preschoolers did not appear to adjust how they communicated with deaf children. Instead, they continued to use simple speech, which was effective with hearing, but not deaf, partners. This shows the isolation of the deaf child, and discredits the idea that the hearing and deaf child's communication skills will be enhanced by interaction with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vandell|first=Deborah Lowe|author2=George, Linda B.|title=Social Interaction in Hearing and Deaf Preschoolers: Successes and Failures in Initiations|journal=Child Development|date=June 1981|volume=52|issue=2|pages=627–635|jstor=1129183|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1981.tb03089.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many cases, hearing children do not understand what it means when another child is deaf. This leads to frustration when a deaf child's speech is not clear or when the deaf child asks for continuous repetition. Communication strategies that are culturally acceptable to the deaf child, such as banging on a table or physically touching another person, can also cause the deaf child to be rejected by his or her peers because such behaviors are not always considered acceptable in mainstreaming hearing culture.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; Research has suggested that the placement of a deaf child in special schools or classes may be more desirable for deaf students than for those with other disabilities. This is primarily because of the greater social benefits for the students.&lt;ref name="Stinson 1999 163–174"/&gt;
* The ''residual knowledge'' that hearing children can access is often lost on deaf children. A hearing child can listen in on adult conversations, TV, radio and the news to learn things that are not specifically taught or told to them.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; This is not the case with the deaf child, who, in a hearing environment, can only learn what is directly communicated to them. This often leads to gaps in general knowledge, which can be both harmful to academic success and social interactions.
* The ''effect of mainstreaming on Deaf culture'' is also a key issue for [[Deaf rights movement#Deaf culture movement|Deaf culture advocates]]. The rate of children enrolled in residential schools for the deaf is declining, as many hearing parents send their child to a mainstream school in hopes of preparing their child for life in the hearing world. In the past, Deaf schools and clubs served as the center for [[Deaf culture]]. Traditions, stories, and values developed and were fostered in these settings, but because of the low incidence of deafness, this same environment cannot be duplicated in the mainstream setting. Aside from the decreased socialization of a deaf child in a hearing school, Deaf community advocates also worry that the disappearance of residential Deaf schools will lead to a weakening of Deaf culture and of the community.

==Alternatives: what mainstreaming is not==
The alternatives to mainstreaming for special needs students are separation, inclusion, and excluding the student from school.  Normally, the student's individual needs are the driving force behind selecting mainstreaming or another style of education.

Mainstreaming does not involve putting a child full-time in a [[special school]].

Mainstreaming does not involve placing a child full-time in a regular classroom.  A student who spends the entire day in a regular classroom with non-disabled peers is considered [[inclusion (education)|fully included]].  Most students with mild levels of disabilities such as dyslexia or [[attention deficit disorder]], or with non-cognitive disabilities such as [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|diabetes]] are fully included.

Mainstreaming does not involve teaching the child outside of school.  A student who is taught in an institution (such as a hospital) or at home (such as while recovering from a serious illness) is excluded.  Such a student may receive individual instruction or may attend small group instruction.  A student who is excluded from school may or may not have been [[expulsion (academia)|expelled]] from the school.

==History of mainstreaming in US schools==
{{See also|Inclusion (education)}}

Before the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA) was enacted in 1975, U.S. public schools educated only 1 out of 5 children with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Back to School"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/2000/backtoschool_1.htm |title=NCD - Back to School on Civil Rights: Advancing the Federal Commitment to Leave No Child Behind |accessdate=2008-02-13 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 200,000&lt;ref name="Back to School"/&gt; children with disabilities such as [[deafness]] or [[mental retardation]] lived in state institutions that provided limited or no educational or rehabilitation services,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, Ellen, Fran O’Reilly, Tom Fiore, Marking the Progress of IDEA Implementation, published by the Office of Special Education Programs.  URL: {{cite web|url=http://nclid.unco.edu/Resources/IDEA_Progress.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202938/http://nclid.unco.edu/Resources/IDEA_Progress.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} , Retrieved June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and more than a million children were excluded from school.&lt;ref name="Back to School"/&gt;  Another 3.5 million children with disabilities attended school but did not receive the educational services they needed.&lt;ref name="Back to School"/&gt;  Many of these children were segregated in special buildings or programs that neither allowed them to interact with non-disabled students nor provided them with even basic academic skills.

The EHA, later renamed the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA), required schools to provide specialized educational services to children with disabilities.  The ultimate goal was to help these students live more independent lives in their communities, primarily by mandating access to the general education standards of the public school system.

Initially, children with disabilities were often placed in heterogeneous "special education" classrooms, making it difficult for any of their difficulties to be addressed appropriately.  In the 1980s, the mainstreaming model began to be used more often as a result of the requirement to place children in the [[least restrictive environment]] (Clearinghouse, E. 2003).   Students with relatively minor disabilities were integrated into regular classrooms, while students with major disabilities remained in segregated special classrooms, with the opportunity to be among normal students for up to a few hours each day.  Many parents and educators favored allowing students with disabilities to be in classrooms along with their nondisabled peers.

In 1997, IDEA was modified to strengthen requirements for properly integrating students with disabilities.  The [[Individualized Education Program|IEP]]s must more clearly relate to the general-education curriculum, children with disabilities must be included in most state and local assessments, such as [[High school graduation examination in the United States|high school exit exams]], and regular progress reports must be made to parents.  All public schools in the U.S. are responsible for the costs of providing a [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] as required by federal law.   Mainstreaming or inclusion in the regular education classrooms, with supplementary aids and services if needed, are now the preferred placement for all children.  Children with disabilities may be placed in a more restricted environment only if the nature or severity of the disability makes it impossible to provide an appropriate education in the regular classroom.

== Australian context ==
It has been estimated that in the year of 2009 there has been 292,600 children attending school within Australia that has been diagnosed with a disability also within this year it has been seen that there had been a higher rate of participation within school activities coming from children with a disability compared to children without one. It has been shown that almost one in ten boys within schools (186,000) had been diagnosed with a disability where the level of girls within a school (106,600) diagnosed with a disability was around one in sixteen. Within mainstream schools it has been shown that primary schools had a higher number of students with disabilities with a high 9.1% where students within secondary schools where only 7.4% had a disability. Out of the 71,000 students attending school with a disability 64.7% have been known to have a severe or core-activated limitation. It has also been proven that special needs children within Australia demonstrate higher academic outcomes when in a mainstream school where they have been given opportunities to engage in higher academic levels and activities.  Having children with a disability in a mainstream school has also been shown to increase in independent communication and motor skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4429.0main+features100302009|title=Main Features - Children At School With Disability|last=Statistics|first=c=AU; o=Commonwealth of Australia; ou=Australian Bureau of|website=www.abs.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3377">'''Maturationism''' is an early childhood [[philosophy of education|educational philosophy]] that sees the child as a growing organism and believes that the role of [[education]] is to passively support this growth rather than actively fill the child with information. This theory suggests that growth and [[Developmental psychology|development]] unfold from within the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching Young Children: An Introduction to the Early Childhood Profession, 2nd ed.|last=Puckett|first=Margaret|last2=Diffily|first2=Deborah|publisher=Thomson Learning, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=1401825834|location=New York|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Theory ==
In maturationism, genetic factors play a larger role in development than environmental ones, particularly in regard to [[language acquisition]]. Here, the effect of genetic inheritance to development has more bearing than the impact of nurture, experience, and learning.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Childhood Education: An International Encyclopedia, Volume 2|last=New|first=Rebecca|last2=Cochran|first2=Moncrieff|publisher=Praeger|year=2007|isbn=0313331006|location=Westport, CT|pages=509}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that an innate maturational schedule drives what a child will do and at what time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theoretical Issues in Language Acquisition: Continuity and Change in Development|last=Weissenborn|first=Jurgen|last2=Goodluck|first2=Helen|last3=Roeper|first3=Thomas|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=2013|isbn=0805803793|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maturationism is associated with the concept of [[Child development stages|developmental stages]]. Maturation theorists maintain that the universal and invariant sequence of human development can be described and that the genetic makeup of an individual determines the pace of such development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is often associated with the work of [[Arnold Gesell]] who, along with his colleagues at the Clinic of Child Development at [[Yale University]], charted the development of thousands of children and described developmental milestones that were achieved in a developmental sequence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Classroom Management|last=Scarlett|first=W.

'''Model United Nations''', also known as '''Model UN''' or '''MUN''', is an educational simulation and/or academic activity in which students can learn about [[diplomacy]], [[international relations]], and the [[United Nations]]. MUN involves and teaches participants speaking, debating, and writing skills, in addition to [[critical thinking]], teamwork, and [[leadership]] abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/what-is-model-united-nations/|title=What is Model United Nations?|work=Best Delegate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.model-un.de/en/was-ist-mun/ |title=What does "Model United Nations" mean? |publisher=model-un.de |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually an extracurricular activity, some schools also offer Model UN as a class. It is meant to engage students and allow them to develop deeper understanding into current world issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.winthrop.edu/modelun/default.aspx?id=26613 |title=Model UN - Courses - Winthrop University |publisher=Winthrop University|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in Model United Nations conferences, known as delegates, are placed in committees and assigned countries to represent, or occasionally other organizations or political figures, where they represent members of that body. They are presented with their assignments in advance, along with a topic or topics that their committee will discuss. Delegates conduct research before conferences and formulate positions that they will then [[debate]] with their fellow delegates in the committee, staying true to the actual position of the member they represent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/getting-started/frequently-asked-questions#what_is |title=Getting Started - What is MUN? |publisher=UNA-USA |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of a conference, the best-performing delegates in each committee, as well as delegations, are sometimes recognized with awards.

Model UN participants include students at middle school, high school, and college/university levels, with most conferences catering to just one of these three levels (high school and college conferences being most common).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mymun.net/muns/list |title=List of MUN Conferences by High School and College level |publisher=MyMUN.net |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates usually attend conferences together as delegations sent by their respective schools' or universities' Model UN clubs, though some delegates attend conferences independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/independent-model-un-teams/|title=The Sudden Rise of Independent Model UN Teams: Homeschool, Community, and Private Travel Teams|work=Best Delegate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Model UN began as a series of student-led Model [[League of Nations]] simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.munplanet.com/articles/model-united-nations/toward-a-history-of-model-united-nations|title=Toward a History of Model United Nations|first=KOvacevic|last=Marko|work=MUNPlanet}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the first Model League of Nations conferences were held in the 1920s, before transitioning to Model UN after the formation of the League's successor organization, the [[United Nations]], in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/getting-started/frequently-asked-questions#how_did|title=Frequently Asked Questions|first=Ross|last=Feldman|work=United Nations Association of the USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, some Model United Nations conferences include simulations of the League of Nations among their committee offerings.

The first Model United Nations was held at St. Lawrence University from 11–13 February 1949.&lt;ref&gt;"Ten Colleges Participate in Model Session of United Nations Held at S. L.U. Campus," ''Watertown Daily Times'', 14 February 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was initiated by Dr. Harry Reiff, Head of the History and Government Department, with the assistance of departmental colleague Otto L. George.&lt;ref&gt;"Ten Schools Form Synthetic UN Group," ''Hill News'', 3 February 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Reiff was a technical advisor on the [[United States]] delegation to the 1945 San Francisco Conference (where the UN Charter was written) and the UN Organizational Conference in [[London]] in 1945-46 (where the UN was established).&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in America'' (Chicago: A. N. Marquis) vol. 31, 1960, p. 2394.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1949 St. Lawrence University Model UN conference included delegates from regional conferences and universities, including Adelphi, Alfred, Champlain, Clarkson, McGill, Middlebury, Potsdam, St. Michael's, and Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;"To Conduct Model Security / Ten Colleges to Follow United Nations Procedure / Sessions Will Take Place on St. Lawrence Campus February 11–13," ''St. Lawrence Plaindealer'' [Canton, N. Y.], 25 January 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"SLU I. R. Sponsors Model UN Meeting," ''Commercial Advertiser'' [Canton, N. Y.], 1 February 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"St. Lawrence IRC Host to 9 Colleges," ''Hill News'' [Canton, N.Y.] 9 February 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference continued annually for many years at St. Lawrence &lt;ref&gt;Pink, Louis H. and Rutherford E. Delmage, ''Candle in the Wilderness: A Centennial History of the St. Lawrence University'', 1856-1956 (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, Inc., 1957). p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward H.

In 1987, a few American exchange students founded TEIMUN in [[The Hague]]. In recent decades, Model UN has spread to East and South Asia, the Middle East, Europe, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa. Other major conference organizers such as Indian International Model United Nations, Harvard, THIMUN establishing additional conferences in these regions to meet burgeoning demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/which-countries-love-model-un-the-most-analysis-of-the-g20-countries-of-best-delegate-fans/|title=Which Countries Love Model UN the Most?

== Procedures ==
[[File:MUN-SH2005KielGermany.jpg|thumb|Delegates negotiating during an unmoderated caucus]]
In order to maintain [[Decorum#Social decorum|decorum]], most Model UN committees use parliamentary procedure derived from [[Robert's Rules of Order]]. However, most crisis committees forgo the formality of parliamentary procedure so as to ensure smoother operation. In addition, recently the United Nations has spearheaded efforts to introduce new Model UN rules of procedure that are more closely aligned with those used by the actual UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/un4mun-workshop-recap-4-big-differences-between-model-un-and-the-real-un/|title=UN4MUN Workshop Recap: 4 Big Differences Between Model UN and the Real UN|work=Best Delegate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/opinion/the-un-on-the-model-un.html?smid=pl-share&amp;_r=0|title=Letter: The U.N., on the Model U.N.|author=[[Maher Nasser]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/about/ropga/|title=UN General Assembly - Rules of Procedure|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MUN Rules"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/model-un-preparation/rules-of-procedure |title=Rules of Procedure |publisher=United Nations Foundation |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there is no [[Board of governors|governing body]] for MUNs, each conference differs in the rules of procedure. The following rules of procedure apply to general MUNs but may not apply to every MUN:

MUNs are run by a group of [[Business administration|administrators]] known as the dais. A dais is headed by a [[Secretary-General]]. Each committee usually has a chair (also known as moderator), a member of the dais that enforces the rules of procedure. A [[delegate]] may request the committee as a whole to perform a particular action; this is known as a motion. Documents aiming to address the issue of the committee are known as resolutions and are voted for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/getting-started/model-un-glossary |title=Model UN Glossary |publisher=United Nations Foundation |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MUN committees can be divided into three general sessions: formal [[debate]], moderated [[caucus]], and unmoderated caucus. In a formal debate, the staff maintains a list of speakers and the delegates follow the order written on the 'speaker list'. Speakers may be added to the speaker list by raising their [[placard]]s or sending a note to the chair. During this time, delegates talk to the entire committee. They make [[speech]]es, answer questions, and debate on resolutions and amendments. If there are no other motions, the committee goes back to formal debate by default. There is usually a [[time limit]]. In a moderated caucus, the committee goes into a recess and the rules of procedure are suspended. Anyone may speak if recognized by the chair. A vote on a motion is necessary to go into a moderated caucus. There is a comparatively shorter time limit per speech. In an unmoderated caucus, the delegates informally meet with other delegates and the staff for discussions.&lt;ref name="MUN Rules" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MUN Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web |last =Shen |first=Sunny |author2=Ryan Bae |author3=Amanda Chen |author4=Geneva Nam |author5=Sarah Wang |author6=Marco Wong |author7=Lance Zhou  |title=The MUN Manifesto |publisher=Connect Global Youth Association |year=2012 |url=http://project-connect.ca/resources/MUNManifesto.pdf |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Resolution (law)|Resolution]]s are the basis of all debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.utk.edu/~modelun/resolutions.htm |title=What is a Resolution? |publisher=University of Tennessee |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered the final results of [[conversation]]s, [[writing]]s, and [[negotiation]]s. Resolutions must go through a [[Draft document|draft]], approval by the dais, and consequent debate and modification.&lt;ref name="Resolution"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/model-un-preparation/resolutions |title=Resolutions |publisher=United Nations Foundation |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic aspects ==
Participation in Model UN is meant to foster [[negotiation]], [[public speaking|speaking]] and [[communication skills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socialsciences.uottawa.ca/international/opportunities/un-course|title=Model United Nations Course {{!}} Faculty of Social Sciences {{!}} University of Ottawa|website=socialsciences.uottawa.ca|language=en|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, crisis committees, which deal with [[crisis]] [[scenario]]s which can be contemporary or historical, can develop leadership skills and the ability to adapt and deal with unexpected situations. Material issues of [[diplomacy]] and [[policy]] are also approached through a quasi-academic process. In preparation for a conference, topics are chosen for each committee, and typically, research and background guides (called Study Guides) are made available by the organizers of a conference for each committee. Delegates of each committee are often expected to pre-formulate the position of the country or group they represent, based on these background guides, and submit the result of this preparation to their committee as a so-called Position Paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/model-un-preparation/position-papers|title=Position Papers|last=Feldman|first=Ross|newspaper=United Nations Association of the USA|access-date=20 February 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this procedure is to familiarize delegates with the substantial topics of debate, encourage [[academic research]] and writing, and to enable substantial preparation for conferences.

While several guides on the techniques of writing Position Papers, including templates and examples, are available,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unitedambassadors.com/single-post/2016/05/02/How-to-Write-a-Great-Position-Paper-for-a-Model-United-Nations-Conference|title=United Ambassadors for Model United Nations|website=United Ambassadors for Model United Nations|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aps.schoolwires.com/Page/12903|title=Model United Nations / Writing a Position Paper|website=aps.schoolwires.com|language=en|access-date=20 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221010038/http://aps.schoolwires.com/Page/12903|archive-date=21 February 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bestdelegate.com/a-formula-for-the-perfect-position-paper-solution-oriented-research/|title=A Formula for the Perfect Position Paper: Solution-Oriented Research|newspaper=Best Delegate|access-date=20 February 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; no conferences publish their Study Guides, Position Papers or Resolutions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Currently, only one subscription-based Position Paper database is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mymun.net/position-paper-database|title=Position Paper Database|last=|first=|date=20 February 2017|website=MyMUN.net|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mun is not arguing the nature of a question, proving research facts, or standing up and defending a foreign policy agenda but providing solutions that every nation,  human and nature can endeavour and use to resolve crises and rise in the risk of uniting strength to maintain international peace and security. This is the difference between the parliament and the UN, distinguishing power struggle from diplomacy.

== Languages ==
[[File:Buenos Aires MINU UN Model - 2007-11-06 - 4.jpg|thumb|Placard for the [[United Kingdom]] in Spanish at the International Model United Nations of Buenos Aires (MINUBA) in [[Argentina]]]]
Traditionally, [[English language|English]] has been the official and working language of most conferences, but, as Model UN has become more popular around the world, and as conferences in countries such as the United States have sought to appeal to underrepresented minorities (such as the [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking community), committees using languages other than English, or which are [[multilingualism|bilingual]], have become common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/model-un-conferences/model-un-city-conferences/minnesota|title=Global Classrooms: Minnesota Model UN Conference|first=Ross|last=Feldman|work=United Nations Association of the USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that this is still not yet a mainstream phenomenon, especially not in the United States, where most bilingual or Spanish language committees are found at conferences hosted in [[Puerto Rico]] or the [[Southern United States|South]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/model-united-nations-san-antonio-munsa-finds-success-through-community/|title=Model United Nations San Antonio (MUNSA) Finds Success Through Community|work=Best Delegate}}&lt;/ref&gt;, apart from Spain.

== Attire ==
Nearly all Model United Nations conferences require delegates to wear [[Informal attire|Western business attire]], as dressing professionally is an important way to show respect for the nation, organization, or individual one is representing, as well as for the rest of one's committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/model-un-preparation/dressing-for-success|title=Dressing for Success|first=Ross|last=Feldman|work=United Nations Association of the USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Committees ==
While Model United Nations conferences regularly simulate the bodies of the United Nations, the [[European Union]], government [[Cabinet (government)|cabinets]], and regional bodies such as [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] as so-called Committees, as well as corporate [[Board of directors|boards]], [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] or so-called [[Press corps|Press Corps]], idiosyncrasies and fictional Committees also exist. An example for such a special committee that does not have a parallel in the actual [[United Nations]] which deals with a [[crisis]] is known as a 'Crisis Committee.'&lt;ref name="Crisis NYT"&gt;{{cite news |last=Parrin |first=Anjli |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/education/edlife/a-new-student-run-breed-crisis-oriented-and-fiercely-competitive.html?_r=0 |title=The Dog-Eat-Dog World of Model U.N. |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=2 August 2013 |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this committee, a crisis is given to a team of students and the teams must come up with solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Montero |first=Nicole |url=http://fiusm.com/2013/11/22/model-united-nations-team-hopes-to-rank-first-among-the-country/ |title=Model United Nations Team Hopes to Rank First Among the Country |publisher=FIU Student Media |date=22 November 2013 |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crisis Committee traditionally focuses on a single historical event, but recently current and future events have been used as well. The event may be [[fiction]]al or [[non-fiction]]al.&lt;ref name="Crisis NYT" /&gt;

== Organization ==
Model United Nations conferences are usually organized by [[high school club]]s or [[college]] clubs.&lt;ref name="What MUN"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yossinger |first=Nili Sarit |url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2012/07/2012073142614.html#axzz2lSH4DnI0 |title=What is Model UN?

== Model UN by region and country ==
{{Main article|List of Model United Nations conferences}}
Although Model United Nations originated in the United States, MUN clubs and conferences are not isolated to that country. Rather, like the actual UN, Model UN is found in countries around the globe.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/model-un-conferences-database/|title=Model United Nations Conference Database: 2014-2015|work=bestdelegate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Model UN is decentralized and has grown autonomously around the world, there are significant differences in how MUN is done between regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/a-tale-of-two-coasts-5-key-differences-between-west-coast-versus-east-coast-model-un/|title=A Tale of Two Coasts: 5 Key Differences Between West Coast versus East Coast Model UN|work=Best Delegate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===

MUN is relatively popular in Denmark, with conferences at both [[Gymnasium (school)|high-school]] and university level. It was first introduced in 2003,&lt;ref name=EGMUN&gt;{{cite web|title=Previous MUNs|url=http://egmun.org/previous-muns/|website=egmun.org|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has since spread with 3 major conferences at high-school level, with at least 400 participants at each conference,&lt;ref name=EGMUN /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome 2016|url=https://www.facebook.com/bigmunconference/photos/a.635001486565559.1073741825.354614017937642/1023540374378333/?type=3&amp;theater|website=Facebook.com|publisher=BIGMUN|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with BIGMUN being the largest conference in Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Menzer|first1=Joram Gregers|title=Tomorrow's problem solvers are ready|url=http://sn.dk/Rudersdal/Morgendagens-problemloesere-sidder-klar/artikel/556049|website=sn.dk|accessdate=29 February 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain ===
MUN has become popular in Spain at the beginning of this decade, hosting the largest number of Conferences in Madrid.

The largest MUN in the Netherlands is The Hague International Model United Nations (THIMUN) conference, which includes over 3500 participants coming from around 200 schools and 100 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thimun.org/9-features/2-thimun-conference|title=THIMUN Conference The Hague|publisher=THIMUN Foundation|accessdate=1 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006070307/http://www.thimun.org/9-features/2-thimun-conference|archivedate=6 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not located near the United-Nations Headquarters in New-York, it is one of the pioneer Model United Nations conferences in the world, since it has been founded in 1968 and located in the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) world city of the Hague. A whole network of conferences is marked by its THIMUN affiliation, a label which basically describes the universality of the procedures that rule the conference and make it part of the UN recognized foundation. In 1995 the THIMUN Foundation was accredited as a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) associated with the United Nations Department of Public Information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thimun.org/index.php/youth-in-action|title=Youth In Action|publisher=THIMUN Foundation|accessdate=1 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208134107/http://www.thimun.org/index.php/youth-in-action|archive-date=8 December 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the THIMUN has established its own conferences' network throughout time: THIMUN Qatar, THIMUN Singapore, THIMUN Online MUN (O-MUN) and THIMUN Latin America conferences have been set up from 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thimun.org/index.php/about/thimun-history|title=THIMUN History|publisher=THIMUN Foundation|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third biggest MUN-conferences of the Netherlands are MUNISH (Model United Nations at the International School of the Hague and HMUN (Haarlem Model United Nations). There is also The European International Model UN TEIMUN which is founded in 1987 and is the oldest university Model UN in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teimun.org|title=The European International Model UN website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkey ===
{{Primary sources|date=May 2018}}

In Turkey, Model United Nations conferences are mostly held by non-profit university-clubs. [[Istanbul]] hosts more conferences than all Turkish other cities combined. Yeditepe Model United Nations Club, the oldest and one of the most popular clubs in Turkey, holds three different conferences, being, Yeditepe Model United Nations Training and Development [http://www.y-mun.org Conference], Justinianus Moot [http://www.justinianusmootcourts.org Courts], and Model United Nations Conference Istanbul (MUNIST)[http://munist2017.org]. Also, Koç University Model United Nations Conference (KUMUN)[http://kumun.ku.edu.tr], Kadir Has University Model United Nations Conference (HASMUN)[http://hasmun.org], alongside with the training conference of the Kadir Has University Model United Nations Training Conference (HASTRAIN), Izmir University of Economics Model United Nations Conference (ECOMUN)[https://web.archive.org/web/20170809233018/http://ecomun2017.org/], alongside with the training conference, İzmir University of Economics Training Conference (EcoTRAIN) are most qualified conferences in Turkey. These conferences simulate not only General Assembly committees, but also Joint Crisis Cabinets, Futuristic, Fictional and Historical timeline based committees.

=== United Kingdom ===

There are a very large number of Model United Nations conferences on both the University and Sixth Form level in the United Kingdom. Almost every university that has an MUN society holds a yearly conference, of varying size, with the largest and most prestigious being [[London International Model United Nations]] - so much so a features film was shot about it ([[Winning London]]), followed by [[CUIMUN]] hosted in Cambridge and [[OxiMUN]] in Oxford, however in recent years conferences such as [[YorkMUN]] and [[ScotMUN]] in Edinburgh have been gaining popularity amongst UK delegations. The UK MUN circuit is not particularly well integrated with the European circuit, with most UK delegations not crossing international borders to get to their conferences and international delegations to UK conferences outside of the big three a rarity, but recently European conferences have begun to recruit chairing staff quite heavily from the UK.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

But the concept of MUN became a popular one in [[Bangladesh]] from 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/education/2013/nov/16/creating-future|title=Creating the future |first= |last= |publisher= [[Dhaka Tribune]]|date=16 November 2013 |accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United Nations Youth and Students Association of Bangladesh (UNYSAB) established MUN in Bangladesh. [[Bangladesh Model United Nations]] conferences include: Bangladesh International Model United Nations 2012; Dhaka+20, Brainwiz MUN 2013 and UNYSAB MUN 2014, organized by UNYSAB.

==== China ====
Model United Nations first came to China in 1995, when the elite [[China Foreign Affairs University]] held the country's first collegiate Model United Nations conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?filename=WJXY503.015&amp;DBName=cjfqtotal&amp;dbcode=cjfq|title = 记外交学院首届模拟联合国活动 - China Academic Journals Full-text Database|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/special/2013-04/25/c_132339467.htm |title=Intro to CFAU-MUNA - Xinhua &amp;#124; English.news.cn |website=News.xinhuanet.com |date=25 April 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509164033/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/special/2013-04/25/c_132339467.htm |archive-date=9 May 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2012-04/21/nw.D110000zgqnb_20120421_4-04.htm|title = 外交学院举办"2012北京模拟联合国大会"|date = |accessdate =22 January 2016 |website =Zqb.cyol.com |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving in Chinese high schools in 2005, Model UN expanded rapidly. [[Peking University|Peking University (PKU)]] students, after attending [[Harvard College|Harvard]]'s [[Harvard Model United Nations|HMUN]], organized the first national Model UN conference for high school students in China. PKU's conference was initially backed by [[United Nations Association of the United States of America|UNA-USA]], however support was curtailed in 2010 due to the [[Great Recession]].

Between 2005 and 2010, national Model United Nations conferencess such as those organized by PKU and the rivaling Fudan University in Shanghai drew the best high school students from around the country, who competed for limited spaces. Over time, lesser-known national conferences, as well as regional and even local conferences for high school students, began to develop and gradually spread to cities beyond [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/04/romance-money-intrigue-its-model-un-in-china/275308/2/|title=Romance!

In the realm of interscholastic Model United Nations conferencess in China, the widely acknowledged{{According to whom|date=May 2018}} top 3 conferences are called "the ABC": [[Asian International Model United Nations]] held by [[Peking University]]; [http://www.bimun.org.cn/en/ Beijing International Model United Nations] held by [[China Foreign Affairs University]], and [[China National Model United Nations]], held by [[United Nations Association of China]], hosted in different cities annually. Another famous conference is the Annual NEOMUN conference, also known as SCAMUN by internal members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=模拟联合国(MUN)简介|url=http://www.unachina.org/upload/Attach/default/272497.doc|publisher=U.N.

== Model UN by Region ==
Model United Nations is popular across the United States, with MUN clubs and conferences being found in every region.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate1"/&gt; However, because of the fact that Model UN is decentralized and has grown autonomously, there are significant differences in how MUN is done between regions.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate3"&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/a-tale-of-two-coasts-5-key-differences-between-west-coast-versus-east-coast-model-un/ |title=A Tale of Two Coasts: 5 Key Differences Between West Coast versus East Coast Model UN |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-03-06 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conferences also evaluate delegates holistically when deciding on the distribution of awards.

The [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] is known for their Model United Nations programs. Naturally stressing the academic side of Model UN, conferences greatly value well-written position papers, not just factoring them into awards decisions, but also giving dedicated awards for them. The popularity of Model United Nations, as well as for the high quality of delegates.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate3"/&gt; West Coast conferences are run by universities, high schools, and interscholastic organizations. [http://bmun.org/ BMUN (Berkeley MUN)], [http://mckennamun.org/ McKennaMUN], and [http://scmun.org/ SCMUN] are popular college conferences for high school delegates. For example, SCMUN (hosted by the University of Southern California), offers advanced debate for high school delegates who are hoping to glean substantive and academic value from Model United Nations conferences. Additionally, high school-run conferences such as Huntington Beach High School's Surf City and Novice Conferences, [http://www.cerritosmun.com/ CHSMUN], and Mira Costa's LAIMUN are all nationally-recognized conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Final 2012-2013 High School Rankings|url = http://bestdelegate.com/final-2012-2013-high-school-rankings/|website = Best Delegate|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Midwest ===
Despite the fact that the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] has fewer conferences than the more established East and West Coast circuits,&lt;ref name="bestdelegate4"&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/model-united-nations-of-the-university-of-chicago-munuc-liveblog-educating-the-midwest/ |title=Model United Nations of the University of Chicago (MUNUC) Liveblog: Educating the Midwest |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-02-05 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; it still has a very developed and distinct Model UN culture that is dominated by small regional conferences (such as Midwest Model UN (MMUN), Model UN at the University of Illinois (MUNI), and large international-level conferences centered around Chicago). While some major conferences are located in [[Michigan]] and [[Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan |url=http://bestdelegate.com/model-united-nations-at-the-university-of-michigan-munum-2013/ |title=Model United Nations at the University of Michigan (MUNUM) 2013 |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2013-01-20 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; most are located in [[Illinois]],&lt;ref name="bestdelegate5"&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/high-school-preseason-rankings/ |title=High School Model UN Preseason Rankings |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in [[Chicago]].

Chicago is a major hub of the Model UN community at large, but maintains a strong sense of independence, and is known to have a characteristic focus on realism and innovative crisis simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emily |url=http://bestdelegate.com/5-things-to-know-about-midwestern-model-un/ |title=5 Things to Know About Midwestern Model UN |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-04-27 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; MUN is mostly seen as an educational political exercise, where the students understanding of the world and power is emphasized, and where awards and resolution writing tend to be de-emphasized.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bestdelegate6"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan |url=http://bestdelegate.com/chicago-international-model-united-nations-conference-cimun-2012/ |title=Politics, Business, and Technology: 3 Takeaways from the Chicago International Model United Nations Conference (CIMUN) |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Midwest's crisis conferences are well-regarded, with ChoMUN and CIMUN being particularly well known for this style.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bestdelegate7"&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/chicago-model-united-nations-chomun-2012-solving-the-worlds-crises/ |title=Chicago Model United Nations (ChoMUN) 2012: Solving the World’s Crises |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Model United Nations of the University of Chicago (MUNUC)]] is the largest high school conference in the Midwest, featuring 27 different committees, with several thousand delegates in attendance.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://munuc.org/ |title=Model United Nations of the University of Chicago |publisher=Munuc.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Model United Nations Development Organization (MUNDO) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modelun.net|title=Welcome to MUNDO! {{!}} Model United Nations Development Organization (MUNDO)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209055313/http://www.modelun.net/|archivedate=February 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; runs the [[Chicago International Model United Nations (CIMUN)]], which featured 24 committees, and welcomed 1300 high school delegates in 2014, its 11th annual conference. CIMUN is known to be among the most innovative and fastest growing Model UN's in the US and features some of the most realistic simulations available for high school students.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Kosmidis |url=http://bestdelegate.com/conference-recap-a-delegates-perspective-on-cimun-chicago-international-model-united-nations-conference/ |title=Conference Recap: A Delegate’s Perspective on CIMUN (Chicago International Model United Nations Conference) |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2014-12-30 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago Model United Nations (ChoMUN), also organized by the University of Chicago, is a prestigious college-level Model UN conference in the region, being well known for its unique simulations, and is known to be one of the best college-level crisis conferences in the US.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate7"/&gt; The American Model United Nations (AMUN), an independent organization, is the largest college-level conference in the Midwest and featured 15 committees. In 2014, AMUN welcomed 1400 delegates from around the US and the globe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amun.org/about-amun/ |title=About AMUN &amp;#124; American Model United Nations |publisher=Amun.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also celebrated its 25th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amun.org/uploads/2014_Conference_Program_lowres.pdf |format=PDF |title=American Model United Nations International : 2014 Conference Program |website=Amun.org |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, more Midwestern teams have also traveled to conferences on the East Coast, raising their profile nationally. High schools, such as the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]], [[St. Ignatius College Prep]], [[Lyons Township High School]], [[Glenbrook South High School]], and [[Carl Sandburg High School]] have performed well at large East Coast conferences and have become particularly well-known.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bestdelegate5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/final-2012-2013-high-school-rankings/ |title=Final 2012-2013 High School Rankings |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2013-05-29 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; University teams have also been successful, such as UChicago's team which in both 2013 and 2014 was ranked the best college Model UN team in North America, the first team to twice achieve this feat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bestdelegate.com/model-un-rankings/ |title=Rankings |publisher=Best Delegate |date= |accessdate=2016-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126014202/http://bestdelegate.com/model-un-rankings/ |archivedate=2016-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other teams like &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/hnmun-and-mcmun-tie-as-best-north-american-conference-of-2013-2014/ |title=HNMUN and McMUN Tie as Best North American Conference of 2013-2014 |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2014-05-21 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alma College, UW Oshkosh and University of Illinois - Chicago have made a name for themselves at larger conferences like National Model UN (NMUN) and American Model UN (AMUN), and at regional conferences like Midwest Model UN (MMUN).

In addition to the city of Chicago, several Minnesota teams have become major players in conferences around the country. In the 2010-2011 season, Cambridge-Isanti finished the year ranked 14th in the best delegate national rankings after finishing the equivalent of second at MUNUC and winning awards at UMMUC.   Edina High School hosts the only student run conference in Minnesota, often attracting up to four hundred high school delegates from over twelve metropolitan schools. Edina High School and Cambridge-Isanti High School are still ranked in the top 150 high school programs in the country by Best Delegate. Other notable Minnesota teams include Minnetonka High School and the Blake School.

=== South ===
Middle school Model UN is fairly popular in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/top-12-scheduling-and-market-trends-from-the-2011-12-model-un-conference-calendar/ |title=Top 12 Model UN Conference Scheduling and Market Trends in 2011-12 |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vibrant South region of Model UN in the U.S. can be easily divided into three sub-regions, San Antonio, Texas, Southwest Florida,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/southwest-florida-model-un-powerhouse/ |title=How Southwest Florida High Schools Have Become National Powerhouses in Model UN |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Virginia. All excel at Model UN and have distinct styles.

=== Puerto Rico ===
In [[Puerto Rico]], students are [[multilingualism|bilingual]] and speeches in committee are therefore allowed to be made in either [[English language|English]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. It should be noted however that Spanish is used slightly more often.

The speaking style of Puerto Rican Model UN delegates tends to be more animated than that of other delegates.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Students often speak louder and faster, and when delivering speeches, they may pace in front of their committee instead of standing still.

After a speech, if a delegate wishes to ask a question of the speaker they must ask “Delegates, will you accept my question?” before being able to address the speaker. This is a practice isolated to Puerto Rico, and delegates may be penalized by their chairs if they fail to adhere to it.

Chairs in Puerto Rico adopt a more activist approach, directing the flow of debate and banging their gavels often. This is in comparison to the facilitator style of chairing more common in the rest of the United States which allows delegates to direct more of the flow of debate.

Parents in Puerto Rico are highly supportive of Model UN and some are even [[alumni]]. It is not uncommon for parents to volunteer to help at conferences, and many are present at closing ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/the-only-formal-circuit-in-the-world-structural-and-cultural-lessons-from-la-federacion-in-puerto-rico/ |title=The Only Formal Circuit in the World: Structural and Cultural Lessons from La Federación in Puerto Rico |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=KFC |url=http://bestdelegate.com/puerto-rico-lo-hace-mejor-how-model-un-is-part-of-the-culture-and-why-puerto-ricans-do-it-better/ |title=Puerto Rico Lo Hace Mejor: How Model UN is Part of the Culture and Why Puerto Ricans Do It Better |publisher=Best Delegate |date=2012-03-07 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nikita |url=http://bestdelegate.com/crisis-simulations-a-puerto-rican-perspective/ |title=Crisis Simulations- A Puerto Rican Perspective |publisher=Best Delegate |date= |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The North of England Education Conference (NEEC)''' was the UK’s biggest annual education conference. The first Conference took place in [[Manchester]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL20289314M/North_of_England_education_conference_1902-1992 "A history of the NEEC Conference 1902 -1992"] Professor Peter Osgood, Leeds University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The event provided an opportunity for senior decision makers in education, Children’s Services, the public sector, associated agencies and organisations to meet and consider the latest thinking and legislation affecting children and young people. In recent years the scope of the conference had expanded to encompass the broader children’s services agenda.

Despite the conference name, delegates attended from across the UK and beyond. In recent years the conference took place outside of the North of England, including [[Belfast]] and [[Cardiff]].
In 2015 the conference was to be hosted in [http://www.educationconferences.co.uk Manchester] between 14–16 January but was cancelled and has not been held since.
==Delegates==

Within recent years the focus of the conference had expanded. Whilst still having education at its core, a broader children’s agenda was embraced.  Attendees included Directors of Education, key elected members, headteachers, school governors, those engaged in research in Higher Education and partners from Health, Police and Voluntary Sector organisations.

==Speakers==

The conference attracted high-profile speakers and notably the appropriate Secretary of State. This has included in recent years [[Ed Balls]], [[Ruth Kelly]], [[David Miliband]], [[David Blunkett]] and [[Estelle Morris]]. The conference was often used as a platform to launch or 'sound out' changes in policy or legislation. Hosting authorities often worked in collaboration with local universities and colleges to tap into national and international expertise and research.

==Venues==

Historically the Conference has taken place each January and has alternated in venue between the east and west of the [[Pennines]]. On occasion however, the Conference has been held outside the North of England. In 2004 the NEEC was held in [[Northern Ireland]] in [[Belfast]] and in 2008, the NEEC paid its first visit to [[Wales]] and [[Cardiff]].  In January 2014 the last conference was held in [[Nottingham]]. 

==Development==

Reflecting changes in recent years in the delivery of services to children, young people and families the conference focus had begun to reflect the wider children’s agenda encapsulated in ''[[Every Child Matters|Every Child Matters: Change for Children]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/ "Every Child Matters Agenda"] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101220152656/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/ |date=20 December 2010 }}  Labour Government Paper enshrining the Children Act 2004 (retrieved 31 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the conference continued to provide high-profile speakers with an education focus, it had recently included speakers from other areas of the children’s workforce such as health, the police, business and the [[Voluntary sector|Third Sector]]. However the event, which generations of education policymakers viewed as a key moment of the year, now appears to be a thing of the past and by the time Michael Gove took over as education secretary in 2010, it was an event he was quite happy to miss, choosing to make major announcements elsewhere. No minister was due to appear in 2015.

==Governance==

The NEEC operated under the governance formed by its membership as part of the North of England Education Conference Association. This is defined as ''"Those English Local Authorities within the Government Office areas for the North West, the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber, and also the higher education institutions lying in this area".'' Representatives from the host authority, their predecessor and the following years host were represented in the governance.

==Involvement of children and young people==

A strong feature of the conference is the involvement of children and young people. Traditionally involved in artistic, musical and dramatic performance they had begun to play a wider role in the content of the programme. In January 2012 Blackpool had a young person co-preside over the conference for the first time along with President, [[Ann Widdecombe]]. In [[Nottingham]] in 2014 there was a separate Youth Conference running alongside the main event run by young people from the eight Core Cities.

==History of the Conference==

In 1902, having seen the success of a conference for science teachers in London,  JH Reynolds, Manchester City Council's Director of Technical Instruction, decided to replicate the conference in his home town. The conference, also with a science theme, was arranged for 2 and 3 January 1903 and attended by 3,200 teachers, lecturers, inspectors and local government employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=373229 "Best wishes to our friend in the North"] Times Educational Supplement, 3 January 2003, Alison Brace - Article on the History of the NEEC on its 100th anniversary (retrieved 31 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Built on this success the conference widened the agenda to cover all areas of the curriculum. With short input from a range of professionals the, conference has remained true to the original template and remained a fixture in the first week of the year.
 
In 1924 the political dimension was added and the Secretary of the State of the day has usually been in attendance ever since, the conference often serving as a platform for announcement to changes in legislation or educational approaches. Over the course of its history this has included: [[Anthony Crosland]], [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]], [[Kenneth Clarke]], [[Shirley Williams]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=102083 "Speech to North of England Education Conference"], 6 Jan 1971, Margaret Thatcher&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth Clarke, on assuming his post as Secretary of State, is reported to have been told it was the one conference he could not afford to miss.

'''Plagiarism detection''' is the process of locating instances of [[plagiarism]] within a work or document. The widespread use of computers and the advent of the Internet has made it easier to plagiarize the work of others. Most cases of plagiarism are found in academia, where documents are typically essays or reports. However, plagiarism can be found in virtually any field, including novels, scientific papers, art designs, and source code.

Detection of plagiarism can be either manual or software-assisted. Manual detection requires substantial effort and excellent memory, and is impractical in cases where too many documents must be compared, or original documents are not available for comparison. Software-assisted detection allows vast collections of documents to be compared to each other, making successful detection much more likely.  

The practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software is known as [[rogeting]].&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grove|first1=Jack|title=Sinister buttocks? Roget would blush at the crafty cheek  Middlesex lecturer gets to the bottom of meaningless phrases found while marking essays|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/sinister-buttocks-roget-would-blush-at-the-crafty-cheek/2015027.article|accessdate=15 July 2015|publisher=Times Higher Education|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software-assisted detection==
Computer-assisted plagiarism detection (CaPD) is an [[Information retrieval|Information retrieval (IR)]] task supported by specialized IR systems, referred to as plagiarism detection systems (PDS).

===In text documents===
Systems for text-plagiarism detection implement one of two generic detection approaches, one being external, the other being intrinsic.&lt;ref name="Stein07"/&gt;
External detection systems compare a suspicious document with a reference collection, which is a set of documents assumed to be genuine.&lt;ref name=Potthast09/&gt;
Based on a chosen [[Information retrieval#Model types|document model]] and predefined similarity criteria, the detection task is to retrieve all documents that contain text that is similar to a degree above a chosen threshold to text in the suspicious document.&lt;ref name=Stein07a/&gt;
Intrinsic PDS solely analyze the text to be evaluated without performing comparisons to external documents. This approach aims to recognize changes in the unique writing style of an author as an indicator for potential plagiarism.&lt;ref name=MeyerZuEissen06/&gt;
PDS are not capable of reliably identifying plagiarism without human judgment. Similarities are computed with the help of predefined document models and might represent false positives.&lt;ref name=Bao06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clough00/&gt;&lt;ref name="Culwin01"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancaster03/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer07/&gt;

====Effectiveness of in higher education settings====
{{onesource|section|date=December 2017}}
A study was conducted to test the effectiveness of plagiarism detection software in a higher education setting. One part of the study assigned one group of students to write a paper. These students were first educated about plagiarism and informed that their work was to be run through a plagiarism detection system. A second group of students was assigned to write a paper without any information about plagiarism. The researchers expected to find lower rates in group one but found roughly the same rates of plagiarism in both groups.&lt;ref name="Youmans"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Youmans|first1=Robert J.|title=Does the adoption of plagiarism-detection software in higher education reduce plagiarism?|journal=Studies in Higher Education|date=November 2011|volume=36|issue=7|pages=749–761|doi=10.1080/03075079.2010.523457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Approaches====
The figure below represents a classification of all detection approaches currently in use for computer-assisted plagiarism detection. The approaches are characterized by the type of similarity assessment they undertake: global or local. Global similarity assessment approaches use the characteristics taken from larger parts of the text or the document as a whole to compute similarity, while local methods only examine pre-selected text segments as input.

[[File:PDS Classification.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|Classification of computer-assisted plagiarism detection methods]]

=====Fingerprinting=====
Fingerprinting is currently the most widely applied approach to plagiarism detection. This method forms representative digests of documents by selecting a set of multiple substrings ([[n-gram]]s) from them. The sets represent the fingerprints and their elements are called minutiae.&lt;ref name=Hoad03/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stein05/&gt;
A suspicious document is checked for plagiarism by computing its fingerprint and querying minutiae with a precomputed index of fingerprints for all documents of a reference collection. Minutiae matching with those of other documents indicate shared text segments and suggest potential plagiarism if they exceed a chosen similarity threshold.&lt;ref name="Brin95"/&gt; Computational resources and time are limiting factors to fingerprinting, which is why this method typically only compares a subset of minutiae to speed up the computation and allow for checks in very large collection, such as the Internet.&lt;ref name=Hoad03 /&gt;

=====String matching=====
[[String matching]] is a prevalent approach used in computer science. When applied to the problem of plagiarism detection, documents are compared for verbatim text overlaps. Numerous methods have been proposed to tackle this task, of which some have been adapted to external plagiarism detection. Checking a suspicious document in this setting requires the computation and storage of efficiently comparable representations for all documents in the reference collection to compare them pairwise. Generally, suffix document models, such as [[suffix tree]]s or suffix vectors, have been used for this task. Nonetheless, substring matching remains computationally expensive, which makes it a non-viable solution for checking large collections of documents.&lt;ref name=Monostori00/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker93/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khmelev03/&gt;

=====Bag of words=====
Bag of words analysis represent the adoption of [[Vector space model|vector space retrieval]], a traditional IR concept, to the domain of plagiarism detection. Documents are represented as one or multiple vectors, e.g. for different document parts, which are used for pair wise similarity computations. Similarity computation may then rely on the traditional [[Cosine similarity|cosine similarity measure]], or on more sophisticated similarity measures.&lt;ref name=Si97/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreher07"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Muhr09/&gt;

=====Citation analysis=====
Citation-based plagiarism detection (CbPD)&lt;ref name=Gipp14/&gt; relies on [[citation analysis]], and is the only approach to plagiarism detection that does not rely on the textual similarity.&lt;ref name=Gipp10/&gt; CbPD examines the citation and reference information in texts to identify similar [[pattern]]s in the citation sequences. As such, this approach is suitable for scientific texts, or other academic documents that contain citations. Citation analysis to detect plagiarism is a relatively young concept. It has not been adopted by commercial software, but a first prototype of a citation-based plagiarism detection system exists.&lt;ref name=Gipp13/&gt; Similar order and proximity of citations in the examined documents are the main criteria used to compute citation pattern similarities. Citation patterns represent subsequences non-exclusively containing citations shared by the documents compared.&lt;ref name=Gipp10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gipp11a/&gt; Factors, including the absolute number or relative fraction of shared citations in the pattern, as well as the probability that citations co-occur in a document are also considered to quantify the patterns’ degree of similarity.&lt;ref name=Gipp10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gipp11a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gipp11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gipp09/&gt;

=====Stylometry=====
[[Stylometry]] subsumes statistical methods for quantifying an author’s unique writing style&lt;ref name=Holmes98/&gt;&lt;ref name=Juola08/&gt; and is mainly used for authorship attribution or intrinsic CaPD. By constructing and comparing stylometric models for different text segments, passages that are stylistically different from others, hence potentially plagiarized, can be detected.&lt;ref name=MeyerZuEissen06 /&gt;

====Performance====
Comparative evaluations of plagiarism detection systems&lt;ref name=Potthast09 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTW04/&gt;&lt;ref name=HTW08/&gt;&lt;ref name=HTW10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Potthast10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Potthast11/&gt; indicate that their performance depends on the type of plagiarism present (see figure). Except for citation pattern analysis, all detection approaches rely on textual similarity. It is therefore symptomatic that detection accuracy decreases the more plagiarism cases are obfuscated.

[[File:PD Methods Detection Performance.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|Detection performance of CaPD approaches depending on the type of plagiarism being present]]

Literal copies, aka copy and paste (c&amp;p) plagiarism, or modestly disguised plagiarism cases can be detected with high accuracy by current external PDS if the source is accessible to the software. Especially substring matching procedures achieve a good performance for c&amp;p plagiarism, since they commonly use lossless document models, such as [[suffix tree]]s. The performance of systems using fingerprinting or bag of words analysis in detecting copies depends on the information loss incurred by the document model used. By applying flexible chunking and selection strategies, they are better capable of detecting moderate forms of disguised plagiarism when compared to substring matching procedures.

Intrinsic plagiarism detection using [[stylometry]] can overcome the boundaries of textual similarity to some extent by comparing linguistic similarity. Given that the stylistic differences between plagiarized and original segments are significant and can be identified reliably, stylometry can help in identifying disguised and [[Paraphrasing of copyrighted material|paraphrased]] plagiarism. Stylometric comparisons are likely to fail in cases where segments are strongly paraphrased to the point where they more closely resemble the personal writing style of the plagiarist or if a text was compiled by multiple authors. The results of the International Competitions on Plagiarism Detection held in 2009, 2010 and 2011,&lt;ref name="Potthast09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Potthast10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Potthast11" /&gt; as well as experiments performed by Stein,&lt;ref name=Stein11/&gt; indicate that stylometric analysis seems to work reliably only for document lengths of several thousand or tens of thousands of words, which limits the applicability of the method to CaPD settings.

An increasing amount of research is performed on methods and systems capable of detecting translated plagiarisms. Currently, cross-language plagiarism detection (CLPD) is not viewed as a mature technology&lt;ref name=Potthast10a/&gt; and respective systems have not been able to achieve satisfying detection results in practice.&lt;ref name=HTW10 /&gt;

Citation-based plagiarism detection using citation pattern analysis is capable of identifying stronger paraphrases and translations with higher success rates when compared to other detection approaches, because it is independent of textual characteristics.&lt;ref name=Gipp10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gipp11 /&gt; However, since citation-pattern analysis depends on the availability of sufficient citation information, it is limited to academic texts. It remains inferior to text-based approaches in detecting shorter plagiarized passages, which are typical for cases of copy-and-paste or shake-and-paste plagiarism; the latter refers to mixing slightly altered fragments from different sources.&lt;ref name=Weber-Wulff08/&gt;

====Software====
	The design of plagiarism detection software for use with text documents is characterized by a number of factors:{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

|}

Most large-scale plagiarism detection systems use large, internal databases (in addition to other resources) that grow with each additional document submitted for analysis. However, this feature is considered by some as a [[Turnitin#Concerns about violation of student copyright in the United States|violation of student copyright]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===In source code===
Plagiarism in computer source code is also frequent, and requires different tools than those used for text comparisons in document. Significant research has been dedicated to academic source-code plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/assessment/plagiarism/research_sourcecode.html "Plagiarism Prevention and Detection - On-line Resources on Source Code Plagiarism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115105655/http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/assessment/plagiarism/research_sourcecode.html |date=15 November 2012 }}. [[Higher Education Academy]], [[University of Ulster]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinctive aspect of source-code plagiarism is that there are no [[essay mill]]s, such as can be found in traditional plagiarism. Since most programming assignments expect students to write programs with very specific requirements, it is very difficult to find existing programs that already meet them. Since integrating external code is often harder than writing it from scratch, most plagiarizing students choose to do so from their peers.

According to Roy and Cordy,&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Chanchal Kumar;Cordy, James R. (26 September 2007).[http://research.cs.queensu.ca/TechReports/Reports/2007-541.pdf "A Survey on Software Clone Detection Research"]. School of Computing, [[Queen's University]], Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; source-code similarity detection algorithms can be classified as based on either
* Strings – look for exact textual matches of segments, for instance five-word runs. Fast, but can be confused by renaming identifiers.
* Tokens – as with strings, but using a [[Lexical analysis|lexer]] to convert the program into [[token (parser)|token]]s first. This discards whitespace, comments, and identifier names, making the system more robust to simple text replacements. Most academic plagiarism detection systems work at this level, using different algorithms to measure the similarity between token sequences.
* [[parse tree|Parse Trees]] – build and compare parse trees. This allows higher-level similarities to be detected. For instance, tree comparison can normalize conditional statements, and detect equivalent constructs as similar to each other.
* [[call graph|Program Dependency Graphs]] (PDGs) – a PDG captures the actual flow of control in a program, and allows much higher-level equivalences to be located, at a greater expense in complexity and calculation time.
* Metrics – metrics capture 'scores' of code segments according to certain criteria; for instance, "the number of loops and conditionals", or "the number of different variables used". Metrics are simple to calculate and can be compared quickly, but can also lead to false positives: two fragments with the same scores on a set of metrics may do entirely different things.
* Hybrid approaches – for instance, parse trees + [[suffix tree]]s can combine the detection capability of parse trees with the speed afforded by suffix trees, a type of string-matching data structure.

The previous classification was developed for [[code refactoring]], and not for academic plagiarism detection (an important goal of refactoring is to avoid duplicate code, referred to as [[code clone]]s in the literature). The above approaches are effective against different levels of similarity; low-level similarity refers to identical text, while high-level similarity can be due to similar specifications. In an academic setting, when all students are expected to code to the same specifications, functionally equivalent code (with high-level similarity) is entirely expected, and only low-level similarity is considered as proof of cheating.

The '''Scout method''' is the informal [[education|educational system]] used by [[Scouts]]. The aim of Scouting is character training with the goal of helping participants become independent and helpful,&lt;ref name="Outlook"&gt;{{cite book | last = Baden-Powell | first = Robert | authorlink = Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell | url = http://www.usscouts.org/history/BPoutlook1.asp | title = B.-P's Outlook | nopp = true | page = October, 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby become "healthy, happy, helpful citizens".&lt;ref name="SfB"&gt;{{cite book | last = Baden-Powell | first = Robert | authorlink = Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell | year = 1926 | title = [[Scouting for Boys]] | page = 331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scout method uses appealing games in the primitive outdoors to generate challenges which a Scout learns to solve by himself.&lt;ref name="Outlook"/&gt; Through the training and the example of the leader, Scouts are taught independence, leadership, the ambition to learn by himself, and a moral code with positive goals. According to founder [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], the Scout method works naturally and unconsciously: naturally in the way that it follows the natural impulses of the Scout, and unconsciously because the Scout is not aware of the education.

Hands-on orientation provides a practical method of learning and helps the Scout build confidence. Activities and games provide a fun way to develop skills and provide contact with nature and the environment when pursued in an outdoor setting. Scouts learn in small groups to build unity and a brotherly atmosphere. Developing the characteristics of responsibility, self-reliance, self-confidence, and readiness, the Scouts eventually learn collaboration and leadership skills. An attractive program of varying activities expands a Scout's horizons and bonds the Scout even more to the group.

==The eight elements==
The [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]]'s (WOSM) definition of the Scout method has changed over the years. Through the 1980s it was composed of four elements: [[Scout Law]] and [[Scout Promise]] (Scout Oath), learning by doing, development of small groups, and a progressive and attractive programs of different activities. This changed in the 1990s when WOSM restated the method in seven elements.&lt;ref name="Educational System"&gt;{{cite web | year = 1998 | url = http://www.scout.org/en/content/download/3899/34684/file/ScoutEducSyst_E.pdf | title = Scouting: An Educational System | format = PDF | publisher = World Organization of the Scout Movement | accessdate = 2007-01-13 | page = 19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070316202248/http://www.scout.org/en/content/download/3899/34684/file/ScoutEducSyst_E.pdf | archivedate = 16 March 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 41st World Scout Conference in 2017, an eighth element was added, "community involvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=41st World Scout Conferrence Document 8, The Scout Method Review|publisher=World Scout Committee|url=https://www.scout.org/sites/default/files/media-files/ConfDoc8_Baku2017_ScoutMethodReview_en_20170627.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These eight elements are summarized here.

The [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] uses a very similar, eight-part method.&lt;ref name="constitutionWAGGGS"&gt;{{cite book | year = 2005 | url = http://www.wagggsworld.org/en/grab/1109/1/1ConstitutionbookletEnglish.pdf | title = Constitution Booklet | format = PDF | publisher = World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts | accessdate = 2007-09-15 | chapter = Article 6b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law and promise===
The [[Scout law]] is a personal code of living to guide the way each Scout lives his or her life. It is not a repression of faults, so was not framed as a list of prohibitions. It states what is good form and what is expected of a Scout.&lt;ref name="VoL"&gt;{{cite book | last = Baden-Powell | first = Robert | authorlink = Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell | year = 1933 | url = http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bp-varsity10-1.htm | title = Lessons from the Varsity of Life, Chapter X | work =  | publisher =  | accessdate = 2007-01-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061202185248/http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bp-varsity10-1.htm | archivedate = 2 December 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scout Law is at the heart of the Scout method. With the [[Scout promise]] a Scout is engaged to do his best to obey the Scout law. The main principles are:&lt;ref name="VoL" /&gt;
* Duty to God
* Duty to others
* Duty to self
[[Image:Nosso Grupo voltando do Acampamento.jpg|thumb|Brazilian Scouts]]

====Prohibition====
Scouting does not prohibit bad habits, but instead gives better alternatives that will absorb the Scout's attention and gradually lead him to forget the old habit.&lt;ref name="AtS"&gt;{{cite book | last = Baden-Powell | first = Robert | authorlink = Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell | year = 1919 | url = http://www.wakan.cz/download/Knihy/Aids_to_Scoutmastership.pdf | title = Aids to Scoutmastership, World Brotherhood Edition | format = PDF | publisher = The National Council Boy Scouts of Canada | accessdate = 2007-01-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070226073403/http://www.wakan.cz/download/Knihy/Aids_to_Scoutmastership.pdf | archivedate = 26 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}} The reasoning is that "prohibition generally invites evasion, since it challenges the spirit inherent in every red-blooded boy. The boy is not governed by DON'T, but is led on by DO."&lt;ref name="VoL" /&gt;

====Spirituality====
A Scout should be spiritual but Scouting is open to all religions. Scouting deals with religions in the practical way: by nature study (to see what God is) and helping others (which is what God asks for). According to Baden-Powell this is part of all [[Philosophy of religion|religions]]. Scouting develops the spiritual side through teaching life-saving techniques and by promoting the daily good deed. Today religious practice is not a duty any more, as long as the Scout follows the Scout law and promise.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

====Good deeds====
The good deed is a key component of the law and promise. Baden-Powell felt this is the main duty God asks for, and fulfilling our duty to others makes us happy, which fulfills the duty to ourselves. The point is not so much the deed itself, which could be minor, but to teach the Scout to always pay attention and recognise if he could help someone.&lt;ref name="AtS" /&gt;{{rp|36, 64, 65}}

===Learning by doing===
Scouts games are full of practical action. This holds the participant's attention and gives the Scout hands-on experience in how the theory works. Although Baden-Powell put emphasis on practical work and independent learning, he did not rule out the need for instruction by leaders or in books. The phrase "Learning by doing" is nowadays much used in Scouting.

===Team system===
[[Image:WSJ2007 Gilwell Park Discovery Bust2.JPG|thumb|Baden-Powell]]
{{quotation|The Patrol System is the one essential feature in which Scout training differs from that of all other organizations, and where the System is properly applied, it is absolutely bound to bring success. It cannot help itself! The formation of the boys into Patrols of from six to eight and training them as separate units each under its own responsible leader is the key to a good Troop.|Robert Baden-Powell&lt;ref name="Baden"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baden-Powell |first=Robert |year= 943 |publisher=The National Council Boy Scouts of Canada |title=Aids to Scoutmastership a Guidebook for Scoutmasters on the Theory of Scout Training |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Patrol system====
Sometimes called the 'patrol method.' Scouts are organised in small groups (about five to seven Scouts) because this is the natural way boys work together.&lt;ref name="AtS" /&gt;{{rp|18}} These patrols are therefore more important than the [[Scout troop]]. Patrols must be kept intact under all circumstances, including working, tenting, learning, cooking, and surviving together.&lt;ref name="AtS" /&gt;{{rp|49}} In a Patrol the Scouts learn to work with others, while the Patrol leader learns responsibility for others. Both have to give up part of their personal interest for this.&lt;ref name="AtS" /&gt;{{rp|24}} However, Scouting deals with the individual, not with the Company.&lt;ref name="AtS" /&gt;{{rp|21, 15}} A Scout has his own identity within the group and learns as an individual. The Patrol serves as the character school for the individual.&lt;ref name="AtS" /&gt;{{rp|24}} Younger sections, such as Cub Scouts and Beaver Scouts, are divided into sixes (Cubs) or lodges (Beavers). While Beaver lodges have no leader structure, Cub sixes have a sixer and seconder.

====Court of Honour====
Called the "Patrol Leaders' Council" in some places. The Scout patrols are subject to a Court of Honour formed by the Patrol Leaders, with the Scout Leader as advisor.&lt;ref name="AtS"/&gt; This is a peer system in which Scouts discuss each other's behaviour and is part of the self-governing aspect of Scouting.

===Symbolic framework===

====Imagination====
Scouting plays on the imagination of the Scout, who loves to "make-believe" and live in the imaginative world of adventurers, such as backwoodsmen, pioneers, sailors, and airmen.&lt;ref name="AtS" /&gt;{{rp|21}} The Scout identifies with the personal qualities of his heroes. Drawing on his experience as an amateur actor, Baden-Powell built into Scouting a theatrical and non-serious environment, using words with strange meanings, yells, songs, and unique customs. The common uniform is also part of this theatre.

====Rituals====
Scouting has a number of rituals. They are designed to be short, simple, and attractive for Scouts, but with underlying symbolism. For instance, the cub yell during the opening ritual is "We DOB, DOB, DOB". It is a funny yell for the cubs, but at same time it is an abbreviation for "we Do Our Best".

===Personal progression===
[[Image:Wszystkich Swietych-2006-Ejdzej-07.jpg|thumb|Polish Scouts]]

====Self-reliance====
Baden-Powell wanted a Scout to learn to make his own decisions, as he felt this would help the children grow and mature. Baden-Powell wrote that a Scout should paddle his own canoe, metaphorically speaking. He should travel not in a rowing boat, with his back to where he goes, rowed by others and someone else at the rudder, but alone in a canoe: facing the future, paddling and steering by himself.&lt;ref name="RtS"&gt;{{cite book | last = Baden-Powell | first = Robert | authorlink = Robert Baden-Powell | coauthors = | year = 1930 | url = | title = Rovering to Success | publisher = | accessdate = | page = 22 }},&lt;/ref&gt; Scouting teaches self-reliance by bringing the Scouts into a challenging, somewhat risky environment, without help in the direct neighbourhood. Therefore the program is based on an adult, adventurous, and appealing outdoor life. "A man's job cut down to boy's size."&lt;ref name="AtS" /&gt;{{rp|32, 15}}

====Self-governing====
Giving responsibility to the Scouts is a keystone of the Scout method: "Expect him to carry out his charge faithfully. Don't keep prying to see how he does. Let him do it his own way. Let him come a howler over it if need be, but in any case leave him alone." The Patrol is almost independent, while the Troop is run by the Patrol Leaders in the Patrols' Leaders Council and Court of Honour.&lt;ref name="AtS" /&gt;{{rp|24, 32}}

====Self-learning====
Education in Scouting should give a Scout the ambition and desire to learn by himself, which is more valuable than receiving instruction from leaders. This is done by having the Scout undertake activities that attract him individually from the selection offered in [[Scouting for Boys]].&lt;ref name="AtS" /&gt;{{rp|16, 60}}

====Badge system====
The "Personal Progressive Scheme" is based on two complementary elements:
* Proficiency (Merit) badges are intended to encourage the Scout to learn a subject which could be his work or hobby, and cover many different types of activities not always related to Scouting.
* Class badges or Progress system:
** Class badges are successive stages in which the Scout learns the techniques needed for the Scout game. An important final (first Class) test for the Scout or Guide section is making a journey on their own, proving their independence.
** The personal progress system was introduced by the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] as an alternative to the Class badges. The programme uses successive stages which young people go through in order to reach the educational objectives for each age group. The system puts more emphasis on personal objectives of physical, intellectual, affective, social, spiritual, and character development.&lt;ref name="RAP"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2007| url =http://www.scout.org/en/content/download/5944/56692/file/rap.pdf| title =The RAP User's Guide| format =PDF| work =| publisher =World Organization of the Scout Movement| accessdate =2007-07-26| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222005/http://www.scout.org/en/content/download/5944/56692/file/rap.pdf| archivedate =27 September 2007| df =dmy-all}} p. 119-121&lt;/ref&gt;
:Badges are not a final goal, but a first step, to give a Scout encouragement.&lt;ref name="AtS" /&gt;{{rp|56–57}} The Scout should then decide by himself to proceed if he likes the activity, without further need of standards. Scouting should not be a high standard of knowledge.&lt;ref name="SfB"/&gt;{{rp|331}} This part of the method is no longer emphasized, as today's standards are higher than in the past, and there are additional levels in the United States above the class badges.

====Non-competitive====
Education in Scouting is non-competitive because Scouts should learn because they like the subject, not just in competition or to be better than others.&lt;ref name="AtS" /&gt;{{rp|28}}

====Individual====
Education in Scouting is individual, because every Scout, no matter what their capabilities, must be inspired to learn. The goal is not the quality of the whole group. Scouts should proceed on their own level. The badges signify not a certain quality of knowledge or skill as "the amount of effort the Scout puts into his work." The standards were therefore purposely not clearly defined.&lt;ref name="AtS" /&gt;{{rp|28}}

===Nature===
[[Image:Brownsea Island 6.jpg|thumb|Brownsea Island]]

====Nature as the learning school====
The Scouting game mostly takes place in Nature, because it is an adventurous environment with challenges, which Scouts want to conquer. In this way the Scout and the Patrol learn to overcome difficulties and learn to make their own decisions.

====God in nature====
According to Baden-Powell, the Scout could find God in Nature when he realised the complexity and beauty of Nature.

====Love of outdoors====
Scouts see Nature as an adventurous place, and it is expected that when they get older the experience from their youth will make them nature lovers.

===Adult support===
[[Image:Basic Practical Course Leaders Jan 1971.png|thumb|Leaders]]

====Example of the leader====
An important part of Scouting education is the personal example of the leader. The Scout is impressed by the leader because of his age, his knowledge, and his position as a leader. If the leader is popular, leadership will be seen as an attractive goal, and the Scout will follow the example of the leader. The Scoutmaster living the Scout law will have more influence than one who simply talks about it. In the boys' eyes it is what a man does that counts and not so much what he says.&lt;ref name="AtS" /&gt;{{rp|4, 38}}

====Guide====
The self-governing of the boys changes the role of the leader: "I had stipulated that the position of Scoutmaster was to be neither that of a schoolmaster nor of a commander Officer, but rather that of an elder brother among his boys, not detached or above them individually, able to inspire their efforts and to suggest new diversions when his finger on their pulse told him the attraction of any present craze was wearing off."&lt;ref name="VoL" /&gt; Scouting leaders should not direct, but guide (and check on safety).

===Community Involvement===
This refers to knowledge of and service to the various communities that a person is part of, local, national, and international.

'''Sloyd''' ('''''Slöjd'''''), also known as '''Educational sloyd''', is a system of handicraft-based education started by [[Uno Cygnaeus]] in [[Finland]] in 1865. The system was further refined and promoted worldwide, and was taught in the [[United States]] until the early 20th Century. It is still taught as a compulsory subject in Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian schools.

[[Image:Sloejdsal 1931.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Woodwork room for teaching sloyd in Denmark, 1931]]

== Historical overview ==

=== Background ===
The word "sloyd" is derived from the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] word ''Slöjd'', which translates as [[crafts]], handicraft, or handiwork. It refers primarily to [[woodwork]] but also paper-folding and [[sewing]], [[embroidery]], [[knitting]] and [[crochet]].

[[Otto Salomon]], with the financial support of his uncle, started a school for teachers in [[Nääs]] (now a part of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] municipality of Lerum) in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=621&amp;letter=A Jewish Encyclopedia: Abrahamson, August], Retrieved August 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The school attracted students from throughout the world and was active until around 1960.

Educational sloyd's purpose was [[Formative assessment|formative]] in that it was thought that the benefits of handicrafts in [[Secondary education|general education]] built the character of the child, encouraging moral behavior, greater intelligence, and industriousness. Sloyd had a noted impact on the early development of manual training, manual arts, industrial education and technical education.

=== Sloyd in Sweden ===
Sloyd (''Slöjd'') has been a Swedish school subject since the 1870s and compulsory since 1955. In the present national curriculum for Swedish elementary schools, students have classes in ''Slöjd'' every semester, normally between the ages of nine and fifteen.

In most schools, the course is still divided traditionally in two parts: soft materials (textiles) and hard materials (woodwork and metalwork). Each semester, students switch between the two different classrooms. Differences in what kind of tasks are selected, and how the subject-specific content is handled, depend on the teacher's training.

The present aims of the ''Slöjd'' curriculum in Sweden are:
*developing the ability to create and design self-made products in different materials
*managing handtools and materials
*expressing cultural and aesthetic values.

Sloyd also aims to develop the student's practical knowledge, and their ability to solve practical problems through knowledge of different working processes, as well as how to evaluate the results of their own work during the production process by trying out different ways to handle specific tools or materials or by choosing alternative tools and materials.

=== Sloyd in America ===
[[File:Meri Toppelius (1894).png|thumb|Meri Toppelius]]
Born in Finland, [[Meri Toppelius]] was the first to introduce the sloyd system in the United States.{{sfn|Harper|1891|p=153}}

The major points of sloyd introduction in the United States were Gustaf Larsson's Sloyd Teacher Training School, which was housed on the fourth floor of the North Bennet Street Industrial School (now the [https://www.nbss.edu/ North Bennet Street School]) in Boston, and at the Baron de Hirsch Trade School in NYC.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Of the sloyd system, North Bennet Street Industrial School's annual report from the school year 1908-1909 had the following to say:

{{quote|The North Bennet Street Industrial School came into being in 1880 as an answer to the question thus stated in the first annual report: 'Might we not train these unskilled masses, and thus create a demand for them and their labor?' Throughout its history, the school has had a single aim—social betterment by means of such education as shall increase efficiency and respect for labor.... Indeed, it is largely due to the work started here and developed through the Sloyd Training School that manual training has become the inheritance of children over our entire country.}}

That same annual report goes on to say that "The Sloyd Training School, for many years occupying the fourth floor, was given a new building on Harcourt Street, the growth and demands upon the school having increased to such an extent as made the old quarters entirely inadequate. The implication is that the teachings were further absorbed into the Boston educational system.

Gustaf Larsson wrote a number of books about sloyd and sloyd education, and B.B. Hoffmann, principal of the Baron De Hirsch Trade School, also published an important text.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Ednah Anne Rich, a graduate of Gustaf Larsson's school in Boston and of the Sloyd Training School at Nääs started Sloyd teacher training in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]. In a few years, sloyd was being taught in hundreds of schools throughout the US.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

== Principles ==
[[File:SalomonOtto.jpg|thumb|Otto Salomon]]
=== Developmental goal ===
In “Educational sloyd,” as devised by [[Otto Salomon]] in the 1870s, woodworking projects were designed to build incrementally on the child’s growing skill. This was accomplished by making the projects grow in degree of difficulty over a period of time, through the introduction of complexity of shape and procedures and through the gradual introduction of more difficult woodworking tools. Salomon believed that the teacher should carefully study and know each child.  It was said that from the student’s perspective, no project should be any more difficult than the immediately preceding project. Sloyd was taught through the use of series of models, growing in difficulty and complexity that the students were supposed to accurately reproduce without interference from the teacher. Salomon developed "exercises" in the use of various tools leading to proficiency in the making of models. The exercises in the use of various tools were developed through careful study by Salomon, but he also encouraged that model series be adapted and made relevant to the various cultures in which sloyd was taught. The objects in the model series were designed to be useful to the child and his family, thereby building a relationship of good will and mutual support in the child's education.

"Paper sloyd," in particular, was intended as a preparation for woodworking and sewing, which were considered more difficult work appropriate for older students. The book "Paper Sloyd for Primary Grades" suggests that the craft's benefits for the student included the following: "Observation is quickened; eyes are trained to see right lines and distances, thus aiding in free-hand drawing and writing; while the hand and wrist muscles, being used for a definite purpose, unconsciously become obedient assistants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Rich  | first = Edna A.  | title = Paper Sloyd: A Handbook for Primary Grades  | publisher = Ginn &amp; Company  | year = 1905  | location = Boston }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper sloyd consisted of paper folding which resembles the Japanese art of [[origami]], but involves more cutting and gluing. Projects might include folding a case for a comb or whiskbroom, a box for candies or pencils, pinwheels, a "match scratcher," a blotting pad, or a penwiper.

=== Unique characteristics ===

[[File:Basicbench.jpg|thumb]]Sloyd differed from other forms of manual training in its adherence to a set of distinct [[pedagogical]] principles.  These were: that instruction should move from the known to the unknown, from the easy to the more difficult, from the simple to the more complex, from the concrete to the abstract and the products made in sloyd should be practical in nature and build the relationship between home and school. Sloyd, unlike its major rival, [[Education in Russia|"the Russian system"]] promoted by [[Victor Della-Vos]], was designed for general rather than vocational education.

Educational sloyd as practiced in Sweden started with the use of the knife. The knife was controversial when sloyd was first introduced in the [[UK]]. Educators in [[London]] and the other cities of the UK could hardly imagine putting knives in the hands of the juveniles. They developed a rationale for the use of chisels instead. Salomon's purpose in the use of the knife was that it illustrates a fundamental premise. During the time of sloyd’s invention and introduction in rural Sweden, nearly every boy growing up on a farm was already experienced in the use of the knife and knew how to use it without endangering himself or others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Starting with the known and moving toward the unknown was a crucial element of Salomon’s theory. He also believed that beauty of form was more readily available through the use of the knife.

Salomon believed that of all the basic crafts, woodworking best fit general educational purposes. Because most schools would not be able to afford to introduce a wide variety of crafts to their students, the overall needs of education would be best served through woodworking sloyd. He adhered rigidly to this plan, and it wasn’t until his death that textile and metal sloyd were added to the teacher training at Nääs. It was also clear to Salomon, that mastery of a single craft was more important than a cursory exploration of several crafts that did not offer the student the opportunity of reaching a point of mastery.

Unlike woodworking education of the later years in the US, woodworking sloyd was introduced in the primary grades for the greatest benefit to the child’s growing intellect. This was in contrast to the Russian system devised by Victor Della Vos, which was intended as a vocational system to help prepare students for employment in industry.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The distinctions between the two systems were greater than perceived by many. Both used series of models, but the Russian system used only parts of things rather than finished objects. Salomon's system was based firmly on his study of a long line of educational philosophers like [[Rousseau]], [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]], [[Friedrich Fröbel|Fröbel]], [[Commenius]] and others. Teacher training at Nääs involved extensive lectures in the fundamental theory of education.  Salomon believed that teaching was an art in itself, and that woodworking skills were of secondary importance in the teaching of sloyd. Of various educational theorists, sloyd is most closely associated with Fröbel. "Hand &amp; Eye," an educational journal published in England from about 1890-1902, was dedicated to joint discussion of the principles of "Freobelian education" and Educational sloyd.

=== Relationship to physical education ===
As Salomon was a great believer in physical education, training teachers in games was part of the basic curriculum. In fact, the school at Nääs was the point of introduction of basketball to Europe,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} with the game being brought to the school by students from the US. Salomon also believed that woodworking was a means for physical development. He drew a distinction between the posture of the carpenter, and the proper posture for use in sloyd.

== Legacy ==
Salomon kept up regular correspondence with former students all over the world, spoke in several languages, and delivered his lectures on alternate days in Swedish, English, and German. He was not as good in English – but he practiced in his lessons and conversations during the summer courses. “My English is always better in the autumn”, he said as a joke.

Thousands of teachers from all over the world attended classes at Nääs. Some of the countries, in which sloyd was successfully introduced were the UK, the US, Japan, Brazil, Argentina, Cuba, the Scandinavian Countries and many more.

== Today ==
Currently, sloyd is still part of the compulsory school curriculum in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. In Sweden, students take part in both wood and metal, and textile sloyd (but only given one grade that covers both areas), in Denmark all three materials are compulsory as individual subjects, and in Norway they are united into one subject called ''forming''.

While sloyd disappeared from the American educational landscape in the early 1900s, articles have been published by Doug Stowe in Woodwork Magazine, August 2004 and again in August 2005, and by Joe Barry in the Journal of the American Period Furniture Makers, September 2004, Volume IV.

Roy Underhill gives a 30-minute presentation from "The Book of Sloyd"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/woodwrightsshop/watch-on-line/watch-season-episodes/2017-2018-episodes/ The Woodwright's Shop, Season 37, Episode 1]&lt;/ref&gt; on [[The Woodwright's Shop]] on PBS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5473">'''Student Approaches to Learning''' is a theory that students will take a different approach to how they study, depending upon the perceived objectives of the [[Course (education)|course]] they are studying.

The theory was developed from the clinical studies of two educational psychologists, [[Ference Marton]] and [[Roger Säljö]], who found that students, in relation to any given learning task, can be divided into two distinct groups:

* those who took an [[understanding]]&lt;ref&gt;Also called [[intellection]].&lt;/ref&gt; approach to learning,
* and those who took a reproduction approach to learning.

These are commonly referred to as the "deep" and "surface" approaches.

In a study conducted by Marton and Säljö,&lt;ref&gt;Marton F. and Säljö R. (1976) On qualitative differences in learning. I – Outcome and Process’ British Journal of Educational Psychology 46, pp. 4-11.&lt;/ref&gt; students read a 1500-word article, about which they were later questioned by an interviewer. In the interviews, students were asked about what they remembered, how they felt about the task, and how they had approached the task. Analysis of the interviews showed that the students could be divided into two distinct groups:

* those who adopted a "deep" approach to learning engaged in an active process to reflect and integrate information in order to understand material being taught.
*"deep" approach recognized by a sub-scale which involves “(1) seeking meaning, (2) relating ideas, (3) using evidence, and having (4) an interest in ideas”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tait|first=H.|last2=Entwistle|first2=N.|date=January 1996|title=Identifying students at risk through ineffective study strategies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00129109|journal=Higher Education|language=en|volume=31|issue=1|pages=97–116|doi=10.1007/bf00129109|issn=0018-1560}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* those who adopted a "surface" approach to learning focused on trying to cope with the task assigned, and visualizes the course as burden, therefore uses memorization of information which then leads to a limited learning understanding.
*"surface" approach recognized to have sub-scale which involve “1) unrelated memorizing of information, (2) confining learning of the subject to the syllabus (syllabus-boundless), and (3) a fear of failing” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.
 
These findings were corroborated by the laboratory studies of [[G. Pask]] and co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;Pask G.(1976) Styles and Strategies of Learning British Journal of Educational Psychology 46, pp. 128-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Pask referred to the two groups of students as "holists" and "serialists." Holists have a broad focus and see their task in [[Context (language use)|context]], using analogies and illustrations. Serialists look at details and at steps in an argument. 

Researchers later proposed the “strategic approach or achievement approach” those individuals who try to attain the maximum grade by studying in an organized fashion utilizing time-management skill &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Entwistle|first=Noel|last2=Hanley|first2=Maureen|last3=Hounsell|first3=Dai|date=July 1979|title=Identifying distinctive approaches to studying|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01680525|journal=Higher Education|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=365–380|doi=10.1007/bf01680525|issn=0018-1560}}&lt;/ref&gt;.   

Using the following sub-scale: “(1) organized study, (2) time management, (3) being alert to assessment demands, (4) achieving high grades, and (5) monitoring effectiveness” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

Later, Entwistle and McCune (2004) suggest that the strategic approach is an approach to studying rather than an approach to learning but when combined with the deep approach, students seem to show successful academic performance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Entwistle|first=Noel|last2=McCune|first2=Velda|date=December 2004|title=The Conceptual Bases of Study Strategy Inventories|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10648-004-0003-0|journal=Educational Psychology Review|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=325–345|doi=10.1007/s10648-004-0003-0|issn=1040-726X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Learning approaches and phenomenography==
Marton has also been involved in the development of [[phenomenography]], a qualitative research methodology.  Phenomenography seeks to create a detailed understanding of people's experiences and thoughts.

==Learning approaches vs. learning styles==
Learning approaches are not the same as [[learning styles]]. Students will use different learning approaches for different tasks.

Learning approaches are not inherent personality traits; they are produced by the interaction of the student with specific learning tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Laurillard D. (1979) The Process of Student Learning Higher Education 8, pp. 395-409.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurillard D. (1997) Ch. 11 in F. Marton, D. Hounsell, and N. Entwistle, The Experience of Learning: Implications for Teaching and Studying in Higher Education (Edinburgh, Scottish Academic Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taking Children Seriously''' ('''TCS''') is a [[parenting]] movement and [[Philosophy of education|educational philosophy]] whose central idea is that it is possible and desirable to raise and educate children without either doing anything to them against their [[Will (philosophy)|will]], or making them do anything against their will.

==Overview==
It was founded in 1994 as an on-line mailing-list by the [[libertarians]] Sarah Fitz-Claridge and [[David Deutsch]]. Deutsch is also a theoretical [[physicist]] at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/node/136 Origins of TCS.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

TCS begins with the observation that most traditional interactions between adults and youth are based on [[coercion]]. The TCS model of [[parenting]] and [[education]] rejects this coercion as infringing on the will of the child, and also rejects parental or educator "self-sacrifice" as infringing on the will of the adult. TCS advocates that parents and children work to find a common preference, a solution all parties genuinely prefer to all other candidate solutions they can think of.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/common_preferences_and_non_coercion Taking Children Seriously common preferences and non-coercion.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The TCS philosophy was inspired by the [[epistemology]] of [[Karl Popper]]. Popper was a professional educator himself before he started to do philosophy. In fact, philosophy was only a second option for him at that time, to be able to emigrate to escape the imminent [[Anschluss]]. He was active in the ''Wiener Schulreform'' (Vienna school reform) movement,&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl R. Popper]] (1925) "Über die Stellung des Lehrers zu Schule und Schüler," ''Schulreform'' '''4'''(4): 204–208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K. R. (1927) "Zur Philosophie des Heimatgedankens," ''Die Quelle'' '''77'''(10): 899–908.&lt;/ref&gt; and there are connections between the [[psychology of learning]], on which he did his doctoral thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K. R. (1928) ''Zur Methodenfrage der Denkpsychologie''. Wien (unpublished dissertation).&lt;/ref&gt; and his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[William W. Bartley]] (1970) "Die österreichische Schulreform als die Wiege der modernen Philosophie" in Gerhard Szcesny, ed., ''Club Voltaire IV''. Hamburg: 360. {{ISBN|3-499-65086-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a philosopher, he did not advocate any concrete [[pedagogy]], although he had some general views on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Champion, Rafe (1987) "[http://www.the-rathouse.com/RC_PopperEdu.html Popper on Education.]"&lt;/ref&gt; TCS views Popper's epistemology, as did Popper, as a universal theory of how [[knowledge]] grows, and tries to work out its profound implications for [[Philosophy of education|educational theory]].

[[Image:hidden-curriculum-cover.jpg|thumbnail|''The Hidden Curriculum'' (1973 edition)]]

'''''The Hidden Curriculum''''' (1970) is a book by the psychiatrist Benson R. Snyder,&lt;ref name="Snyder1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benson R. Snyder |title=The Hidden Curriculum |year=1971 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |isbn=0-394-42842-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the then-Dean of Institute Relations at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Benson Rowell Snyder, former psychiatrist-in-chief at MIT, dies at 89 |url=http://news.mit.edu/2012/obit-snyder |newspaper=MIT News |date=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Snyder advances a thesis that much of campus conflict and students' personal anxiety is caused by unstated academic and social norms. These hidden norms affect the ability to develop independently or think creatively, and form what Snyder calls the [[hidden curriculum]].  He illustrates his thesis with psychological studies and other research conducted at MIT and [[Wellesley College]].

==Summary==
The phrase "hidden curriculum" was coined by Philip Jackson in his 1968 book entitled ''Life in Classrooms'', in a section about the need for students to master the institutional expectations of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Philip Wesley Jackson |title=Life in Classrooms |date=1968 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston}} Reprinted as {{cite book |author=Philip Wesley Jackson |title=Life in Classrooms |year=1990|publisher=Teachers College Press |isbn=978-0-8077-7005-4 |pages=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder develops this with observations of particular institutions.&lt;ref name=ISSTL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doceo.co.uk/tools/hidden.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414182209/http://www.doceo.co.uk/tools/hidden.htm |archivedate=2017-04-14 |df= }} Sending Messages:
Managing the Hidden Curriculum; second conference of the International Society for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (Vancouver B.C., 14–16 October 2005) "For our purposes in higher education, therefore, let us set aside most of the above line of debate, and start with Snyder (1971). Snyder's observations pre-figured all the later research on "Deep" and "Surface" learning; he noted that at MIT in the 'fifties and 'sixties, the curriculum was getting more and more crowded as technological knowledge grew, and so undergraduates were taking "short cuts" in their learning. They could not absorb everything, so they strategically tried to guess what would be assessed, for example, and revised only that. Snyder's additional insight, however, was to realise that unintentionally the Institute was teaching them to act strategically, hence the term "hidden curriculum".''

Under Creative Commons License: Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives&lt;/ref&gt;  Snyder then addresses the question of why students &amp;mdash; even or especially the most [[gifted]] &amp;mdash; turn away from education. Even honest efforts to enrich curricula frequently fail, says Snyder, thanks to the importance of the tacit and unwritten understanding.  He says that while some students do not realize there is a disjunction between the two curricula, in a demanding environment, students develop strategies to cope with the requirements they face.&lt;ref name = ISSTL /&gt;

Many students find they can not possibly complete all the work assigned them; they learn to neglect some of it. Some student groups maintain files of past examinations which only worsen this situation.&lt;ref name = ISSTL /&gt;

The difference between the formal and real requirements produced considerable dissonance among the students and resulted in cynicism, scorn, and hypocrisy among students, and particular difficulty for minority students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Hafferty |editor-first1=Frederick W. |editor-last2=O'Donnell |editor-first2=Joseph F.  |title=The Hidden Curriculum in Health Professional Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tSXZBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |accessdate=November 1, 2016 |year=2015 |publisher=Dartmouth |isbn=978-1611686609 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No part of the university community, writes Snyder, neither the professors, the administration nor the students, desires the end result created by this process.&lt;ref name = ISSTL /&gt;

The [[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]] said the book "will gain recognition as one of the more cogent 'college unrest' books" and that it presents a "most provocative thesis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1971feb20 [[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)]] ] Book review, 20 Feb 1971, page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arriva driver trainer.JPG|thumb|300px|An [[Arriva UK Bus|Arriva UK]] training bus]]
[[File:NWFBTrainingBuses.png|thumb|300px|Two training buses of [[New World First Bus]] in [[Hong Kong]].]]
A '''training bus''' is a special kind of [[bus]] or [[coach (vehicle)|coach]] that is used by [[list of bus operating companies|bus operators]] for training the driving skills of bus drivers. It is also used to train the driving skill of a person who is learning to become a bus driver. Driving a training bus on the road is an important part of driving training, as it is the most practical to train one's driving skill.

A training bus is usually a bus that has been retired from the passenger-serving fleet. Some bus companies may like to repaint the bus with a special livery for training bus after the bus is retired from the passenger-serving fleet, which is usually white or a plainer version of the company's regular livery. Some bus companies may also remove most of the facilities (such as passenger seats) from a training bus, so that those facilities can be installed onto some newer buses. On a training bus, there is usually another seat for the [[driving instructor]] (trainer) next to the driver's seat. This allows the instructor to monitor how trainee is driving and give appropriate instruction when necessary.

==Hong Kong==
The use of training buses for practical training is especially popular among the [[:Category:Bus companies of Hong Kong|Hong Kong franchised bus companies]]. In [[Hong Kong]], training buses are known in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] as "訓練巴士" ([[pinyin]]: Xùn liàn bā Shì). Training buses used in Hong Kong, such as those used at [[Kowloon Motor Bus]], are typically buses that are older buses and retired from its main bus fleet, therefore only used for training purposes and not for passenger services.  However, for route training and other service or safety improvement trainings, in-service buses may be used.

==Other places==
In contrast, other jurisdictions may use active-service buses for training; this will be at non-peak service times when more buses are available. The head sign may be set to read 'TRAINING', and a sign mounted at the rear as well.

===Toronto===
The [[Toronto Transit Commission]] uses training buses on regular routes or roads with sign display the bus as a training bus for real life training for new drivers. The bus will not be in service and will only stop briefly at select bus stops.

'''VideoBook''' is a brand of online, interactive educational videos marketed by Studio 21.

==History==
The name "VideoBook" was first registered and used in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1982 by Barry R. Pyatt, the owner of Yorkshire film producers "Studio 21." VideoBook was the marque, trading title and style for local-interest and sell-through video films. The name VideoBook was in commercial use by Studio 21 in the UK and Spain until 2003. In 2004, Pyatt opened AngelFilms in Spain, which took over the VideoBook marque. In 2005, AngelFilms-UK was established, and in 2008, VideoBook products were re-launched in the UK.

==Marque==
Video Books are identified and registered with the ISBN agencies. The trademark style is as one word, with uppercase V and uppercase B, in a modified Bookman typeface, and is Pyatt's exclusive property.

The name "videobook" (without the two uppercase characters) has become a standard term for a form of [[online training]] that delivers downloadable training videos. Most video books are single website entities that focus on teaching a particular topic.

Video books are similar in content and structure to a "regular" book. The videos are typically recorded by a trained instructor and offered to the viewer on a subscription model. The user visits the video book (the website containing the training videos), purchases a subscription and can then download the videos.

Video Books are different from many [[Computer-based training]] (CBT) models in that they are typically in a shareable and portable format. They also differ in content delivery.

In contrast to printed books and audio books which rely solely on text and audio, respectively, the basic component of a videobook is video. The video book can have on-screen text along with pictures and video clips. The text may be animated along with related audio background commentary.

The student can watch videos in any order. Once downloaded, no Internet connection is necessary. The videos use non-proprietary formats. The target market is usually an individual instead of an organization. Videobook materials may involve presentation software such as [[PowerPoint]], screen-capture software such as [[Camtasia]] and [[text-to-speech software]], such as TextAloudMP3.

Paid Videobook (online, offline) - videobook online(offline) using the private information in the form of thoughts of a person registered on the Internet project has temporal properties: time, date, month, year of writing. Copyrights are registered online on authoritative sources confirmed . Payment for the information contained in the paid videobook takes place in credit, after reading it.

[[File:Reality check ESA384313.jpg|thumb|250px|Researchers with the [[European Space Agency]] in [[Darmstadt]], Germany, exploring virtual reality for controlling [[Rover (space exploration)|planetary rovers]] and [[satellites]] in orbit]]

'''Virtual reality''' ('''VR''') is an interactive [[Computer generated reality|computer-generated]] experience taking place within a simulated environment. It incorporates mainly auditory and visual feedback, but may also allow other types of [[Perception#Types|sensory feedback]] like [[Haptic perception|haptic]]. This immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical. [[Augmented reality]] systems may also be considered a form of VR that layers virtual information over a live camera feed into a headset or through a [[smartphone]] or tablet device giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.

Current VR technology most commonly uses [[virtual reality headset]]s or multi-projected environments, sometimes in combination with physical environments or props, to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to "look around" the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a [[head-mounted display]] with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens.

VR systems that include transmission of vibrations and other sensations to the user through a [[game controller]] or other devices are known as [[haptic technology|haptic]] systems. This tactile information is generally known as [[force feedback]] in medical, [[video gaming]], and military training applications.

==Etymology and terminology==
[[File:Linux kernel and gaming input-output latency.svg|thumb|Paramount for the sensation of [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]] into virtual reality are a high [[frame rate]] (at least 95 fps), as well as a low [[latency (engineering)|latency]].]]

"[[Virtual (philosophy)|Virtual]]" has had the meaning of "being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact" since the mid-1400s.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "virtual" has been used in the computer sense of "not physically existing but made to appear by software" since 1959.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"/&gt; 
In 1938, the French avant-garde playwright  [[Antonin Artaud]] described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the [[theatre]] as [[:fr:Réalité virtuelle|"la réalité virtuelle"]] in a collection of essays, ''[[:fr:Le Théâtre et son double|Le Théâtre et son double]]''. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as ''[[The Theater and its Double]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonin Artaud]], ''The Theatre and its Double'' Trans. Mary Caroline Richards. (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; is the earliest published use of the term "virtual reality". The term "[[artificial reality]]", coined by [[Myron W. Krueger|Myron Krueger]], has been in use since the 1970s. The term "virtual reality" was first used in a science fiction context in ''The Judas Mandala'', a 1982 novel by [[Damien Broderick]].

A "[[cyberspace]]" is a networked virtual reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cyberspace|title=the definition of cyberspace|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual reality shares some elements with "[[augmented reality]]" (or AR).&lt;ref&gt;Myron Krueger. Artificial Reality 2, Addison-Wesley Professional, 1991. {{ISBN|0-201-52260-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; AR is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their ''real'' surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. Some AR systems use a camera to capture the user's surroundings or some type of display screen which the user looks at (e.g., Microsoft's [[HoloLens]], [[Magic Leap]]).

==Technology==
The [[VRML|Virtual Reality Modelling Language]] (VRML), first introduced in 1994, was intended for the development of "virtual worlds" without dependency on headsets.&lt;ref name="W3 VRML archive"&gt;{{cite web|title=VRML Virtual Reality Modeling Language|url=https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/VRML/|website=www.w3.org|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Web3D]] consortium was subsequently founded in 1997 for the development of industry standards for web-based 3D graphics. The consortium subsequently developed [[X3D]] from the VRML framework as an archival, [[open source software|open-source]] standard for web-based distribution of VR content.&lt;ref name="W3D Brutzman 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brutzman|first1=Don|title=X3D Graphics and VR|url=http://www.web3d.org/sites/default/files/presentations/X3D%20Graphics%20and%20VR/X3dGraphicsVirtualRealityW3cWorkshop2016October18.pdf|website=web3D.org|publisher=Web3D Consortium|accessdate=20 March 2017|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All modern VR displays are based on technology developed for [[smartphone]]s including: [[gyroscope]]s and motion sensors for tracking head, hand, and body positions; small HD screens for [[stereoscopic]] displays; and small, lightweight and fast [[processors]]. These components led to relative affordability for independent VR developers, and lead to the 2012 Oculus Rift Kickstarter offering the first independently developed VR headset.&lt;ref name="Wired Magic Leap Apr2016" /&gt;

Independent production of VR images and video has increased by the development of [[omnidirectional camera]]s, also known as 360-degree cameras or [[VR photography|VR cameras]], that have the ability to record in all directions, although at low-resolutions or in highly compressed formats for online streaming of [[360 video]].&lt;ref name="CNET May 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orellana|first1=Vanessa Hand|title=10 things I wish I knew before shooting 360 video|url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/360-cameras-comparison-video-things-to-know-before-you-buy/|website=CNET|accessdate=20 March 2017|language=en|date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[photogrammetry]] is increasingly used to combine several high-resolution photographs for the creation of detailed 3D objects and environments in VR applications.&lt;ref name="RE7 80.lv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resident Evil 7: The Use of Photogrammetry for VR|url=https://80.lv/articles/resident-evil-7-the-use-of-photogrammetry-for-vr/|website=80.lv|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="otherboard March 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Leif|title=Forget 360 Videos, Photogrammetric Virtual Reality Is Where It's At - Motherboard|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/forget-360-videos-photogrammetric-virtual-reality-is-where-its-at|website=Motherboard|accessdate=20 March 2017|language=en-us|date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:View-Master with Reel.jpg|thumb|[[View-Master]], a stereoscopic visual simulator, was introduced in 1939]]

The exact origins of virtual reality are disputed, partly because of how difficult it has been to formulate a definition for the concept of an alternative existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/intro | title=Seeing is Believing: The State of Virtual Reality | author=Matthew Schnipper | publisher= The Verge | access-date= 7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of perspective in Renaissance Europe created convincing depictions of spaces that did not exist, in what has been referred to as the "multiplying of artificial worlds".&lt;ref name="Baltrušaitis 1977"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baltrušaitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York |isbn=9780810906624 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements of virtual reality appeared as early as the 1860s. Antonin Artaud took the view that illusion was not distinct from reality, advocating that spectators at a play should suspend disbelief and regard the drama on stage as reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vrs.org.uk/virtual-reality/beginning.html | title=How did virtual reality begin? | publisher=Virtual Reality Society | access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first references to the more modern concept of virtual reality came from [[science fiction]].

=== 1950–1970 ===
[[File:Sensorama-morton-heilig-virtual-reality-headset.jpg|upright|thumb|left|The [[Sensorama]] was designed in the 1960s]]

[[Morton Heilig]] wrote in the 1950s of an "Experience Theatre" that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity. He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the [[Sensorama]] in 1962, along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch). Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a [[Machine|mechanical device]]. Heilig also developed what he referred to as the "Telesphere Mask" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device as "a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100% peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/forgotten-genius-the-man-who-made-a-working-vr-machine-in-1957-1318253/2 | title=Forgotten genius: the man who made a working VR machine in 1957 | author=Holly Brockwell | date=3 April 2016 | publisher=Tech Radar | access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, [[Douglas Engelbart]] used computer screens both as input and output devices. In 1968, [[Ivan Sutherland]], with the help of his student [[Bob Sproull]], created what was widely considered to be the first [[head-mounted display]] (HMD) system for use in immersive simulation applications. It was primitive both in terms of [[user interface]] and [[realism (arts)|realism]], and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling. The graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple [[wire-frame model]] rooms. The formidable appearance of the device inspired its name, [[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|The Sword of Damocles]].

The VR industry mainly provided VR devices for medical, flight simulation, automobile industry design, and military training purposes from 1970 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|title=National Center for Supercomputing Applications: History|publisher=The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821054144/http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|archivedate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Em became the first artist to produce navigable virtual worlds at [[NASA]]'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where he was Artist in Residence from 1977 to 1984.&lt;ref name="Creative Computing March 1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Ted|title=Report on Siggraph '81|journal=Creative Computing|date=March 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aspen Movie Map]] was created at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1978. The program was a crude virtual simulation of [[Aspen, Colorado]] in which users could wander the streets in one of the three modes: summer, winter, and polygons. 

In 1979 [[Eric Howlett]] developed the Large Expanse, Extra Perspective (LEEP) optical system. The combined system created a stereoscopic image with a field of view wide enough to create a convincing sense of space. The users of the system have been impressed by the sensation of depth [field of view] in the scene and the corresponding realism. The original LEEP system was redesigned for the NASA Ames Research Center in 1985 for their first virtual reality installation, the VIEW (Virtual Interactive Environment Workstation) by [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]]. The LEEP system provides the basis for most of the current virtual reality helmets available today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Wayne|title="Virtual Reality and Artificial Environments", A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation|date=December 2005|location=Section 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atari]] founded a research lab for virtual reality in 1982, but the lab was closed after two years due to the Atari Shock ([[North American video game crash of 1983]]). However, its hired employees, such as Tom Zimmerman, [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]], [[Jaron Lanier]], [[Michael Naimark]], and [[Brenda Laurel]], kept their research and development on VR-related technologies.

By the 1980s the term "virtual reality" was popularized by Jaron Lanier, one of the modern pioneers of the field. Lanier had founded the company [[VPL Research]] in 1985. VPL Research has developed several VR devices like the Data Glove, the EyePhone, and the Audio Sphere. VPL licensed the Data Glove technology to [[Mattel]], which used it to make an accessory known as the Power Glove. While the Power Glove was hard to use and not popular, at US$75, it was an early affordable VR device.

=== 1990–2000 ===
In 1991, [[Carolina Cruz-Neira]], [[Daniel J. Sandin]] and [[Thomas A. DeFanti]] from the [[Electronic Visualization Laboratory]] created the [[Cave automatic virtual environment|first cubic immersive room]], The Cave. Developed as Cruz-Neira's PhD thesis, it involved a multi-projected environment, similar to the [[holodeck]], allowing people to see their own bodies in relation to others in the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goad|first1=Angela|title=Carolina Cruz-Neira {{!}} Introductions Necessary|url=http://introductionsnecessary.com/2016/01/18/carolina-cruz-neira/|website=Introductions Necessary|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arkansas Online Niera"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=David|title=Engineer envisions sci-fi as reality|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2014/nov/24/engineer-envisions-sci-fi-as-reality-20/?print|accessdate=28 March 2017|work=Arkansas Online|date=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1989-1992, [[Nicole Stenger]] created ''Angels'', the first real-time interactive immersive movie. The interaction was facilitated with a [[dataglove]] and high-resolution goggles.

In 1992, [[Louis Rosenberg (entrepreneur)|Louis Rosenberg]] created the [[Virtual fixture|Virtual Fixtures]] system at the [[Armstrong Laboratory|U.S. Air Force’s Armstrong Labs]] using a [[:File:Virtual-Fixtures-USAF-AR.jpg|full upper-body exoskeleton]], enabling a physically realistic virtual reality in 3D.  The system enabled the overlay of physically real 3D virtual objects registered with a user's direct view of the real world, producing the first true [[augmented reality]] experience enabling sight, sound, and touch.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg 1992"&gt;Rosenberg, Louis (1992).

In 1999, entrepreneur [[Philip Rosedale]] formed [[Linden Lab]] with an initial focus on the development of VR hardware. In its earliest form, the company struggled to produce a commercial version of "The Rig", which was realized in prototype form as a clunky steel contraption with several computer monitors that users could wear on their shoulders. The concept was later adapted into the personal computer-based, 3D virtual world [[Second Life]].&lt;ref&gt;Au, Wagner James. ''The Making of Second Life'', pg. 19.

In 2001, SAS Cube (SAS3) became the first PC based cubic room, developed by Z-A Production ([[Maurice Benayoun]], David Nahon), Barco, and Clarté. It was installed in [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]], France. The SAS library gave birth to Virtools VRPack. 

By 2007, [[Google]] introduced [[Google Street View|Street View]], a service that shows panoramic views of an increasing number of worldwide positions such as roads, indoor buildings and rural areas. It also features a stereoscopic 3D mode, introduced in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://readwrite.com/2010/04/06/google_street_view_in_3d_here_to_stay |title=Google Street View in 3D: More Than Just an April Fool's Joke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Palmer Luckey]] designed the first prototype of the [[Oculus Rift]]. This prototype, built on a shell of another virtual reality headset, was only capable of rotational tracking. However, it boasted a 90-degree field of vision that was previously unseen in the consumer market at the time. This initial design would later serve as a basis from which the later designs came.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Peter. (2014). Oculus Rift.

{{Main article|Applications of virtual reality}}

VR is most commonly used in entertainment applications such as [[Video game|gaming]] and [[3D cinema]]. Consumer virtual reality headsets were first released by video game companies in the early-mid 1990s. Beginning in the 2010s, next-generation commercial tethered headsets were released by Oculus (Rift), HTC (Vive) and Sony (PlayStation VR), setting off a new wave of application development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data-reality.com/comparison-of-best-vr-headsets-morpheus-vs-rift-vs-vive/|title=Comparison of VR headsets: Project Morpheus vs. Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive|website=Data Reality|accessdate=15 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820001906/http://data-reality.com/comparison-of-best-vr-headsets-morpheus-vs-rift-vs-vive/|archivedate=20 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3D cinema has been used for sporting events, pornography, fine art, music videos and short films. Since 2015, roller coasters and [[theme parks]] have incorporated virtual reality to match visual effects with haptic feedback .&lt;ref name="Wired Magic Leap Apr2016" /&gt;

VR can simulate real workspaces for workplace occupational safety and health purposes, educational purposes, and training purposes. It can be used to provide learners with a virtual environment where they can develop their skills without the real-world consequences of failing.

Applications for VR are facilitated by technologies that go beyond the use of graphics and [[Virtual reality headset|headsets]]. There are a multitude of techniques, technologies, and hardware solutions to enhance the immersive experience and derive data from the users’ responses to that experience. The use of haptic clothing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teslasuit.io/|title=Teslasuit - full body haptic suit|website=Teslasuit - full body haptic VR suit|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, eye tracking technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tobiipro.com/|title=Eye tracking technology for research - Tobii Pro|date=2015-04-27|website=www.tobiipro.com|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and “Fourth Dimension” sensory stimulation are becoming especially popular and useful&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mxtreality.co.uk/help/|title=Help - MXT|website=mxtreality.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The first fine art virtual world was created in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metaplasticity in Virtual Worlds: Aesthetics and Semantic Concepts|last=Mura|first=Gianluca|publisher=Information Science Reference|year=2011|isbn=978-1-60960-077-8|location=Hershey, PA|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the technology developed, more artistic programs were produced throughout the 1990s, including feature films. When commercially available technology became more widespread, VR festivals began to emerge in the mid-2010s. The first uses of VR in museum settings began in the 1990s, seeing a significant increase in the mid-2010s. Additionally, museums have begun making some of their content virtual reality accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mw2016.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/virtual-reality-at-the-british-museum-what-is-the-value-of-virtual-reality-environments-for-learning-by-children-and-young-people-schools-and-families/|title=Virtual reality at the British Museum: What is the value of virtual reality environments for learning by children and young people, schools, and families? – MW2016: Museums and the Web 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/blogs/checklist/extending-the-museum-experience-with-virtual-reality|title=Extending the Museum Experience with Virtual Reality|date=18 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction and popular culture ==
{{Main|Virtual reality in fiction}}

There have been many works of fiction that reference and describe forms of virtual reality. 

In the 1980s and 1990s, [[cyberpunk]]s viewed the technology as a potential means for social change. The [[recreational drug]] subculture praised virtual reality not only as a new art form, but as an entirely new frontier.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultronix.eserver.org/chesher/|title=Colonizing Virtual Reality: Construction of the Discourse of Virtual Reality|last=Chesher|first=Chris|date=1994|website=|publisher=Cultronix|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304125850/http://cultronix.eserver.org/chesher/|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concerns and challenges ==
===Health and safety===
There are many health and safety considerations of virtual reality. Most virtual reality systems come with consumer warnings, including: seizures; developmental issues in children; trip-and-fall and collision warnings; discomfort; repetitive stress injury; and interference with medical devices.&lt;ref name="Oculus Rift Warnings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oculus Rift Health and Safety Notice|url=https://static.oculus.com/documents/310-30023-01_Rift_HealthSafety_English.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users may experience twitches, seizures or blackouts while using VR headsets, even if they do not have a history of epilepsy and have never had blackouts or seizures before. As many as one in 4000 people may experience these symptoms. Since these symptoms are more common among people under the age of 20, children are advised against using VR headsets. Other problems may occur in physical interactions with one's environment. While wearing VR headsets, people quickly lose awareness of their real-world surroundings and may injure themselves by tripping over, or colliding with real-world objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fagan |first1=Kaylee |title=Here's what happens to your body when you've been in virtual reality for too long |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/virtual-reality-vr-side-effects-2018-3 |accessdate=5 September 2018 |publisher=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of unwanted symptoms have been caused by prolonged use of virtual reality,&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, B. D. (2014). Motion sickness symptomatology and origins. Handbook of Virtual Environments: Design, Implementation, and Applications, 531-599.&lt;/ref&gt; and these may have slowed proliferation of the technology. For example, in 1995, Nintendo released a gaming console known as the [[Virtual Boy]]. Worn as a headpiece and connected to a typical controller, the Virtual Boy received much criticism for its negative physical effects, including "dizziness, nausea, and headaches".&lt;ref&gt;Frischling, Bill. "Sideline Play." The Washington Post (1974-Current file): 11. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Washington Post (1877-1995). October 25, 1995. Web. May 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; VR headsets may regularly cause eye fatigue, as does all screened technology, because people tend to blink less when watching screens, causing their eyes to become more dried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mukamal |first1=Reena |title=Are Virtual Reality Headsets Safe for Eyes? |url=https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/are-virtual-reality-headsets-safe-eyes |website=American Academy of Ophthalmology |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some concerns about VR headsets contributing to myopia, but although VR headsets sit close to the eyes, they may not necessarily contribute to nearsightedness if the focal length of the image being displayed is sufficiently far away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Langley |first1=Hugh |title=We need to look more carefully into the long-term effects of VR |url=https://www.wareable.com/vr/vr-long-term-brain-eyes-effects-6674 |website=Wareable.com |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virtual reality sickness]] (also known as cybersickness) occurs when a person's exposure to a virtual environment causes symptoms that are similar to [[motion sickness]] symptoms.&lt;ref name="Kiryu2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kiryu |first1=T |last2=So |first2=RH |title=Sensation of presence and cybersickness in applications of virtual reality for advanced rehabilitation |journal=Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation |date=25 September 2007 |volume=4 |pages=34 |doi=10.1186/1743-0003-4-34 |pmid=17894857 |pmc=2117018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common symptoms are general discomfort, headache, stomach awareness, nausea, vomiting, pallor, sweating, fatigue, drowsiness, disorientation, and apathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hicks |first1=Jamison S. |last2=Durbin |first2=David B. |title=ARL-TR-5573: A Summary of Simulator Sickness Ratings for U.S. Army Aviation Engineering Simulators |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a551763.pdf |publisher=US Army Research Laboratory |date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These motion sickness symptoms are caused by a disconnect between what is being seen and what the rest of the body perceives. When the vestibular system, the body's internal balancing system, does not experience the motion that it expects from visual input through the eyes, the user may experience VR sickness. This can also happen if the VR system does not have a high enough frame rate, or if there is a lag between the body's movement and the onscreen visual reaction to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Caddy |first1=Becca |title=Vomit Reality: Why VR makes some of us feel sick and how to make it stop |url=https://www.wareable.com/vr/vr-headset-motion-sickness-solution-777 |website=Wareable.com |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because approximately 25–40% of people experience some kind of VR sickness when using VR machines, companies are actively looking for ways to reduce VR sickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Samit |first1=Jay |title=A Possible Cure for Virtual Reality Motion Sickness |url=http://fortune.com/2018/02/06/virtual-reality-motion-sickness/ |website=Fortune.com |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy===
The persistent tracking required by all VR systems makes the technology particularly useful for, and vulnerable to, mass [[surveillance]]. The expansion of VR will increase the potential and reduce the costs for information gathering of personal actions, movements and responses.&lt;ref name="Wired Magic Leap Apr2016" /&gt;

===Conceptual and philosophical concerns===
In addition, there are conceptual and philosophical considerations and implications associated with the use of virtual reality. What the phrase "virtual reality" means or refers to can be ambiguous. [[Mychilo S. Cline]] argued in 2005 that through virtual reality techniques will be developed to influence human behavior, [[interpersonal communication]], and [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7OxbJWzIaVEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=power+madness+and+immortality&amp;q=|title=Power, Madness, &amp; Immortality: the Future of Virtual Reality |publisher=Virtualreality.universityvillagepress.com |accessdate=2009-10-28|author1=Cline, Mychilo Stephenson|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtualreality.universityvillagepress.com/index.php?itemid=25&amp;catid=4 |title=The Future of Virtual Reality with Mychilo Cline " Introduction to the Future of Virtual Reality |publisher=Virtualreality.universityvillagepress.com |accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power, Madness and Immortality {{!}} KurzweilAI|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/power-madness-and-immortality|website=www.kurzweilai.net|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
