'''Accidental incest''' is [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or [[marriage]] between persons who were unaware of a family relationship between them which would be considered [[incest]]uous.

The laws of many jurisdictions [[Void marriage|void incestuous marriages]], even if entered into without awareness of the kinship. If an incestuous relationship is suspected, [[DNA testing]] may be used. Some jurisdictions permit offspring of IVF donations access to donation records or to adoption records.

==Causes==
People may be unaware of a [[kinship]] relationship between them in a number of circumstances. For example, [[artificial insemination]] with an anonymous [[sperm donation|donated sperm]] may result in offspring being unaware of any biological relations, such as paternity or half siblings. To reduce the likelihood of accidental incest, fertility clinics usually limit the number of times that a donor's sperm may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9iJlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RYgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2368,2279497&amp;dq=accidental-incest |title=Accidental Incest Risk Increases |date=15 March 1979 |work=Edmonton Journal |agency=Associated Press |page=61 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=coNSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hwUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6125,3788930&amp;dq=accidental-incest |title=Report From A Test Tube Baby |last=Atallah |first=Lillian |date=19 April 1976 |work=Ocala Star-Banner |page=35 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries have laws limiting the number of children a donor can father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/30/international/europe/30sperm.html |title=Spreading Scandinavian Genes, Without Viking Boats |last=Alvarez |first=Lizette |date=30 September 2004 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others limit sperm donations based on family numbers to enable one family to have true siblings.

[[Taiwan]] allows those conceived by artificial means to find out if they are related to a person they are considering marrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/05/11/2003360370 |title=DOH working on provision to stop accidental incest |last=Oung |first=Angelica |date=11 May 2007 |work=The Taipei Times |page=2 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |location=Taiwan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accidental incest may also arise in the following situations:
* Children separated from their family at birth,
* [[Child abandonment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Angelica |first=Jade Christine |title=A Moral Emergency: Breaking the Cycle of Child Sexual Abuse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-F92TlEyr8oC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22accidental+incest%22&amp;ei=-P-HTa2tOKqO0QHR58T9DQ&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwATgK&amp;q=%22accidental%20incest%22 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sexual exploration.

==Notable cases==
*In 2008, it was reported that a British brother and sister, who were twins separated at birth, married without knowing of their relationship. According to the report, the relationship was discovered soon after their wedding, and the marriage was annulled. The case has raised the issue regarding whether adoptions should be kept secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/01/11/twins.married/?imw=Y&amp;iref=mpstoryemail |title=Unknowing twins married, lawmaker says |publisher=CNN |accessdate=23 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://culturekitchen.com/mole333/blog/accidental_incest_twins_separated_at_birth_marr |title=Accidental Incest: Twins Separated at Birth Marry |last=Sabater |first=Liza |publisher=Culture Kitchen |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have been raised, however, about whether the story is, in fact, true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Henley |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/15/familyandrelationships.jonhenley |title=Did a pair of twins really get married by mistake? |work=The Guardian |accessdate=3 April 2012 |location=London |date=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An engaged couple in South Africa, who had been together for five years and were expecting a child, discovered that they were brother and sister just before their wedding. They were raised separately and met as adults in college. Just before the wedding, their parents met and they came to realize that they were siblings. The couple broke off the relationship after the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stewart |last=Maclean |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2057081/Engaged-couple-discover-brother-sister-parents-meet-days-wedding.html |title=Engaged couple discover they are brother and sister when their parents meet just before wedding |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sevierville, Tennessee: Insight Publishing, 2010, pp. 237-248.&lt;/ref&gt; As founder of an international event production company, Extraordinary Events, Michaels and her company produce large corporate events. She is an original member of the special events industry Hall of Fame&lt;ref&gt;Baragona, Carolyn, "Spotlight Award/Hall of Fame Inductees," ''Event Solutions'' magazine, December, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and the author of a business biography,&lt;ref name=reflect&gt;&gt;Michaels, Andrea, ''Reflections of a Successful Wallflower - Lessons in Business; Lessons in Life.'' Denver: Outskirts Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and is featured in three [[anthologies]].

== Early life ==
Andrea Michaels was born in the [[Arbe concentration camp]] (today [[Rab]], [[Croatia]], on the northern shore of the [[Adriatic Sea]]) to Lelja Kauders (b. Zagreb, Yugoslavia, August 25, 1923 ‚Äì d. Los Angeles California, May 30, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Tributes.com/show/Lelja-Gerson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ben7879&gt;Wright, David, ''Yes You Can! Reaching Your Potential While Achieving Greatness - with Dr. Warren Bennis, Andrea Michaels and Jim Rohn''. Sevierville, Tennessee: Insight Publishing, 2010, pp. 77-88.&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels and her mother, along with her mother's [[Jewish]] parents, Paul (Palvo) Kauders and Elza Ackerman Kauders, escaped in a small boat across the Adriatic to Italy.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; Michaels lived in Italy to the age of four with her grandparents until her mother, who had married an American pilot, sent for her to come live in America.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; The marriage ended, and after Michaels arrived in America, her mother married Peter Gerson, who adopted Andrea and moved the family from [[Silverlake, California]], to [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; When Michaels was ten, the family moved to [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt;

An only child Michaels graduated from [[Burbank High School (Burbank, California)|Burbank High School]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.classmates.com/places/school/school/3516/m?startYear=1900&amp;endYear=9999&amp;communityId=3516&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels attended the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1961 and 1962, transferring to the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA) before marrying Bob Spritz on February 1, 1964.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; The marriage lasted ten years, and they had a son, Jon (b. July 24, 1970).&lt;ref name=reflect/&gt; After her divorce from Spritz, she changed her last name as well as that of her son's to "Michaels."&lt;ref name=reflect/&gt; Michaels returned to UCLA in 1970 and earned a degree, with honors, in [[Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;2002 Hall of Fame, NAWBOLA.org./About_Us/2002_hof.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
Instead of pursuing a career in Psychology, Michaels began working with the Ron Rubin Orchestras in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Maggie, "Spectacular Events Keep Encino Firm in Demand," Features Section, Los Angeles Times, November 23, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, she became interested in the [[event planning]] business when there was no formalized industry. She produced her first event in 1978‚Äî-a [[Anniversary|bicentennial]] celebration for Marsh McClellan Insurance Company. By 1982, the company had been restructured and renamed Michaels, Rubin and Associates.&lt;ref name=ben7879 /&gt; Michaels and Rubin dissolved their relationship in December 1988, and on that same day, Extraordinary Events was launched.&lt;ref&gt;"Coffee With Andrea Michaels - Meetings And Conventions".

{{redirect|Special report|the television program with the same name|Special Report (Fox News program)|other uses|Breaking news (disambiguation)}}
'''Breaking news''', interchangeably termed '''late-breaking news''' and also known as a '''special report''' or '''special coverage''' or '''news bulletin''', is a [[news|current issue]] that broadcasters feel warrants the interruption of scheduled programming and/or current news in order to report its details. Its use is also assigned to the most significant story of the moment or a story that is being covered live. It could be a story that is simply of wide interest to viewers and has little impact otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Always Free Online|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/breaking-news|author=Christopher Merrill|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|date=January 20, 2014|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Breaking News ‚Äì  Journalism Terms|url=http://journalism.about.com/od/journalismglossary/g/breakingnews.htm|publisher=Journalism.about.com|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many times, breaking news is used after the news organization has already reported on the story. When a story has not been reported on previously, the graphic and phrase "Just In" is sometimes used instead.

==Formats==
===Television===
The format of a ''special report'' or ''breaking news'' event on television commonly consists of the current non-news programming (or, in some cases, regularly scheduled newscasts) suddenly switching to a reverse countdown, usually from 5 seconds, to allow any [[Network affiliate|affiliated stations]] to switch to the network news feed (television stations typically do not provide these countdowns for local coverage, normally leading with a graphic and/or voiceover announcing the cut-in). If a national network newscast is in progress when the breaking news event occurs, the newscast will pause temporarily to allow other network affiliates to join the network news feed.
There is then an opening graphic, featuring music (such as [[NBC]]'s "[[The Mission (theme music)|The Pulse of Events]]", composed by [[John Williams]]) which adds an emphasis on the importance of the event. This is usually followed by the introduction of a [[news anchor]], who welcomes the viewer to the broadcast and introduces the story at hand. [[Lower thirds]] and other graphics may also be altered to convey a sense of urgency. 

Once the story is introduced, the network or local station may, if possible, choose to continue to show a live shot of the anchor or may cut away to video or images of the story that is being followed during the broadcast. Additionally, the coverage may be passed to a [[reporter]] at the location of the breaking event, possibly sharing more information about the story as it breaks.

Depending upon the story being followed, the report may last only a few minutes, or continue for multiple hours ‚Äì or with the longest uninterrupted news events, four days ‚Äì at a time (events in which the latter instances has occurred include the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] and the [[September 11 attacks]], which took place between November 22‚Äì26, 1963 and September 11‚Äì15, 2001, respectively). If coverage continues for an extended amount of time, the network may integrate analysis about the story through analysts in-studio, via phone, [[communications satellite|satellite]], [[broadband]] (B-GAN) or through other means of communication. Depending on the severity of the event, regular [[television commercial|commercial advertising]] may be completely suspended for sustained coverage, and network affiliates will be required to insert their [[station identification]] in at the top of the hour overlaid during the report rather than through the usual means of a station imaging promo or program reminder. 

If a story occurs during the [[Dayparting|Early Fringe]] timeslot and depending on the magnitude of the events at hand, local stations might be given the opportunity to break away from the network feed and begin their evening newscasts. This is set up by a cue from the network's talent that they will pause for a few seconds to reset coverage, at which point an opening graphic may be rolled again. Information is also disseminated from an internal alert service utilized by a station's [[master control]]. After the local newscast, stations will likely return to the network's feed as they normally would for the nightly news, but they may be joining in on an "extended edition". Whether or not a station will take over for local news is usually the choice of that station's [[news director]].

When the coverage comes to a close, the network or station may either resume programming that was occurring prior to the event or begin new programming (if the breaking news occurs during a newscast the network will switch back to the newscast upon completion if time permits), depending upon the amount of time spent on the coverage. The anchor will usually remind viewers to check the network's website (or that of the station, if coverage is provided locally), or watch any [[United States cable news|cable news]] channels that may be co-owned with the network for more information. If the story breaks during daytime programming, the anchor will usually remind viewers that there will be or might be more details on their local news that day and a full wrap-up on the network's evening news program. Usually, regular daytime programming is re-joined in progress and segments may be missed.

If the event occurs during [[prime time]], the anchor will usually remind viewers that there will be more details on their late local newscast and on the network's [[breakfast television|overnight news program]] (if applicable) the next morning. Programming at this time is either joined in progress or started back up at the point of the interruption, depending on whether the program is new to air, highly rated or has time left in its time slot to finish airing (for instance, [[ABC News (United States)|ABC]]'s breaking news report involving the April 2017 [[2017 Shayrat missile strike|Shayrat missile strike]] took into account a new episode of the popular series ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'', where the show was resumed right at the point of interruption twice for those reports; [[NBC]]'s coverage featured the low-rated ''[[The Blacklist: Redemption]]'' joined in the middle of an episode in progress after their special report without any of that consideration). In either of the above instances, network (and in some cases, for local stations, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]]) programs that have segments not aired or are pre-empted in their entirety by breaking news reports ‚Äì particularly those that extend to or longer than 20 or 45 minutes, depending on the length of the previously scheduled program ‚Äì may have to be rescheduled to air at a later time. 

Some events, like [[State of the Union address]]es and [[United States presidential debates|presidential debates]], are scheduled to start at the top of the hour during prime time. Under those circumstances, regularly scheduled network programming is preempted for the entire duration of the event. If there is sufficient time (generally 60 minutes or more) remaining in prime time, the network may broadcast its next regularly scheduled program in its entirety or join regularly scheduled programming in progress. However, if there is insufficient time remaining for any prime-time programs, the special report will continue until the network affiliates begin airing their late local newscasts.

In the United States, on days when [[United States presidential elections|presidential elections]] take place, regularly scheduled prime-time programming is suspended so that networks can air up-to-the-minute coverage of the elections. Likewise, regularly scheduled daytime programs are suspended during coverage of [[United States presidential inaugurations|presidential inaugurations]]. However, during those types of events, regular commercial advertising is shown. Similar procedures are enacted for elections or political inaugurations that take place in other countries.

===Radio===
On radio, the process of a breaking news story is somewhat the same, though some different considerations are made for the medium. For instance, a breaking news theme is required by default to have an urgent tenor and be used only for the purpose of true breaking news or bulletins. This is obvious on the local [[all-news radio]] stations owned by [[Entercom]] (formerly owned by [[CBS Radio]]), which very rarely use a breaking news theme for all but the most urgent and dire of breaking news, and is purposefully structured to give a sense of attention for the listener, almost sounding like an alarm. For local events, continuous coverage may be imposed, or else the station may wait until they have a reporter at the scene and will promise more details of the event as they become available.

National news that is broadcast over a [[radio network]] requires constant monitoring by station employees to allow the network coverage to air, although many stations will take the 'urgent' signal sent by the network and break into programming immediately. Again, continuous coverage from a national radio network depends on the severity of the event, and often the network may just pass down the coverage by their local affiliate with spare commentary by the network's anchors.

Other considerations are made also; FM music stations rarely relay breaking news unless it is an event of grave national concern, though local weather warnings are relayed when in effect (either in the form of updates provided by an on-staff anchor or [[disc jockey]], an emergency alert system or through an audio simulcast of a television station which maintains a contractual partnership with a radio outlet). Less urgent events allow a network to feed updates to stations at 20, 30 and 50 minutes after the hour to give a summary of events. Stations are also careful about what stories are relayed during play-by-play broadcasts of professional and college sports, as those are the programs most listened to on radio, so breaking news coverage is limited to only commercial breaks.

==Usage==
News bulletins have been a fixture of radio broadcasting since at least the 1920s. Examples of early news bulletins in the [[Golden Age of Radio]] include fictionalized versions in the 1938 radio drama ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and coverage of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], which was also the first television news bulletin, reported on stations in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. [[KTLA]] in Los Angeles is credited with being the first television station to provide extended coverage of a breaking news event: for 27¬Ω hours from April 8 to 9, 1949, the station carried live coverage of an attempt to rescue three-year-old [[Kathy Fiscus]], who had fallen down an abandoned well in [[San Marino, California]], where she ultimately perished due to [[asphyxia]] from a lack of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Kathy Fiscus Story: Turning Point in TV News|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-kathy-fiscus-story-19890408-story.html|author=[[Stan Chambers]]|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 8, 1989|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los Angeles Television News Pioneer Stan Chambers Dies at 91|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/los-angeles-television-news-pioneer-stan-chambers-dies-28953145|website=[[ABC News]]|date=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades before 24-hour news networks such as [[CNN]] began to exist, programming interruptions were restricted to extremely urgent news, such as the death of an important political figure. For example, one of the earliest such interruptions that modern viewers would recognize as "breaking news" coverage was for the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, (with [[CBS News]] anchorman [[Walter Cronkite]]'s [[Walter Cronkite#Kennedy assassination|coverage]] being especially noted), and as such reflected the relatively crude technology and procedures of that era. Such breaks are now common at 24-hour [[news channel]]s, which may have an anchor available for live interruption at any time. Some networks, such as [[Sky News]], largely emphasize this, even advertising the station/network as being "''first for breaking news''".

Another type of breaking news is that of [[severe weather]] events, which had such coverage evolve in a very similar manner. In [[North America]] until the 1990s, television and radio stations normally only provided long-form weather coverage during immediate, ongoing threats (such as a [[tornado]] that has been confirmed visually or by [[Doppler weather radar|radar]] to be producing damage or a landfalling [[hurricane]]); cut-ins and, in the case of television stations, [[news ticker|alert crawls]] during regular programming were used otherwise, even when higher-end alerts such as [[tornado warning]]s were issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The History (and Future) of Tornado Warning Dissemination in the United States|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2010BAMS3062.1|author=Timothy A. Coleman|author2=Kevin R. Knupp|author3=[[James Spann]]|author4=J. B. Elliot|author5=Brian E. Peters|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|format=[[PDF]]|date=May 2011 |doi=10.1175/2010BAMS3062.1 |volume=92 |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |pages=567‚Äì582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancements in newsgathering and weather technology (including the deployment of [[helicopter]]s to provide aerial coverage and radar systems that can detect specific storm attributes), coupled with a few highly life-threatening events during the 1990s (such as [[Hurricane Andrew]] and the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]]) and the resulting heightened urgency to advise those in the storm's path to take safety precautions in advance made extended (or "wall-to-wall") weather coverage once a high-end alert is issued more common in storm-prone areas, with cut-ins only being used in weather events of lesser severity.

In various countries and at various news outlets, terms such as "(late)breaking", "urgent", "flash", "bulletin", and "alert" may accompany breaking news reports. The term ''breaking news'' has come to replace the older use of ''news bulletin'', with the latter term relegated to only the most extraordinary of events. There has been widespread use of ''breaking news'' at the local level, particularly when one station in a [[media market|market]] wants to emphasize the exclusivity of coverage. Not all viewers agree that stories assigned as ''breaking news'' rise to the significance or level of interest that warrant such a designation.

American network news divisions still use the term ''special report'' for either a breaking news,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Check Out Latest Breaking News Headlines|url=http://www.mid-day.com/news|publisher=[[Mid Day]]|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a developing news story or both, but tend to use the term ''breaking news'' on their [[Breakfast television|morning]] and evening news programs. Most local stations across the United States that interrupt regular programming for a news story use the ''breaking news'' and ''special report'' terms (though, local broadcast news outlets use the former most often), with a voice-over stating either "This is a breaking news special report" or "This is a special breaking news report" or "This is a(n) (network name) News Special Report" or "This is a(n) (station brand name) breaking news (special) report" or "(From [station brand name],) this is breaking news." The breaking news ending has a past-tense variation, followed by a disclaimer for viewers who would like more information to see the network's news division website.

However, "special report" has also been de-emphasized by cable news channels in the United States, as both Fox News Channel and CNN now use that phrase for regular programming; Fox News carries ''[[Special Report with Bret Baier]]'', a daily political affairs program, while CNN's ''Special Report'' is a catch-all banner for CNN's library documentary and [[true crime]] programming.

==Criticism==
In early coverage of a breaking story, details are commonly sketchy, usually due to the limited information that is available at the time. For example, during the [[Sago Mine disaster]], there were initial reports that all twelve miners were found alive, but news organizations later learned that only one actually survived.

Often it is considered important to be quick with news bulletins also for less important news. Such news might not be updated later, even if it was found that information was wrong or severely incomplete. If someone (e.g. when editing Wikipedia) later wants to research the event, only incomplete information might be found.

[[File:MSNBC 12-28-17 breaking news.jpg|right|thumb|An example of "breaking news" with no new developments, seen in a screenshot of [[MSNBC]]'s [[The 11th Hour (news program)|''The 11th Hour'']], on December 28, 2017 describing events from August 2017 during the [[2017‚Äì18 North Korea crisis]].]]

Another criticism has been the diluting of the importance of "breaking news" by the need of [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour news channels]] to fill time, applying the title to [[soft news]] stories of questionable importance and urgency (for example, [[car chase]]s). Others question as to whether the use of the term is excessive, citing occasions when the term is used even though scheduled programming is not interrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Is Breaking News‚Ä¶ Not?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|url=http://www.insidethecbc.com/breakingnot|work=InsideTheCBC.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208101055/http://insidethecbc.com/breakingnot|archivedate=2008-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some programs, such as [[HLN (TV network)|HLN]]'s defunct ''[[Nancy Grace (TV series)|Nancy Grace]]'', used the term for recurring coverage of events which occurred months before, even when [[criminal trial]] coverage which may deserve the breaking news tag was not occurring and no new information has developed.

In June 2013, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WDRB]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]] gained notice in the television industry for a [[promo (media)|promo]] that criticized the broad and constant use of the "breaking news" term, explaining that it has been overused as a "marketing ploy" by other news-producing stations, who tend to apply the term to stories that are low in urgency and/or relevance. To coincide with the promo, on its website, WDRB posted "Contracts" with its viewers and advertisers, with the former list promising to use "breaking news" judiciously (applying it to stories that are "both 'breaking' and 'news'").&lt;ref name=TVSpy06042013&gt;{{cite news|title=Louisville Station Stops Using 'Breaking News'|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvspy/louisville-station-stops-using-breaking-news_b92526|work=[[AdWeek|TVSpy]]|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Carbon monoxide poisoning''' typically occurs from [[inhalation|breathing]] in [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) at excessive levels.&lt;ref name=Sc2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schottke|first1=David|title=Emergency Medical Responder: Your First Response in Emergency Care|date=2016|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1284107272|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGCHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910171934/https://books.google.com/books?id=gGCHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms are often described as "[[flu]]-like" and commonly include [[headache]], [[dizziness]], weakness, vomiting, [[chest pain]], and [[confusion]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt; Large exposures can result in [[loss of consciousness]], [[arrhythmias]], [[seizures]], or death.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; The classically described "cherry red skin" rarely occurs.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; Long term complications may include feeling tired, trouble with memory, and movement problems.&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; In those [[smoke inhalation|exposed to smoke]], [[cyanide toxicity]] should also be considered.&lt;ref name=Gu2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=JA|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning.|journal=Critical care clinics|date=October 2012|volume=28|issue=4|pages=537‚Äì48|pmid=22998990|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2012.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur accidentally or as an [[suicide|attempt to end one's life]].&lt;ref name=Buck2011/&gt; CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating.&lt;ref name=Bl2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bleecker|first1=ML|title=Carbon monoxide intoxication|journal=Handbook of clinical neurology|date=2015|volume=131|pages=191‚Äì203|pmid=26563790|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-62627-1.00024-X|series=Handbook of Clinical Neurology|isbn=978-0444626271}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced during [[incomplete combustion|incomplete burning]] of [[organic matter]].&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; This can occur from [[motor vehicles]], heaters, or cooking equipment that run on [[carbon-based fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt; It can also occur from exposure to [[methylene chloride]].&lt;ref name=Fer2017/&gt; Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with [[hemoglobin]] to form [[carboxyhemoglobin]] (HbCO) preventing the [[blood]] from carrying [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; Additionally, [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondria]]l [[cytochrome oxidase]] are affected.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; Diagnosis is based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;

One classic sign of carbon monoxide poisoning is more often seen in the dead rather than the living ‚Äì people have been described as looking red-cheeked and healthy (see below). However, since this "cherry-red" appearance is common only in the deceased, and is unusual in living people, it is not considered a useful diagnostic sign in clinical medicine. In pathological (autopsy) examination the ruddy appearance of carbon monoxide poisoning is notable because unembalmed dead persons are normally bluish and pale, whereas dead carbon-monoxide poisoned persons may simply appear unusually lifelike in coloration.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Simini B|title=Cherry-red discolouration in carbon monoxide poisoning |journal=Lancet| volume=352|issue=9134| page=1154|date=October 1998|pmid=9798630|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)79807-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JEmergMed2002-brooks"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brooks DE, Lin E, Ahktar J |title=What is cherry red, and who cares?|journal= [[The Journal of Emergency Medicine]] |date=February 2002|pages=213‚Äì14|volume=22|issue=2|pmid=11858933|doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(01)00469-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colorant effect of carbon monoxide in such postmortem circumstances is thus analogous to its use as a red colorant in the commercial meat-packing industry.

Carbon monoxide is a product of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete [[oxidation]] to [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty [[furnace]]s, heaters, [[wood-burning stove]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/man-died-from-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-after-using-heat-beads-in-greystanes-home-20150718-gif8d8.html|title=Man died from carbon monoxide poisoning after using 'heat beads' in Greystanes home|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719131747/http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/man-died-from-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-after-using-heat-beads-in-greystanes-home-20150718-gif8d8.html|archivedate=2015-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[internal combustion]] [[vehicle exhaust]], [[electrical generator]]s, [[propane]]-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as [[leaf blower]]s, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Occup Med1999-fawcett"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Marc B, Bouchez-Buvry A, Wepierre JL, Boniol L, Vaquero P, Garnier M |title=Carbon-monoxide poisoning in young drug addicts due to indoor use of a gasoline-powered generator|journal=Journal of Clinical Forensic Medicine|volume=8|issue=2|pages=54‚Äì56|date=June 2001|pmid=16083675|doi=10.1054/jcfm.2001.0474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson C, Moran J, Paine S, Anderson H, Breysse P |title=Abatement of toxic levels of carbon monoxide in Seattle ice-skating rinks|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=65|issue=10|pages=1087‚Äì90|date=October 1975|pmid=1163706|doi=10.2105/AJPH.65.10.1087|pmc=1776025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/co/|title=NIOSH Carbon Monoxide Hazards from Small Gasoline Powered Engines|accessdate=2007-10-15|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029032750/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/co/|archivedate=2007-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fife CE, Smith LA, Maus EA, McCarthy JJ, Koehler MZ, Hawkins T, Hampson NB |title=Dying to play video games: carbon monoxide poisoning from electrical generators used after hurricane Ike |journal=Pediatrics |volume=123 |issue=6 |pages=e1035‚Äì38 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19482736 |doi=10.1542/peds.2008-3273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=Emmerich, SJ|date=July 2011|title=Measured CO Concentrations at NIST IAQ Test House from Operation of Portable Electric Generators in Attached Garage ‚Äì Interim Report|url=https://www.nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id=907771|publisher=United States National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=2012-04-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224044200/http://nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id=907771|archivedate=2013-02-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;

Another source of poisoning is exposure to the organic solvent [[dichloromethane]], found in some [[paint stripper]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Veen|first=MP|author2=Fortezza F |author3=Spaans E |author4=Mensinga TT |title=Non-professional paint stripping, model prediction and experimental validation of indoor dichloromethane levels|journal=Indoor Air|year=2002|volume=12|issue=2|pages=92‚Äì97|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0668.2002.01109.x|pmid=12216472}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the metabolism of dichloromethane produces carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name="DrugMetabDispos1975-kubic"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kubic VL, Anders MW |title=Metabolism of dihalomethanes to carbon monoxide.

== Pathophysiology ==

The precise mechanisms by which the effects of carbon monoxide are induced upon bodily systems, are complex and not yet fully understood.&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt; Known mechanisms include carbon monoxide binding to [[hemoglobin]], [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome oxidase]] and restricting oxygen supply, and carbon monoxide causing [[brain]] [[lipid peroxidation]].&lt;ref name="Weaver-NEJM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bateman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bateman DN|title=Carbon Monoxide|journal=Medicine|volume=31|issue=10|page=233|date=October 2003|doi=10.1383/medc.31.10.41.27810}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"/&gt;

=== Hemoglobin ===
[[File:Hemoglobin saturation curve.svg|thumb|Carbon monoxide shifts the oxygen-dissociation curve to the left.]]
Carbon monoxide has a higher diffusion coefficient compared to oxygen, and the only enzyme in the human body that produces carbon monoxide is [[heme oxygenase]], which is located in all cells and breaks down [[heme]]. Under normal conditions, carbon monoxide levels in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] are approximately 0 [[Millimeter of mercury|mmHg]] because it has a higher diffusion coefficient and the body easily gets rid of any CO made.&lt;ref name="Kaplan.Physio"&gt;{{cite book|title=USMLE Step 1 Lecture Notes: Physiology|year=2011|author=Dunn, Robert B.|author2=Kudrath, W. |author3=Passo, SS |author4=Wilson, LB|pages=167‚Äì68|chapter=7-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When CO is not ventilated it binds to hemoglobin, which is the principal oxygen-carrying compound in blood; this produces a compound known as [[carboxyhemoglobin]]. The traditional belief is that carbon monoxide toxicity arises from the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and inhibits the transport, delivery, and utilization of oxygen by the body. The affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately 230 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen so hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Townsend CL, Maynard RL |title=Effects on health of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=59|issue=10|pages=708‚Äì11|date=October 2002|pmid=12356933|pmc=1740215|doi=10.1136/oem.59.10.708|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPhysiol1895-Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Haldane J|title=The action of carbonic oxide on man|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1895|pages=430‚Äì62|volume=18|url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf|pmid=16992272|issue=5‚Äì6|pmc=1514663|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1895.sp000578|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708152937/http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemoglobin is a [[Tetrameric protein|tetramer]] with four oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon monoxide at one of these sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue.&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gorman D, Drewry A, Huang YL, Sames C |title=The clinical toxicology of carbon monoxide|journal=Toxicology|date=May 2003|pages=25‚Äì38|volume=187|issue=1|pmid=12679050|doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(03)00005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the [[oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve|oxygen dissociation curve]] to the left.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt; Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.

=== Myoglobin ===

Carbon monoxide also binds to the [[hemeprotein]] [[myoglobin]]. It has a high affinity for myoglobin, about 60 times greater than that of oxygen.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt; This causes reduced [[cardiac output]] and [[hypotension]], which may result in [[brain ischemia]].&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.&lt;ref name=Toxicology2002/&gt;

=== Cytochrome oxidase ===

Another mechanism involves effects on the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain that is responsible for effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to [[cytochrome oxidase]] with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gorman DF, Runciman WB |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning |journal=Anaesthesia and Intensive Care |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=506‚Äì11 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1750629 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient [[adenosine triphosphate]] synthesis. Cells respond by switching to [[anaerobic metabolism]], causing [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]], [[lactic acidosis]], and eventual cell death.&lt;ref name="PharmacolToxicol2003-alonso"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso JR, Cardellach F, Lopez S, Casademont J, Miro O |title=Carbon monoxide specifically inhibits cytochrome c oxidase of human mitochondrial respiratory chain|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology|date=September 2003|pages=142‚Äì46|volume=93|issue=3|pmid=12969439|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0773.2003.930306.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of [[oxidative metabolism]].&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt;

=== Central nervous system effects ===

The mechanism that is thought to have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain [[lipid peroxidation]] (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes [[endothelial]] cell and platelet release of [[nitric oxide]], and the formation of [[oxygen free radicals]] including [[peroxynitrite]].&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt; In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, [[capillary]] leakage, [[leukocyte]] sequestration, and [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="JRSocMed2001-blumenthal"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blumenthal I|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=June 2001|pages=270‚Äì72|volume=94|issue=6|pmid=11387414|url=http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11387414|format=Free full text|pmc=1281520|doi=10.1177/014107680109400604}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of these effects is [[lipid peroxidation]], which causes delayed reversible [[Demyelinating disease|demyelinization]] of [[white matter]] in the central nervous system known as [[Grinker myelinopathy]], which can lead to [[edema]] and [[necrosis]] within the brain.&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"/&gt; This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to the cerebral [[white matter]] and [[basal ganglia]].&lt;ref name="JRSocMed2001-blumenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fan HC, Wang AC, Lo CP, Chang KP, Chen SJ |title=Damage of cerebellar white matter due to carbon monoxide poisoning: a case report|journal=[[The American Journal of Emergency Medicine]]|volume=27|issue=6|pages=757.e5‚Äìe7|date=July 2009|pmid=19751650|doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2008.10.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, [[globus pallidus]], [[cerebellum]], [[hippocampus]] and the [[cerebral cortex]].&lt;ref name="Prockop"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Prockop LD, Chichkova RI |title=Carbon monoxide intoxication: an updated review|journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences|date=Nov 2007|pages=122‚Äì30|volume=262|issue=1‚Äì2|pmid=17720201|doi=10.1016/j.jns.2007.06.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fukuhara M, Abe I, Matsumura K, Kaseda S, Yamashita Y, Shida K, Kawashima H, Fujishima M |title=Circadian variations of blood pressure in patients with sequelae of carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=American Journal of Hypertension |volume=9|issue=4 Part 1|pages=300‚Äì05|date=April 1996|pmid=8722431|doi=10.1016/0895-7061(95)00342-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pregnancy ===

Carbon monoxide poisoning in pregnant women may cause severe adverse [[fetus|fetal]] effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] by decreasing the release of maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the [[placenta]] and combines with [[fetal hemoglobin]], causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult.&lt;ref name=Toxicology2002/&gt; Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical.&lt;ref name="Greingor"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Greingor JL, Tosi JM, Ruhlmann S, Aussedat M |title=Acute carbon monoxide intoxication during pregnancy.

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Co monitor.JPG|thumb|Finger tip [[carboxyhemoglobin]] saturation monitor (SpCO%). Note: This is not the same as a pulse oximeter (SpO2%), although some models (such as this one) do measure both the oxygen and carbon monoxide saturation.]]
[[File:Breath CO Monitor.jpg|thumb|Breath CO monitor displaying carbon monoxide concentration of an exhaled breath sample (in ppm) with its corresponding percent concentration of carboxyhemoglobin.]]
As many symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult.&lt;ref name="Varon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bennetto L, Powter L, Scolding NJ |title=Accidental carbon monoxide poisoning presenting without a history of exposure: A case report|journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports|volume=2|issue=1|page=118|date=April 2008|pmid=18430228|doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-118|pmc=2390579}}&lt;/ref&gt; A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of [[carboxyhemoglobin]] compared to the amount of [[hemoglobin]] in the blood.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;

The ratio of carboxyhemoglobin to hemoglobin molecules in an average person may be up to 5%, although cigarette smokers who smoke two packs per day may have levels up to 9%.&lt;ref name="Clinical Toxicology2001-ford"&gt;{{cite book|veditors=Ford MD, Delaney KA, Ling LJ, Erickson T |title=Clinical Toxicology|year=2001|page=1046|publisher=WB Saunders Company|isbn=0721654851}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symptomatic poisoned people they are often in the 10‚Äì30% range, while persons who die may have postmortem blood levels of 30‚Äì90%.&lt;ref&gt;Sato K, Tamaki K, Hattori H, et al.

Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 237‚Äì41.&lt;/ref&gt;

As people may continue to experience significant symptoms of CO poisoning long after their blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration has returned to normal, presenting to examination with a normal carboxyhemoglobin level (which may happen in late states of poisoning) does not rule out poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kele≈ü A, Demircan A, Kurtoƒülu G |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning: how many patients do we miss?|journal=European Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=15|issue=3|pages=154‚Äì57|date=June 2008|pmid=18460956|doi=10.1097/MEJ.0b013e3282efd519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring===
Carbon monoxide may be quantitated in blood using [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometric]] methods or [[chromatography|chromatographic techniques]] in order to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in a person or to assist in the forensic investigation of a case of fatal exposure.

The United States [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] has stated, "carbon monoxide detectors are as important to home safety as smoke detectors are," and recommends each home have at least one carbon monoxide detector, and preferably one on each level of the building.&lt;ref name="cpsc.gov"/&gt; These devices, which are relatively inexpensive&lt;ref name="Krenzelok EP"/&gt; and widely available, are either battery- or AC-powered, with or without battery backup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipinski|first=Edward R|title=Keeping Watch on Carbon Monoxide|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 14, 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/nyregion/home-clinic-keeping-watch-on-carbon-monoxide.html|accessdate=2009-09-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623100533/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/nyregion/home-clinic-keeping-watch-on-carbon-monoxide.html|archivedate=June 23, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In buildings, carbon monoxide detectors are usually installed around heaters and other equipment. If a relatively high level of carbon monoxide is detected, the device sounds an alarm, giving people the chance to evacuate and ventilate the building.&lt;ref name="Krenzelok EP"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krenzelok EP, Roth R, Full R |title=Carbon monoxide ... the silent killer with an audible solution |journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine |date=September 1996 |pages=484‚Äì86 |volume=14 |issue=5 |pmid=8765117 |doi=10.1016/S0735-6757(96)90159-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yoon SS, Macdonald SC, Parrish RG |title=Deaths from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning and potential for prevention with carbon monoxide detectors |journal=JAMA |date=March 1998 |pages=685‚Äì87 |volume=279 |issue=9 |pmid=9496987 |doi=10.1001/jama.279.9.685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[smoke detector]]s, carbon monoxide detectors do not need to be placed near ceiling level.

The use of carbon monoxide detectors has been standardized in many areas. In the US, NFPA 720-2009,&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=NFPA 720: Standard for the Installation of Carbon Monoxide (CO) Detection and Warning Equipment|publisher=National Fire Protection Agency|location=Quincy, MA|year=2009|pages=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the carbon monoxide detector guidelines published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]], mandates the placement of carbon monoxide detectors/alarms on every level of the residence, including the basement, in addition to outside sleeping areas. In new homes, AC-powered detectors must have battery backup and be interconnected to ensure early warning of occupants at all levels.&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"/&gt; NFPA 720-2009 is the first national carbon monoxide standard to address devices in non-residential buildings. These guidelines, which now pertain to schools, healthcare centers, nursing homes and other non-residential buildings, include three main points:&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"/&gt;
:1. A secondary power supply (battery backup) must operate all carbon monoxide notification appliances for at least 12 hours,
:2. Detectors must be on the ceiling in the same room as permanently installed fuel-burning appliances, and
:3. Detectors must be located on every habitable level and in every [[HVAC]] zone of the building.

Gas organizations will often recommend to get gas appliances serviced at least once a year.&lt;ref name="Gas Safe Register (UK Government Organization)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gas Safety in the Home |publisher=UK Gas Safe Register |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url=http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/being_gas_safe.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502012946/http://gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/being_gas_safe.aspx |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal requirements ===

The NFPA standard is not necessarily enforced by law. As of April 2006, the US state of Massachusetts requires detectors to be present in all residences with potential CO sources, regardless of building age and whether they are owner-occupied or rented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter148/Section26F1~2|title=MGL Ch. 148 ¬ß28F{{frac|1|2}} ‚Äì Nicole's Law, effective March 31, 2006|work=malegislature.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230154311/http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter148/Section26F1~2|archivedate=December 30, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is enforced by municipal inspectors, and was inspired by the death of 7-year-old Nicole Garofalo in 2005 due to snow blocking a home heating vent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/subject/about/carbonmonoxide.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305145343/http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/subject/about/carbonmonoxide.html |archivedate=2013-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurisdictions may have no requirement or only mandate detectors for new construction or at time of sale.

Despite similar deaths in vehicles with clogged exhaust pipes (for example in the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978]] and [[February 2013 nor'easter]]) and the commercial availability of the equipment, there is no legal requirement for automotive CO detectors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===World Health Organization recommendations===
The following guideline values (ppm values rounded) and periods of time-weighted average exposures have been determined in such a way that the carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) level of 2.5% is not exceeded, even when a normal subject engages in light or moderate exercise:
* 100&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (87 ppm) for 15 min
* 60&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (52 ppm) for 30 min
* 30&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (26 ppm) for 1 h
* 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (9 ppm) for 8 h

For indoor air quality 7&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (6 ppm) for 24 h (so as not to exceed 2% COHb for chronic exposure)

==History==
&lt;!-- Editors are strongly requested NOT to change the title of this paragraph until consensus has been achieved on the talk page. --&gt;

The earliest description of carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt; Documented cases of carbon monoxide being used as a [[Suicide methods#Carbon monoxide|method of suicide]] date to at least 100 BC in [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref name=Pen2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penney|first1=David G.|title=Carbon Monoxide Poisoning|date=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0849384189|page=754|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA754|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910172025/https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA754|archivedate=2017-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work ''Misopogon'': "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside."&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''Misopogon'' 341C-D&lt;/ref&gt; This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]].

[[John Scott Haldane]] identified carbon monoxide as the lethal constituent of [[afterdamp]], the gas created by [[combustion]], after examining many bodies of miners killed in pit explosions. Their skin was coloured cherry-pink from [[carboxyhaemoglobin]], the stable compound formed in the blood by reaction with the gas. As a result of his research, he was able to design respirators for rescue workers. He tested the effect of carbon monoxide on his own body in a closed chamber, describing the results of his slow poisoning. In the late 1890s, he introduced the use of small animals for miners to detect dangerous levels of carbon monoxide underground, either white mice or canaries. With a faster metabolism, they showed the effects of poisoning before gas levels became critical for the workers, and so gave an early warning of the problem. The [[canary in a coal mine|canary]] in British pits was replaced in 1986 by the electronic gas detector.

As part of the [[Holocaust]] during [[World War II]], German [[Nazi]]s used [[gas van]]s at [[Chelmno extermination camp]] and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in the gas chambers of several [[extermination camp|death camps]] such as [[Treblinka]], [[Sobibor]] and [[Belzec]]. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in [[action T4]], the programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and [[disabled people]] before the war started in earnest. The gas was supplied by [[IG Farben]] in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the gas chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre]]. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger numbers of people in the gas vans and the special [[gas chamber]]s used in the [[death camp]]s such as [[Treblinka]]. [[Exhaust fumes]] from tank engines for example, were used to supply the gas to the chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Genocide|vauthors=Totten S, Bartrop P, Markusen E|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood|pages=129, 156|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rgGA91skoP4C&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=nazi%20carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526000146/http://books.google.com/books?id=rgGA91skoP4C&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;ots=S8jhBY6NxB&amp;dq=nazi%20carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;f=false|archivedate=2013-05-26|df=|isbn=978-0313346422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of oxygen as treatment began in 1868.&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt; The use of hyperbaric oxygen in rats following poisoning was studied by Haldane in 1895 while its use in humans began in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt;

==Research==
Carbon monoxide is produced naturally by the body as a byproduct of converting [[protoporphyrin]] into [[bilirubin]]. This carbon monoxide also combines with hemoglobin to make carboxyhemoglobin, but not at toxic levels.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;

Small amounts of CO are beneficial and enzymes exist that produce it at times of oxidative stress. Drugs are being developed to introduce small amounts of CO during certain kinds of surgery, these drugs are called [[carbon monoxide-releasing molecules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foresti|first1=R|last2=Bani-Hani|first2=MG|last3=Motterlini|first3=R|title=Use of carbon monoxide as a therapeutic agent: promises and challenges.|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|date=April 2008|volume=34|issue=4|pages=649‚Äì58|pmid=18286265|doi=10.1007/s00134-008-1011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent raid on the aircraft by [[Egypt]]ian troops resulted in dozens of deaths, making the hijacking of Flight 648 one of the deadliest such incidents in history. 

==Hijacking==
On 23 November 1985, Flight 648 took off at 8pm on its [[Athens]]-to-[[Cairo]] route. Ten minutes after takeoff, three [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] members of Abu Nidal hijacked the aircraft. The [[Palestinian political violence|terrorists]], calling themselves the Egypt Revolution, were heavily armed with guns and [[grenade]]s.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} The terrorist leader, [[Omar Rezaq]], proceeded to check all [[passport]]s. At this point, an Egyptian Security Service agent, Mustafa Kamal,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newdominion.com/2012/03/03/interpol-investigates-terror-in-the-skies.html Interpol Investigates ‚Äì Terror in the Skies&lt;/ref&gt; aboard opened fire, killing one terrorist before being wounded along with two flight attendants. In the exchange of fire the [[fuselage]] was punctured, causing a rapid depressurization. The aircraft was forced to descend to {{convert|14000|ft|m}} to allow the crew and passengers to breathe.

[[Libya]] was the original destination for the hijackers, but due to negative publicity the hijacking would have had if flown to Libya and the fact that the plane did not have enough fuel, [[Malta]] was chosen as a more suitable option. The aircraft was running dangerously low on fuel, experiencing serious pressurization problems and carrying a number of wounded passengers. However, Maltese authorities did not give permission for the aircraft to land; the Maltese government had previously refused permission to other hijacked aircraft, including on 23 September 1982 when an [[Alitalia]] aircraft was hijacked on its way to [[Italy]]. The EgyptAir 648 hijackers insisted, and forced the [[Aviator|pilot]], Hani Galal, to land at [[Luqa Airport]]. As a last-ditch attempt to stop the landing, the runway lights were switched off, but the pilot managed to land the damaged aircraft safely.

The Mexican passengers were actress Lupita Pall√°s and her daughter Laila Ortiz de Pinedo, mother and sister of Mexican actor [[Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo]].

==Standoff==
At first, Maltese authorities were optimistic they could solve the crisis. Malta had good relations with the [[Arab world]], and 12 years earlier had successfully resolved a potentially more serious situation when a [[KLM]] [[Boeing 747]] landed there under similar circumstances. The Maltese Prime Minister, [[Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici]], rushed to the airport's control tower and assumed responsibility for the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20101123/local/anniversary-of-a-massacre-the-egyptair-hijacking-in-malta.337385|title=Anniversary of a massacre ‚Äì The EgyptAir hijack in Malta|date=23 November 2010|work=[[Times of Malta]]|page=|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com/features/10-most-terrifying-airplane-hijackings-of-all-time.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430015446/http://www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com/features/10-most-terrifying-airplane-hijackings-of-all-time.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 April 2011|title=10 Most Terrifying Airplane Hijackings of All Time|date=|work=[[Criminal Justice Degrees Guide]]|page=|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by an interpreter, he refused to refuel the aircraft, or to withdraw Maltese armed forces which had surrounded the plane, until all passengers were released. Eleven passengers and two injured flight attendants were allowed off the plane. The hijackers then started shooting hostages, starting with Tamar Artzi, an Israeli woman, whom they shot in the head and back. Artzi survived her wounds.  Rezaq, the chief hijacker, threatened to kill a passenger every 15 minutes until his demands were met. His next victim was Nitzan Mendelson, another Israeli woman, killing her. He then shot three Americans ‚Äì Patrick Scott Baker, Scarlett Marie Rogenkamp and Jackie Nink Pflug. Of the five passengers shot, Artzi, Baker and Pflug survived; Mendelson died in a Maltese hospital a week after the hijacking. A British passenger commented that he saw that Rezaq had to raise his gun in order to shoot Baker, who was about 6' 5" tall.

France, the United Kingdom and the United States all offered to send anti-hijack forces. Bonnici was under heavy pressure from both the hijackers and from the United States and Egypt, whose ambassadors were at the airport. The non-aligned Maltese government feared that the Americans or the Israelis would arrive and take control of the area, as the U.S. [[Naval Air Station Sigonella]] was only 20 minutes away. A U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules with an aeromedical evacuation team from [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] (2nd Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron) near [[Frankfurt]], Germany, and rapid-deploying surgical teams from Wiesbaden Air Force Medical Center were on standby at the U.S. Navy Hospital at [[Naples]]. When the U.S. told Maltese authorities that Egypt had a special forces counterterrorism team trained by the U.S. [[Delta Force]] ready to move in, they were granted permission to come. The Egyptian [[Unit 777]] under the command of Major-General [[Kamal Attia]] was flown in, led by four American officers. Negotiations were prolonged as much as possible, and it was agreed that the plane should be attacked on the morning of 25 November when food was to be taken into the aircraft. Soldiers dressed up as caterers would jam the door open and attack.

==Raid==
Without warning Egyptian commandos launched the raid about an hour and a half before it had been originally planned. They blasted open the passenger doors and luggage compartment doors with explosives. Bonnici claimed that these unauthorized explosions caused the internal plastic of the plane to catch fire, causing widespread [[suffocation]]. On the other hand, the ''[[Times of Malta]]'', quoting sources at the airport on the day, held that when the hijackers realized that they were being attacked, they lobbed hand grenades into the passenger area, killing people and starting the fire aboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19851124-0 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 737‚Äì266 SU-AYH Malta-Luqa Airport (MLA) |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date= |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storming of the aircraft killed 54 of the remaining 87 passengers, as well as two crew members and one hijacker. Only one hijacker ‚Äî Omar Rezaq, who had survived ‚Äî remained undetected by the Maltese government. The terrorist leader, who was injured during the storming of the aircraft, had removed his hood and ammunition and pretended to be an injured passenger. Egyptian commandos tracked Rezaq to St. Luke's General Hospital and, holding the doctors and medical staff at gunpoint, entered the casualty ward looking for him. He was arrested when some of the passengers in the hospital recognized him.

A total of 58 of the 95 passengers and crew had died, as well as two of the three hijackers, by the time the crisis was over. Maltese medical examiners estimated that eight passengers were shot dead by the commandos.

Rezaq faced trial in Malta, but with no anti-terrorism legislation, he was tried on other charges. There was widespread fear that terrorists would hijack a Maltese plane or carry out a terrorist attack in Malta as an act of retribution. Rezaq received a 25-year sentence, of which he served eight. His release caused a diplomatic incident between Malta and the U.S. because Maltese law strictly prohibited trying a person twice, in any jurisdiction, on charges connected to the same series of events (having wider limitations compared to classic [[double jeopardy]]). Following his immediate expulsion on release, he was captured on arrival in [[Nigeria]]. After three months he was handed over to the U.S., brought before a U.S. court and, on 7 October 1996, sentenced to life imprisonment with a no-parole recommendation.

==Aftermath and criticism==
In his 1989 book ''[[Massacre in Malta]]'', [[John A. Mizzi]] writes:

{{cquote|Malta was faced with a problem it was ill-equipped to meet. The authorities took a firm stand in denying fuel to the hijackers but made no sensible provisions, through political bias and lack of experience, to meet the circumstances that arose from this decision. No proper team was set up at the outset to evaluate or deal progressively with the crisis, although only a few days previously an incident management course had been organized by a team of U.S. experts in Malta at the request of the government.&lt;ref name="Mizzi"&gt;Mizzi, J.A. (1989). ''Massacre in Malta : The Hijack of Egyptair MS 648'', 72 p:ill. J.A. Mizzi ‚Äì Valletta : Technografica, 1989. DDC : 364.162&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mizzi adds:

{{cquote|The Egyptian commandos were given too free a hand and they acted out of their mission with little regard for the safety of the passengers. They were determined to get the hijackers at all costs and the Maltese government's initial refusal for U.S. anti-terrorist resources (a team led by a major-general with listening devices and other equipment) offered by the [[State Department]] through the U.S. Embassy in Malta ‚Äì a decision reversed too late ‚Äì contributed in no small measure to the mismanagement of the entire operation.&lt;ref name="Mizzi" /&gt;}}

Mizzi also mentions how Maltese soldiers positioned in the vicinity of the aircraft were equipped with rifles but were not issued ammunition. An Italian secret service report on the incident showed how the fire inside the aircraft was caused by the Egyptian commandos who placed explosives in the aircraft cargo hold ‚Äì the most vulnerable part of the aircraft, as it held the oxygen tanks which blew up. During the hijacking, only the Socialist Party media and state-controlled television were given information on the incident. Such was the [[censorship]] of the media, that the Maltese people first heard of the disaster through [[RAI TV]], when its correspondent [[Enrico Mentana]] spoke live on the air via a direct phone call: "Parlo da Malta. Qui c'√® stato un massacro ..." ("I'm speaking from Malta. Here there's just been a massacre ...") Shortly before this broadcast, a news bulletin on the Maltese national television had erroneously stated that all passengers had been released and were safe.

Decisions taken by the Maltese government drew criticism from overseas. The United States protested to Malta about U.S. personnel sent to resolve the issue having been confined to Air Squadron HQ and the U.S. Embassy in [[Floriana]]. The United States had seen the situation as so ‚Äòhot‚Äô that it had ordered a number of its naval ships, including an aircraft carrier, to move toward Malta for contingency purposes.

EgyptAir still flies the Athens‚ÄìCairo route, now assigned flight numbers 748 and 750 and is now performed by [[Boeing 737-800]]. The [[flight number]] 648 
is now on its Riyadh‚ÄìCairo route.

==In popular culture==
The events of the hijacking were related in an account by American survivor Jackie Nink Pflug, who had been shot in the head, on the [[Biography Channel]] television program ''[[I Survived...]]'', which was broadcast on 13 April 2009. Laurence Zrinzo, the neurologist and neurosurgeon who established neurosurgery as a sub-speciality in the Maltese islands, performed Ms Pflug's neurosurgical procedure. Ms Pflug also related details about the flight and the attack in her 2001 book, ''Miles to Go Before I Sleep''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jackie Nink Pflug|author2=Peter Kizilos|title=Miles to Go Before I Sleep: A Survivor's Story of Life After a Terrorist Hijacking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=royVNfdQE6cC&amp;pg=PA102|year=2001|publisher=Hazelden Publishing|isbn=978-1-56838-837-3|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was chronicled and reenacted in an ''[[Interpol Investigates]]'' episode, [[Interpol Investigates#Terror in the Skies|"Terror in the Skies"]], broadcast by the [[National Geographic Channel]].

The hijacking is also the subject of the book ''Valinda, Our Daughter'', written by Canadian author [[Gladys Taylor (publisher)|Gladys Taylor]].

The events of the hijacking are described in and used to further the plot in [[Brad Thor]]'s novel Path of the Assassin.

On 19 February 1978, Egyptian special forces raided [[Larnaca International Airport]] near [[Larnaca]], [[Cyprus]], in an attempt to intervene in a [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]]. Earlier, two assassins had killed prominent Egyptian newspaper editor [[Yusuf Sibai]] and then rounded up as hostages several Arabs who were attending a convention in [[Nicosia]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=1978: Egyptian forces die in Cyprus gunfight | date=1978-02-19 | publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/19/newsid_2565000/2565701.stm | work =BBC | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-02 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Cypriot forces were trying to negotiate with the hostage-takers at the airport, Egyptian troops launched their own assault without authorization from the Cypriots. The unauthorized raid led to the Egyptians and the Cypriots exchanging gunfire, killing or injuring more than 20 of the Egyptian commandos.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; As a result, Egypt and Cyprus severed political ties for several years after the incident.

== Hijacking ==
In the late hours of 18 February 1978, Yusuf Sibai, editor of a prominent [[Egypt]]ian newspaper and a friend of the [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Anwar Sadat]], was [[assassinated]] by two gunmen at a convention being held at the [[Nicosia]] Hilton. The two assassins rounded up 16 Arab convention delegates as hostages (among them, two P.L.O. representatives and one Egyptian national) and demanded transportation to [[Larnaca International Airport]]. They also demanded and were supplied with a [[Cyprus Airways]] DC-8 aircraft. Following negotiations with the Cypriot authorities, the hijackers were allowed to fly the aircraft out of Cyprus with 11 hostages and four crew members. The aircraft, however, was denied permission to land in [[Djibouti]], [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] and was forced to return and land in [[Cyprus]] a few hours later.

According to a report in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Sadat was aggrieved by the assassination of his personal friend and begged the Cypriot President, [[Spyros Kyprianou]] to rescue the hostages and extradite the terrorists to Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Murder and Massacre on Cyprus | date= March 6, 1978 | publisher= | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915969-2,00.html | work =[[Time Magazine]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cypriot President responded by promising to oversee the rescue operation and any negotiations personally, and travelled to the airport himself. According to the same report however, Sadat dispatched an elite [[Unit 777|antiterrorism unit]] (Task Force 777) to Cyprus aboard a [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft. Cairo merely informed Kyprianou that ''"people are on the way to help rescue the hostages"'' and did not reveal who was on board nor what their intentions were.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Upon landing in Cyprus, the Egyptian force immediately launched an all out assault, dispatching a single [[Jeep]] all-terrain vehicle with three men to race ahead of an estimated 58 troops (another report has this figure at 74&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19780219-1 |title=Criminal Occurrence description |accessdate=2008-02-02 |date=1978-02-19 |publisher=Aviation Safety Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;) moving towards the hijacked aircraft on foot.

== Egyptian raid ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
As the [[Egypt]]ian troops advanced quickly towards the hijacked DC-8 aircraft and the [[Cypriot National Guard]] forces who surrounded it, the Cypriot forces reportedly issued a single verbal warning to halt and submit, though in other reports, the Cypriots issued two verbal warnings, the second a demand for the Egyptians to return to their aircraft. As this occurred, the occupants of the Jeep and the Cypriot National Guardsmen exchanged gunfire, and the Egyptian Jeep was struck by a [[rocket propelled grenade]] (RPG), as well as gunfire, killing all three occupants. As the vehicle came to a halt, the [[Cyprus|Cypriots]] and the main Egyptian force confronted each other at a range of less than {{convert|300|m|yd}}, and it is variously reported that the Egyptians, who lacked any form of cover, dropped down onto the tarmac in prone firing positions. At this moment, the two forces engaged each other with heavy gunfire, and the Cypriots opened fire on the Egyptian C-130H aircraft with a 106&amp;nbsp;mm anti-tank missile, striking it in the nose and killing all three crew on board.

With their aircraft destroyed, the Egyptian force and the Cypriot National Guard exchanged heavy gunfire for nearly an hour in sporadic fighting on the open tarmac. Some of the Egyptian troops took cover in a nearby empty [[Air France]] aircraft.

Cypriot President Spyros Kyprianou, who was watching the events unfolding from the airport control tower, was forced to withdraw from the windows and take cover as Egyptian commandos struck the tower with automatic gunfire.

==Aftermath==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}
Of the Egyptian commando force, 15 men were killed, in addition to three crew of the C-130H Hercules transport aircraft who were killed when it was struck by a missile. An estimated 15 more Egyptian commandos were reported to have been taken injured to [[Larnaca]] General Hospital with gunshot wounds.

Following the assault, it emerged that the surrender of the two hostage-takers had already been secured at the time of the failed Egyptian attack, and the two men were taken prisoner by the Cypriots and later extradited to [[Egypt]], where they received death sentences, later commuted to life sentences.

On 20 February, Egypt recalled its diplomatic mission and requested the Cyprus government to do the same in Cairo. Cyprus requested the withdrawal of Egypt's military attach√©.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Watts | coauthors= | title=Angry Egyptians call envoys home as Cyprus dispute grows | date=February 21, 1978 | publisher= | url=http://www.galeuk.com/times/ | work=[[The Times]] Digital Archive | pages=1; Issue 60242; col F | accessdate=2008-05-02 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030906202207/http://www.galeuk.com/times/ | archivedate=September 6, 2003 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Enigmarelle''''' was a fake humanoid [[automaton]], in fact with a person concealed inside, which was exhibited as a scientific and technical curiosity around 1905 in the US and Europe, chiefly in theaters. Enigmarelle was claimed to be able to perform several extraordinary tasks, which it demonstrated in performances: these included walking, riding a bicycle, and writing its name on a blackboard.

== Presentation==
Enigmarelle was shown in the US and then in parts of Europe, in [[vaudeville]] theaters and circuses. The booking agent, an American named Frederick J. Ireland, was represented at these appearances as the creator and owner of the automaton.

Enigmarelle was a large automaton and was in fact operated by a human concealed within its body, although the precise operating mechanisms are not known. The operator is believed to have been a performer who had had both his legs [[amputation|amputated]] and who went by the name of Alba W. Root, and who also performed as a bicycle acrobat using leg [[prosthesis|prostheses]]. &lt;!-- is believed to be Alba W. Root, who lost both legs in a train accident as a boy. Enigmarelle was designed to exploit this disability, with removable legs to "prove" its mechanical nature. --&gt;

Enigmarelle was the subject of a short documentary film in 1905&lt;ref group="P"&gt;{{cite web |first=Alan |last=Goble |title=Enigmarelle the Wonderful Automaton - Film / Movie |url=http://www.citwf.com/film423590.htm |website=Complete Index To World Film |access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a detailed "scientific" description with three photos in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1906.&lt;ref group="C"&gt;{{cite news |language=en|title=A Clever Mechanical and Electrical Automaton |periodical=Scientific American |volume=94 |issue=2 |date=1906-01-13 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-clever-mechanical-and-electrical/|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mentioned in some modern publications on automatons.&lt;ref group="P"&gt;{{cite book|language=en|author1=Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume|title=Clockwork Music|location=Australia|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1973|pages=334|isbn=9780047890048|quotation=Another and equally spectacular 'android' was that exhibited at the London Hippodrome in 1905. Called Enigmarelle, this seven-foot high figure possessed incredible abilities. It would walk on to the stage, write its name in somewhat backward-sloping manuscript upon a blackboard, and then ride a bicycle in a circle. Its head was of wax, its feet of steel and its legs of wood and iron. The motive power comprised no less than seven motors-three being spring, and four electric which drew their power from wet-cell batteries concealed in the trunk. Unbuttoning its waistcoat revealed a mass of wheelwork and wires, levers, and cranks.

=== Name ===
The name ''Enigmarelle'' seems to be a [[portmanteau]] of the French words ''√©nigme'' (enigma) and ''marelle'' ([[hopscotch]]), but the creators of the machine were English speakers, so there is no reason to suppose a French portmanteau is the true origin of the name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9709">In [[philosophy]], '''events''' are objects in [[time]] or instantiations of [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] in objects.

==Kim‚Äôs property-exemplification==

[[Jaegwon Kim]] theorized that events are structured.&lt;br&gt;
They are composed of three things:
# Object(s) [x],
# a property [P] and
# time or a [[Time standard|temporal interval]] [t].
Events are defined using the [[operational definition|operation]] [x, P, t].&lt;br&gt;
A unique event is defined by two principles:&lt;br&gt;
:a) the existence condition and
:b) the identity condition.
The existence condition states ‚Äú[x, P, t] exists if and only if object x exemplifies the n-adic P at time t‚Äù. This means a unique event exists if the above is met. The identity condition states ‚Äú[x, P, t] is [y, Q, t`] if and only if x=y, P=Q and t=t`].

Kim uses these to define events under five conditions:
# One, they are unrepeatable, unchangeable [[particular]]s that include changes and the states and conditions of that event.
# Two, they have a [[semi-temporal]] location.
# Three, only their constructive property creates distinct events.
# Four, holding a constructive property as a generic event creates a type-token relationship between events, and events are not limited to their three requirements (i.e. [x, P, t]). Critics of this theory such as [[Myles Brand]] have suggested that the theory be modified so that an event had a [[spacetime|spatiotemporal]] region; consider the event of a flash of lightning. The idea is that an event must include both the span of time of the flash of lightning and the area in which it occurred.

&lt;!-- ****************************** --&gt;
&lt;!-- the fifth condition is missing!--&gt;
&lt;!-- ****************************** --&gt;

Other problems exist within Kim‚Äôs theory, as he never specified what properties were (e.g. [[universals]], [[Trope (philosophy)|tropes]], natural classes, etc.). In addition, it is not specified if properties are few or abundant. The following is Kim‚Äôs response to the above.

{{Quotation|. . . [T]he basic generic events may be best picked out relative to a scientific theory, whether the theory is a common-sense theory of the behavior of middle-sized objects or a highly sophisticated physical theory. They are among the important properties, relative to the theory, in terms of which lawful regularities can be discovered, described, and explained. The basic parameters in terms of which the laws of the theory are formulated would, on this view, give us our basic generic events, and the usual logical, mathematical, and perhaps other types of operations on them would yield complex, defined generic events. We commonly recognize such properties as motion, colors, temperatures, weights, pushing, and breaking, as generic events and states, but we must view this against the background of our common-sense explanatory and predictive scheme of the world around us. I think it highly likely that we cannot pick out generic events completely ''a priori''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaegwon Kim]] (1993) ''Supervenience and Mind'', page 37, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is also a major debate about the essentiality of a constitutive object. There are two major questions involved in this: If one event occurs, could it have occurred in the same manner if it were another person, and could it occur in the same manner if it would have occurred at a different time? Kim holds that neither are true and that different conditions (i.e. a different person or time) would lead to a separate event. However, some consider it natural to assume the opposite.

==Davidson==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and [[John Lemmon]] proposed a theory of events that had two major conditions, respectively: a causal criterion and a spatiotemporal criterion.

The causal criterion defines an event as two events being the same if and only if they have the same [[Causality|cause and effect]].

The spatiotemporal criterion defines an event as two events being the same if and only if they occur in the same [[space]] at the same [[time]]. Davidson however provided this scenario; if a metal ball becomes warmer during a certain minute, and during the same minute rotates through 35 degrees, must we say that these are the same event? However, one can argue that the warming of the ball and the rotation are possibly temporally separated and are therefore separate events.

==Lewis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] theorized that events are merely spatiotemporal regions and properties (i.e. [[element (mathematics)|membership of a class]]). He defines an event as ‚Äúe is an event only if it is a class of spatiotemporal regions, both thisworldly (assuming it occurs in the actual world) and otherworldly.‚Äù The only problem with this definition is it only tells us what an event could be, but does not define a unique event. This theory entails [[modal realism]], which assumes [[possible worlds]] exist; worlds are defined as sets containing all objects that exist as a part of that set. However, this theory is controversial. Some philosophers have attempted to remove possible worlds, and reduce them to other [[Subjunctive possibility|entities]]. They hold that the world we exist in is the only world that actually exists, and that possible worlds are only possibilities.

Lewis‚Äô theory is composed of four key points. Firstly, the non-duplication principle; it states that x and y are separate events if and only if there is one member of x that is not a member of y (or vice versa). Secondly, there exist regions that are subsets of possible worlds and thirdly, events are not structured by an essential time.

==Badiou==

In [[Alain Badiou#Introduction to ''Being and Event''|''Being and Event'']], [[Alain Badiou]] writes that the event (''√©v√©nement'') is a multiple which basically does not make sense according to the rules of the "situation," in other words existence.  Hence, the event "is not," and therefore, in order for there to be an event, there must be an "intervention" which changes the rules of the situation in order to allow that particular event to be ("to be" meaning to be a multiple which belongs to the multiple of the situation&amp;nbsp;‚Äî these terms are drawn from or defined in reference to [[set theory]]).  In his view, there is no "one," and everything that {{not a typo|is is}} a "multiple."  "One" happens when the situation "counts," or accounts for, acknowledges, or defines something: it "counts it as one."  For the event to be counted as one by the situation, or counted in the one of the situation, an intervention needs to decide its belonging to the situation.  This is because his definition of the event violates the prohibition against self-belonging (in other words, it is a set-theoretical definition which violates set theory's rules of consistency), thus does not count as extant on its own.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain Badiou]] (1988) ''L'√ätre et l'√âv√©nement''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deleuze==
[[Gilles Deleuze]] lectured on the concept of ''event'' on March 10, 1987. A sense of the lecture is described by James Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Charles J. Stivale (editor) (2011) ''Gilles Deleuze: Key Concepts'', 2nd edition, chapter 6: Event, pp 80‚Äì90&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also wrote, "From the point of view of the difference between two possible worlds, the event is all important".&lt;ref&gt;James Williams (2003) ''Gilles Deleuze‚Äôs [[Difference and Repetition]]: A Critical Introduction and Guide'', page 78, [[Edinburgh University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated, "Every event is revolutionary due to an integration of signs, acts and structures through the whole event. Events are distinguished by the intensity of this revolution, rather than the types of freedom or chance."&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2003 p xi&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 Deleuze published a magazine article "Signes et √©v√©nements"&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze (1988) "Signes et √©v√©nements", ''Magazine Litt√©raire'', #257, pages 16 to 25&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Nietszche and Philosophy'', he addresses the question "Which one is beautiful?" In the preface to the English translation he wrote:
:The one that ... does not refer to an individual, to a person, but rather to an event, that is, to the forces in their various relationships to a proposition or phenomenon, and the genetic relationship that determines these forces (power).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hart (1993) ''Gilles Deleuze: An apprenticeship in philosophy'', page 31, [[University of Minnesota Press]] {{ISBN|0-8166-2160-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kirkeby==
The Danish philosopher [[Ole Fogh Kirkeby]] deserves mentioning, as he has written a comprehensive trilogy about the event, or in Danish "begivenheden". In the first work of the trilogy "Eventum tantum ‚Äì begivenhedens ethos"&lt;ref&gt;Ole Fogh Kirkeby (2005) ''Eventum tantum : Begivenhedens ethos.'' K√∏benhavn: Samfundslitteratur&lt;/ref&gt; (Eventum tantum - the ethos of the event) he distinguishes between three levels of the event, inspired from [[Nicola Cusanus]]: Eventum tantum as non aliud, the alma-event and the proto-event.

{{multiple issues|{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}{{more footnotes|date=April 2016}}}}

''' Event management''' is the application of [[project management]] to the creation and development of large-scale events such as [[festival]]s, conferences, ceremonies, weddings, formal parties, concerts, or [[convention (meeting)|conventions]]. It involves studying the brand, identifying its [[target audience]], devising the event concept, and coordinating the technical aspects before actually launching the event.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsborg, G.C.; B Miller, D Breiter, BJ Reed &amp; A Rushing (eds), ''Professional meeting management: Comprehensive strategies for meetings, conventions and events'', 2008, 5th ed, Kendall/Hunt Publishing, Dubuque, Iowa. {{ISBN|0-7575-5212-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of planning and coordinating the event is usually referred to as '''event planning''' and which can include budgeting, scheduling, site selection, acquiring necessary [[License|permit]]s, coordinating transportation and parking, arranging for speakers or entertainers, arranging decor, event security, [[catering]], coordinating with third party vendors, and emergency plans. Each event is different in its nature so process of planning &amp; execution of each event differs on basis of type of event. 

The events industry now includes events of all sizes from the [[Olympics]] down to business breakfast meetings. Many industries, [[charitable organization]]s, and interest groups hold events in order to market themselves, build business relationships, raise money, or celebrate achievement.

==Marketing tool==

Event management might be a tool for [[Marketing strategy|strategic marketing]] and communication, used by companies of every size. Companies can benefit from promotional events as a way to communicate with current and potential customers.  For instance, these advertising-focused events can occur as press conferences, promotional events, or product launches.

Event managers may also use traditional news media in order to target their audience, hoping to generate media coverage which will reach thousands or millions of people. They can also invite their audience to their events and reach them at the actual event.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Event manager==

The '''event manager''' is the person who plans and executes the event, taking responsibility for the creative, technical, and logistical elements.  This includes overall event design, brand building, marketing and communication strategy, [[audio-visual]] production, script writing, logistics, budgeting, negotiation, and client service.

==Event venue==
An event venue may be an onsite or offsite location. The event manager is usually not responsible for operations at rented event or entertainment venues, but will monitor all aspects of the event on site. Some of the tasks listed in the introduction may pass to the venue, but usually at a cost.

Corporate event managers book event venues to host corporate meetings, conferences, networking events, trade shows, product launches, team building retreats or training sessions in a more tailored environment.

== Sustainability ==
[[Sustainable event management]] (also known as event greening) is the process used to produce an event with particular concern for environmental, economic, and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso20121.htm ISO 20121 - Sustainable events]", ISO (www.iso.org), retrieved 2014-30-05&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability in event management incorporates socially and environmentally responsible decision making into the planning, organization and implementation of, and participation in, an event. It involves including sustainable development principles and practices in all levels of event organization, and aims to ensure that an event is hosted responsibly. It represents the total package of interventions at an event, and needs to be done in an integrated manner. Event greening should start at the inception of the project, and should involve all the key role players, such as clients, organizers, venues, sub-contractors, and suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/get_involved/live_green/at_the_office/green_events/|title=Organizing a Green Event|publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

[[Event management software]] companies provide [[event planning|event planners]] with software tools to handle many common activities such as delegate registration, hotel booking, travel booking, or allocation of exhibition floorspace.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A recent trend in event technology is the use of mobile apps for events. Event mobile apps have a range of uses. They can be used to hold relatively static information such as the agenda, speaker biographies, and general FAQs. They can also encourage audience participation and engagement through interactive tools such as live voting/polling, submitting questions to speakers during Q&amp;A, or building live interactive "word clouds". Mobile event apps can also be used by event organisers as a means of communication. Organisers can communicate with participants through the use of alerts, notifications, and push messages. They can also be used to collect feedback from the participants through the use of surveys in app. Going a step further, some mobile event apps can also help participants to engage with each other, with sponsors, and with the organisers with built-in networking functionality.

==Education==
There are an increasing number of [[universities]] which offer courses in event management, including diplomas and graduate degrees. In addition to these academic courses, there are many associations and societies that provide courses on the various aspects of the [[industry]]. Study includes organizational skills, technical knowledge, [[public relations]], [[marketing]], [[advertising]], [[catering]], [[logistics]], [[Interior design|decor]], glamor identity, human relations, study of law and licenses, risk management, budgeting, and the study of allied industries like television, other media, and several other areas. Certification can be acquired from various sources to obtain designations such as 
*Certified Trade Show Marketer (CTSM)
*Certified in Exhibition Management (CEM)
*Global Certification in Meeting Management (CMM)
*[[Certified Meeting Professional]] (CMP)
*Global Certificate in Event Design (EDC) 
*Certified Special Event Professional (CSEP) 
*Certified Quality Event Planner (CQEP)

'''Fame Kills: Starring Kanye West and Lady Gaga''' was a planned co-headlining [[concert tour]] by American rapper [[Kanye West]] and singer [[Lady Gaga]]. For the tour, which would have supported West's fourth album ''[[808s &amp; Heartbreak]]'' (2008) and Gaga's ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' EP (2009), the pair conceived a production that would unite their different musical audiences. The tour was scheduled to run from November 2009 to January 2010, but was canceled after public controversy regarding [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards#Kanye West controversy and debated incidents|West's interruption]] of [[Taylor Swift]]'s Best Female Video speech at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Shortly after the cancellation, Gaga embarked on her own tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]], while West took a break from his career.

==Background and development==
[[File:LadyGaga-EqualityMarch-Crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gaga only agreed to tour with West under the condition that everything "remain gay".]]
In June 2009, West announced on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' he would be touring with Gaga, but she would not perform as an opening act. "She's talented and so incredible that she's not an opening act", he said. "We're doing it together, with no opening act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West To Tour With Lady Gaga|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=June 9, 2009|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210202610/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|archivedate=December 10, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Gaga expressed her belief that the tour would be "one of the most groundbreaking moments in touring history."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1618664/20090813/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Promises 'Groundbreaking' Tour With Kanye West|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=August 13, 2009|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the singer agreed to collaborate with West, she demanded that the tour would remain accessible to her [[gay]] fans. "I'm gay", she recalled telling West in an interview with ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine, "my music is gay. My show is gay. And I love that it's gay. And I love my gay fans and they're all going to be coming to our show. And it's going to ''remain'' gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|title=The Lady Is a Vamp|last=Stein|first=Joshua David|author2=Michelson, Noah|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|publisher=Joe Landry|page=2|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=August 9, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309102723/http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|archivedate=March 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour's stage was designed by Gaga and West as a [[wiktionary:traverse|traverse]]; "Instead of being on just one end of the arena, the stage traverses the entire arena", Gaga noted. "It's not really in-the-round; it's more of a runway." The concept of the tour was to feature the performers on opposite ends of the stage, with Gaga's end representing "home and humble beginnings" and West's end representing "the fame", with the two fighting for each other's positions throughout the show. West would perform his singles, Gaga would perform hers, and then the duo would perform several duets.&lt;ref name="Aswad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622849/20091001/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West/ Lady Gaga's Fame Kills Tour Canceled|last=Aswad|first=Jem|author2=Dinh, James|date=October 1, 2009|publisher=MTV News.

Gaga said she enjoyed designing Fame Kills with West, calling themselves "creative kindreds."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"/&gt; She explained that they did not plan to tour for themselves, but rather for "everybody else"; the goal of the tour would have been to bring two different groups of fans and music enthusiasts together. "I make pop music and Kanye's fans love pop music because he has changed what [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] means", she said. "For me, the tour is more about just bringing people together and having a big dance party. The show is a celebration of creativity, art, fashion and choreography." She also noted that West showed her a lot during the creative planning of the show, such as one instance where Gaga wanted to put side panels on the stage that would have obstructed the view for some fans. "He was like, 'I'm not selling a ticket to a fan who can't see the show,' and he's right", she said.&lt;ref name="Aswad"/&gt;

A promotional video for the tour was released in September 2009. West posted the video on his blog accompanied by the text, "What happened to all the rock stars? The fame killed them!" The 30-second clip features slow-motion footage of a topless Gaga being carried by a man presumed to be West. Daniel Kreps from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described it as "soft 70s porn", while adding that he had "no idea what [the text in the video] has to do with the 30-second clip, but we're sure it'll start to make more sense as more promos roll out as we approach the tour's launch."&lt;ref name="Kreps"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-gets-nsfw-in-promo-for-joint-tour-with-kanye-west-20090923|title=Lady Gaga Gets NSFW in Promo For Joint Tour With Kanye West|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=September 23, 2009|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|title=Nude Lady GaGa 'Fame Kills' tour promo released|date=September 24, 2009|accessdate=July 31, 2014|work=[[NME]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091358/http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanyecolorconcert.jpg|thumb|West ''(pictured)'' was criticized for his interruption of [[Taylor Swift]]'s VMA speech. The incident reportedly put the fate of the Fame Kills tour in question.]]
Following singer [[Taylor Swift]]'s win for the music video "[[You Belong with Me]]" at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]], West stormed the stage, grabbed Swift's microphone, and declared that singer [[Beyonc√©]] deserved the award for her "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" video. He declared, "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm going to let you finish, but Beyonc√© had one of the best videos of all time." West was profusely criticized from celebrities and fans alike over the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|title=Kanye West interrupts Taylor Swift's VMAs moment: What was he thinking?|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|date=September 13, 2009|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u4qjZcIO?url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|archivedate=November 8, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/09/14/kanye.west.reaction/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|title=Anger over West's disruption at MTV awards|last=France|first=Lisa Respers|date=September 14, 2009|publisher=[[CNN]].

A representative from a US urban radio station commented: "I think this could potentially affect his upcoming tour with Lady Gaga.

Various rumors circulated as to why the tour was canceled. It was suspected that it was canceled due to poor ticket sales, feuding between Gaga and West's management teams, and Gaga's desire to play in smaller venues. Gaga's choreographer, [[Laurieann Gibson]], said the tour was terminated due to "creative differences" between the singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West's "Fame Kills" Tour Killed By Poor Sales?|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 2, 2010|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109011526/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|archivedate=January 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaga claimed that the cancellation was a mutual decision, and added that she would soon embark on her own headlining tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]] in the coming weeks, while West would be taking a break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|title=Lady Gaga Speaks: Solo Tour Soon, Kanye Taking Time Off|last=Prince|first=David J.|author2=Concepcion, Mariel|date=October 2, 2009|work=Billboard|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412053639/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|archivedate=April 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, West claimed that Gaga had been solely responsible for canceling the tour following the MTV incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|title=Kanye West Talks Why His Joint Tour With Lady Gaga Was Canceled (Hint: Taylor Swift)|last=Lee|first=Christina|date=April 11, 2016|work=Idolator|accessdate=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616140319/http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foreign body aspiration''' occurs when a foreign body enters the airways and causes [[choking]].&lt;ref name="urlForeign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298940-overview |title=Foreign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects can enter the esophagus through the mouth, or enter the trachea through the mouth or nose.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Pediatrics, 24e, "Respiratory Tract &amp; Mediastinum"|last=Federico|first=Monica|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=1259862909|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Most cases of foreign body aspiration are in children ages 6 months to 3 years due to the tendency for children to place small objects in the mouth and nose. Children of this age usually lack molars and cannot grind up food into small pieces for proper swallowing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Surgery, 14e, "Otolaryngology: Head &amp; Neck Surgery"|last=Weinberger|first=Paul|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2015|isbn=9781259255168|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small, round objects including nuts, hard candy, popcorn kernels, beans, and berries are common causes of foreign body aspiration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Latex balloons are also a serious choking hazard in children that can result in death. A latex balloon will conform to the shape of the trachea, blocking the airway and making it difficult to expel with the [[Heimlich maneuver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muntz|first=Harlan|title=Pediatric Otolaryngology for the Clinician: Foreign Body Management|year=2009|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=978-1-58829-542-2|pages=215‚Äì222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adults, foreign body aspiration is most prevalent in populations with impaired swallowing mechanisms such as the following: neurological disorders, alcohol use, sedative use, advanced age (most common in the 6th decade of life), and loss of consciousness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders, Fifth Edition, "Upper Airway Obstruction in Adults"|last=Won|first=Christine|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2015|isbn=0071807284|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Signs and Symptoms ==
[[File:Foreign body aspiration.jpg|thumb|foreign body aspiration]]
Signs and symptoms of foreign body aspiration vary based on the site of obstruction, the size of the foreign body, and the severity of obstruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 20% of foreign bodies become lodged in the upper airway, while 80% become lodged in the mainstem or lobar bronchus.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Emergency Medicine, 8e, "Respiratory Distress"|last=Lucia|first=Dominic|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2017|isbn=0071840613|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs of foreign body aspiration are usually abrupt in onset with coughing, choking, and/or wheezing; however, symptoms can be more progressive if the foreign body does not cause a large degree of obstruction of the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Classically, patients present with acute onset of choking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In these cases, the obstruction is classified as a partial or complete obstruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Signs of partial obstruction include choking with drooling, stridor, and the ability to speak.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Signs of complete obstruction include choking with inability to speak or cough, and signs of respiratory distress such as cyanosis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Foreign bodies above the larynx often present with stridor, while objects below the larynx present with wheezing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Foreign bodies above the vocal cords often present with difficulty and pain with swallowing and excessive drooling.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Foreign bodies below the vocal cords often present with pain and difficulty with speaking and breathing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Increased respiratory rate may be the only sign of foreign body aspiration in a child who cannot verbalize or report if they have swallowed a foreign body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

If the foreign body does not cause a large degree of obstruction, patients may present with chronic cough, asymmetrical breath sounds on exam, or recurrent pneumonia of a specific lung lobe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The right lower lobe of the lung is the most common site of recurrent pneumonia in foreign body aspiration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is due to the fact that the anatomy of the right main bronchus is wider and steeper than that of the left main bronchus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Signs and symptoms of foreign body aspiration in adults can sometimes mimic other lung disorders such as asthma, COPD, and lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Medical Diagnosis &amp; Treatment, "Pulmonary Disorders"|last=Chesnutt|first=Asha|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2019|isbn=126011743X|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Diagnosis ==
If foreign body aspiration is suspected, finger sweeping in the oral cavity is not recommended due to the increased risk of displacing the foreign object further into the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Most patients receive a chest x-ray to determine the location of the foreign body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, a negative chest x-ray cannot rule out foreign body aspiration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lateral neck, chest, and bilateral decubitus end-expiratory chest x-rays should be obtained in patients suspected of having aspirated a foreign body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Signs on x-ray that can be indicative of foreign body aspiration include visualization of the foreign body or hyperinflation of the affected lung.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other x-ray findings that can be seen with foreign body aspiration include obstructive emphysema, atelectasis, and consolidation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

While, x-ray can be used to visualize the location and identity of a foreign body, rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia is the gold-standard for diagnosis since the foreign body can be visualized and removed with this intervention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rigid bronchoscopy is indicated when two of the three following criteria are met: report of foreign body aspiration by the patient or a witness, abnormal lung exam findings, or abnormal chest x-ray findings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Treatment ==
Treatment of foreign body aspiration is determined by the severity of obstruction of the airway involved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In partial obstruction, the patient can usually clear the foreign body with coughing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In complete obstruction, acute intervention is required to remove the foreign body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For choking children less than 1 year of age, the child should be placed face down over the rescuer's arm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Back blows should be delivered with the heel of the hand, then the patient should be turned face-up and chest thrusts should be administered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The rescuer should alternate five back blows followed by five chest thrusts until the object is cleared.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Heimlich maneuver should be used in choking patients older than 1 year of age to dislodge a foreign body. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the patient becomes unresponsive during physical intervention, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be started.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the event that the above measures do not remove the foreign body, and adequate ventilation cannot be restored, need for treatment by trained personnel becomes necessary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Laryngoscopy should be performed in unresponsive patients if non-invasive airway clearance techniques are unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Laryngoscopy involves placing a device in the mouth to visualize the back of the airway.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the foreign body can be seen, it can be removed with forceps.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An endotracheal tube should then be placed in order to prevent airway compromise from resulting inflammation after the procedure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the foreign body cannot be visualized, intubation, tracheostomy, or needle cricothyrotomy can be done to restore an airway for patients who have become unresponsive due to airway compromise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

If non-invasive measures do not dislodge the foreign body, and the patient can maintain adequate ventilation, rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia should be performed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Supplemental oxygen, cardiac monitoring, and a pulse oximeter should be applied to the patient.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Efforts should be made to keep the patient calm and avoid agitating the patient to prevent further airway compromise.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After the foreign body is removed, patients should receive nebulized beta-adrenergic medication and chest physiotherapy to further protect the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Complications ==
Many complications can develop after a foreign body is removed, or if a foreign body remains in the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Patients may develop inflammation of the airway walls or lung abscess from a foreign body remaining in the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hyperinflation of the airway distal to the obstruction can also occur if the foreign body is not removed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Patients can also develop pneumonia from retained foreign bodies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Episodes of recurrent pneumonia in the same lung field should prompt evaluation for a possible foreign body in the airway.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even if the foreign body is removed, complications such as chemical bronchitis, mucosal reactions, and the development of granulation tissue are possible.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A '''geohazard''' is a geological state that may lead to widespread damage or risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohazards.no International Centre for Geohazards]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302114513/http://www.geohazards.no/ |date=March 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geohazards are geological and environmental conditions and involve long-term or short-term geological processes. Geohazards can be relatively small features, but they can also attain huge dimensions (e.g., submarine or surface [[landslide]]) and affect local and regional socio-economy to a large extent (e.g., [[tsunami]]s).

==Geohazards==
{{See also|Natural hazard}}
Human activities, such as drilling through overpressured zones‚Äîcould result in significant risk, and as such mitigation and prevention are paramount, through improved understanding of geohazards, their preconditions, causes and implications. In other cases, particularly in montane regions, natural processes can cause catalytic events of a complex nature, such as an [[avalanche]] hitting a lake causes a debris flow, with consequences potentially hundreds of miles away, or creating a [[lahar]] by volcanism.

The continued and multi-disciplinary investigation into the occurrence and implications of geohazards, in particular offshore geohazards in relation with the oil and gas exploration, lead to specific mitigation studies and establishing relevant prevention mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadim | year = 2006 | title = Challenges to geo-scientists in risk assessment for sub-marine slides | url = | journal = Norwegian Journal of Geology | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 351‚Äì362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solheim | first1 = A.| year = | title = , 2005.

=== Geohazards in Earth's history ===
Eleven distinct [[flood basalt]] episodes occurred in the past 250 million years, resulting in [[large volcanic province]]s, creating [[plateau]]s and [[mountain range]]s on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/241/4866/663 http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1988/1988_Rampino_Stothers_1.pdf|authors=[[Michael R.

The timing of six out of eleven known provinces coincide with periods of [[global warming]] and marine [[Anoxic event|anoxia]]/dysoxia. Thus, suggesting that volcanic CO2 emissions can force an important effect on the [[climate system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825200000374|author=P.B.

On 10 December 2014, when reflecting on the year she has had and the struggles she faced in the years before, Azalea announced plans of an arena tour and a second studio album via her [[Twitter]] account. The same day, Azalea revealed the title of the tour and the concept behind it, which is Azalea picturing herself as "a musical escape artist for people." Azalea also revealed that the name of the tour goes along with the title of her upcoming second studio album, which will also be promoted on the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bobb|first=Maurice|title=Iggy Azalea's Planning Her 'Great Escape': Here's What She's Talking About|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2023011/iggy-azalea-announces-great-escape-tour/|work=[[MTV]]|date=10 December 2014|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2014, the North American leg of the tour was officially announced. Presented by [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG]], the first leg of tour, which was set to commence on 14 April 2015 in [[Fresno, California]], and was scheduled to visit twenty-four cities across North America during the spring of 2015 before ending on 24 May 2015 in [[Austin, Texas]]. Also revealed in the North American leg announcement was that [[Nick Jonas]] and [[Tinashe]] would be the special guests supporting Azalea on the first leg of the tour promoting their latest individual efforts, ''[[Nick Jonas (album)|Nick Jonas]]'' (2014) and ''[[Aquarius (Tinashe album)|Aquarius]]'' (2014). Azalea's [[disc jockey]], DJ Wizz Kidd, would also support Azalea throughout the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bobb|first=Maurice|title=Iggy Azalea Announces The Great Escape Tour Dates: See Them Here!|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2027204/iggy-azalea-great-escape-tour-nick-jonas/|work=[[MTV]]|date=15 December 2014|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning on 15 December 2014, pre-sale tickets were available to all [[American Express]] cardholders through 18 December 2014. The public on-sale followed immediately after with tickets becoming available on 19 December 2014. Platinum and VIP Packages also became available for purchase on AEG's website, in which the packages included premium seating and exclusive autographed merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iggy Azalea Blazes a Trail For the Can‚Äôt-Miss The Great Escape Tour|url=http://www.aeglive.com/news/view/12284|work=[[Anschutz Entertainment Group]]|date=15 December 2014|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[GQ]]'', Azalea began to reveal details about the tour's stage, visuals, and concept. When speaking about her main focus of the tour, Azalea stated "I want everything to be right‚Äîeverything, from the tour book to what someone wears. Even the right faces for the dancers, and their attitude. Everything is equally important." While discussing stage layout, Azalea revealed that she's "trying to work on the initial stage design" and that she's "making a stage that [she can] engage with many people in an arena that big." She also noted that she was working with [[Jamie King]], who has also worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] on her [[Confessions Tour]] (2006), which Azalea has stated is a major influence for the tour. Other influences for the tour that she's mentioned include the films ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'' (1980) and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940). In regards to the visuals, Azalea has stated that the tour will include "color blocking‚Äîloud, just obnoxious-type visual things", that she also characterized as "Trippy, cool, [and] colorful." Azalea also commented on the nature of the show by saying "The traditional hip-hop arena show is more focused on a DJ. I don't think it has as many props and spectacles as perhaps a pop show, which is also what I would say my show is visually like." Overall, Azalea has stated her desire for the show is "not to be too wacky" and to be "a great experience [in which fans feel] really immersed in the whole thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=Sarah|title=Iggy Azalea Hopes She'll Still Be "Gyrating in a Leotard at 35"|url=https://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201502/iggy-azalea-interview-grammys|work=[[GQ]]|date=20 January 2015|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The whole point was to make no compromises, but nothing's changed in terms of my creative vision," Azalea told the [[Associated Press]] on 18 March 2014, backstage at a show for [[Samsung Galaxy]] during [[South by Southwest|SXSW]]. "It's very kind of like [[Patrick Nagel]], powerful 80s androgynous women vibe." Azalea admitted not wanting to wait until September to launch the tour, "but because the arenas are so far in advanced booked, it was kind of their next slot." She also mentioned taking advantage of the free time to finish recording her second album, "I didn't anticipate having any time to completely finish it, but now that I have kind of the time, I'd love to have an album at the end of 2015."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Iggy Azalea Talks 'Trouble,' Tour Postponement &amp; More with Michelle and Booker|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/iggy-azalea-social-media-tour-album-britney-spears-29746908|website=abcnews.go.com|date=19 March 2015|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2015, Azalea told ''Billboard'' at the [[iHeartRadio Music Awards]], the tour was now under the creative guidance of a new production designer, Baz Halpin, who'd been seasoning the show with a post-apocalyptic vibe, "It's going to be maybe a bit like [[Blade Runner]], full of dark and '80s ridiculous fare but not in a clich√© way," also revealing she had parted ways with former tour producer AEG Live over creative differences earlier that month. "It's been great working with a new person who really understands my vision," Azalea said of Halpin, who had also fashioned the set for her performance of "[[Trouble (Iggy Azalea song)|Trouble]]" with [[Jennifer Hudson]] both at the iHeartRadio Awards and [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]] on the previous day. "It's taken some of the workload off me that he's able to understand what I'm trying to achieve instead of battling it, or it being lost in translation," Azalea continued. "Some things just work. With Baz, I really don't have to say it; he's thinking what I'm thinking, and it's great. I'm super-excited about the tour," she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iggy Azalea Is Done 'Battling' for What She Wants on Tour|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6516964/iggy-azalea-tour-iheartradio-awards-interview|work=Billboard|date=30 March 2015|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rescheduling and cancellation==
On 10 March 2015, it was announced the tour was being rescheduled "due to tour production delays", according to a statement from Def Jam Recordings. After reports surfaced that the tour was to be cancelled due to lack of promotion and conflict between her and management, Def Jam announced the decision "to accommodate for creative team availability and tour productions, it was determined that the tour will not be ready this spring." They continued, "It's important to Iggy that she delivers the show she envisaged to share with her fans and that requires more time in development." The spring tour was rescheduled to the fall, kicking off on September 18 in San Diego, California. A rep for Azalea also added that "there's no truth to the rumor that there's any conflict between her and her management."&lt;ref name="bb2015"/&gt; The press release issued by AEG Live also noted tickets for dates on the tour would be valid for the new dates in the fall, with the exception of the Baltimore, Las Vegas and Sacramento shows being canceled altogether, also indicating that the opening acts for the spring tour, Nick Jonas and Tinashe, would be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Varga|first=George|title=Iggy Azalea postpones her spring tour to fall|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2015/mar/10/iggy-azalea-reschedules-spring-tour-for-fall/|website=utsandiego.com|date=10 March 2015|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the announcement, a message was also posted from Azalea's official Twitter account: "The tour getting pushed back only means that it'll be way more amazing than it would've been in April. Good things take time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boardman|first=Madeline|title=Iggy Azalea Postpones The Great Escape Tour, Pushes It Months Back|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/iggy-azalea-postpones-the-great-escape-tour-pushes-it-months-back-2015103|work=[[Us Weekly]]|date=10 March 2015|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2015, it was announced that the entire tour had been cancelled, with ticket holders receiving an email that stated "The Iggy Azalea Great Escape Tour scheduled for this fall has been cancelled and refunds are available at point of purchase. There will be a new tour planned around Iggy's new record to be released in 2016 and we apologize for any inconvenience."&lt;ref name="XXL"/&gt; Azalea stated, "I'm sad and sorry to let my fans down," confirming plans to "be back on the road when the next album is done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iggy Azalea apologises to fans for cancelling tour|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/32943518/iggy-azalea-apologises-to-fans-for-cancelling-tour|work=bbc.co.uk|date=29 May 2015|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later issued a statement clarifying the cancellation saying she "had a different creative change of heart," in addition to being unable to find new opening acts available for the new dates she thought that would be a good fit for the tour and announcing she would also be taking a break to figure out the progression she wanted for her sound and visuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rizzo|first=Monica|title=Iggy Azalea Reveals Why She Canceled Her Upcoming Tour|url=http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/music/news/a31241/exclusive-iggy-azalea-on-why-she-canceled-her-upcoming-tour/|work=[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]|date=1 June 2015|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour promoter, AEG Live's senior VP Debra Rathwell, stated they never put its full marketing support behind the tour, explaining, "As we were not able to fill the support slots on the tour in the fall, due to so many artists already having commitments and working this summer, we had not advertised or promoted the new shows since last winter." She added, "The dates were selling well and were going to do fine,‚Äù standing by Azalea‚Äôs creative decision to take a break and not exploring a move to smaller venues by clarifying, "there was no reason to do so. AEG LIVE is committed to her and will be working with her on her new tour." Azalea‚Äôs booking agency, CAA, also issued a statement, "The lines of communication between Iggy, myself, and her [Turn First] managers Sarah [Stennett] and Nadia [Khan] have always been open. Iggy is an incredibly talented and creative artist with a clear vision, which she continuously shares with myself and her management team."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boardman|first=Madeline|title=Iggy Azalea Tour Cancellation Explained by AEG's Debra Rathwell &amp; CAA's Cara Lewis: Exclusive|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6590031/iggy-azalea-tour-cancellation-aeg-caa-explanation|work=Billboard|date=4 June 2015|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial performance==
After the tickets for the tour became available to the public for purchase on 19 December 2014, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported positive news for ticket sales on the primary and secondary markets. On 7 January 2015, a list compiled by [[TiqIQ]] revealed that tickets for Azalea's tour were ranked fourteenth for most expensive concert tickets of the year as of that month. On the secondary market, the average ticket price for Azalea's tour totals in about $167, therefore making the tickets some of the most expensive tickets available on the secondary market. Ticket prices for the tour managed to top artists such as the [[Foo Fighters]], but paled in comparison to artists such as [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Maroon 5]], and [[Taylor Swift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Jesse|title=Top 15 2015 Concert Tours at the Ticket Booth|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/fjlg45mhfj/14-iggy-azalea-nick-jonas-the-great-escape-tour-avg-price-167-19/|work=[[Forbes]]|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La masacre de San Bartolom√©, por Fran√ßois Dubois.jpg|380px|thumb|The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] (August 23, 1572) in Paris, France (painting by [[Fran√ßois Dubois]])]]
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being phased out due to its extreme size and impracticality. If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--Need to add: Jonestown Massacre--&gt;

The following is a list of events for which one of the commonly accepted names includes the word "[[massacre]]."&lt;ref name=Mikaberidze&gt;{{harvnb|Mikaberidze|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[:wikt:massacre|Massacre]]'' is defined in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' as "the indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people or (less commonly) animals; carnage, butchery, slaughter in numbers". It also states that the term is used "in the names of certain massacres of history".&lt;ref name=OED_N&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first recorded use in English of the word ''massacre'' in the name of an event is due to [[Christopher Marlow]] who in c. 1600 referred to what is now known as the  [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] as "The massacre at Paris"&lt;ref&gt;"Marlowe (c. 1600) (''title'') The massacre at Paris". [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
''Massacre'' can also be used as a verb, as "To kill (people or, less commonly, animals) in numbers, esp. brutally and indiscriminately".&lt;ref name=OED_V/&gt; The first usage of which was "(c. 1588) Men which make no conscience for gaine sake, to breake the law of the √¶ternall, and massaker soules (...) are dangerous subjects",&lt;ref name=OED_V&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, v.&lt;/ref&gt; and this usage is not recorded in this list.--&gt;

The purpose of the list is to trace such of the term "massacre" specifically.
There are many alternative terms with similar connotations, such as [[:wikt:butchery|butchery]], [[:wikt:carnage|carnage]],  [[:wikt:bloodbath|bloodbath]], [[:wikt:mass killing|mass killing]], [[wikt:atrocity|atrocity]], etc. as well as euphemisms such as ''[[Sicilian Vespers|Vespers]]'', ''[[Blutgericht]]'' or "attack", "incident", "tragedy" (etc.), use of which are outside the scope of this list.
''Massacre'' is also used figuratively to describe dramatic events that did not involve any deaths, such as the "[[Hilo massacre]]" and the "[[Saturday Night Massacre]]"; this usage is also outside of the scope of this list.

==List of events==
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being reduced in size due to current unwieldiness; events listed should only include events very widely, or overwhelmingly known under a name including the term "massacre".  If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--
;Inclusion criteria
#Inclusion in this list is based ''solely'' on evidence in multiple [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] that a name including the word "massacre" is one of the accepted names for that event. A reliable source that merely describes the event as ''being'' a massacre does not qualify the event for inclusion in this list. The word ''massacre'' must appear in the source as part of a ''name'' for the event.
#If possible, cite the date of the earliest authority giving the name in question under the "name" column
#Where there is dispute over this, discussion should be [[WP:MULTI|centralized]]. If it is discussed on the talk page of the article concerned, a link should be posted on the talk page of this list; if the discussion is on the talk page of this list, a link should be posted at the article's talk page.
;Notes
#Any name for the event which is established by use of [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] as being one of the accepted terms would usually also be included in the article on that event.
#Inclusion in this list does not ''of itself'' justify inclusion in the article, and nor does use of the name in an article justify inclusion in this list, because Wikipedia is not a [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable source]]. Both uses must be based directly on explicit references to the sources, which should be cited in footnotes. However, it is hard to envisage any situation where a name including "massacre" could be included in this list but not mentioned in an article on the event (or vice versa); if that situation should arise, both the uses should be carefully examined.--&gt;

The now-current name of "Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day" dates to the first half of the 19th century (Francis Alexander Durivage, ''A Popular Cyclopedia of History'', 1835), translating French 
''massacre de la Saint-Barth√©lemy'' which term had been in use since the 17th century (Louis Maimbourg, ''Histoire De La Ligue'', 1686).
Appositional "St. Bartholomew's Day massacre" (rather than genitival "Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day") first appears in American English in the first half of the 20th century (Oberlin Alumni Magazine 31.4, 1935, p. 102).&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Boston Massacre]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The event was almost immediately termed a "massacre" and used for propagandistic purposes, especially by [[Samuel Adams]]. A pamphlet with the title ''A short narrative of the horrid massacre in Boston, perpetrated in the evening of the fifth day of March, 1770, by soldiers of the 29th regiment, which with the 14th regiment were then quartered there; with some observations on the state of things prior to that catastrophe'' was printed still in 1770.
Appositional "Boston massacre" was in use by the early 1800s (Benjamin Austin, ''Constitutional Republicanism, in Opposition to Fallacious Federalism'', 1803, 
 [https://books.google.ch/books?id=fvY-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 p. 314]).
The term "[[Massacre Day]]" for the annual remembrance  held during 1771&amp;ndash;1783 dates to the late 19th century (Augusta De Grasse Stevens, ''Old Boston: An American Historical Romance'', 1888, p. 126) The 1772 "Massacre Day of Oration" by [[Joseph Warren]] was originally titled ''An Oration Delivered March 5th, 1772. At the Request of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston; to Commemorate the Bloody Tragedy of the Fifth of March, 1770''.

Questionable list entries also include such names for pre-1930s events which were coined only significantly later.

|During the 1990s, many [[Algerian Civil War#Village massacres|large-scale massacres of villagers]] in Algeria were perpetrated by groups attacking villages at night and cutting the throats of the inhabitants. The [[Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA) has avowed its responsibility for many of them. The massacres peaked in 1997 (with a smaller peak in 1994). According to a few reports former Algerian army officer, Habib Souaidia testified to his government's involvement in the massacres.

In fact, survivors who openly accuse the army for its failure to intervene also expressed no doubt about the identity of the killers, pointing to the Islamist guerrillas (e.g. Tuquoi 1997). Moreover, some of the troubling aspects of this story can be explained without reference to an army conspiracy. For example, in civil wars prisoners tend to be killed on the spot rather than taken prisoner (Laqueur 1998).11 Militiamen, the most likely to capture guerrillas, have openly stated that they took no prisoners (AI 1997b: 17). Journalists working in the field have found credible testimonies in support of the thesis that most massacres are organized by the rebels (Lecl√®re 1997; Tuquoi 1997 among others). European foreign ministries believe that it is Islamist guerrillas who are responsible for the massacres (Observer 9 February 1998). Although, it is impossible to know the full truth at this point (see Charef 1998), the assumption that many massacres were committed by the Islamist guerrillas seems plausible and is widely adopted by area experts (Addi 1998: 44) and other authors (Smith 1998: 27). Likewise, the reluctance of the army to intervene and stop some of these massacres is also beyond doubt."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mountjoy Prison.jpg|thumb|[[Mountjoy Prison]] where on October 31, 1973 three IRA members escaped in a hijacked helicopter.&lt;ref name="mountjoy"/&gt;]]
[[File:La-Sante-Prison-MCB.jpg|thumb|[[Prison de la Sant√©]] where on May 26, 1986 Michel Vaujour was flown out of the prison by his wife.&lt;ref name="lesante"/&gt;]]

A helicopter [[prison escape]] is made when an inmate escapes from a [[prison]] by means of a [[helicopter]]. This list includes prisoner escapes where a helicopter was used in an attempt to free prisoners from a place of internment, a prison or correctional facility.

One of the earliest instances of using a helicopter to escape a prison was the escape of Joel David Kaplan, nicknamed "Man Fan", on August 19, 1971 from the Santa Martha Acatitla in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;  Kaplan was a New York businessman who not only successfully escaped the prison but eventually escaped Mexico and went on to write a book about his experience, ''The 10-Second Jailbreak''.&lt;ref name="Kaplan_book"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eliot Asinof| authorlink = | title = The 10-Second Jailbreak: The helicopter escape of Joel David Kaplan|edition= 1973|page= 268 | publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston; 1st edition| isbn= 0-03-001011-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France has had more recorded helicopter escape attempts than any other country, with at least 11.&lt;ref name="aiton_2005"/&gt; One of the most notable French jail breaks occurred in 1986, when the wife of bank robber Michel Vaujour studied for months to learn how to fly a helicopter.  Using her newly acquired skills, she rented a white helicopter and flew low over Paris to pluck her husband off the roof of his fortress prison. Vaujour was later seriously wounded in a shootout with police, and his pilot wife was arrested.&lt;ref name="lesante"/&gt;

The record for most helicopter escapes goes to convicted murderer [[Pascal Payet]], who has used helicopters to escape from prisons in 2001, 2003, and most recently 2007.&lt;ref name="Grasse"&gt;{{cite news | date = 14 July 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6899274.stm | title = French inmate in second breakout | publisher = BBC News| accessdate = May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another multiple helicopter escapee is [[Vasilis Paleokostas]] who on February 22, 2009 escaped for the second time from the [[Korydallos Prison|same prison]].&lt;ref name="korydallos"/&gt; Because of this, many prisons have taken applicable precautions, such as nets or cables strung over open prison courtyards.&lt;ref name="Blade_1988"&gt;{{cite news |ref=harv|title= 3 Escapes caught after copter chase|first= |last=AP |authorlink=Associated Press |author2= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19880712&amp;id=4VtQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kw4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5669,2993901 |format= |newspaper= [[The Blade (Toledo)|Toledo Blade]]|publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date= Jul 12, 1988 |page= |pages=Cover and p.7 |at= |accessdate= June 8, 2014 |language= |quote= |archiveurl=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19880712&amp;id=4VtQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kw4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5669,2993901 |archivedate=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She demanded that he land in the Orsainville prison courtyard, where her boyfriend (awaiting extradition to California on a murder charge) was set to escape. The pilot, Brian Jenner, feigned a panic attack, put the helicopter through some rough maneuvers and was then able to convince Paquet, in the back seat of the Jet Ranger, to turn over her shotgun and her knife. Jenner then gave her the choice of any landing spot, except the prison. She chose to go back to the airport.

The pilot then explained, in great detail, exactly where they were and where they would be landing on arrival at the Quebec City airport. He added that the police would surely be aware by then, that she had hijacked the helicopter but would not yet be aware that she had given up her arms to the pilot. All the time Jenner was squeezing the transmit button on his cyclic stick and the tower was picking up all the details. The moment they touched down at the airport, the woman bailed from the helicopter but the police, who had been advised of the situation by the control tower, were hiding out all over the place and captured Paquet within seconds.

|Trikala Prison, [[Trikala]]

|{{sortname|Panagiotis|Vlastos |nolink=1}}
|The chartered helicopter&amp;nbsp;‚Äî carrying two armed passengers, a pilot and a technician&amp;nbsp;‚Äî first tried to rip off the chicken-wire fence surrounding Trikala prison with a hook dangling from a rope. But that didn't work, so a rope was lowered down to whisk away Panagiotis Vlastos. Another prisoner, an unnamed Albanian national also in the courtyard at the time, may also have been part of the escape plan.

At the same time, the armed passengers used AK47 assault rifles and Uzi submachine gun to fire on the prison guards.  One guard, who was inside a post, was slightly injured by shards of flying glass. He and others returned fire, injuring Vlastos, who had managed to climb into the helicopter, as well as the helicopter's technician. Vlastos fell from a height of about 3 meters (10 feet) into the courtyard, and the helicopter was eventually grounded in the parking lot.

Prison officials told TV stations Mega and NET that they recovered well over 500 bullets fired from the helicopter. The Ministry of Justice, in statements describing the escape attempt, added that the helicopter passengers also carried, but did not use, "improvised explosive devices."

|Two inmates successfully escaped from the Saint-J√©r√¥me Detention Facility by clambering up a rope from an awaiting helicopter. The helicopter had been hijacked at gunpoint by two accomplices and took them to a waiting vehicle, in which they drove to a chalet in the Chertsey area and forced their way in. Local residents reported the incident, and only a few hours later the suspects again drove off, but were soon surrounded by police vehicles, at which point they exited their vehicle and opened fire, with the police returning fire. Fleeing on foot, they were soon captured and the last of the suspects was apprehended overnight. There were no serious injuries reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2013/03/17/quebec-prisoners-escape-saint-jerome.html | location=Saint-J√©r√¥me | work=CBC News | first=CBC | last=News | title=Quebec manhunt on for fugitives who fled prison in helicopter | date=March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Pola Roupa&lt;br /&gt;Nikos Maziotis
|A helicopter pilot foiled an attempted hijack of his apparatus by an armed woman who authorities believe wanted to use it to help convicted terrorist Nikos Maziotis escape from Korydallos prison.  
In 2013, Maziotis was convicted in absentia to 50 years in prison for setting up the now-defunct Revolutionary Struggle terrorist group, simple complicity in attempted murder, and a series of attacks claimed by group. He had been on the run since 2012 and was arrested in July 2014.
According to the anti-terrorist squad, the helicopter was leased by a woman who has since been identified by the pilot as Maziotis‚Äô wife, Pola Roupa, at the municipality of Ermionida, in the Argolis regional unit of the Peloponnese on Sunday, and was supposed to fly to the island of Kythnos after picking up six more passengers.
Describing the incident in an announcement, anti-terror police said that the helicopter was near Athens, when the woman pulled out a gun and told the pilot to redirect the aircraft towards the city. The pilot immediately tried to disarm the woman which caused him to lose control of the helicopter and start to lose altitude. During the struggle, the woman shot at him three times without injuring him. Instead, the bullets pierced the instruments. The pilot managed to land the helicopter at an uninhabited mountainous area near the town of Thiva. The woman immediately opened the door and ran away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helicopter pilot foils hijack attempt, part of an escape plan for convicted terrorist|url=http://www.amna.gr/english/article/12946/Helicopter-pilot-foils-hijack-attempt--part-of-an-escape-plan-for-convicted-terrorist/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous historical escapes==
[[File:Famous adventures and prison escapes of the civil war (1893) (14573020789).jpg|{{largethumb}}|On November 27, 1863, [[John Hunt Morgan]] and six of his officers, most notably [[Thomas Hines]], escaped from their cells in the [[Ohio Penitentiary]] by digging a tunnel from Hines' cell into the inner yard and then ascending a wall with a rope made from bunk coverlets and a bent poker iron.]]

There have been many infamous escapes throughout history:

===13th century===
* In 1244, whilst imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]], [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr]] crafted a make-shift rope made of bed sheets and cloths, lowered it, and climbed down. However, because he was heavy, the rope broke and as a consequence, he fell to his death.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8QY7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT135&amp;dq=gruffydd+ap+llywelyn+fawr+death+rope&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2i-Gvif7XAhVE-qQKHbfaD2sQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=gruffydd%20ap%20llywelyn%20fawr%20death%20rope&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
* In 1621 Dutch author [[Hugo Grotius]] escaped from [[Loevestein|Loevestein Castle]] where he was held captive by hiding himself inside a book chest. He was then smuggled outside.

===18th century===

* Englishman [[Jack Sheppard]] took to theft and burglary in 1723, and was arrested and imprisoned five times in 1724 but escaped four times, making him a notorious public figure and wildly popular with the poorer classes.
* The Italian author and adventurer [[Giacomo Casanova]] escaped from prison in 1757.

===19th century===
*In the [[Libby Prison Escape]], during the [[American Civil War]], over 109 [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[POWs]] broke out of a building at [[Libby Prison]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]] on the night between February 9 and February 10, 1864. All but 50 (two were drowned in the nearby [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]) successfully reached back to Union lines.
*The notorious outlaw [[Billy The Kid]] managed to escape from prison in 1881, but was captured and shot by [[Pat Garrett]] only a few months later.

===1900‚Äì1950===
* In 1901, [[Lum You]] was convicted of murder and sentenced to death by a [[Pacific County, Washington]] court.  He enjoyed great public sympathy, including from county officials, who supposedly allowed him to escape by leaving his cell door unlocked at night. He eventually seized the opportunity, but within a few days he either gave himself up or was recaptured.&lt;ref name="stevens"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sydney |last=Stevens |title=Behind Bars in Old Pacific County, 1902: The Hanging of Lum You |newspaper=Chinook Observer |date=June 7, 2011 |url=http://www.chinookobserver.com/news/history/the-hanging-of-lum-you/article_303b3b2a-912f-11e0-a1e7-001cc4c002e0.html |accessdate=August 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503121544/http://www.chinookobserver.com/news/history/the-hanging-of-lum-you/article_303b3b2a-912f-11e0-a1e7-001cc4c002e0.html |archivedate=May 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="espy"&gt;{{cite book | first=Willard R. | last=Espy | authorlink=Willard R.

* German Naval Air Service Kapit√§nleutnant [[Gunther Pl√ºschow]] escaped from the [[Donington Hall]] [[prisoner of war camp]] in 1915.
* [[Frederick Mors]], an Austrian-born American serial killer, was declared insane and placed into the Matteawan Institution for the Insane in the United States in 1915. He escaped in 1916 and was never seen again.
*Leonard T. Fristoe was imprisoned for double murder in 1920 of a police Constable and a deputy Sherriff in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.odmp.org/officer/17466-constable-arthur-j-st-clair ODMP memorial]&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped from Nevada State Prison in 1923. He lived for nearly 46 years under the allias of Claude R. Willis, before being turned in by his own son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-11000/longest-prison-escape/ |title=Longest prison escape |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving several years in prison he died of natural causes .
* [[John Dillinger]] served time at the Indiana State Penitentiary at Michigan City, until 1933, when he was paroled. Within four months, he was back in jail in [[Lima, Ohio]], but his gang sprang him, killing the jailer, Sheriff Jessie Sarber. Most of the gang was captured again by the end of the year in [[Tucson, Arizona]], due to a fire at the Historic Hotel Congress. Dillinger alone was sent to the Lake County jail in [[Crown Point, Indiana]]. He was to face trial for the suspected killing of police officer William O'Malley during a bank shootout in [[East Chicago, Indiana]], some time after his escape from jail. During this time on trial, a famous photograph was taken of Dillinger putting his arm on prosecutor Robert Estill's shoulder when suggested to him by reporters.
* On March 3, 1934, Dillinger escaped from the "escape-proof" (as it was dubbed by local authorities at the time) Crown Point, Indiana county jail, which was guarded by many police officers and national guardsmen. Newspapers reported that Dillinger had escaped using a fake gun made from wood, blackened and shined with shoe polish.
* French prisoner [[Ren√© Belbeno√Æt]] escaped from the penal colony of French Guiana on March 2, 1935 when he and five others took to the sea with a boat they had bought. After a series of daring adventures, during which all of the other escapees were captured, he reached United States in 1937. In 1938 his account, ''Dry Guillotine'', was published. Belbeno√Æt had written it in French and it was translated in English by Preston Rambo. It went through 14 printings in less than a year.
* Japanese murderer [[Yoshie Shiratori]] broke out of prison four times between the 1930s and 1940s. A novel and TV-drama ''Hagoku'' was based on his true story.
* [[Fort San Crist√≥bal (Spain)|Fort San Crist√≥bal]] is located on the top of the mountain San Crist√≥bal, which is very close (4&amp;nbsp;km) to [[Pamplona]], [[Spain]]. Built inside the mountain and obsolete since its opening in 1919, due to its weakness against aviation, it served as a prison. On May 22, 1938, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], around 30 prisoners organised a mutiny for a massive prison break. 792 prisoners fled but only three succeeded in getting to the [[France|French]] border; 585 were arrested, 211 died and 14 of the arrested who were considered the leaders were sentenced to death. Most fugitives were intercepted during the following days. In 1988, a sculpture was erected to honour the memory of the Republican people dead there. The fort ceased to be a prison in 1945.
* [[Colditz Castle]] was used as an "escape-proof" prisoner-of-war camp during [[World War II]], but over the course of 300 escape attempts, 130 prisoners escaped.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Thirty escapees eventually managed to reach friendly territory. The men had tunneled, disguised themselves as guards, workmen or women, sneaked away through sewer drains, and even planned to use a glider to get over the wall.
* [[Andr√© Devigny]], a French resistance fighter during World War II, escaped [[Fort Montluc|Montluc Military Prison]] in Lyons with his cellmate in April 1943.
* French author [[Henri Charri√®re]] tried to escape in vain several times, but eventually was successful in 1943. His story, ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'', was published and filmed [[Papillon (1973 film)|under the same name]].
* In [[Stalag Luft III|the Great Escape]], 76 Allied POWs (primarily Commonwealth airmen) escaped from [[Stalag Luft III]] during World War II. 73 of the escapees were captured and fifty of them were executed by the [[Gestapo]], while only three succeeded in reaching neutral territories.
*In the [[Cowra breakout]], at least 545 out of approximately 1000 Japanese POWs escaped from Number 12 POW Compound at Cowra on the night of 4 August 1944. Out of the roughly 500 escapees, 231 died  and 108 were wounded. 31 killed themselves and 12 were burnt to death in huts set on fire by the Japanese. Sixteen of the wounded showed signs of attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="memorial"&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Gavin|year=1963|chapter-url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070308--1-.pdf|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1070206/|title=The Final Campaigns|chapter=Appendix 5 ‚Äì The Prison Break at Cowra, August 1944|series=Australia in the War of 1939‚Äì1945.

*In the [[Great Papago Escape]], over 25 German POWs escaped by tunneling out of [[Camp Papago Park|Camp Papago Park POW facility]], near [[Phoenix, Arizona]], on the night of December 23, 1944. They then fled into the surrounding desert but because the rivers in Arizona were mostly dry and had not been navigable for decades, most of them were recaptured without bloodshed over the next few weeks.
*In the [[Acre Prison break]], 28 members of the Jewish underground groups [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] escaped from [[Acre Prison]] in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Mandatory Palestine]] (now [[Israel]]) on May 4, 1947.

It is unknown if any of the helicopters sustained any damage in this first incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jqhY55584EVVKxIIbOeHrLWeoPvA Pakistani troops twice repel US choppers: officials] AFP, 23 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7628890.stm Pakistan troops 'repel US raid'] -''BBC News'', 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty minutes later, two gunships attempted to cross the border again at the same place. Pakistani regular and [[Frontier Corps]] troops fired warning shots into the air and away from the helicopters, causing the helicopters to turn back without attacking any targets in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Pak-troops-fire-at-US-helicopters-in-N-Waziristan/364409/ Pak troops fire at US helicopters in N Waziristan] ‚Äì ''ExpressIndia.com'', 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
An Eric Trump Foundation staff biography of Patton states that she was involved in casting the 2012 and 2014 seasons of ''[[The Celebrity Apprentice]]''.&lt;ref name="ETFBIO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirkland|first1=Allegra|title=Trump's Onetime Rivals Resurface For RNC's 'Make America First Again' Night|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/speakers-convention-make-america-first-again-night|work=[[Talking Points Memo]]|accessdate=November 16, 2017|date=July 20, 2016|quote=played a key role in casting the 2012 and 2014 seasons of "The Celebrity Apprentice."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the AP questioned the campaign's citation of her as a Trump Organization executive, her title on the Eric Trump Foundation's website and her profile on the LinkedIn service was changed to "vice president of the Eric Trump Foundation." That position did not appear on the foundation's most recent tax filing for 2014, which said Patton was one of 16 unpaid directors who devote approximately one hour per week to the charity. |title=Few if any minority senior execs in Trump's empire |first=Jeff |last=Horwitz |first2=Jake |last2=Pearson |date=June 16, 2016 |url=https://apnews.com/426e763d7a38472d9c1df8b799725084/few-if-any-minority-senior-execs-trumps-empire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her HUD financial disclosures stated that she had been a vice president and a board member at the Eric Trump Foundation from January 2009 to January 2017, and she speaks of being with the Trump family since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trump|first=Donald J.|date=February 1, 2017|title=Remarks at an African American History Month Listening Session|url=|journal=Daily Compilation of Presidential Documents|publisher=Superintendent of Documents|volume=|page=5|pages=|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=10 Must Reads for the CRE Industry Today (June 14, 2017)|last=|first=|date=June 14, 2017|work=National Real Estate Investor|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|quote=Eric Trump Foundation Probe Casts Shadow Over HUD "The New York State Attorney General's investigation into possible misuse of funds at the Eric Trump Foundation is casting a shadow over the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where a former foundation vice president now works as a key adviser to Secretary Ben Carson.

In May 2016, during Donald Trump's 2016 Presidential campaign, Patton narrated a [[YouTube]] video called "The Trump Family I Know ‚Äì A Black Female Trump Executive Speaks Out," in which she defended Trump against accusations that he was racist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention; the official convention program listed her position as "Vice President of The Eric Trump Foundation and Senior Assistant to Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump, Jr."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=2016 GOP Convention Program for Wednesday, July 20|last=|first=|date=July 20, 2016|work=U.S. Newswire|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|quote=Lynne Patton, The Eric Trump Foundation  Lynne Patton is Vice President of The Eric Trump Foundation and Senior Assistant to Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump, Jr. As VP, Lynne works in tandem with the Executive Director/President of the Foundation to oversee all operations, volunteers, events, outreach, social media, vendors, and corporate partnerships.

Additionally, the company is a preferred event supplier at some of London‚Äôs most precious and historic buildings including [[Somerset House]], [[Natural history museum|the Natural History Museum]], [[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]], [[Worshipful Company of Barbers#Barber-Surgeons.27 Hall and Arms|Barber-Surgeons‚Äô Hall]] and [[Middle Temple|Middle Temple Hall]].

==History==
In 1980, in a flat in [[Welling]], South East London, David Pacy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=20080325125433W2407&lt;/ref&gt; Managing Director and Brian Rottger, Technical Director founded Metrovideo. Its principal activity was tape sales to advertising agencies such as [[J. Walter Thompson|JWT]] (formerly J. Walter Thompson Co.), [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] and [[Young &amp; Rubicam|Y&amp;R]] (formerly Young &amp; Rubicam).

The company soon relocated to Landsdown Road in Stockwell and then, in April 1984, to the Old Bacon Factory in Great Suffolk Street,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetimenow.com/united_kingdom/london/audio_visual_services-92/metrovideo_ltd-1492781&lt;/ref&gt; London SE1.

In early 1986, the business was sold to WPP plc, a British, multinational advertising and public relations company founded by [[Sir Martin Sorrell|Martin Sorrell]]. Metrovideo was the third company to be acquired by the Group.

Metrovideo later acquired a number of regional video businesses for itself including Horizon Video and Still Frame Video in the South of England and Teletape Anglia in [[Cambridge]]. This expanded the sales, installation, service, AV hire and technical event production&lt;ref&gt;http://www.incentivetravel.co.uk/news/venuesevents/22615-variety-hosts-an-evening-of-magic-at-vinopolis&lt;/ref&gt;| areas of the company. A broadcast division of the company was located in offices in London‚Äôs [[Soho]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/metro-to-expand-broadcast-arm/164686.article&lt;/ref&gt;   All of these businesses traded under the Metro Group banner.

In 1990, Metro launched a full-service production business called G Force which later changed its name to Clever Media.  Clever Media was then merged into another WPP operating company.

In 1997, the company extended its operation into [[Scotland]] by establishing an office and equipment warehouse in [[Edinburgh]].

In 2007 the Company was renamed as Metro Broadcast Ltd.   In 2012 Metro Broadcast relocated its head office and main business premises to its current location in Oval, South London.  In 2014 it acquired additional workshop space to house its set and staging department.  Today, the London business is led by Managing Director Mary Metcalfe&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citmagazine.com/article/1294808/metro-broadcast-appoints-new-creative-lead&lt;/ref&gt; and the Scottish business is led by Managing Director Oscar Askin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eventindustrynews.co.uk/brand-marketing/metro-ecosse-appointed-national-theatre-scotland-help-deliver-24-hour-live-streamed-event-theme-independence&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''news bureau''' is an office for gathering or distributing [[news]]. Similar terms are used for specialized bureaux, often to indicate geographic location or scope of coverage: a ‚ÄòTokyo bureau‚Äô refers to a given news operation's office in [[Tokyo]]; 'foreign bureau' is a generic term for a news office set up in a country other than the primary operations center; a ‚ÄòWashington bureau‚Äô is an office, typically located in [[Washington, D.C.]], that covers news related to national politics in the [[United States]]. The person in charge of a news bureau is often called the bureau chief.

The term is distinct from a news desk, which refers to the editorial function of assigning reporters and other staff, and otherwise coordinating, news stories, and sometimes the physical desk where that occurs, but without regard to the geographic location or overall operation of the news organization.  For example, a foreign bureau is located in a foreign country and refers to all creative and administrative operations that take place there, whereas a foreign desk describes only editorial functions and may be located anywhere, possibly as an organizational unit within the news organization's home office.

==Operation of news bureaux==
A news bureau is traditionally operated out of an office by a single news outlet such as a radio, television, or newspaper news program.  A single news company such as [[CNN]] or [[NPR]] may use a single bureau and office staff for all of its programs, and even those of [[subsidiary]] or other affiliated companies.  For convenience, to save money and space, and to ensure the availability of necessary services (such as video feeds and studios), different companies may share an office space or co-locate at a single office building.  [[News agencies]] may also operate news bureaux, and major public relations sources (such as governments, large companies, or advocacy groups) may operate news bureaux of their own to create, rather than simply report, news stories.

==History of news bureaux==
&lt;!--
===Origin===
insert content here
--&gt;

===Decline===

Traditional [[news media]], particularly [[television news]] and [[newspapers]], have cut the number and size of news bureaux in recent decades for several reasons.  They face declining profitability due to increasing competition from Internet news sources, and therefore have less money to spend on news-gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2007-11-12|title=NBC Says Viewers Won‚Äôt Notice Cuts in News Staff|author=Jaques Steinberg|date=October 20, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/business/media/20nbc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers rely increasingly on cooperative arrangements with counterparts elsewhere, and often will accept stories from their sister organizations rather than investigating stories themselves.  Similarly, smaller newspapers may formally affiliate to sponsor cooperative bureaux that operate as [[press pool]]s to serve more than one news organization (and sometimes a large number of organizations) from a single office.  When news sources combine operations following a [[merger]] or other [[Consolidation (business)|business consolidation]], the surviving company often combines or eliminates redundant bureaux.  Growing [[multiculturalism]] has facilitated this process: rather than demanding a reporter from their own country or locale who has been sent on assignment, news audiences have come to tolerate or even expect to see stories in remote locations covered by people who live locally; this empowers the audience to make their own judgments about any apparent cultural difference between themselves and the news subjects, rather than leaving the function of cultural interpretation entirely up to the reporter.

The often-criticized practice of [[parachute journalism]] allows [[News media]] to cover stories remotely using journalists who are generalists rather than more specialized field experts.  Rather than leaving journalists in place waiting for breaking news to occur, smaller staff can be assigned as needed to wherever there are breaking stories, either by commuting to the physical location or by synthesizing reports from remote sources.  An even more controversial practice, sometimes described as a reaction to declining resources rather than a legitimate cost-saving measure, is to rely on and reprint information from [[press release]]s written by [[public relations]] professionals working for people or companies that are the subject of an article, or have an interest in an article, without spending the resources to verify or conduct independent research on the matter.  Another practice that limits news bureaux is [[embedded reporter|embedded reporting]], whereby [[war correspondent]]s travel under the care of military units rather than at their own direction.  The ability to quickly and safely travel throughout a war zone, and to obtain interviews with soldiers and coverage of important conflicts, appeals to news media, but at the cost of journalistic independence and, according to some, objectivity.

==Nontraditional bureaux==

The interaction between professional journalists, witnesses, and news subjects has evolved considerably.  Whereas news subjects and bystanders were once treated simply as [[witnesses]] to be interviewed for a [[news story]], media have now accepted them as part of the news process.  There are many antecedents to [[Citizen journalism]].  For example, meteorologists would count on amateurs to gather weather data to report, or interview willing subjects unrelated to a news story for "[[man on the street]]" interviews.  As early as the 1930s the [[Soviet Union]] encouraged millions of amateur [[People's correspondent]]s to expose corruption and otherwise report on news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14|publisher=Moscow Times|date= July 3, 2006|title=Proletarian Bloggers Celebrate a Milestone|author=Carl Schreck|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2006/07/03/002.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, media, unable to respond quickly enough to obtain compelling coverage of natural disasters and weather phenomena such as [[tornadoes]] would count on hobbyists for photographs and film footage.  With improvements in technology and as [[video camera]]s and [[Videophone|video-equipped cell phone]]s became widely available, they set up formal programs to gather material from nonprofessionals.  For example, in August, 2006, [[CNN]] launched "CNN Exchange", by which the public is encouraged to submit "I-Reports" comprising photographs, videos, or news accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=C/Net|title=CNN snatching page out of YouTube's book|author=Greg Sandoval|date=July 30, 2006|url=http://www.news.com/2100-1025-6100139.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel|accessdate=2007-11-14|title=CNN welcoming citizen journalists|author=Scott Leith|date=August 1, 2006|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=478319}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently newspapers have incorporated [[blogs]], once seen as a threat to conventional news practice, either by creating blogs of their own (and deputizing local or field-specific bloggers as a second, lower-paid tier among their recognized staff of [[independent contractor]]s) or by covering blogs as news sources.

In 2006 [[Reuters]] opened its first virtual news Bureau, staffing real-life reporters in a virtual office in [[Second Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14|publisher=USA Today|title=Reuters opens virtual news bureau in 'Second Life'|date=October 10, 2006|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-10-16-reuters-second-life_x.htm?POE=TECISVA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[CNN]] followed suit in October 2007, but took a citizen journalism approach, allowing residents of Second Life to submit their own reportage.&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14 |publisher=Media Week |title=CNN To Launch Bureau in Second Life Virtual World |author=Mike Shields |date=October 29, 2007 |url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664297 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031060212/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664297 |archivedate=2007-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the news audience of Second World is relatively small, and declining, media consider it a training ground for themselves and participants, applicable to future virtual news projects.&lt;ref name="mw"/&gt;

'''Pete Lawrence''' is a conceptualist, social entrepreneur, recording artist, DJ, event organiser, music programmer writer and broadcaster based in the UK.

==Background==

Lawrence created the concept for [[The Big Chill (music festival)|The Big Chill]] in February 1994, originally as a new type of Sunday multimedia club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.petelawrence.net/the_big_chill|title=The Big Chill|newspaper=Pete Lawrence|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his partner at the time, Katrina Larkin, he put together an event at which people were able to network and enjoy an experimental, audio-visual environment, as part of a multi-faceted eight-hour event. It was the first London club to have its own website and to offer free internet access and was initially noted for its ambient and downtempo soundtrack, contributing to the development of the chill out‚Äô boom at the turn of the Millennium.

This ‚Äúfestival in a club‚Äù concept adapted relatively easily to an outdoors setting and in 1995 Pete Lawrence and Katrina Larkin staged the first Big Chill Festival, reaching a capacity of 35,000 by 2007 as one of the top UK festivals. He was also instrumental in taking The Big Chill concept to several locations worldwide in collaboration with The [[British Council]].

Lawrence was also involved in The Big Chill's expansion into opening London venues. The Big Chill Bar in Brick Lane, was followed in autumn 2006 with the three story Big Chill House in Kings Cross as well as releasing his own recording project [[Chilled By Nature]]. It included a number of EPs, one-off tracks and collaborations, live performances at The Big Chill festival, and the debut album ''Under One Sun''.

In the mid 80s, he established the [[Cooking Vinyl]] label and recorded 'The Texas Campfire Tapes' with singer-songwriter Michelle Shocked which went to No 1 in the UK Independent album charts. He co-edited the book ''Crossfade - a Big Chill Anthology'' (Serpents Tail). In December 2007, Pete Lawrence and Katrina Larkin were voted into Time Out's Top 100 ‚Äòmovers and shakers‚Äô.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.virtualfestivals.com/Pete-Lawrence|title=Pete Lawrence - Virtual Festivals|last=Jasinski|first=Mr|newspaper=Virtual Festivals|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence stood down as a director and shareholder of Chillfest (The Big Chill) in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/oct/09/pete-lawrence-big-chill|title=My greatest mistake: Pete Lawrence|last=Snowdon|first=Graham|date=2010-10-08|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Lawrence's new project [https://campfireconvention.uk Campfire Convention] launched as a social network and membership based events community. Campfire's aims include :
Building a social movement around values, bringing people together to find common ground, real life meet ups, connections and conversations : campaigning, initiatives and engagement at local level via Campfire Beacons, building resources for reference and activism, pioneering a new journalistic media voice, creating new models for a post-capitalist world which reward engagement and global cultural exchange.

Campfire's first outdoor Convention was in August 2016 in Michaelchurch Escley, Herefordshire which included keynote addresses from their patron Brian Eno and peace activist Scilla Elworthy as well as panels, thinkshops, music, art and yoga.

The '''Rio Nu√±ez incident''' or '''Rio Nu√±ez affair''' was an [[international incident]] which occurred on the [[Nunez river|Rio Nu√±ez]] near [[Bok√©]], in modern-day [[Guinea]], in 1849. The incident occurred when vessels of a joint [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[French Second Empire|French]] naval force fired on two [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] traders in the area. 

During the 1840s and 50s, [[West Africa]] was the site of fledgling colonial rivalry between European powers. The Nu√±ez region lay between the [[French conquest of Senegal|French colony of Senegal]] and [[Gambia Colony and Protectorate|British Gambia]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. French traders were increasingly challenged by commercial trading expeditions from Britain, Belgium and America.

The French regional commander, [[Louis √âdouard Bou√´t-Willaumez|√âdouard Bou√´t-Willaumez]], hoped that the Nu√±ez region could be formally annexed as a protectorate of the [[French colonial empire]]. The attack, far from securing the region for France, went contrary to Bou√´t-Willaumez's plans. Both France and Belgium led a [[cover-up]]. Attempts by the British Prime Minister, [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Viscount Palmerston]], to force France to pay reparations for the incident were ultimately unsuccessful and the affair lasted four years.

The incident formed part of the "Prelude to the [[Scramble for Africa]]" and, as Bou√´t-Willaumez had hoped, did lead to increased French control of the Nu√±ez. In 1866, French forces occupied Bok√©. The affair was therefore one of the first signs of future French hegemony in West Africa in what would become [[French West Africa]] (AOF).

A '''social media newsroom''' is a company resource, set up to increase the functionality and usability of the traditional online newsroom. 

Social media newsrooms (SMNs) are intended to encourage dialogue and information sharing. Unlike online newsrooms, content is accessible to more than just journalists, but to all those with whom the company engages such as bloggers, their prospects, customers, business partners and investors. It gives these stakeholders access to news, public relations announcements, images, audio, video and other multimedia files.

In addition to posting press releases and corporate news, companies can integrate other social content from sites such as [[YouTube]], [[Flickr]] and [[Slideshow]] as well as streams from corporate [[Twitter]] accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=658:hold-the-front-page&amp;catid=81:november-2009&amp;Itemid=112 Communicate magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225210651/http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=658:hold-the-front-page&amp;catid=81:november-2009&amp;Itemid=112 |date=2012-02-25 }} Hold the Front Page, Communicate magazine, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional tools for journalists such as corporate fast facts, leadership information, a multimedia library, financial information, awards and other recent media coverage are also included in an SMN.

Examples of companies effectively using social media newsrooms include [[Opel Group]], Pressat, [[First Direct]], [[MyNewsdesk]], [[Scania AB|Scania]] and [[Newport Beach]].{{cn|date=March 2012}}

'''Sustainable event management''' (also known as '''event greening''') is the process used to produce an [[wikt:event|event]] with particular concern for environmental, economic and social issues. [[Sustainability]] in event management incorporates socially and [[environmentally responsible]] decision making into the planning, organisation and implementation of, and participation in, an event. It involves including sustainable development principles and practices in all levels of event organisation, and aims to ensure that an event is hosted responsibly. It represents the total package of interventions at an event, and needs to be done in an integrated manner. Event greening should start at the inception of the project, and should involve all the key role players, such as clients, organisers, venues, sub-contractors and suppliers.

== History ==
The first time that environmental concerns were raised by the public was at the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Albertville Winter Olympics]] in France, which led to the first ‚Äògreen Games‚Äô in [[1994 Winter Olympics|Lillehammer, Norway]], in 1994. The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee received the [http://www.unep.org/sport_env/about.aspx UNEP Global 500 Award] for setting environmental standards which were absent from previous Olympic games.

The Centennial Olympic Congress, Congress of Unity, held in Paris in 1994, recognised the importance of the environment and sustainable development, which led to the inclusion of a paragraph in Rule 2 of the Olympic Charter. The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) has acknowledged its particular responsibility in terms of promoting sustainable development, and regards the environment as the third dimension of Olympism, alongside sport and culture. This led to its decision in 1995 to create an [http://www.olympic.org/sport-environment-commission IOC Sport and Environment Commission].&lt;ref&gt;International Olympic Committee, Sport and Environment Commission, http://www.olympic.org/sport-environment-commission&lt;/ref&gt; 

Environmental Guidelines for the Summer Olympics were developed to guide Olympic hosts to ensure that facilities are constructed in a more environmentally friendly manner. The Guidelines were successfully used in the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. As a result, the organizers of the Sydney Games were honoured with the Global 500 Award in 2001 for organizing the greenest games ever. Since then, other major sports events have also considered their environmental impact. 

A major aspect of [http://www.unep.org/sport_env/ UNEP]‚Äôs work is with the IOC. A cooperative agreement was signed in 1994 with IOC and an Agenda 21 for Sport and Environment developed. Since 2002, UNEP has participated in a task force of the UN Secretary-General on the use of sport for the implementation of the United Nations Development Goals.  UNEP also supports the IOC in organizing world conferences and regional seminars on sport and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, Sport and Environment, http://www.unep.org/sport_env/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2006 FIFA World CupTM in Germany, Green Goal was launched, which was also implemented in South Africa for the 2010 FIFA World CupTM.  The Host City [https://web.archive.org/web/20100608185533/http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/greengoal/Pages/default.aspx Cape Town Green Goal] programme had been awarded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Sport and Environment Award. Nominated by [https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/news/newsid=1476740/index.html FIFA], the award recognised the efforts of the Host City [[Cape Town]] to mitigate negative environmental impacts of the FIFA World Cup and to maximise a positive environmental and social legacy.&lt;ref&gt;City of Cape Town, Green Goal Programme, {{cite web |url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/GreenGoal/Pages/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608185533/http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/greengoal/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=2010-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Event greening is however not only limited to sports events, and other examples include the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD), [[Johannesburg]] 2002, and [[COP15|UNFCCC 15th Conference of the Parties]] (COP15) held in [[Copenhagen]] in 2010.



==Monitoring and evaluation ==
[[Monitoring and Evaluation|Monitoring and evaluation]] is an essential component of event greening, and should be used to make continuous improvement. A detailed plan needs to be in place to ensure that information is gathered on all aspects of the event ‚Äì before, during, and also after the event. This ensures that information is available to understand the effects of greening interventions (e.g. to what extent was water used, and how did water-saving measures reduce water use), as well as the potential improvements to future event-greening initiatives.

With large events it is best to ensure an independent report, which complies with international standards, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalreporting.org/reporting/sector-guidance/event-organizers/Pages/default.as&lt;/ref&gt; The GRI Event Organizers Supplement provides organizations in the sector with a tailored version of GRI‚Äôs Reporting Guidelines. It includes the original Guidelines, which set out the Reporting Principles, Disclosures on Management Approach and Performance Indicators for economic, environmental and social issues. The Event Organizers Supplement‚Äôs capture the issues that matter most for event organizers to be reported on:
* Site selection
* Transport of attendees
* Recruiting and training of the event workforce, participants and volunteers
* Sourcing of materials, supplies and services
* Managing impacts on communities, natural environments, and local and global economies.
* Planning and managing potential legacies
* Accessibility of an event

The British Standard ([http://www.bsigroup.co.uk/en/Assessment-and-Certification-services/Management-systems/Standards-and-Schemes/BS-8901/ BS 8901]) has been developed specifically for the events industry with a purpose of helping the industry to operate in a more sustainable manner. The standard defines the requirements for a sustainability event management system to ensure an enduring and balanced approach to economic activity, environmental responsibility and social progress relating to events.

It requires organizations to identify and understand the effects that their activities have on the environment, on society and on the economy both within the organization and the wider economy; and put measures in place to minimize the negative effects.  These standards will however be replaced by the International Standard ([http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1281 ISO 20121]) for Sustainability Management Systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6533">[[File:Lockerbie disaster memorial.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A memorial is often established to remember lives lost in a tragedy such as the [[Lockerbie air disaster]]]]
A '''tragedy''' is an event of great loss, usually of human life.  Such an event is said to be ''tragic''. Traditionally the event would require "some element of moral failure, some flaw in character, or some extraordinary combination of elements"&lt;ref&gt;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920405&amp;slug=1484688&lt;/ref&gt; to be tragic.

Not all death is considered a tragedy. Rather it is a precise set of symptoms surrounding the loss that define it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crisis Intervention Training for Disaster Workers: An Introduction |last=Doherty |first=George W. |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=12 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of factors that define a death as ''tragic''.

An event in which a massive number of deaths occur may be seen as a tragedy. This can be re-enforced by media attention or other public outcry.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=1 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tragedy does not necessarily involve [[massacre|massive death]]. The death of a single person, e.g., a public figure or a child, may be seen as a tragedy.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1/&gt; The person need not necessarily have been [[celebrity|famous]] before death.

==Factors that make death a tragedy==
Generally, the label of "tragedy" is given to an event based on public perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=11 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of factors that can make a death be considered a tragedy.

===Scope===
The scope of an event can affect the public view, and make it appear tragic. This can be the case whether the death toll is high, or if a single, unexpected death occurs in a well-beloved person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=5 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of attachment in the public eye may also impact whether or not the event is publicly labeled as a tragedy. For example, the unexpected death of a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] student that receives heavy media attention may be seen as more tragic than that of a [[recidivism|recidivist]] prisoner who is beaten to death by fellow inmates.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1 /&gt;

===Prematurity===
A death may be viewed as a tragedy when it is premature in nature. An old person dying of old age is an expectation, but the death of a child or of a young, healthy adult that is not expected by others can be viewed as tragic.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1/&gt;

===Publicity===
[[Publicity]] is a factor in making the public view an event as a tragedy. With publicity of a large number of deaths or even a single death, this plays on the emotions of the general public, and thereby impacts perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=3 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of coverage affects the number of people in whose eyes the event is viewed as tragic. While local coverage may garner sympathy from those in the hometown of the deceased, international coverage may lead the whole world to mourn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=9 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
The resulting consequences from one or more deaths can be seen as a tragedy. For example, if a large number of persons are killed in a terrorist attack, not only is life lost, but others may lose their sense of security, and this impacts the lives of others in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=8 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lasting effects===
The long-term effects of an event can render it as tragic. Tragedies often have effects that shape those affected, and are remembered even long after, as they clearly impact the future for those involved. They may also be commemorated on anniversaries or whenever they otherwise come to mind.&lt;ref&gt;Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional; by Stephen B. Roberts, Willard W. C. Ashley; {{ISBN|978-1-59473-240-9}}; page 67&lt;/ref&gt; A public tragedy often leads to measures being taken to prevent similar tragic events in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional, and National Tragedy |last=Roberts |first=Stephen B.  |authorlink= |author2=Willard W. C. Ashley  |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-1-59473-240-9 |page=86 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dealing with tragedy==
There are various ways tragedy can affect people.

The typical reaction to tragedy is heavy [[grief]], followed by a slow recovery. Common feelings following a tragedy include [[sadness]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[crying]], [[blame]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tragedy: A psychiatrist offers ways to deal with trauma and grief |author=Alvin F. Poussaint, M.D. |newspaper=Ebony Magazine |date=February 1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AM4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=coping+with+tragedy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jUT4TIfBFIWClAe0rvGgAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=coping%20with%20tragedy&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some people wonder what they did to deserve such suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with Tragedy |last=Ramsey |first=Tara |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=33 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some, their [[religion|faith]] may be a source of comfort in the wake of tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith in the Fast Lane |last=Owens |first=Ken |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=106 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
{{lang|fr|'''"Vive le Qu√©bec libre !'''"}} ({{IPA-fr|viv·µä l…ôkeb…õk Ààlib Å·µä|lang}}, "Long live free Quebec!") was a controversial phrase in a speech delivered by [[Charles de Gaulle|President Charles de Gaulle]] of France on July 24, 1967, during an official visit to Canada under the pretext of attending [[Expo 67]] in Montreal, Quebec. While giving an address to a large crowd from a balcony at [[Montreal City Hall]], he uttered {{lang|fr|"Vive Montr√©al ! Vive le Qu√©bec !"}} ("Long live Montreal, Long live Quebec!") and then added, followed by loud applause, {{lang|fr|"Vive le Qu√©bec {{noitalic|libre}} !"}} ("Long live ''free'' Quebec!") with particular emphasis on the word {{lang|fr|"libre"}}. The phrase, a slogan used by Quebecers who favoured [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec sovereignty]], and de Gaulle's use of it was seen by them as giving his support to the movement. The speech sparked a diplomatic incident with Canada's government, and was condemned by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Lester B. Pearson]], saying that "Canadians do not need to be liberated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prime Minister Pearson stands up to de Gaulle|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/prime-ministers/lester-b-pearson-from-peacemaker-to-prime-minister/standing-up-to-de-gaulle.html|website=CBC Digital Archives|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, though many were sympathetic to the cause of Quebec nationalism, de Gaulle's speech was criticized as a breach of protocol. 

==Background==
[[File:Charles de Gaulle-1963.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Charles de Gaulle in 1963]]
Even before his arrival, the [[Government of Canada|Canadian federal government]] had been concerned about President de Gaulle's visit. Earlier that year, the French government had not sent a high-level representative to the funeral service for [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Georges Vanier]].&lt;ref name="Thomson 1988pp188-9"&gt;{{harvnb|Thomson|1988|pp=188‚Äì189}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attracted notice in Canada, as Vanier and his wife, [[Pauline Vanier|Pauline]], had been personal friends of de Gaulle since 1940, when the latter was in exile in [[London, England]].&lt;ref name="Thomson 1988pp188-9"/&gt; In April, de Gaulle did not attend the 50th anniversary ceremonies commemorating the Canadian victory at [[Vimy Ridge]].&lt;ref name="Vimy Ridge 1967"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; So worried was the Pearson government about potential interference of France in domestic affairs that [[Secretary of State for External Affairs (Canada)|Secretary of State for External Affairs]], [[Paul Joseph James Martin|Paul Martin]], was dispatched to visit de Gaulle in Paris to mend the two countries' relationship. The ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' speculated, 45&amp;nbsp;years after the incident, that de Gaulle was still annoyed over a perceived slight from World War II-era Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]]'s slow recognition of the new French government in late summer 1944.&lt;ref name="DeGaulle's Speech 45-years later"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1966, as part of the Expo 67 diplomatic protocols, de Gaulle and all world leaders whose countries had an exhibit at the fair were invited to visit Canada during the spring and summer of 1967.&lt;ref name="Berton 302-303"&gt;{{harvnb|Berton|1967|pp=302‚Äì303}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, de Gaulle was also sent a separate invitation to visit Quebec by [[Premier of Quebec|Quebec premier]] [[Daniel Johnson, Sr.|Daniel Johnson]].&lt;ref name="Berton 302-303"/&gt; Although a visiting head of state, the president did not arrive in the Canadian capital, [[Ottawa]], as would be conventional protocol. Instead, he took the time to sail on the French navy's Mediterranean flagship, the cruiser ''[[French cruiser Colbert (C611)|Colbert]]'', so that he could arrive in [[Quebec City]], the capital city of the province of Quebec.&lt;ref name= "Berton (1997)"&gt;{{harvnb|Berton|1997|pp=300‚Äì312}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, de Gaulle was cheered enthusiastically, while the new governor general, [[Roland Michener]], was booed by the same crowd when "[[God Save the Queen]]" was played at his arrival.&lt;ref name="De Gaulle lands"&gt;

==Speech==
[[File:Montreal-Canada5884.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Montreal City Hall]]'s balcony where De Gaulle gave his speech.]]
On July 15, before boarding the ''Colbert'', de Gaulle told Xavier Deniau: "They will hear me over there, it will make waves!"&lt;ref name="Thomson 1988" /&gt; He also confided to his son-in-law General [[Alain de Boissieu]] that: "I am going to strike a strong blow. Things are going to get hot. But it is necessary. It is the last chance to rectify the cowardice of France."&lt;ref name="Thomson 1988" /&gt; De Gaulle was referring to what he viewed as France's abandonment of 70,000 French colonists to the British after France was defeated in [[French and Indian War|the North American theatre]] of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763.

On July 24, de Gaulle arrived in Montreal and was driven up the ''[[Chemin du Roy]]'' to [[Montreal City Hall]], where Mayor [[Jean Drapeau]] and Premier Johnson waited. De Gaulle was not scheduled to speak that evening, but the crowd chanted for him; he told Drapeau: "I have to speak to those people who are calling for me". According to a number of personal interviews with high-ranking French officials, as well as documents he uncovered,  scholar [[Dale C. Thomson]] wrote that de Gaulle's statement was planned, and that he used it when the opportunity presented itself.&lt;ref name = "Thomson 1988"&gt;{{harvnb|Thomson|1988|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle stepped out onto the balcony to give a short address to the assembled masses which was also broadcast live on radio. In his speech he commented that his drive down the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], lined as it had been with cheering crowds, reminded him of his triumphant return to Paris after the [[Liberation of Paris|liberation]] from Nazi Germany. The speech appeared to conclude with the words {{lang|fr|"Vive Montr√©al ! Vive le Qu√©bec !"}} ("Long live Montreal! Long live Quebec!"), but he then added, {{lang|fr|"Vive le Qu√©bec libre ! Vive, vive, vive le Canada fran√ßais ! Et vive la France !"}} ("Long live free Quebec! Long live, long live, long live French Canada! And long live France!"),&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon the crowd roared with approval, especially after hearing, {{lang|fr|"Vive le Qu√©bec libre!"}}. De Gaulle particularly emphasized the use of the word {{lang|fr|"libre"}}, as he leaned into the microphones and enunciated it more slowly and loudly than other elements of his speech.

&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the speech, de Gaulle visited Expo 67 and hosted a banquet at the French pavilion. On July 26, instead of continuing his visit on to Ottawa, where he was scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Pearson, he decided to return to France on a French military jet.&lt;ref name = "Busby 2008"&gt;{{harvnb|Busby|2008|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Expo and departure"&gt;{{cite news |last= Gorrell |first= David |title= Ceremony at Airport Brief but Correct |newspaper= The Globe and Mail |date= July 27, 1967 |location= Toronto |page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, to members of the Quebec sovereignty movement, the speech was viewed as a watershed moment.&lt;ref name = "40-years later CBC"/&gt; Occurring soon after the [[Quiet Revolution]], and taking into account the low economic and political state of [[French Canadian]]s at the time, the support of a foreign head of state seemed to add credibility to the movement in the eyes of many, including future Quebec premier [[Ren√© L√©vesque]].&lt;ref name="Levesque on Brinkmanship"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

On the flight home from Montreal, de Gaulle told Ren√© de Saint-L√©gier de la Saussaye‚Äîhis diplomatic counsellor‚Äîthat the event was "a historical phenomenon that was perhaps foreseeable but it took a form that only the situation itself could determine. Of course, like many others I could have got away with a few polite remarks or diplomatic acrobatics, but when one is General De Gaulle, one does not have recourse to such expedients. What I did, I had to do it."&lt;ref name="Thomson 1988 p243"&gt;{{harvnb|Thomson|1988|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, de Gaulle visited [[Brittany]], during which, in [[Quimper]], he declaimed a poem written by his uncle (also called [[Charles de Gaulle (poet)|Charles de Gaulle]]) in the [[Breton language]], expressing devotion to Breton culture. The speech, well received by the crowd, followed a series of crackdowns on [[Breton nationalism]]. He was accused of double standards for, on the one hand demanding a "free" Quebec because of its linguistic differences from English-speaking Canada, while on the other oppressing the movement in Brittany.&lt;ref name = "Ellis 1993"&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|1993|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this Quimper speech, he replied to this criticism that Brittany was free and had been freed by Bretons and other French forces during the Liberation, reminding that the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] was more intense in Brittany than in any other part of France, and that many Bretons had joined the [[Free French Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Charles |last= de Gaulle |url= http://www.ina.fr/politique/presidents-de-la-republique/video/CAF88035484/allocution-du-general-de-gaulle-a-quimper.fr.html |via= French National Audiovisual Institute (INA) |title= Allocution du G√©n√©ral de Gaulle √† Quimper |trans-title= Speech of General de Gaulle in Quimper |language= fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Analemma fishburn.tif|right|thumb|An [[analemma]] illustrates the changing [[position of the Sun]] over the course of a year, as viewed from a fixed [[standard time|time of day]].]]

A '''year''' is the [[orbital period]] of the [[Earth]] moving in [[Earth's orbit|its orbit]] around the [[Sun]]. Due to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], the course of a year sees the passing of the [[season]]s, marked by change in [[weather]], the hours of [[daylight]], and, consequently, [[vegetation]] and [[fertility (soil)|soil fertility]]. The current year is {{CURRENTYEAR}}.

In [[temperate]] and [[subpolar climate|subpolar]] regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [[spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]. In [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [[tropics#Seasons and climate|seasonal tropics]], the annual [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s are recognized and tracked.

A [[calendar year]] is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period as counted in a given [[calendar]]. The [[Gregorian calendar]], or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [[common year]] of 365 days or a [[leap year]] of 366 days, as do the [[Julian calendar]]s; ''see'' [[#In international calendars|below]]. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The ISO standard [[ISO 80000-3]], Annex C, supports the symbol ''a'' (for Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'') to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations ''y'' and ''yr'' are commonly used.

In astronomy, the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] is a [[unit of time]]; it is defined as 365.25 [[day]]s of exactly 86,400 [[second]]s ([[SI base unit]]), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |url=http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ |title=SI units |accessdate=February 18, 2010}} (See Table 5 and Section 5.15.) Reprinted from: {{cite journal |first=George A. |last=Wilkins |url=http://www.iau.org/static/publications/stylemanual1989.pdf |title=The IAU Style Manual |year=1989 |journal=IAU Transactions |volume=XXB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''year'' is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the [[seasonal year]], the [[fiscal year]], the [[academic year]], etc. Similarly, ''year'' can mean the orbital period of any [[planet]]; for example, a [[Martian year]] and a [[Venus|Venusian year]] are examples of the time  a planet takes to    transit one complete orbit. The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [[Great Year]].&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], s.v. "year", entry 2.b.: "''transf.''  Applied to a very long period or cycle (in chronology or mythology, or vaguely in poetic use)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
English ''year'' (via [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] ''ƒ°ƒìar'' ({{IPA|/j…õar/}}), [[Anglian dialects|Anglian]] ''ƒ°ƒìr'') continues [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*j«£ran'' (''*j[[Proto-Germanic language#ƒì‚ÇÅ and ƒì‚ÇÇ|ƒì‚ÇÅ]]&lt;nowiki&gt;ran&lt;/nowiki&gt;'').
Cognates are [[German language|German]] ''Jahr'', [[Old High German]] ''jƒÅr'', [[Old Norse]] ''√°r'' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''[[:wikt:êåæêå¥êçÇ|jer]]'',&lt;!--(Gothic ''e'' is always a long vowel)--&gt; from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] noun ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yeh‚ÇÅ-|*yeh‚ÇÅr-om]]}}'' "year, season". Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [[ablaut]]) are [[Avestan]] ''yƒÅr«ù'' "year", [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|·Ω•œÅŒ±}} (h·πìra) "year, season, period of time" (whence "[[hour]]"), [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''jar≈≠'', and [[Latin]] ''hornus'' "of this year". &lt;!--root [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h‚ÇÅey-]] "go", needs reference to deal with the "laryingealistic" problems--&gt;

Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'' (a [[2nd declension]] masculine noun; ''annum'' is the [[accusative case|accusative singular]]; ''annƒ´'' is genitive singular and nominative plural; ''ann≈ç'' the dative and ablative singular) is from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] noun ''{{PIE|*h‚ÇÇet-no-}}'', which also yielded Gothic ''a√æn'' "year" (only the dative plural ''a√ænam'' is attested).

Although most languages treat the word as thematic ''*yeh‚ÇÅr-o-'', there is evidence for an original derivation with an ''*-r/n'' suffix, ''*yeh‚ÇÅ-ro-''. Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh‚ÇÅ-ro-'' and ''*h‚ÇÇet-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning "to go, move", ''*h‚ÇÅey-'' and ''*h‚ÇÇet-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''√©ti'' "goes", ''atasi'' "thou goest, wanderest").
A number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means "each year", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means "in the year of the Lord".

The Greek word for "year", {{lang|grc|·ºîœÑŒøœÇ}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' "old", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' "year", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' "year" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' "yearling (calf)", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' "bull calf",  English ''wether'' "ram" (Old English ''we√∞er'', Gothic ''wi√ærus'' "lamb").

In some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in "summers", or "winters", or "harvests". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:Âπ¥|Âπ¥]] "year", originally [[:wikt:ÁßÇ|ÁßÇ]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting "harvest". Slavic besides ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/god—ä|god≈≠]]'' "time period; year" uses ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/lƒõto|lƒõto]]'' "summer; year".

In the [[International System of Quantities]] ([[ISO 80000-3]]), the year (symbol, ''a'') is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.

== Intercalation ==
No astronomical year has an [[integer]] number of days or lunar months, so any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.

=== Julian calendar ===
In the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is [[intercalation (timekeeping)#Solar calendars|intercalated]] into the month of February. The name "[[Leap Day]]" is applied to the added day.

The [[Revised Julian calendar]], proposed in 1923 and used in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, 
has 218 leap years every 900 years, for  the average (mean) year length of {{val|365.2422222}} days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, {{val|365.24219}} days (relative error of 9¬∑10&lt;sup&gt;‚àí8&lt;/sup&gt;).
In the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Miriam Nancy. (1924). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1924PA.....32..407S "The New Calendar of the Eastern Churches], ''Popular Astronomy'', Vol. 32, p.407. Courtesy NASA Astrophysics Data System.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gregorian calendar===
The Gregorian calendar attempts to cause the [[northward equinox]] to fall on or shortly before March 21 and hence it follows the [[tropical year|northward equinox year]], or [[tropical year]].&lt;ref&gt;Ziggelaar, A. (1983). [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=grc..&amp;year=1983&amp;volume=book&amp;page_ind=209 "The Papal Bull of 1582 Promulgating a Reform of the Calendar"]. In Coyne, Hoskin, Pedersen (eds), ''Gregorian Reform of the Calendar: Proceedings of the Vatican Conference to Commemorate its 400th Anniversary''. Vatican City: Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Specolo Vaticano, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Because 97 out of 400 years are leap years,   the mean length of the Gregorian calendar year is {{gaps|365.242|5}} days; with a relative error below one [[Parts per million|ppm]] (8¬∑10&lt;sup&gt;‚àí7&lt;/sup&gt;)  relative to the current length of the mean tropical year ({{gaps|365.242|19}} days) and even closer to the current ''March equinox year'' of {{gaps|365.242|374}} days that it aims to match.   It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.

===Other calendars===
{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}
Historically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.
Lunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).

A modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.

==Year numbering==
A [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.

The worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]] era (but the label [[Common Era]] is preferred by some). It was historically introduced in the 6th century and intended as counting years from the [[birth of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P. K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly state Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does state on page 585 the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes; the Gregorian calendar is used with the Anno Domini era.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] "in the year of the Lord"), or alternatively CE for "[[Common Era]]. Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].
Year numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no "year zero".
In the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], ‚àí1 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.

==Pragmatic divisions==
Financial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.

=== Fiscal year ===
A [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.

For example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.

=== Academic year ===
An academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].

Some schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.

Some other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.

There are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.

In India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Schools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.

=== Julian year ===
{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}
The Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit "year" (symbol "a" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many "real" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].

In the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.

:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]

The [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.

=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===
{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}

Each of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.

The [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).&lt;ref&gt;International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service. (2010).[http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/models/constants.html IERS EOP PC Useful constants.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the mean tropical year is defined as the period of time for the mean [[ecliptic longitude]] of the Sun to increase by 360 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, E. G. (2013). Calendars. In S. E. Urban &amp; P. K. Seidelmann (Eds.), ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'' (3rd ed.). Mill Valley, CA: University Science Books. p. 586.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Sun's ecliptic longitude is measured with respect to the equinox,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#longitude-ecliptic longitude, ecliptic]" and "[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#dynamical-equinox dynamical equinox]". (2018). In "Glossary", ''The Astronomical Almanac Online''. United States Naval Observatory.&lt;/ref&gt; the tropical year comprises a complete cycle of the seasons; because of the biological and socio-economic importance of the seasons, the tropical year is the basis of most calendars. The modern definition of mean tropical year differs from the actual time between passages of, e.g., the northward equinox for several reasons explained below. Because of the Earth's [[axial precession (astronomy)|axial precession]], this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year.  The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition.&lt;ref&gt;

The anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its [[Apsis|apsides]]. The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the [[perihelion]], where the Earth is closest to the Sun (January 3 in 2011), and the [[aphelion]], where the Earth is farthest from the Sun (July 4 in 2011). The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages.  Its average duration is {{val|365.259636}} days (365 d 6 h 13 min 52.6 s) (at the epoch J2011.0).&lt;ref&gt;

=== Draconic year ===
The draconic year, draconitic year, eclipse year, or ecliptic year is the time taken for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the same [[lunar node]] (a point where the Moon's orbit intersects the ecliptic). The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is
:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).

This term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).

=== Full moon cycle ===
The [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [[full moon]], and also with the varying duration of the [[month|synodic month]]. The duration of one full moon cycle is:
:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 34 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).

=== Lunar year ===
The [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].
A Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.

=== Vague year ===
The vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.  The vague year was used in the calendars of [[Egyptian calendar|Ancient Egypt]], [[Iranian calendar|Iran]], [[Armenian calendar|Armenia]] and in [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerica]] among the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] and [[Haab'|Maya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayacalendar.com/descripcion.html Calendar Description and Coordination] Maya World Studies Center&lt;/ref&gt;   It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.

=== Heliacal year ===
A heliacal year is the interval between the [[heliacal rising]]s of a star. It differs from the [[sidereal year]] for stars away from the [[ecliptic]] due mainly to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].

=== Sothic year ===
The [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] is the interval between heliacal risings of the star [[Sirius]]. It is currently less than the [[#Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years|sidereal year]] and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.

=== Gaussian year ===
The [[Gaussian year]] is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]. Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is:
:{{val|365.2568983}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s).

=== Besselian year === &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Time]] --&gt;
The [[Besselian epoch#Besselian years|Besselian year]] is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280¬∞. This is currently on or close to January 1. It is named after the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician [[Friedrich Bessel]]. The following equation can be used to compute the current Besselian epoch (in years):&lt;ref&gt;

The TT subscript indicates that for this formula, the Julian date should use the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale, or its predecessor, [[ephemeris time]].&lt;!-- Capitalization follows that of the glossary of the ''Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010'' --&gt;

=== Variation in the length of the year and the day ===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
The exact length of an astronomical year changes over time.
* The positions of the equinox and solstice points with respect to the apsides of Earth's orbit change: the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars because of [[precession]], and the apsides move in the other direction because of the long-term effects of gravitational pull by the other planets.  Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a "tropical year" measured from one passage of the northward ("vernal") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward ("autumnal") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.
* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.
* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].

An average Gregorian year is 365.2425 [[day]]s (52.1775 [[week]]s, {{val|8765.82}} [[hour]]s, {{val|525949.2}} [[minute]]s or {{val|31556952}} [[second]]s).  For this calendar, a common year is 365 days ({{val|8760}} hours, {{val|525600}} minutes or {{val|31536000}} seconds), and a leap year is 366 days ({{val|8784}} hours, {{val|527040}} minutes or {{val|31622400}} seconds).  The 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar has {{val|146097}} days and hence exactly {{val|20871}} weeks.

=== Equinoctial cycle ===
The Great Year, or equinoctial cycle, corresponds to a complete revolution of the equinoxes around the ecliptic. Its length is about 25,700 years.

== Seasonal year ==
{{Further|Effect of sun angle on climate}}
A seasonal year is the time between successive recurrences of a seasonal event such as the flooding of a river, the migration of a species of bird, the flowering of a species of plant, the first frost, or the first scheduled game of a certain sport. All of these events can have wide variations of more than a [[month]] from year to year.

== Symbols ==
In the [[ISO 80000-3|International System of Quantities]] the symbol for the year as a [[unit of time]] is ''[[a (year)|a]]'', taken from the Latin word ''annus''.&lt;ref name="How"&gt;

The joint document says that definitions such as the Julian year "bear an inherent, pre-programmed obsolescence because of the variability of Earth‚Äôs orbital movement", but then proposes using the length of the tropical year as of 2000 AD (specified down to the millisecond), which suffers from the same problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norman E.

==== SI prefix multipliers ====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous]], from [[Template:Geologic time scale]] and from [[Theropoda]]. --&gt;
For the following, there are alternative forms which elide the consecutive vowels, such as ''kilannus'', ''megannus'', etc. The exponents and exponential notations are typically used for calculating and in displaying calculations, and for conserving space, as in tables of data.
* {{Anchor|Kiloannus|Kiloannum}} '''''ka''''' (for kiloannum) ‚Äî a [[unit of time]] equal to one [[thousand]], or 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, years, or 1 E3 yr, also known as a [[millennium]] in [[anthropology]] and calendar uses. The prefix multiplier "ka" is typically used in geology, paleontology, and [[archaeology]] for the [[Holocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] [[period (geology)|periods]], where a non‚àí[[radiocarbon dating]] technique: e.g. [[ice core]] dating, [[dendrochronology]], [[uranium-thorium dating]], or [[varve]] analysis; is used as the primary dating method for age determination. If age is primarily determined by [[radiocarbon dating]], then the age should be expressed in either radiocarbon or calendar (calibrated) years [[Before Present]].
* {{Anchor|Megaannus|Megaannum}} '''''Ma''''' (for megaannum) ‚Äî a [[unit of time]] equal to one [[million]], or 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, years, or 1 E6 yr. The suffix "Ma" is commonly used in scientific disciplines such as geology, paleontology, and [[celestial mechanics]] to signify very long time periods into the past or future. For example, the [[dinosaur]] species ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' was abundant approximately 66 Ma (66 million years) ago. The duration term "ago" may not always be indicated: if the quantity of a duration is specified while not explicitly mentioning a duration term, one can assume that "ago" is implied; the alternative unit "mya" does include "ago" explicitly. It also written as "million years" (ago) in works for general public use. In astronomical applications, the year used is the Julian year of precisely 365.25 days. In geology and paleontology, the year is not so precise and varies depending on the author.

===Abbreviations yr and ya===
{{anchor|years ago}}{{anchor|kya}}{{anchor|Mya}}
{{further|Before Present}}

In [[astronomy]], geology, and paleontology, the abbreviation ''yr'' for ''years'' and ''ya'' for '''''years ago''''' are sometimes used, combined with prefixes for thousand, million, or billion.&lt;ref name="AGUStyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASC"&gt;

 |quote=(c) Convention and abbreviations. ‚Äì The age of a stratigraphic unit or the time of a geologic event, as commonly determined by numerical dating or by reference to a calibrated time-scale, may be expressed in years before the present. The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with "a" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; years), Mega-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; years), and Giga-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The "present" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as "ago" or "before the present" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates). For example, boundaries of the Late Cretaceous Epoch currently are calibrated at 63 Ma and 96 Ma, but the interval of time represented by this epoch is 33 m.y.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not SI units, using ''y'' to abbreviate the English "[[:wikt:year|year]]", but following ambiguous international recommendations, use either the standard English first letters as prefixes (t, m, and b) or [[metric prefix]]es (k, M, and G) or variations on metric prefixes (k, m, g). In archaeology, dealing with more recent periods, normally expressed dates, e.g. "22,000 years ago" may be used as a more accessible equivalent of a [[Before Present]] ("BP") date.

These abbreviations include:

Use of ''mya'' and ''bya'' is deprecated in modern geophysics, the recommended usage being ''Ma'' and ''Ga'' for dates [[Before Present]], but "m.y." for the duration of epochs.&lt;ref name="AGUStyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Strat" /&gt; This ''ad hoc'' distinction between "absolute" time and time intervals is somewhat controversial amongst members of the Geological Society of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Geological Society of America|title=Time Units|url=http://www.geosociety.org/TimeUnits/|accessdate=February 17, 2010| archivedate=June 16, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616100504/http://www.geosociety.org/TimeUnits/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that on graphs, using ''ya'' units on the horizontal axis time flows from right to left, which may seem counter-intuitive. If the ''ya'' units are on the vertical axis, time flows from top to bottom which is probably easier to understand than conventional notation.{{clarify|date=March 2017}}
