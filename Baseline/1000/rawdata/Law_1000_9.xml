The '''American Society for Political and Legal Philosophy''' ('''ASPLP''') is a [[learned society]] founded in 1955 by political theorist [[Carl Friedrich]].  The ASPLP's annual thematic conferences form the foundation for the ''Nomos'' series.  The ASPLP operates according to a distinctive three-discipline structure.  Its annual meetings rotate on a three-year cycle, meeting in conjunction with the [[Association of American Law Schools]], the [[American Political Science Association]], and the [[American Philosophical Association]] (Eastern Division).  Its presidency rotates among the three disciplines, with vice-presidents always representing the other two.  And its conferences consist of three lead papers, one from each discipline, each with two commentators from the other two disciplines.  

''Nomos'', now published by [[New York University Press]],&lt;ref&gt;{{issn|0078-0979}}, {{oclc|1760419}}&lt;/ref&gt; has published work by some of the leading political and legal theorists of the twentieth century, from a wide range of [[ideological]] and [[methodological]] perspectives, including [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Lon Fuller]], [[John Rawls]], [[Robert Nozick]], [[Michael Walzer]], [[Judith Shklar]], [[Cass Sunstein]], [[Martha Nussbaum]], [[Richard Posner]], [[Sheldon Wolin]], [[James Buchanan]], [[Catharine MacKinnon]], [[Jules Coleman]], [[Jean Hampton]], [[Jon Elster]], [[George Kateb]], and [[Richard Allen Epstein|Richard Epstein]].  The series was edited by Friedrich for volumes I-IX, coedited by J. Roland Pennock and John Chapman for volumes IX-XXXI, and edited by Chapman alone for XXXI-XXXV.  Since then, series editors have included [[Ian Shapiro]], [[Stephen Macedo]], [[Melissa Williams]], [[Sanford Levinson]], and James Fleming. The series is currently{{when|date= December 2016}} co-edited by Andrew Rehfeld (Washington University Political Science) and Jack Knight (Duke Law School).

{{Refimprove|date=March 2017}}
'''Analytical jurisprudence''' is a theory of [[jurisprudence]] that draws on the resources of modern [[analytical philosophy]] to try to understand the nature of law. Since the boundaries of analytical philosophy are somewhat vague, it is difficult to say how far it extends.  [[H. L. A. Hart]] was probably the most influential writer in the modern school of analytical jurisprudence,&lt;ref&gt;Bodenheimer, Edgar, [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7496&amp;context=penn_law_review Modern Analytical Jurisprudence and the Limits of Its Usefulness], [[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; though its history goes back at least to [[Jeremy Bentham]].

Analytical jurisprudence is not to be mistaken for [[legal formalism]] (the idea that legal reasoning is or can be modelled as a mechanical, algorithmic process). Indeed, it was the analytical jurists who first pointed out that legal formalism is fundamentally mistaken as a theory of law.

Analytic, or 'clarificatory' jurisprudence uses a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to the aspects of legal systems. This was a philosophical development that rejected [[natural law]]'s fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. [[David Hume]] famously argued in ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' that people invariably slip between describing that the world is a certain way to saying therefore we ought to conclude on a particular course of action. But as a matter of pure logic, one cannot conclude that we ought to do something merely because something is the case. So analysing and clarifying the way the world is, must be treated as a strictly separate question to normative and evaluative [[is–ought problem|ought questions]].

The most important questions of analytic jurisprudence are: "[[Definition of law|What are laws]]?"; "What is the law?"; "What is the relationship between law and [[power (social and political)|power]]?"; and, "What is the relationship between law and [[morality]]?" [[Legal positivism]] is the dominant theory, although there are a growing number of critics, who offer their own interpretations.

[[Springer books]] commissioned essays on analytical jurisprudence for ''A Treatise on Legal Philosophy and General Jurisprudence''. {{ISBN|9781402033872}}

An '''assignment'''&lt;ref&gt;Latin ''cessio''&lt;/ref&gt; is a legal term used in the context of the law of [[contract]] and of [[property (law)|property]]. In both instances, assignment is the process whereby a person, the ''assignor'', transfers rights or benefits to another, the ''assignee''.&lt;ref&gt;For the assignment of claim see [http://www.trans-lex.org/917000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; An assignment may not transfer a duty, burden or detriment without the express agreement of the assignee. The right or benefit being assigned may be a gift (such as a [[waiver]]) or it may be paid for with a contractual [[consideration]] such as money. 

The rights may be vested or contingent,&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation|HCA|21|1963|parallelcite=(1963) 109 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 9 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and may include an [[equitable interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian Law Dictionary|publisher=oxford university press|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mortgages and loans are relatively straightforward and amenable to assignment. An assignor may assign rights, such as a [[mortgage note]] issued by a third party borrower, and this would require the latter to make repayments to the assignee.

A related concept of assignment is [[novation]] wherein, by agreement with all parties, one contracting party is replaced by a new party. While novation requires the consent of all parties, assignment needs no consent from other non-assigning parties. However, in the case of assignment, the consent of the non-assigning party may be required by a contractual provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdnf.tlcollect.com/f1/cl/610/8172/TMT%20Newsletter%20August%202010%20v1d.pdf#page=3 |title=Tips and traps in contracting: novation versus assignment |last1=Kallenbach |first1=Paul |last2=Reid |first2=Nicole |publisher=[[MinterEllison]] |date=August 2010 |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
The assignment does not necessarily have to be in writing; however, the assignment agreement must show an intent to transfer rights. The effect of a valid assignment is to extinguish [[privity]] (in other words, contractual relationship, including right to sue) between the assignor and the third-party [[obligor]] and create privity between the obligor and the assignee.

==Liabilities and duties==
Unless the contractual agreement states otherwise, the assignee typically does not receive more rights than the assignor, and the assignor may remain liable to the original counterparty for the performance of the contract. The assignor often delegates duties in addition to rights to the assignee, but the assignor may remain ultimately responsible.

However, in the United States, there are various laws that limit the liability of the assignee, often to facilitate credit, as assignees are typically lenders.&lt;ref name=AssigneeLiability&gt;[http://arnstein.com/attorneypublications/Ropiquet/Assignee.Liability.-.Through.the.Minefield.pdf Assignee Liability: Through the Minefield]. Arnstein &amp; Lehr LLP.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples include a provision in the [[Truth in Lending Act]]&lt;ref&gt;See 15 U.S.C. 1641(a).&lt;/ref&gt; and provisions in the [[Consumer Leasing Act]] and the [[Home Ownership Equity Protection Act]].&lt;ref name=AssigneeLiability/&gt;

In other cases, the contract may be a [[negotiable instrument]] in which the person receiving the instrument may become a [[holder in due course]], which is similar to an assignee except that issues, such as lack of performance, by the assignor may not be a valid defense for the obligor.&lt;ref name=PSTCC_HDC&gt;[http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/lat/classes/2300/notes/chap23.htm Commercial Paper: Holder in Due Course &amp; Defenses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128024402/http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/lat/classes/2300/notes/chap23.htm |date=2012-11-28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a response, the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] promulgated Rule 433, formally known as the "Trade Regulation Rule Concerning Preservation of Consumers' Claims and Defenses", which "effectively abolished the [holder in due course] doctrine in consumer credit transactions".&lt;ref name=PSTCC_HDC/&gt; In 2012, the commission reaffirmed the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftc.gov/opa/2012/05/holderrule.shtm FTC Opinion Letter Affirms Consumers' Rights under the Holder Rule]. FTC.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assignment of contract rights==
{{Contract law}}

After the assignment of contractual rights, the assignee will receive all benefits that had accrued to the assignor. For example, if A contracts to sell his car for $100 to B, A may assign the benefits (the right to be paid $100) to C.&lt;ref&gt;In this scenario, Party A is the '''obligee/assignor''', Party B is an '''obligor''', and Party C is the '''assignee'''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, Party C is ''not'' a ''[[third party beneficiary]]'', because the contract was not made for C's benefit. Assignment takes place after the contract was formed; they may not precede them.{{cn|date=April 2018}}
===When assignment will be permitted===
The [[common law]] favors the freedom of assignment, so an assignment will generally be permitted unless there is an express prohibition against assignment in the contract. Where assignment is thus permitted, the assignor need not consult the other party to the contract. An assignment cannot have any effect on the duties of the other party to the contract, nor can it reduce the possibility of the other party receiving full performance of the same quality. Certain kinds of performance, therefore, ''cannot'' be assigned, because they create a unique relationship between the parties to the contract. For example, the assignment of a legal malpractice claim is void since an assignee would be a stranger to the attorney-client relationship, who was owed no duty by the attorney and would imperil the sanctity of the highly confidential and fiduciary relationship existing between attorney and client.

Torts are not assignable as [[public policy]], and various statutes may prohibit assignment in certain instances.&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt; In addition, the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]] lists prohibitions in §317(2)(a) based upon the effect to the nonassigning party (obligor),&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt; with similar prohibitions in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] §2-210.&lt;ref name=LexisNexisStudy&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/contracts/contracts18.htm Chapter 18: Assignment and Delegation]. LexisNexis study outline.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, UCC §2-210 states the following:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-210 Uniform Commercial Code § 2-210. Delegation of Performance; Assignment of Rights].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreementotherwise [sic].}}

===Requirements for an effective assignment===
For assignment to be effective, it must occur in the present. No specific language is required to make such an assignment, but the assignor must make some clear statement of intent to assign clearly identified contractual rights to the assignee. A promise to assign in the future has no legal effect. Although this prevents a party from assigning the benefits of a contract that has not yet been made, a [[court of equity]] may enforce such an assignment where an established economic relationship between the assignor and the assignee raised an expectation that the assignee would indeed form the appropriate contract in the future.

A contract may contain a [[non-assignment clause]], which prohibits the assignment of specific rights and some various rights, or of the entire contract, to another. However, such a clause does not necessarily destroy the power of either party to make an assignment. Instead, it merely gives the other party the ability to sue for breach of contract if such an assignment is made. However, an assignment of a contract containing such a clause will be ineffective if the assignee ''knows'' of the non-assignment clause, or if the non-assignment clause specifies that "all assignments are void".

Two other techniques to prevent the assignment of contracts are ''[[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] clauses'' or clauses creating a ''[[condition subsequent]]''. The former would give the other party to the contract the power to rescind the contract if an assignment is made; the latter would rescind the contract automatically in such circumstances.

====Requirement of a writing====
There are certain situations in which the assignment must be in writing.
#Assignment of [[wages]]; additionally, statutes may prohibit this assignment&lt;ref name=Stark2003/&gt;
#Assignment of any interest in [[real property]]
#Assignment of [[Chose (English law)|choses in action]] worth over $5,000

===Delegation===
A parallel concept to assignment is ''[[delegation (law)|delegation]]'', which occurs when one party transfers his ''duties or liabilities'' under a contract to another. A delegation and an assignment can be accomplished at the same time, although a non-assignment clause may also bar delegation.

== Remedies ==
[[Legal remedy|Legal remedies]] may be available if the nonassigning party's rights are affected by the assignment.

===Revocability===
Assignments made for consideration are irrevocable, meaning that the assignor permanently gives up the legal right to take back the assignment once it has been made. Donative assignments, on the other hand, are generally revocable, either by the assignor giving notice to the assignee, taking performance directly from the obligor, or making a subsequent assignment of the same right to another. There are some exceptions to the revocability of a donative assignment:
#The assignment can not be revoked if the obligor has already performed
#The assignment can not be revoked if the assignee has received a ''token chose'' (''chose'' being derived from the [[French language|French]] word for "thing", as in a chose of action) - a physical object that signifies a right to collect, such as a stock certificate or the passbook to a savings account.
#The assignment can not be revoked if the assignor has set forth in writing the assignment of a ''simple chose'' - a contract right embodied in any form of token.
#[[Estoppel]] can prevent the revocation of a donative assignment if the assignee changed their position in reliance on the assignment.

===Breach and defenses===
A cause of action for [[breach of contract|breach]] on the part of the obligor lies with the assignee, who will hold the exclusive right to commence a cause of action for any failure to perform or defective performance. At this stage, because the assignee "stands in the shoes" of the assignor, the obligor can raise any defense to the contract that the obligor could have raised against the assignor. Furthermore, the obligor can raise against the assignee counterclaims and setoffs that the obligor had against the assignor. For example, suppose that A makes a contract to paint B's house in exchange for $500. A then assigns the right to receive the $500 to C, to pay off a debt owed to C. However, A does such a careless job painting the house that B has to pay another painter $400 to correct A's work. If C sues B to collect the debt, B can raise his counterclaim for the expenses caused by the poor paint job, and can reduce the amount owed to C by that $400, leaving only $100 to be collected.

When the assignor makes the assignment, he makes with it an [[implied warranty]] that the right to assign was not subject to defenses. If the contract had a provision that made the assignment ineffective, the assignee could sue the assignor for breach of this implied warranty. Similarly, the assignee could also sue under this theory if the assignor wrongfully revoked the assignment.

===Successive assignments===
Occasionally, an unscrupulous assignor will asof the assignment, and on the timing of the assignments relative to certain other actions.

In a quirk left over from the common law, if the assignment was donative, the ''last assignee'' is the true owner of the rights. However, if the assignment was for consideration, the ''first assignee'' to actually ''collect against the assigned contract'' is the true owner of the rights. Under the modern ''American rule'', now followed in most U.S. jurisdictions, the first assignor with equity (i.e. the first to have paid for the assignment) will have the strongest claim, while remaining assignees may have other remedies.  In some countries, the rights of the respective assignees are determined by the old common law [[rule in Dearle v Hall|rule in ''Dearle v Hall'']].

# Earlier donative assignees for whom the assignment was revocable (because it had not been made irrevocable by any of the means listed above) have no cause of action whatsoever.
# Earlier donative assignees for whom the assignment was made irrevocable can bring an action for the [[tort]] of [[conversion (law)|conversion]], because the assignment was technically their property when it was given to a later assignee.
# Later assignees for consideration have a cause of action for breaches of the implied warranty discussed above.

==Special rules for assignment of certain rights==

===Property rights===
{{Property law}}
{{See also|Rule in Dumpor's Case|Privity of estate}}
[[Real property]] rights can be assigned just as any other contractual right. However, special duties and liabilities attach to transfers of the right to possess property. With an assignment, the assignor transfers the complete remainder of the interest to the assignee. The assignor must not retain any sort of reversionary interest in the right to possess. The assignee's interest must abut the interest of the next person to have the right to possession. If any time or interest is reserved by a tenant assignor then the act is not an assignment, but is instead a sublease.

The liability of the assignee depends upon the contract formed when the assignment takes place. However, in general, the assignee has privity of estate with a lessor. With privity of estate comes the duty on the part of the assignee to perform certain obligations under covenant, e.g. pay rent. Similarly, the lessor retains the obligations to perform on covenants to maintain or repair the land.

If the assignor agrees to continue paying rent to the lessor and subsequently defaults, the lessor can sue both the assignor under the original contract signed with the lessor as well as the assignee because by taking possession of the property interest, the assignee has obliged himself to perform duties under covenant such as the payment of rent.

Unlike a Novation where consent of both the lessor and lesse is required for the third party to assume all obligations and liabilities of the original lessee, an assignment does not always need the consent of all parties. If the contract terms state specifically that the lessor's consent is not needed to assign the contract, then the lesee can assign the contract to whomever the lesee wants to.

Absent language to the contrary, a tenant may assign their rights to an assignee without the landlord's consent. In the majority of jurisdictions, when there is a clause that the landlord may withhold consent to an assignment, the general rule is that the landlord may not withhold consent unreasonably unless there is a provision that states specifically that the Landlord may withhold consent at Landlord's sole discretion.

===Partnership rights===
A person can also assign their rights to receive the benefits owed to a partner in a [[partnership]]. However, the assignee can ''not'' thereby gain any of the assignor's rights with respect to the operation of the partnership. The assignee may not vote on partnership matters, inspect the partnership books, or take possession of partnership property; rather, the assignee can only be given the right is to collect distributions of income, unless the remaining partners consent to the assignment of a new general partner with operational, management, and financial interests. If the partnership is dissolved, the assignee can also claim the assignor's share of any distribution accompanying the dissolution.

===Intellectual property rights===
{{See also|transfer (patent)}}

Ownership of intellectual property, including [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, and [[trademark]]s, may be assigned, but special conditions attach to the assignment of patents and trademarks. In the [[United States]], assignment of a patent is governed by [[statute]], {{USCode|35|261}}.  Patent rights are assignable by an "instrument in writing."  Title in a patent can also be transferred as a result of other financial transactions, such as a [[merger]] or a [[takeover]], or as a result of operation of law, such as in an [[inheritance]] process, or in a [[bankruptcy]].  An assignment of a patent can be recorded with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].  Although such recording is not required, if an assignment is not recorded at the USPTO within three (3) months or prior to a subsequent assignment, the assignment will be void against a subsequent assignee without notice of the earlier, unrecorded assignment.

With respect to a trademark, the owner of the mark may not transfer ownership of the mark without transferring the [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] associated with the mark.

Companies sometimes request from employees that they assign all intellectual property they create while under the employment of the company.  This is typically done within an Employment Agreement, but is sometimes done through a specific agreement called Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement (PIIA).

===Personal injury torts===

The standard rule is that [[personal injury]] [[tort]] causes of action are nonassignable as a matter of [[Public policy (law)|public policy]].&lt;ref name=Stark2003&gt;Stark T. (2003). ''Negotiating and Drafting Contract Boilerplate'', [http://www.starklegaled.com/downloads/sample-nadcp-3.2.pdf Ch. 3: Assignment and Delegation]. ALM Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pony v. County of Los Angeles'', 433 F.3d 1138 (9th Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  These should be distinguished from final settlements or judgments resulting from lawsuits brought on such causes of action, which may be assignable.

===Legal malpractice===

In the majority of jurisdictions, assignments involving fraud or [[legal malpractice]] causes of action are void as against public policy.&lt;ref&gt;''Cowan Liebowitz &amp; Latman, PC v. Kaplan'', 902 So. 2d 755, 759-760 (Fla. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equitable assignment==
An '''equitable assignment''' is an assignment, or transfer of rights, in [[Equity (law)|equity]].

===General principles===

There are numerous requirements that exist for an equitable assignment of property, outside the 'standard' ''clear and unconditional intention to assign''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSCA|39|2007|litigants=Westbourne Grammar School v Sanget Pty |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These requirements are fundamental characteristics of a statutory assignment: Absolute assignment (an unconditional transfer: conditions precedent or part of a debt are not absolute) and the assignment must be made in writing and signed by the assignor, and in particular, this applies to real property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca1919141|Conveyancing Act 1919|23C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assigning future property in equity cannot be gratuitous. The assignor must receive consideration for the agreement, otherwise the assignment will be ineffective.&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"/&gt; However, an absolute assignment does not require consideration to be given. Secondly, between the period of agreement between assignor and assignee and acquisition by the assignor, the assignees rights are not [[contractual]], but rather a [[property|proprietary right]] to the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|39|1978|litigants=Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Everett |parallelcite=(1978) 21 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 625 at p. 643 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court (Full Court)]] (Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the assignee has an interest in this future property, in the same manner any owner has over property.

In equity, these principles operate to protect both the assignor and the assignee. In ''Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation'',&lt;ref name="Normnan v FCT"/&gt;  a taxpayer attempted to assign by [[deed]], to his wife certain moneys which he was eventually going to receive. This included dividends and [[interest]] due on [[loan]]s. The court held the interest and the [[dividend]]s were expectancies or possibilities which could not be assigned without consideration. The court's worry was that assignments without consideration might be used as instruments of fraud, to avoid creditors and tax collection.

===Mere expectancies===

Courts will not enforce a contract to assign an expectancy unless there is a valuable consideration. For example, under a settlement of property the respondent "the son" would have been entitled to an equal portion of properties along with his other siblings which was gained in a [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] by his mother. This portion was only his when allocated to him at his mothers discretion. Prior to this allocation being made, the respondent allotted his benefit to [[trustee]]s for a voluntary settlement. He was assigning or purporting to assign something which he might become entitled to in the future, not a [[contingent interest]]. The judgment held it ineffective and elaborated on previous points to state the respondent cannot be compelled to allow the trustees to retain the appointed sum.&lt;ref&gt;Northumberland (Duke) v Inland Revenue Comrs&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''boilerplate clause''' is a [[legal English]] term that is used in conjunction with [[contract law]]. When forming contracts, parties to the contract often use templates or forms with boilerplate clauses ([[boilerplate text|boilerplate language]], used as standard language). Such clauses refers to the standardised clauses in contracts, and they are to be found towards the end of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Leszek Berezowski, Jak czytać i rozumieć angielskie umowy? Warsaw 2014, page 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Including boilerplate clauses is the process by which parties to the contract may better define their relationship and the will to provide certainty if terms in the contract are ever disputed. Boilerplate clauses are standard contractual terms that are routinely included in many contracts.&lt;ref&gt;International Commercial Agreements: An Edinburgh Law Guide: An Edinburgh Law Guide, Michala Meiselles
Edinburgh University Press - page 336&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most common clause types are listed below:

==Assignment clause== 
An assignment clause is based on prohibiting or permitting a complete transfer or rights under the contract to another party.

'''An example:'''
 Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under the Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by either party without the prior written consent of the other party.

The transfer may be prohibited or permitted entirely or in part. The example of permitting assignment under specified circumstances is:

'''An example:'''
The hulls and freight clauses contain a similar "assignment clause" which states that no assignment is binding unless a dated notice of assignment, signed by the assured is endorsed on the policy and the policy is produced before payment of claim or return of premium.&lt;ref&gt;Insurance Law in the United Kingdom,John Birds,Kluwer Law International, 2010 - p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Assignment (law)}}

==''Force majeure'' clause== 
A ''[[force majeure]]'' clause is designed to protect against failures to perform contractual obligations caused by unavoidable events beyond a party’s control, such as natural disasters. ''Force majeure'' clauses are primarily used to identify circumstances in which performance of contract may be forgiven&lt;ref&gt;International Commercial Agreements: A Primer on Drafting, Negotiating, and Resolving Disputes, William F. Fox
Kluwer Law International, 2009 - p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;

'''An example:'''
 GUMBER &amp; PARTNERS SOLICITORS shall in no event be responsible for any delay or failure in performance resulting from circumstances beyond its reasonable control.

{{see also|Force majeure}}

== Arbitration clause == 
A specific boilerplate clause which is stated to forgo taking any dispute that may arise to court. Parties to the contract are to refer the dispute to an arbitrator to reach out-of-court settlement.

'''An example:''' 
 In the event a dispute shall arise between the parties hereto, it is hereby agreed that the dispute shall be referred to International Chamber of Commerce and settled by three arbitrators. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding.

{{see also|Arbitration}}

== Severability clause == 
Severability clause provides that in the event of one or more provisions of the contract are determined to be unenforceable, the rest of the contract remains in force.

'''An example:''' 
 This Agreement will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. If for any reason any term or provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, then (a) such term or provision will be interpreted, construed, or reformed to the extent reasonably required to render the same valid, enforceable, and consistent with the original intent underlying such provision; (b) such term or provision will remain in effect to the extent that it is not invalid or unenforceable; and (c) such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement.”

'''Breach of the peace''', or '''disturbing the peace''', is a legal term used in [[constitutional law]] in English-speaking countries, and in a wider [[public order]] sense in the several [[jurisdiction]]s of the [[United Kingdom]]. It is a form of [[disorderly conduct]].

==Public order==
{{expert needed|Crime|section|date=June 2012}}
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2008}}

Disturbing the peace is a [[crime]] generally defined as the unsettling of proper order in a [[public space]] through one's actions. This can include creating loud noise by fighting or challenging to fight, disturbing others by loud and unreasonable noise (including [[loud music]]), or using [[profanity]].

Disturbing the peace is typically considered a [[misdemeanour]] or an [[infraction]] depending on the [[jurisdiction]] and is often punishable by either a fine or a brief term in jail. On other rare occasions, it is considered an ordinance violation, the lowest level of offence.  In most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, a person held in breach of the peace will not have a [[criminal record]] entered against their name,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} which record could otherwise hurt the person's employment prospects (often seriously) and could adversely affect how he or she is viewed and treated by law-enforcement authorities, e.g., what if any bond he or she is granted if arrested in the future.

A violation of a [[Noise regulation|noise ordinance]] is in most jurisdictions not considered a disturbance of the peace unless the perpetrator has disregarded an affirmative request that he or she reduce the noise to a reasonable level.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Standards for whether to charge someone with disturbance of the peace are highly subjective, and in many jurisdictions, courts are highly deferential to the opinion of the arresting/charging officer as to whether the accused's actions violated the law (even though in theory the officer's testimony addresses only questions of fact, whereas questions of the law's applicability to those facts are left to the trying court alone).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maan|first=Daanish|date=30 June 2010|title=A Look Back at G8 and G20 in Toronto: What Not to Do When Hosting A Global Conference in a Global City|journal=South Asian Generation Next|url=http://www.sagennext.com/2010/06/30/a-look-back-at-g8-and-g20-in-toronto-what-not-to-do-when-hosting-a-global-conference-in-a-global-city/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many local ordinances prohibiting disturbance of the peace exhibit a problematic degree of [[Void for vagueness|vagueness]], occasionally to the point that courts deem them unconstitutional (in United States law) or violative of [[due process]] (in both United States and Commonwealth jurisdictions).{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===United States===

In the [[United States]], the [[Speech or Debate Clause]] of [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] provides that members of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] shall be [[Parliamentary immunity|immune]] from [[arrest]] in going to and departing from sessions and while Congress is in session except for cases of "[[Treason]], [[Felony]], and Breach of the Peace."  The first two are somewhat self-explanatory; it has been suggested that the third is deliberately somewhat vague.  The [[doctrine]] thus established is called "congressional immunity"; it arose out of the necessity to prevent a vengeful [[Executive (government)|executive]] from arresting members of the [[legislature]] under a pretext to prevent them from taking actions that the executive might find to be displeasing.  In recent years, this doctrine has been used to prevent members from being stopped and held for [[Speed limit|speeding]] on their way to sessions; this apparently is not a "breach of the peace", whereas perhaps another [[misdemeanour]] such as "[[Public intoxication|drunk]] and [[Disorderly conduct|disorderly]]" might be construed as such.  Most states of the United States and most other [[English language|English]]-speaking jurisdictions have extended this privilege to members of their legislatures on the theory outlined above.

''[[Cox v. Louisiana]]'' was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision that held that a [[Louisiana]] statute criminalizing breaches of the peace "as authoritatively interpreted by the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] is unconstitutionally broad in scope". The statute read in part:

{{quote|Whoever with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or under circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned thereby ... crowds or congregates with others ... in or upon ... a public street or public highway, or upon a public sidewalk, or any other public place or building ... and who fails or refuses to disperse and move on ... when ordered so to do by any law enforcement officer of any municipality, or parish, in which such act or acts are committed, or by any law enforcement officer of the state of Louisiana, or any other authorized person ... shall be guilty of disturbing the peace.}}

In [[Terminiello v. City of Chicago]], the Supreme Court held that a "breach of peace" ordinance of the City of Chicago that banned speech which "stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition of unrest, or creates a disturbance" was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Justice Douglas stated: "Accordingly a function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea.”

===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===
In England and Wales, theoretically all criminal offences cognizable by English law involve "a breach of the [[Queen's peace]]", and all indictments formerly concluded "against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her crown and dignity" before the passage of the [[Indictments Act 1915]] and the Rules that formed that Act's first schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1915/90/pdfs/ukpga_19150090_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=Indictments Act 1915 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conclusion has also found its way into constitutional law in many [[State constitution (United States)|United States state constitution]]s, which mandate that indictments within the state end in a similar manner to the above, usually omitting the "crown" part or substituting "government". For example, [[New Jersey]]'s is "against the peace of this State, the government and dignity of the same".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/lawsconstitution/constitution.asp |title=New Jersey State Constitution |publisher=Njleg.state.nj.us |accessdate=14 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/lawsconstitution/constitution.asp |archivedate=30 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically that concluding phrase, now legally superfluous, represents the last trace of the process by which the royal [[court]]s assume jurisdiction over all offences, and gradually eroded the jurisdiction of the [[sheriff]] and of [[Lord of the Manor|lords of manor]] and [[exclusive right|franchise]]s, making crime a matter of national concern as distinguished from [[tort|civil wrongs]] or infractions of the rights of local magnates. The Peace of the King was sworn on his accession or full recognition, and the jurisdiction of his courts to punish all violations of that peace was gradually asserted. The completion of this process is marked by the institution of the office of [[Justice of the Peace]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Peace, Breach of the|volume=4|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, breach of the peace is descended from the [[Justices of the Peace Act 1361]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/aep/1361/caep_13610001_enm_1 |title=Justices of the Peace Act 1361 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416050654/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/aep/1361/caep_13610001_enm_1 |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to riotous and [[barratry (common law)|barratous]] behaviour that disturbs the peace of the King. More modern authority defines a breach of the peace as "when a person reasonably believes harm will be caused, or is likely to be caused, to a person or in his presence to his property, or a person is in fear of being harmed through an assault, affray, riot, unlawful assembly, or some other form of disturbance".&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Howell'' [1982] QB 416&lt;/ref&gt;

The breach of the peace power of arrest is provided by the [[common law]] and therefore an 'any person' power of arrest and entry both within the same definition &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scie.org.uk/care-act-2014/safeguarding-adults/adult-suspected-at-risk-of-neglect-abuse/law/pcea1984.asp|title=Context of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 in gaining access to an adult suspected of being at risk of neglect or abuse: a guide for social workers and their managers in England – SCIE|author=|date=|website=www.scie.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 17(5) of [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984|PACE 1984]] abolished all powers of a Constable to enter under the common law with the specific exception (subsection 6) when dealing with or preventing a common law breach of the peace. This "offence" definition and power of arrest are contained under the [[common law]] definition of "breach of the peace". Breach of the peace powers are unusual in the fact they originate from the laws [[Alfred the Great]] consolidated into the [[common law]] approximately 1,000 years before the modern Constable was thought up. The first legislative reference to the common law breach of the peace was under the [[Justice of the Peace Act 1361]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw3/34/1|title=Justices of the Peace Act 1361|author=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when a Constable uses their breach of the peace powers, they are acting as 'any person' and not fully as sworn officer in this capacity.

The power to arrest for a breach of the peace is usually used to remove violent, potentially violent or provocative offenders (it is not necessary for the offender themselves to be physically involved in any violence) from a scene rapidly.

In England and Wales, breach of the peace is a [[civil proceeding]] (rather than a criminal offence), although the case must be proved to the criminal standard of proof, '[[Burden of proof (law)|beyond reasonable doubt]]', rather than the civil standard of proof, '[[Burden of proof (law)|on the balance of probabilities]]'. Sometimes the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] conduct the case on behalf of the police, but  the police service is liable for any costs awarded in favour or against the prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/binding-over-orders|title=Binding Over Orders {{!}} The Crown Prosecution Service|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cps.gov.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Breach of the Peace is not an offence, in the sense that it is not punishable either by a fine or imprisonment either at statute or [[common law]] and nor do proceedings for breach of the peace give rise to any conviction.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. County of London Quarter Sessions Appeals Committee, ''ex parte'' Metropolitan Police Commissioner'' [1948] 1 KB 670, per Lord Goddard, CJ; ''Williamson v. Chief Constable of West Midlands Police'' [2004] (1 WLR 14, per Dyson, LJ)&lt;/ref&gt; In England and Wales, [[constable]]s (or other persons) are permitted to arrest a person to "prevent a further breach of the peace" which allows for the police or the public to arrest a person before a breach of the peace has occurred. This is permitted when it is reasonable to believe should the person remain, that they would continue with their course of conduct and that a Breach of the Peace would occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourrights.org.uk/yourrights/the-right-of-peaceful-protest/other-police-powers-to-restrict-right-to-protest.html|title=Your rights - Other Police Powers to Restrict Right to Protest|publisher=Yourrights.org.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409003229/http://www.yourrights.org.uk/yourrights/the-right-of-peaceful-protest/other-police-powers-to-restrict-right-to-protest.html|archivedate=9 April 2010|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only immediate sanction that can be imposed by a court for breach of the peace is to [[bind over]] the offender to keep the peace: that is, justices of the peace can require a person to enter into a recognizance to keep the peace. Any punishment (in the sense of a loss of freedom or permanent financial penalty) takes the form of loss of the surety if the defendant fails to keep the peace or be of good behaviour during the period for which he is bound over. The binding over itself does not amount to a conviction (but any following behaviour causing loss of the surety might well result in conviction for an associated offence). A failure to enter into a recognizance may of itself lead to a person being committed to custody under s.115(3) [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]].

===Scotland===
There are major differences between [[English law]] and [[Scottish law]] with respect to dealing with breach of the peace; unlike England and Wales where criminal penalties apply to the behaviour leading to or liable to cause a breach of the peace, it is a specific criminal offence in Scotland which is prosecuted daily in the sheriff courts and due to its common law definition it can be applied to a number of scenarios. The maximum punishment if a case is remitted to the High Court remains imprisonment for life although such severe punishment is now rarely applied, usually being associated with breaches of licence during an existing life sentence.

The Scottish law definition of a breach of the peace is "conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and threaten serious disturbance to the community".&lt;ref&gt;Smith v Donnelly 2002 J.C. 65 or 2001 S.L.T. 1007 or 2001 S.C.C.R. 800 (Confirmed with full bench decision in Jones v Carnegie 2004 S.L.T. 609 or 2004 S.C.C.R. 361)&lt;/ref&gt;

A constable may arrest any person, without warrant, who commits a breach of the peace. A member of the public may not arrest a person for behaviour which amounts to no more than a breach of the peace (i.e. an arrest is not always for the offence for which someone is eventually prosecuted but can be for a more serious crime that appears to be occurring).

Breach of the peace can include, but is not limited to, any riotous behaviours (which includes "rowdiness" or "brawling") and any disorderly behaviour. This behaviour need not be noisy but still of a nature that would cause concern to other people. Examples include [[voyeurism]], persistently following someone, delivering "threatening" letters and "[[streaking]]" or "[[mooning]]".

To prove a breach of the peace, the most important things to prove are that someone was alarmed, annoyed or disturbed by the incident.

This offence can take place anywhere, for example, a public street or any public space.

One of the leading cases in [[Scottish Law]] is that of ''Smith v Donnelly'', a case concerning a Faslane protester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotHC/2001/121.html|title=Smith v Donnelly (Procurator Fiscal, Dumbarton) [2001] ScotHC 121 (28 September 2001)|publisher=Bailii.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Travellers attacked by brigands.jpg|thumb|200px|The painting, ''Travellers attacked by brigands'', by [[Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem]] (c. 1670)]]
'''Brigandage''' is the life and practice of [[highway robbery]] and [[plunder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] second edition, 1989. "Brigandage" The first recorded usage of the word was by "[Clive] Holland ''Livy'' XXXVIII. xlv. 1011e, A privat brigandage and robberie."&lt;/ref&gt; It is practiced by a '''brigand''', a person who usually lives in a [[gang]] and lives by pillage and robbery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] second edition, 1989. "Brigand.2" first recorded usage of the word was by "H. LUTTRELL in Ellis ''Orig. Lett.'' II. 27 I. 85 Ther ys no steryng of none evyl doers, saf byonde the rivere of Sayne..of certains brigaunts."&lt;/ref&gt;

The brigand is an outlaw who conducts warfare after the manner of an [[Irregular military|irregular]] or partisan soldier by [[Skirmisher|skirmishes]] and surprises, who makes the war support itself by plunder, by extortion, by capturing prisoners and holding them to [[ransom]], who enforces his demands by violence, and kills the prisoners who cannot pay.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] second edition 1989 brigandry "1980 Guardian Weekly 28 Dec. 14/2 Today the rebels wound, mutilate, and kill civilians: where do you draw the fine line between subversion and brigandry?"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The English word ''brigant'' (also ''brigaunt'') was introduced as early as 1400, via [[Old French]] '' [[wikt:brigand|brigand]]'' from Italian ''brigante'' "trooper, skirmisher, foot soldier". The Italian word is from a verb ''brigare'' "to brawl, fight" (whence also ''[[brigade]]'').

As for the related term ''[[bandit]]'',  a ''bandito'' was a man declared [[outlaw]] by proclamation, or ''bando''.
{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}{{sfn|Rickards|2000|p=39}}

==Laws of war==
Towards the end of wars, irreconcilables may refuse to accept the loss of their cause, and may continue hostilities using irregular tactics. Upon capture by the victorious side, whether the capturing power has to recognize them as soldiers (who must be treated as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]) or as brigands (who can be tried under civilian law as common criminals) depends on whether the detainees "respect the laws and customs of war" and whether they operate within a chain of command and are "not persons acting on their own responsibility".{{sfn|Axinn|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xMC5bIE-q7QC&amp;pg=PA73#PPA89,M1 89]}}{{sfn|Elsea|2005|loc=CRS-17, CRS-29}}{{sfn|Lieber|Lieber|Shelly|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7eRfPo2jvx8C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95 95]}}

== Resistance ==
{{see also|Brigandage in the Two Sicilies}}
In certain conditions the brigand has not been a mere malefactor. Brigandage may be, and not infrequently has been, the last resort of a people subject to invasion.

The Calabrians who fought for [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]], and the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Irregular military|irregular]] [[Conscription|levies]], which maintained the national resistance against the French from 1808 to 1814, were called brigands by their enemies.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}  "''It is you who are the thieves''",{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}} was the defence of the [[Calabria]]n who was tried as a brigand by a [[France|French]] [[court-martial]] during the reign of [[Joachim Murat]] in [[Naples]].{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}

In the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]], under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[History of the Balkans#The Ottoman Empire (15th to 19th c.)|rule]], the brigands (called ''[[klepht]]s'' by the [[Greeks]] and ''hayduks'' or ''haydutzi'' by the [[South Slavs|Slavs]]) had some claim to believe themselves the representatives of their people against oppressors. The only approach to an attempt to maintain order was the [[Right to arms|permission given to part of the population to carry arms]] in order to repress the klephts. They were hence called ''armatoli''. In fact the armatole tended to act more as allies than enemies of the klephts.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}

==Causes==
The conditions which favour the development of brigandage may be summed up as [[political corruption|bad administration]]{{efn|{{quote|[...] it would be going much too far to say that the absence of an efficient police is the sole cause of brigandage in countries not subject to foreign invasion, or where the state is not very feeble. [...] But there have been times and countries in which the law and its administration have been so far regarded as enemies by people who were not themselves criminals, that all who defied them have been sure of a measure of sympathy. Then and there it was that brigandage has flourished, and has been difficult to extirpate.|{{harvnb|Hannay|1911|p=563}}}}
}} and to a lesser degree, terrain that permits easy escape from the incumbents.{{efn|"in a less degree, the possession of convenient hiding-places. A country of mountain and forest is favourable to the brigand. The highlands of Scotland supplied a safe refuge to the 'gentlemen [[Border Reivers|reavers]],' who carried off the cattle of the [[Sassenach]] landlords" {{harv|Hannay|1911|p=564}}.}}

The [[Scottish Marches]] supplied a theatre for the ''[[Border Reivers|gentlemen reivers]]''.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}} After the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] (1639–1651), policing the Scottish [[moss-trooper]]s tied up many English soldiers of the occupying [[New Model Army]]. Their contemporaries in Ireland became known as [[Tóraidhe|"tories"]].  [[Rapparees]], Irish guerrillas of a later generation, fought for King [[James II of England|James II]] after the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]] and on his defeat degenerated into brigands.

==Terrain==
[[File:Glatt-Räuber8113.jpg|thumb|[[Xaver Hohenleiter]] and his robber band]]
The forests of [[England]] gave cover to the outlaws, who were flatteringly portrayed in the ballads of [[Robin Hood]]. The dense [[Maquis shrubland]] and hills of [[Corsica]] gave the Corsican brigand many advantages, just as the bush of [[Australia]] concealed the [[bushranger]].{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

The [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], the mountains of [[Calabria]], the [[Sierra mountains (disambiguation)|Sierras]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; of [[Spain]], were the homes of the Italian ''banditi'', and the Spanish ''bandoleros'' (member of a gang) and ''salteadores''  (raiders).  The great haunts of brigands in Europe have been central and southern Italy and parts of Spain.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

England was ruled by [[William III of England|William III]], when "a fraternity of plunderers, thirty in number according to the lowest estimate, squatted near Waltham Cross under the shades of [[Epping Forest]], and built themselves huts, from which they sallied forth with sword and pistol to bid passengers stand".{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}} The Gubbings (so called in contempt from the trimmings and refuse of fish) infested [[Devon]]shire for a generation from their headquarters near [[Brent Tor]], on the edge of [[Dartmoor]].{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

==Historical examples==
===France===
In France there were the ''[[Écorcheurs]]'', or Skinners, in the 15th century, and the ''Chauffeurs'' around the time of the revolution. The first were large bands of discharged [[mercenary]] soldiers who pillaged the country. The second were ruffians who forced their victims to pay ransom by holding their feet in fires.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

In the years preceding the [[French Revolution]], the royal government was defied by the troops of [[Smuggling|smugglers]] and brigands known as ''faux saulniers'', unauthorized [[salt]]-sellers, and gangs of [[Poaching|poachers]] haunted the king's preserves round [[Paris]]. The salt monopoly and the excessive preservation of the game were so oppressive that the peasantry were provoked to violent resistance and to brigandage. The offenders enjoyed a large measure of public sympathy, and were warned or concealed by the population, even when they were not actively supported.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

[[s:Author:David Hannay|David Hannay]] writing in the 1911 edition of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] stated that in "[[Corsica]] the ''maquis'' has never been without its brigand hero, because industry has been stagnant, family feuds persist, and the government has never quite succeeded in persuading the people to support the law. The brigand is always a hero to at least one faction of [[Corsican people|Corsican]]s."{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

===Greece and the Balkans===
In 1870 an English party, consisting of [[Josslyn Pennington, 5th Baron Muncaster|Lord and Lady Muncaster]], Mr Vyner, Mr Lloyd, Mr Herbert, and Count de Boyl, was captured at Oropos, near Marathon, and a ransom of £25,000 was demanded. Lord and Lady Muncaster were set at liberty to seek for the ransom, but the Greek government sent troops in pursuit of the brigands, and the other prisoners were then murdered.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

In the Balkan peninsula, under Turkish rule, brigandage continued to exist in connection with Christian revolt against the Turks.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

=== India ===
The ''[[Dacoity|dacoits]]'' or brigands of India were of the same stamp as their European colleagues. The [[Pindari]]s were more than brigands, and the [[Thuggee|Thugs]] were a religious sect.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

=== Italy ===
[[File:Briganti 1862 from Bisaccia.jpg|thumb|150px|A small band of [[brigand]]s from [[Bisaccia]], photographed in 1862.]]
[[File:Carmine Crocco foto.jpg|right|thumb|[[Carmine Crocco]]]]
{{see also|Brigandage in the Two Sicilies}}
Until the middle of the 19th century Italy was divided into small states; therefore, the brigand who was closely pursued in one could flee to another. Thus it was that Marco Sciarra of the [[Abruzzo|Abruzzi]], when hard pressed by the Spanish viceroy of Naples - just before and after 1600 - could cross the border of the [[papal states]] and return on a favourable opportunity. When [[pope]] and [[viceroy]] combined against him he took service with [[Venice]], from whence he communicated with his friends at home and paid them occasional visits. On one such visit he was led into a trap and slain.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

Marco Sciarra was the follower and imitator of Benedetto Mangone, who was documented to have stopped a party of travellers which included [[Torquato Tasso]]. Sciarrae allowed them to pass unharmed out of his reverence for poets and poetry. Mangone was finally taken and beaten to death with hammers at Naples. He and his like are the heroes of much popular verse, written in ''ottava rima'' beginning with the traditional epic invocation to the muse. A fine example is ''The most beautiful history of the life and death of Pietro Mancino, chief of Banditi'',{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}} which begins:
{{cquote|
:"Io canto li ricatti, e il fiero ardire
:Del gran Pietro Mancino fuoruscito
:(Pietro Mancino that great outlawed man
:I sing, and all his rage.){{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}}}

In [[Kingdom of Naples]], every successive revolutionary disturbance saw a recrudescence of brigandage down to the unification of 1860–1861. The source of the trouble was the supporters of brigands (like [[Carmine Crocco]] from [[Basilicata]], the most famous outlaw during the [[Italian unification]]){{sfn|Hobsbawm|1985|p=25}} received from various kinds of ''manuténgoli'' (maintainers) - great men, corrupt officials, political parties, and the peasants who were terrorized, or who profited by selling the brigands food and clothes.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

In the Campagna in 1866, two English travellers, [[William John Charles Möens]] and the Rev. John Cruger Murray Aynsley, were captured and held for ransom; Aynsley was released shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Lee|1912|p=627}} Möens found that the ''manuténgoli'' of the brigands among the peasants charged famine prices for food, and extortionate prices for clothes and cartridges.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

===Mexico===
The [[Mexico|Mexican]] brigand [[Juan Cortina]] made incursions into [[Texas]] before the [[American Civil War]]. In Mexico the "[[Rurales]]" ended brigandage.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}

=== Spain ===
[[File:Tempranillo by Lewis.jpg|thumb|200px|Jose María el Tempranillo, legendary Spanish brigand of the 19th century.]]
In Spain brigandage was common in and south of the [[Sierra Morena]]. It reached its greatest heights in [[Catalonia]], where it began in the strife of the peasants against the feudal exactions of the landlords. It had its traditional hero, Roque Guinart, who figures in the second part of ''[[Don Quixote]].'' The revolt against the house of Austria in 1640 and the [[War of the Spanish Succession|War of the Succession]] (1700–1714) greatly stimululated Catalan brigandage. A country gentleman named Pedro Veciana, hereditary ''balio'' (military and civil lieutenant) of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tarragona|archbishop of Tarragona]] in the town of [[Valls]], armed his farm-servantsand resisted the attacks of the brigands. With the help of neighbouring country gentlemen he formed a strong band, known as the Mozos (Boys) of Veciana. The brigands combined to get rid of him by making an attack on the town of Valls, but were repulsed with great loss. The government of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] then commissioned Veciana to raise a special corps of police, the ''Escuadra de Cataluna'', which still exists. For five generations the colonel of the escuadra was always a Veciana. Since the organization of ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'' by the Duke of Ahumada, about 1844, brigandage has been well kept down. At the close of the [[Carlist War]] in 1874 a few bands infested [[Catalonia]].{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

The Sierra Morena, and the [[Serrania de Ronda]], have produced the bandits whose achievements form the subject of popular ballads, such as Francisco Esteban El Guapo (Francis Stephen, the Buck or Dandy), Don Juan de Serralonga, Pedranza, &amp;c. Jose Maria, called El Tempranillo (The Early Bird), was a liberal in the rising against [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], 1820–1823, then a smuggler, then a ''bandolero''. He was finally bought off by the government and took a commission to suppress the other brigands. Jose Maria was at last shot by one of them, whom he was endeavouring to arrest.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=565}}

===United States===
In relatively unsettled parts of the [[United States]] there was a considerable amount of a certain kind of brigandage, in early days, when the travel routes to the [[American West]] were infested by [[highwaymen]].  Such outlaws, when captured, were often dealt with in an extra-legal manner by groups of [[vigilante]]s known as [[vigilance committee]]s.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}  A notable example is the [[Harpe brothers]], who were active during the late 18th century.

It is currently being developed as a joint project between students in the Lawyering in the Digital Age Clinic at Columbia Law School and the Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/portfolio/law/collateral_consequen.html|title=Project Portfolio {{!}} Collateral Consequences Calculator}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content is overseen by legal experts in the covered areas.

==History==
Judith Kaye, former Chief Judge of the State of New York, initiated the Partners in Justice Colloquium in 2005 to bring together judges, legal practitioners, and law professors to improve collaboration between the different legal spheres concerning social justice issues. The focus of this initial conference was to gain a better understanding of [[collateral consequences of criminal charges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partners in Justice: Introduction|url=http://law.nyu.edu/journals/reviewoflawandsocialchange/issues/ECM_PRO_066270}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the results was the development of the "Four C's" website, which provides a collection of resources in each of the substantive areas where collateral consequences may occur. Due to the success of this site, development began on the Collateral Consequences Calculator, a "groundbreaking initiative" that will provide a convenient, easy-to-use overview of collateral consequences associated with specific sections of [[New York State Penal Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaye|first=Chief Judge Judith|title=The State of the Judiciary (2007)|url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/ctapps/asx/soj07.asx}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became publicly available on in May, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Storey|first=Jeff|title=Collateral Consequences Calculator is Launched|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=1202458170648&amp;News_In_Brief&amp;hbxlogin=1|accessdate=13 April 2011|newspaper=New York Law Journal|date=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Status==
The Calculator currently provides information in two important areas: immigration and public housing eligibility in New York City. The immigration consequences have been determined for the top 51 crimes that are either commonly charged or have commonly misunderstood immigration consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collateral Consequences Calculator|url=http://calculator.law.columbia.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The housing consequences have been determined for the entire New York penal code, but apply only to New York City public housing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11851">'''Compurgation''', also called '''wager of law''' and '''oath-helping''', was a defence used primarily in medieval law.  A defendant could establish his innocence or nonliability by taking an [[oath]] and by getting a required number of persons, typically twelve, to swear they believed the defendant's oath. From Latin, ''com'' = with, ''purgare'' = make clean, cleanse, excuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.myetymology.com/english/compurgation.html |title=English etymology of compurgation |publisher=myEtymology.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Latin ''com'' is also an intensifier&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor-last = Delbridge |editor-first = A ||display-editors=etal |title = Macquarie Australia's National Dictionary |publisher = The Macquarie Library Pty |year = 1997 |page = 388}}&lt;/ref&gt; and turns a word into the superlative form, so compurgation, by etymology, means 'to thoroughly clean or excuse'.

The wager of law was essentially a character reference, initially by kin and later by neighbours (from the same region as the defendant), often 11 or 12 men, and it was a way to give credibility to the oath of a defendant at a time when a person's oath had more credibility than a written record.  It can be compared to [[legal wager]], which is the provision of surety at the beginning of legal action to minimize frivolous litigation.

Compurgation was found in [[early Germanic law]], in early French law (''très ancienne coutume de Bretagne''), in [[Welsh law]], and in the English [[ecclesiastical courts]] until the seventeenth century. In [[common law]] it was substantially abolished as a defence in [[felonies]] by the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]] in 1164. The defence was still permitted in [[civil action]]s for debt and vestiges of it survived until its statutory repeal at various times in common law countries: in England in 1833,&lt;ref name="Friedman" /&gt; and [[Queensland]] at some point before the Queensland Common Practice Act of 1867&lt;ref name="QCLPA"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/REPEALED/C/CommLawPracA1867_01_.pdf |format = PDF |title=Common Law Practice Act 1867 |publisher=Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel |date=24 June 1994 |quote = Wager of law abolished – 3. No wager of law shall be allowed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes direct reference to the abolition of wager of law.

"Wager of Law, obsolete for centuries" was "a living fossil... a dead letter statute" and was repealed in England in 1833.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{citation |last=Friedman |first=Lawrence Meir

==Origins==
The procedure in a wager of law is traced by [[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Blackstone]] to the Mosaic law, Ex. xxii. 10; but it seems historically to have been derived from the system of compurgation, introduced into England from Normandy, a system which is now thought to have had an appreciable effect on the development of the English jury. It also has some points of resemblance, perhaps some historical connexion, with the sponsao and the decisory oath of Roman law, and the reference to oath of [[Scottish law]].&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2|wstitle=Wager |volume=28 |page=229 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri28chis#page/229/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
[Compurgation] had originated in Anglo-Saxon England in the ties of kinship that bound people together in the period before the year 1000, a time when each man was responsible for the acts of his blood relatives. Later, kinship gave way to a more tribal affiliation and a loyalty to the place of one's birth. When disputes more often than not led to violence, it seemed natural that neighbors would band together. They aligned themselves with a neighbour who was accused in court and swore that in good conscience they believed he was telling the truth. The number of oath-helpers required depended on the defendant's rank and the character of the lawsuit. Eventually it became standard practice to bring eleven neighbours into court to swear for the defendant. The oath-helpers were called compurgators, and the wager of law was called compurgation.&lt;ref name="legal-dictionary"&gt;{{citation |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Wager+of+law |title=Wager of law legal definition of Wager of law |publisher=Legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Wager of law, wager of battle and trial by ordeal==
The wager of law, also called compurgation, is an old legal practice, dating back to Saxon and feudal times, which was [[Contemporary history|contemporaneous]] to the appeal to God to prove fact by [[trial by battle]] (wager of battle, [[trial by combat]], or judicial duel), and of [[trial by ordeal]].&lt;ref name=hamowy&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj23n2/cj23n2-7.pdf |format=PDF |title=F. A. Hayek and the Common Law |first=Ronald |last=Hamowy
|journal=Cato Journal |volume=23 |issue=2 |date=Fall 2003 |publisher=Cato Institute |accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the oath instead of the real or feigned combat — [[Trial by combat#Great Britain and Ireland|real in English law]], feigned in Roman law — no doubt represents an advance in legal development. The technical term sacramentum is the bond of union between the two stages of law. In the wager of law the defendant, with eleven compurgators, appeared in court, and the defendant swore that he did not owe the debt, or (in detinue) that he did not detain the plaintiff's chattel; while the compurgators swore that they believed that he spoke the truth.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

==Surety==
A variation was for the defendant to give gage, or sureties, in an action of debt, and "that at a certain day assigned he would take a law, or oath, in open court, that he did not owe the debt, and at the same time bring with him eleven neighbors (called compurgators), who should avow upon their oaths that they believed in their consciences that he spoke the truth" (see the [[Tractatus of Glanvill|''Tractatus'' of Glanvill]], ca. 1188).

==Determining fact==
Wager of law was replaced by jury, from early times, to determine fact, at a time that judges managed legal procedure and did not determine fact. Trial "by lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land (legus terrae)" Cap. 29 of the [[Magna Carta]] 1215 to 1297.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/translation.html |title=Featured Document: The Magna Carta |publisher=Archives.gov |date=|accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wager of law was practised in England (and English  American colonies) until the 16th century, in criminal matters, and the 19th century, in civil matters.

==Supporting defendant's oath==
A defendant who elected to "make his law" was permitted to make a statement before the court, swear an oath that it was true, and present one or more individuals, often 12, who swore that they believed he had told the truth under oath. The predominant form of defense in the feudal courts, it persisted for a time in the common-law courts. The individuals "did not testify about the fact itself and, indeed, might have no personal knowledge concerning it. The value of a man’s oath might vary with his status; sometimes it was necessary for a defendant to meet a charge by assembling oaths of a prescribed monetary value. Because oath making often had religious implications for those who served as oath helpers and because there was also a possibility of legal sanctions (penalties), individuals might refuse to give oaths for persons with bad reputations. One reason for the long survival of the practice was that 'wagers in law' were often considered better evidence than account books in cases of debt."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/130405/compurgation |title=compurgation |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Welsh law]] allowed for a form of compurgation called [[assach]], which required not 12 but 300 compurgators.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/LFBooks/Maitland0161/CollectedPapers/Vol1/HTMLs/0242-01_Pt03_Essays1.html|title=The Laws of Wales|work=The Collected Papers of Frederic William Maitland|author=Fisher, H.A.L.|authorlink = H. A. L. Fisher| accessdate=2006-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition of wager of law==
{{quote|As the kings consolidated their power, suppressing violence and increasing the authority of the courts, the wager of law lost some of its ancient power and became a nuisance to litigants, who suspected that it frequently opened the door to false swearing. Different forms of action developed that did not permit the wager of law as a defense, and plaintiffs used them as much as possible. The procedure of wager of law had long since been obsolete when it was abolished during the reign of Henry IV (1399–1413).&lt;ref name="legal-dictionary"/&gt;}}

The taking of oaths was an eminently unsatisfactory way of arriving at the merits of a claim, and it is therefore not surprising to find that the policy of the law was in favour of its restriction rather than of its extension. Thus it was not permitted where the defendant was not a person of good character, where the king sued, where the defendant was the executor or administrator of the person alleged to have owed the debt, or in any form of action other than those named, even though the cause of action were the same.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

Trial by ordeal was abolished by order of the Lateran Council of 1215. Trial by battle was abolished in 1819 and wager of law was abolished in 1833, although both had fallen into disuse before their formal abolition.&lt;ref name=hamowy/&gt;

Wager of law was used as late as 1829, when the Rev. Fearon Jenkinson of Gnosall, Staffordshire used it against a Stafford ironmonger who claimed he was owed money by him. Jenkinson and his compurgators did not appear on the date.&lt;ref&gt;Chester Chronicle, 5 June 1829.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wager of law survived to recent centuries and in many jurisdictions it has been abolished by statute. It was abolished in New South Wales in 1841 by the Advancement of Justice Act 1841 (both Victoria and Queensland were still part of New South Wales at this time). This was re-enacted after separation of Queensland from New South Wales in the Queensland Common Law Practice Act 1867, but was strictly unnecessary, given its earlier abolition in 1841 &lt;ref name="QCLPA" /&gt; which makes direct reference to the abolition of wager of law.

No wager of law was allowed in [[assumpsit]], even though the cause of action were a simple debt. This led to the general adoption of assumpsit — proceeding originally upon a fictitious averment of a promise by the defendant — as a means of recovering debts. Where a penalty was created by statute, it became a common form to insert a proviso that no wager of law was to be allowed in an action for the penalty. Wager of law was finally abolished in 1833 (3 &amp; 4 William IV. c. 42).&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911 229"/&gt;

{{Politics of France}}

The '''Constitutional Council''' ({{lang-fr|Conseil constitutionnel}};  {{IPA-fr|kɔ̃sɛj kɔ̃stitysjɔˈnɛl}}) is the highest constitutional authority in [[France]]. It was established by the [[Constitution of France|Constitution of the Fifth Republic]] on 4 October 1958 and its duty is to ensure that constitutional principles and rules are upheld. It is housed in the [[Palais-Royal]], [[Paris]].

Its main activity is to rule on whether proposed statutes conform with the Constitution, after they have been voted by Parliament and before they are signed into law by the [[President of the French Republic]] (''a priori'' review). However, since 1 March 2010, individual citizens who are party to a trial or a lawsuit have been able to ask for the Council to review whether the law applied in the case is constitutional. In 1971, the Council ruled that conformity with the Constitution also entails conformity with two other texts referred to in the preamble of the Constitution, the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] and the preamble&lt;ref&gt;[[:wikisource:fr:Constitution de la IVe République#Pr.C3.A9ambule|Preamble of the Constitution of the Fourth Republic]], Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt; of the constitution&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Constitution du 27 octobre 1946|Constitution of the Fourth French Republic]], Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], both of which list constitutional rights.

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|left|The 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].]]

The [[Government of France]] [[Separation of powers|consists]] of an [[executive branch]] ([[President of France|President of the Republic]], [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], ministers, and their services and affiliated organizations), a [[legislative branch]] (both houses of [[French Parliament|Parliament]]), and a [[judicial branch]]. The [[Judiciary of France|judicial branch]] is, unlike for instance the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal judiciary]] of the United States under the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], not organized into a single hierarchy ([[Judiciary of France#Administrative Stream|administrative courts]] fall under the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Council of State]], [[Judiciary of France#Civil courts|civil]] and [[Judiciary of France#Criminal courts|criminal courts]] under the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]]), and some of its entities also have advisory functions. For historical reasons there has long been a hostility to having anything resembling a "Supreme Court"—that is, a powerful court able to quash legislation.&lt;ref name="Beardsley"&gt;James Beardsley, ''Constitutional Review in France'', The Supreme Court Review, Vol. 1975, (1975), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3108812 pp. 189–259]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Michael H. Davis, ''The Law/Politics Distinction, the French Conseil Constitutionnel, and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U. S. Supreme Court]]'', The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 34, No. 1 (Winter, 1986), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/840292 pp. 45–92]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tallon"&gt;Denis Tallon, John N. Hazard, George A. Bermann, ''The Constitution and the Courts in France'', The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 27, No. 4 (Autumn, 1979), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/839794 pp. 567–587]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the Council is a court is a subject of academic discussion,&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[François Luchaire]], « Le Conseil constitutionnel est-il une juridiction ? », ''Revue du droit public et de la science politique en France et à l'étranger (RDP)'', janvier-juin 1979 (volume 1), pp. 27–52&lt;/ref&gt; but some scholars consider it the [[supreme court]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Waline, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/838736 The Constitutional Council of the French Republic]'', The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 12, No. 4 (Autumn, 1963), pp. 483–493 lists reasons for the Council to be considered as a court: "If it be admitted that a judicial authority is characterized by the effect of ''[[res judicata]]'' attaching to its decisions,  it must necessarily be concluded that
the Constitutional Council is a court, and even the supreme court of the State"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic]] distinguishes two distinct kinds of legislation: [[statute law]], which is normally voted upon by [[Parliament of France|Parliament]] (except for ''[[ordonnance (French constitutional law)|ordonnance]]s'') and government regulations, which are enacted by the Prime Minister and his government as [[decree]]s and other regulations (''arrêtés'').&lt;ref name="Beardsley"/&gt; Article 34 of the Constitution exhaustively lists the areas reserved for statute law: these include, for instance, [[criminal law]].

Any regulation issued by the executive in the areas constitutionally reserved for statute law is unconstitutional unless it has been authorized as [[secondary legislation]] by a statute. Any citizen with an interest in the case can obtain the cancellation of these regulations by the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], on grounds that the executive has exceeded its authority. Furthermore, the Council of State can quash regulations on grounds that they violate existing statute law, constitutional rights or the "general principles of law".&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Neville Brown, John Bell, Jean-Michel Galabert, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=v_X1xhiyl28C French administrative law]'', 5 ed., 1998, [[Clarendon Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-826555-7}}; see p. 220 for the general principles of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, new acts can be referred to the Constitutional Council by a petition just prior to being signed into law by the President of the Republic. The most common circumstance for this is that 60 opposition members of the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]], or 60 opposition members of the [[Senate of France|Senate]] request such a review.&lt;ref name="Prosser"/&gt;

If the Prime Minister thinks that some clauses of existing statute law instead belong to the domain of regulations, he can also ask the Council to reclassify these clauses as regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Article 37 of the Constitution: "Provisions of statutory origin enacted in such matters may be amended by decree issued after consultation with the Council of State. Any such provisions passed after the coming into force of the Constitution shall be amended by decree only if the Constitutional Council has found that they are matters for regulation as defined in the foregoing paragraph."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An example of such reclassification is decision [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/depuis-1958/decisions-par-date/2008/2008-210-l/decision-n-2008-210-l-du-07-mai-2008.12133.html 2008-210 L] of 7 May 2008, with scholarly commentary in ''[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/depuis-1958/decisions-par-date/2008/2008-210-l/decision-n-2008-210-l-du-07-mai-2008.12133.html Commentaire de la décision n° 2008-210 L du 7 mai 2008 – Nature juridique de dispositions du code de la route]'' ("Comments on decision 2008-210 L of 7 May 2008 – Juridical nature of provisions in the Road code") in ''Les Cahiers du Conseil constitutionnel, Cahier n° 25'' ("The Constitutional Council's notebooks"): the name of the administration with which certain administrative procedures should be filed is not the domain of statute law, but of regulation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, France refused to accept the idea that courts could quash legislation enacted by Parliament (though administrative courts could quash regulations produced by the executive). This goes back to the French revolutionary era: pre-revolutionary courts had often used their power not to register laws and thus prevent their application for political purposes, and had blocked reforms. French courts were then prohibited from making rulings of a general nature. Also, it seemed that if courts could quash legislation after it had been enacted and taken into account by citizens, it would introduce legal uncertainties: how could a citizen plan his or her actions according to what is legal or not if laws could ''a posteriori'' be found not to hold? Yet, in the late 20th century, courts, especially administrative courts, began applying the consequences of international treaties, including law of the [[European Union]], as superior to national law.

A 2009 reform, effective on 1 March 2010, enables parties to a lawsuit or trial to question the constitutionality of the law that is being applied to them. The procedure, known as ''question prioritaire de constitutionnalité'', is broadly as follows: the question is raised before the trial judge and, if it has merit, it is forwarded to the appropriate supreme court (Council of State if the referral comes from an administrative court, Cour de Cassation for other courts). The supreme court collects such referrals and submits them to the Constitutional Council. If the Constitutional Council rules a law to be unconstitutional, this law is struck down from the law books; this decision is valid for everybody and not only for the cases at hand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/en_ordinance_58_1067.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and tasks==
[[File:Conseil constitutionnel fr sallereunion.jpg|thumb|280px|Council reunion room]]
The Council has two main areas of power:
# The first is the supervision of elections, both [[President of France|presidential]] and [[Parliament of France|parliamentary]] and ensuring the legitimacy of [[referendum]]s (Articles 58, 59 and 60). They issue the official results, they ensure proper conduct and fairness, and they see that campaign spending limits are adhered to. The Council is the supreme authority in these matters. The Council can declare an election to be invalid if improperly conducted, or if the elected candidate used illegal methods, or if he spent for his campaign over the legal limits.
# The second area of Council power is the interpretation of the fundamental meanings of the constitution, procedure, legislation, and treaties. The Council can declare dispositions of laws to be contrary to the ''[[Constitution of France]]'' or to the principles of constitutional value that it has deduced from the Constitution or from the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]''. It also may declare laws to be in contravention of [[treaty|treaties]] which France has signed, such as the ''[[European Convention on Human Rights]].'' Their declaring that a law is contrary to constitutional or treaty dispositions renders it invalid. The Council also may impose reservations as to the interpretation of certain provisions in statutes. The decisions of the Council are binding on all authorities.

In some cases, examination of laws by the Council is compulsory. [[Organic law#Organic laws in France|Organic bills]], those which fundamentally affect government and treaties, need to be assessed by the Council before they are considered ratified (Article 61-1 and 54). Amendments concerning the rules governing parliamentary procedures need to be considered by the Council, as well. Guidance may be sought from the Council in regard to whether reform should come under statute law (voted by Parliament) or whether issues are considered as ''règlement'' (regulation) to be adopted with [[decree]] of the [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]]. The re-definition of legislative dispositions as regulatory matters initially constituted a significant share of the (then light) caseload of the Council.

In the case of other statutes, seeking the oversight of the Council is not compulsory. However, the President of the Republic, the President of the Senate, the President of the Assembly, the Prime Minister of France, or 60 members of the National Assembly, or 60 Senators&lt;ref&gt;Note that this is not 60 members of Parliament: all members on the referral petition must be from the same house of Parliament, though of course members from both houses can submit petitions at the same time and with the same arguments.&lt;/ref&gt; can submit a statute for examination by the Council before its signing into law by the President. In general, it is the parliamentary [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] which brings laws that it deems to infringe civil rights before the Council.&lt;ref name="Prosser"&gt;[[Tony Prosser]], ''Constitutions and Political Economy: The Privatisation of Public Enterprises in France and Great Britain'', The Modern Law Review, Vol. 53, No. 3 (May 1990), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1096473 pp. 304–320]; see p. 307 "The number of references has steadily grown; it is no
exaggeration to claim that any important controversial legislation is now likely to be referred."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another task of the council, of lesser importance in terms of number of referrals, is the reclassification of statute law into the domain of regulations, on the Prime Minister's request. This happens when the Prime Minister and his government wish to alter law that has been enacted as statute law, but should instead belong to regulations according to the Constitution. The Prime Minister has to obtain reclassification from the Council prior to taking any [[decree]] changing the regulations. This, however, is nowadays only a small fraction of the Council's activity: in 2008, out 140 of decisions, only 5 concerned reclassifications.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Council, [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/depuis-1958/decisions-par-date/2008/les-decisions-de-2008.425.html Index of 2008 decisions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and evolution==
[[File:Conseil Constitutionnel, logo 2016.svg|thumb|left|Logotype of the Constitutional Council of France.]]
While since the 19th century the judicial review that the Constitutional Council brings to bear on the acts of the [[executive branch]] has played an increasingly large role, the politicians that framed the successive French institutions have long been reluctant to have the judiciary review legislation. The argument was that un-elected judges should not be able to overrule directly the decisions of the democratically elected legislature. This may also have reflected the poor impression that the political action of the [[parlement]]s – courts of justice under the [[ancien régime]] monarchy – had left: these courts often had chosen to block legislation in order to further the privileges of a small caste. Whatever the reasons, the idea was that legislation was a political tool, and that the responsibility of legislation should be borne by the legislative body.&lt;ref name="Beardsley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tallon"/&gt;

Originally, the Council was meant to have rather technical responsibilities: ensuring that national elections were fair, arbitrating the division between statute law (from the legislative) and regulation (from the executive), etc. The Council role of safekeeping fundamental rights was probably not originally intended by the drafters of the Constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic]]: it was thought that Parliament should be able to see for itself that it did not infringe on such rights. However, the Council's activity considerably extended in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Jan, ''Le Conseil constitutionnel'', Pouvoirs n° 99 2001/4, pp. 71–86, [[Le Seuil]], {{ISBN|2-02-048213-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1958 to 1970, under [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s presidency, the Constitutional Council was sometimes described as a "cannon aimed at Parliament", protecting the executive branch against encroachment by statute law voted by Parliament. All but one referral to the Constitutional Council came from the Prime Minister, against acts of Parliament, and the Council agreed to partial annulments in all cases. The only remaining referral came from the President of the Senate, [[Gaston Monnerville]], against the [[French presidential election referendum, 1962|1962 referendum]] on the direct election of the President of the Republic, which Charles de Gaulle supported; and the Council ruled itself "incompetent" to cancel the direct expression of the will of the French people.&lt;ref&gt;Alec Stone, ''The Birth of Judicial Politics in France: The Constitutional Council in Comparative Perspective'', [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-507034-8}}, chapter III&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, however, the Council ruled unconstitutional ([http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/1971/7144dc.htm Decision 71-44DC]) some provisions of a law changing the rules for the incorporation of private nonprofit associations, because they infringed on freedom of association, one of the principles given in the 1789 ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]''; they used the fact that the preamble of the French constitution briefly referred to those principles to justify their decision. For the first time, a statute was declared unconstitutional not because it infringed on technical legal principles, but because it was deemed to infringe on personal freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Jérôme Favre, ''La décision du Conseil constitutionnel du 16 juillet 1971. L'invention d'un nouveau pouvoir juridictionnel.'', Revue d'étude politique des assistants parlementaires, nr 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Letourneur, R. Drago, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/837562 The Rule of Law as Understood in France]'', The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Spring, 1958), pp. 147–177&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the possibility to request a constitutional review was extended to 60 members of the National Assembly or 60 senators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000514191 Loi n°74-904 du 29 octobre 1974] portant révision de l'article 61 de la Constitution&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, the political opposition seized that opportunity to request the review of all controversial acts.&lt;ref name="Prosser"/&gt;

The Council increasingly has frowned upon "[[rider (legislation)|rider]]s" (''cavaliers'') – amendments or clauses introduced into bills but having no relationship to the original topic of the bill; for instance, "budgetary riders" in the Budget bill, or "social riders" in the Social security budget bill. ''See [[Rider (legislation)#Europe|legislative riders in France]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Council, [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/pdf/Conseil/droitamd.pdf État de la jurisprudence du Conseil constitutionnel sur le droit d'amendement] ("State of the Constitutional Council case law on the right of amendment")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Les Cahiers du Conseil constitutionnel, Cahier n° 22, [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank/download/2006-544DC-ccc_544dc.pdf Commentaire] de la [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/depuis-1958/decisions-par-date/2006/2006-544-dc/decision-n-2006-544-dc-du-14-decembre-2006.1016.html décision n° 2006-544 DC du 14 décembre 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005, [[Pierre Mazeaud]], then president of the Council, announced that the Council would take a stricter view of language of a non-prescriptive character introduced in laws,&lt;ref&gt;Véronique Champeil-Desplats, ''[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/pdf/pdf_cahiers/cccc21.pdf N'est pas normatif qui peut. L'exigence de normativité dans la jurisprudence du Conseil constitutionnel.]'' ("Anything that can be [[Normative#Standards documents|normative]] is not. The exigence of normativity in the case law of the Constitutional Council"), in ''Les Cahiers du Conseil Constitutionnel'', nr 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes known as "legislative neutrons".&lt;ref&gt;The phrase ''neutron législatif'' ("legislative neutron") was coined by [[Jean Foyer]] to designate provisions in statute law that have "null juridical charge" and thus are ''neutral'' with respect to the state of law. This phrase uses imagery from [[particle physics]] – a neutron has null ''electrical'' charge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mazeaud-2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foyer"&gt;Proceedings of the National Assembly, [http://archives.assemblee-nationale.fr/7/cri/1981-1982-ordinaire2/115.pdf 21 June 1982, third sitting], Jean Foyer: « Cette semaine, le ministre d'État, ministre de la recherche et de la technologie, nous présente un projet dont je dirai, ne parlant pas latin pour une fois, mais empruntant ma terminologie à la langue des physiciens, qu'il est pour l'essentiel un assemblage de neutrons législatifs, je veux dire de textes dont la charge juridique est nulle. » – "This week, the minister of State, minister for research and technology &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; presents us a bill of which I'll say, without talking in latin for once, but instead borrowing my words from the physicists, that it is mostly an assembly of legislative neutrons, I mean of texts with a null juridical charge."&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of prescribing or prohibiting, as advocated by [[Jean-Étienne-Marie Portalis|Portalis]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Étienne-Marie Portalis]], ''[http://classiques.uqac.ca/collection_documents/portalis/discours_1er_code_civil/discours.html Discours préliminaire du premier projet de Code civil]'' ("Preliminary speech for the first project for a [[Civil code]]"): « [La loi] permet ou elle défend ; elle ordonne, elle établit, elle corrige, elle punit ou elle récompense. » ("[Law] permits, or defends; it orders, it establishes, it corrects, it punishes or it rewards.")&lt;/ref&gt; such language makes statements about the state of the world, or wishes about what it should be. Previously, this language was considered devoid of juridical effects and thus harmless; but Mazeaud contended that introducing vague language devoid of juridical consequences just dilutes law unnecessarily. He denounced the use of law as an instrument of political communication, expressing vague wishes instead for effective legislation. Mazeaud also said that, because of the constitutional objective that law should be accessible and understandable, law should be precise and clear, and devoid of details or equivocal formulas.&lt;ref name="Mazeaud-2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/documentation-publications/le-conseil-au-jour-le-jour/le-conseil-en-2004/voeux-a-l-elysee.5147.html|title=Conseil Constitutionnel|first=|last=NEXINT|date=12 July 2008|website=conseil-constitutionnel.fr|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/2006/01/04/constitution-jean-louis-debre-et-pierre-mazeaud-font-la-lecon-au-gouvernement_727180_0.html MM.

{{As of|2004}}, one law out of two, including the budget, was sent to the Council at the request of the opposition. In January 2005, Pierre Mazeaud, then president of the Council, publicly deplored the inflation of the number of constitutional review requests motivated by political concerns, without much legal argumentation to back them on constitutional grounds.&lt;ref name="Mazeaud-2005"/&gt;

The [[French constitutional law of 23 July 2008]] amended article 61 of the Constitution. It now allows for courts to submit questions of unconstitutionality of laws to the Constitutional Council. The [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] (supreme court over civil and criminal courts) and the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] (supreme court over administrative courts) filter the requests coming from the courts under them.

On 29 December 2012, the council said it is overturning an upper income tax rate of 75% due to be introduced in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=French 75% income tax thrown out|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20864114|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 1995, [[Roland Dumas]] was appointed president of the Council by [[François Mitterrand]]. Roland Dumas attracted major controversy twice. First, he appeared in scandals regarding the [[Elf Aquitaine]] oil company, with many details regarding his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], Christine Deviers-Joncour, and his expensive tastes in clothing appearing in the press.&lt;ref&gt;John Tagliabue, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/18/world/at-a-french-trial-a-tale-unfolds-of-graft-on-high.html At a French Trial, a Tale Unfolds of Graft on High]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the Council put forth some highly controversial opinions in a decision related to the [[International Criminal Court]], in [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/1998/98408/98408dc.htm?CCONSTIT1=0310025720814089 Decision 98–408 DC], declaring that the sitting President of the Republic could be tried criminally only by the High Court of Justice, a special court organized by Parliament and originally meant for cases of high treason. This, in essence, ensured that [[Jacques Chirac]] would not face criminal charges until he left office. This controversial decision is now moot since the rules of responsibility of the President of the Republic were redefined by the [[French constitutional law of 23 July 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://affaires-publiques.org/point/gp/pres.htm Responsabilité pénale du chef de l'Etat ?]'' ("The criminal responsibility of the head of state?"), Affaires Publiques&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, because of the [[Elf Aquitaine#Fraud scandal|Elf scandal]], Roland Dumas put himself on leave from the Council and [[Yves Guéna]] assumed the interim presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebdo.nouvelobs.com/hebdo/parution/p1843/articles/a38459-au_revoir_dumas_bonjour_sirven.html Les nouveaux rebondissements de l'affaire Elf – Au revoir Dumas, bonjour Sirven] ("Breaking news about the [[Elf Aquitaine#Fraud scandal|Elf case]] – Goodbye [[Roland Dumas|Dumas]], welcome [[Alfred Sirven|Sirven]]"), [[Le Nouvel Observateur]], N°1843&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Council attracted some controversy when [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] and [[Simone Veil]] campaigned for the proposed [[European Constitution]], which was submitted to the French voters in a referendum. Simone Veil had done so after obtaining a [[leave of absence]] from the Council, which was criticized by some, including [[Jean-Louis Debré]], president of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], as a dubious procedure – to follow their reasoning, what is the use of prohibiting appointed members of the council from conducting partisan politics if they can put themselves on leave for the duration of the campaign? She defended herself by pointing to precedent and famously remarked "How is that his business? He has no lesson to teach me." about Debré.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/france/2005/0,,3217497,00-referendum-simone-veil-repond-debre-.html Référendum : Simone Veil répond à Debré]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' (Referendum: [[Simone Veil]] responds to [[Jean-Louis Debré|Debré]]), [[La Chaîne Info|LCI]], 6 May 2005.

[[File:PR-2012-05-15 IMG 1526.jpg|thumb|[[Laurent Fabius]], current President of the Constitutional Council]]
The Council is made up of former Presidents of the Republic who have chosen to sit in the Council (which they may not do if they become directly involved in politics again), and nine other members who serve non-renewable terms of nine years, one third of whom are appointed every three years, three each by the [[President of France|President of the Republic]], the [[List of Presidents of the National Assembly of France|President of the National Assembly]], and the [[List of Presidents of the Senate of France|President of the Senate]].&lt;ref name="LO58-1067"&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000705065 Ordonnance n°58-1067 du 7 novembre 1958] portant loi organique sur le Conseil constitutionnel ("[[Ordonnance (French constitutional law)|Ordinance]] 58-1067 of 7 November 1958, [[organic law (France)|organic bill]] on the Constitutional council"). About swearing-in: article 3 says ''Avant d'entrer en fonction, les membres nommés du Conseil constitutionnel prêtent serment devant le Président de la République.'' ("Before assuming their duties, the appointed members of the Constitutional council are sworn in before the President of the Republic.")&lt;/ref&gt; The President of the Constitutional Council is selected by the President of the Republic.

Following the [[French constitutional law of 23 July 2008|2008 constitutional revision]], appointments to the Council are subject to a parliamentary approval process (Constitution of France, articles 13 and 56). {{As of|2009|08}}, these provisions are not operational yet since the relevant procedures have not yet been set in law.

A [[quorum]] of seven members is imposed unless exceptional circumstances are noted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000705065 Ordonnance n°58-1067 du 7 novembre 1958], article 14&lt;/ref&gt; Votes are by majority of the members present at the meeting; the president of the Council has a [[casting vote]] in case of an equal split.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, article 56: ''Le président est nommé par le Président de la République. Il a voix prépondérante en cas de partage.''&lt;/ref&gt; For decisions about the incapacity of the President of the Republic, a majority of the members of the council is needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000705065 Ordonnance n°58-1067 du 7 novembre 1958], article 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], former President of the Republic (sat from May 2012 to July 2013)
* [[François Hollande]], former President of the Republic (never sat)

The members of the Council, except for former Presidents of the Republic, are sworn in by the President of the Republic&lt;ref name="LO58-1067"/&gt;

The members of the Council should abstain from [[Partisan (political)|partisanship]]. They should refrain from making declarations that could lead them to be suspected of partisanship. The possibility for former presidents to sit in the Council is a topic of moderate controversy; some see it as incompatible with the absence of partisanship.&lt;ref name="LO58-1067"/&gt; [[René Coty]], [[Vincent Auriol]], [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] are the only former Presidents of France to have sat in the Council.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

'''Constitutional economics''' is a [[research program]] in [[economics]] and [[constitutionalism]] that has been described as explaining the choice "of alternative sets of legal-institutional-constitutional rules that constrain the choices and activities of economic and political agents". This extends beyond the definition of "the economic analysis of constitutional law" and is distinct from explaining the choices of economic and political agents within those rules, a subject of orthodox economics.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Van den Hauwe, 2005. "Constitutional Economics II," ''The Elgar Companion to Law and Economics'', pp. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=EtguKoWHUHYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA223&amp;=fals 223–24.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutional economics takes into account the significant impacts of political economic decisions as opposed to limiting analysis to economic relationships as functions of the dynamics of distribution of marketable goods and services. "The political economist who seeks to offer normative advice, must, of necessity, concentrate on the process or structure within which political decisions are observed to be made. Existing constitutions, or structures or rules, are the subject of critical scrutiny."&lt;ref name= "Buchanan1986"&gt;James M. Buchanan, 1986. [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1986/buchanan-lecture.html "The Constitution of Economic Policy,"] Nobel Prize lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutional economics has been characterized as a practical approach to apply the tools of economics to constitutional matters. For example, a major concern of every nation is the proper allocation of available national economic and financial resources. The legal solution to this problem falls within the scope of constitutional economics.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Kirchnez, ''The Principles of Subsidiary in the Treaty on European Union: A Critique from a Perspective of Constitutional Economics'', 6 TUL. J.INT’L. &amp; COMP. L. 291, 293 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is to study the "compatibility of effective economic decisions with the existing constitutional framework and the limitations or the favorable conditions created by that framework".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, 2001. "Constitutional Economics and the Bank of Russia," ''Fordham Journal of Corporate and Financial Law'', 7(1), [http://law2.fordham.edu/publications/articles/600flspub9473.pdf p. 160.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:James Buchanan by Atlas network.jpg|220px|thumb|Constitutional economics was popularized by [[James M. Buchanan]], for which he received the 1986 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (pictured here in September 2010)]]
The term "constitutional economics" was coined in 1982 by the U.S. economist Richard McKenzie to designate the main topic of discussion at a conference held in Washington D.C. Later, McKenzie's neologism was adopted by another American economist, [[James M. Buchanan]], as a name for a new academic sub-discipline. It was Buchanan's work on this sub-discipline that brought him the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] for his "development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making" in 1986. Constitutionalism has been the subject of criticism for its previous ignorance of economic issues but this criticism was taken into account by the development of constitutional economics. Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the [[state (polity)|state]] as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1986/buchanan.html|title=James M. Buchanan Jr. - Facts|author=|date=|website=nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics. A constitutional economics approach allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis, helping to avoid a one-dimensional understanding. Buchanan believes that a [[constitution]], intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions and to balance interests of the [[state (polity)|state]] and [[society]] against those of individuals and their constitutional rights to [[personal freedom]] and private [[happiness]].&lt;ref name="James Buchanan 1999, p. 314"&gt;James Buchanan, The Logical Foundations of Constitutional Liberty, Volume 1, Liberty Fund, Indianapolis, 1999, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutional economics draws substantial inspiration from the reformist attitude which is characteristic of [[Adam Smith]]’s vision, and that Buchanan’s concept can be considered the modern-day counterpart to what Smith called “the science of [[legislation]].” According to Buchanan the ethic of constitutionalism is a key for constitutional order and "may be called the idealized [[Kantian]] world" where the individual "who is making the ordering, along with substantially all of his fellows, adopts the moral law as a general rule for behaviour".&lt;ref name="James Buchanan 1999, p. 314"/&gt;

Buchanan's Nobel lecture quoted the work of the late 19th century Swedish economist [[Knut Wicksell]], who greatly influenced Buchanan's research: "If utility is zero for each individual member of the community, the total utility for the community cannot be other than zero." In epigraph to the chapter of Nobel lecture entitled "The Constitution of Economic Policy" Wicksell states that "whether the benefits of the proposed activity to the individual citizens would be greater than its cost to them, no one can judge this better than the individuals themselves."&lt;ref name= "Buchanan1986"/&gt;

Buchanan introduced rich cross-disciplinary concepts of "constitutional citizenship" and "constitutional anarchy". Constitutional anarchy is a modern policy that may be best described as actions undertaken without understanding or taking into account the rules that define the constitutional order. This policy is justified by references to strategic tasks formulated on the basis of competing interests regardless of their subsequent impact on political structure. At the same time Buchanan introduces the concept of "constitutional citizenship", which he designates as compliance of citizens with their constitutional rights and obligations that should be considered as a constituent part of the constitutional policy. Buchanan also outlines importance of protection of the moral principles underlying constitutional norms.

=== Ethics of constitutional citizenship ===

James Buchanan wrote that "the ethics of constitutional citizenship is not directly comparable to ethical behavior in interaction with other persons within the constraints imposed by the rules of an existing regime. An individual may be fully responsible, in the standard ethical sense, and yet fail to meet the ethical requirement of constitutional citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J. Logical Foundations of Constitutional Liberty. Vol. 1. Indianapolis, 1999. p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan considered the term "constitutionality" in the broad sense and applied it to families, firms and public institutions, but, first of all, to the state.

Buchanan emphasised that public policy cannot be considered in terms of [[distribution of wealth|distribution]], but is instead always a question of the choice over rules of the game that engender a pattern of exchange and distribution. Buchanan is largely responsible for the rebirth of political economy as a scholarly pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Boettke, P.J. (1998). James M. Buchanan and the rebirth of political economy, in (S. Pressman and R. Holt, eds.), Against the Grain: Dissent in Economics, pp. 21–39, Aldershot, UK: Edward Elgar Publishing, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan's work in [[Public choice theory|public choice]] is often interpreted as the quintessential case of economic imperialism. However, as [[Amartya Sen]] has pointed out,&lt;ref&gt;Amartya Sen, in ''Economics and Sociology'', ch. 14, Princeton: Princeton University Press. p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan should not be identified with economic imperialism. Sen states that Buchanan has done more than most to introduce ethics, legal political thinking, and indeed social thinking into economics.&lt;ref&gt;Swedberg, R. (1990). ''Economics and Sociology: On Redefining Their Boundaries'', New Jersey: Princeton University Press. p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucial to understanding Buchanan's system of thought is the distinction he made between politics and policy. Politics is about the rules of the game, where policy is focused on strategies that players adopt within a given set of rules. “Questions about what are good rules of the game are in the domain of social philosophy, whereas questions about the strategies that players will adopt given those rules is the domain of economics, and it is the play between the rules (social philosophy) and the strategies (economics) that constitutes what Buchanan refers to as constitutional political economy”.&lt;ref&gt;"Where Economics and Philosophy Meet: Review of ''The Elgar Companion to Economics and Philosophy'' with responses from the authors", ''The Economic Journal'', 116 (June), 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Buchanan, along with a few other budding constitutional economists, launched the journal ''Constitutional Political Economy'' with the purpose of further researching and developing the discipline. Buchanan wrote the vanguard article entitled "The Domain of Constitutional Economics", establishing the bounds of the emerging study and cementing the various topics he developed in 1962 and 1986. Buchanan gave a technical definition of constitutional economics as the research program directed at the rules of institutions in which individuals make choices, along with the process of creating these rules. While ordinary economic inquiry focuses on the choices within the rules or the constraints imposed on the individuals, constitutional economics aims at the actual rules themselves, the choice among constraints. Individuals agree to place constraints on themselves in exchange for anticipated benefits, a similar to a [[social contract]] view of government.&lt;ref&gt;Van den Hauwe, Ludwig (1999). "Constitutional Economics," in ''The Elgar Companion to Law and Economics'' Second edition, edited by J. Backhaus. Edward Elgar Publishing Limited: Cheltenham, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as a market transaction occurs through voluntary, mutually beneficial exchange, so with political "exchanges" of rights and authority.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, James M. (1990). "The Domain of Constitutional Economics," ''Constitutional Political Economy'', 1(1): [http://www.walkerd.people.cofc.edu/400/Sobel/2A-8.%20Buchanan%20-%20Constitutional%20Economics.pdf  1–18].&lt;/ref&gt;

With this theory, politics becomes a form of exchange and is therefore worthy of economic analysis, thus establishing the formal beginning of constitutional economics. By the end of the article, Buchanan enters philosophical territory, almost verging on skepticism, saying that each individual must perceive phenomena through his particular "window" and agreement is impossible when everyone views reality from different windows. Due to radical individualism, constitutional economics can include only people who view the world through economic paradigms or windows, not idealistic, goal-driven paradigms.

==Positive constitutional economics==

Within positive constitutional economics, the tools or methods are unique from normal economic tools because of the [[cross-disciplinary]] nature of the program. The main tool of positive constitutional economics is "comparative institutional analysis", with four main elements:&lt;ref&gt;Voigt, Stephan (1997). "Positive Constitutional Economics: A Survey," Public Choice, 90(1/4): 11–53).&lt;/ref&gt; 
# The first element examines how certain constitutional rules arose and what factors caused the rules to be developed as a result of aggregated individual inputs. 
# The second element looks at how rules are distinguishable between individual and collective factors, though Voigt acknowledges this research method is rarely used.
# The third element is the possibilities of further constitutional (or rules) change. Any proposed change to constitutional constraints, or rules of constraints, are subject to economic scrutiny for their effects on efficiency and equity.
# The fourth element of positive constitutional economics examines the economic effects of developed or modified change to rules.
All economic analysis seeks to maximize efficiency, and constitutional economics is no exception. In the market, individuals maximize efficiency when both parties perceive a personal benefit, mutual exchange, and when resources go to their highest valued use. Market economy is today's reality, but it must be a "constitutional market economy" as a term introduced by Chief Justice of Indonesian Constitutional Court Jimly Asshiddiqie in his "Economic Constitution". The political process is one of exchange, only unlike the market, the resources exchanged are political, not material or financial. Therefore, political efficiency is political consent, or when all individuals in the community agree to the political structures.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, James M. (1988). "Contractarian Political Economy and Constitutional Interpretation," ''The American Economic Review'', 78(2): 135–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Constitutional economics mimics a traditional [[Social contract|contractarian]] political economy in its focus on the contract, or consent, between the governed and government. However, consent follows efficiency in markets while efficiency follows consent in politics.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Normative constitutional economics ==

Normative constitutional economics focuses on legitimizing the state and its actions as the best means of maximum efficiency and utility, judging conditions or rules that are efficient, and discerning and studying the political systems to maximize efficiency, where the outcome of collective choices are considered "fair", "just", or "efficient".
Once again, Buchanan dominates the normative discussion of constitutional economics, specifically how methodological individualism affects economic analysis.

By 1988, Buchanan's thought had matured since his speech in 1986. Both Buchanan and Stefan Voigt argue the foundational assumption of normative constitutional economics is that no single individual's goals or values can supersede the value of another's. Therefore, a universal, absolute social norm or goal is impossible. Since politics is a form of exchange, when individuals agree to exchange goods, they are acting rationally in their own perceived self-interest if the decision is voluntary and informed. With these criteria, any such agreement is "efficient" and therefore normatively ought to occur.

Methodological individualism leads Buchanan to the normative claim that a political theory very similar to that of [[John Rawls]] in his seminal 1971 work, ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', would best realize individuals' unique goals. Complete with a [[veil of ignorance]] and ''a priori'' decisions of social goals, Buchanan says political economy does not have a social engineer or moral purpose but only assists individuals in their search for rules that best serve their individual purposes. For Buchanan, the "good" society is one that furthers the interests of individuals, not some independent moral or teleological end.

=== Hayek ===

Buchanan is not the only contributor to normative constitutional economics. Economic polymath [[Friedrich Hayek]] also wrote extensively on the topic of constitutional economics, even if he did not name constitutional economics specifically. Hayek defends a representative [[constitutional democracy]] as the best structure of government.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, Friedrich A. (1973). ''Law, Legislation, and Liberty'', Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek's main project was the vindication of freedom and establishing criteria for a regime of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, Friedrich A. (1960). ''The Constitution of Liberty'', Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek was worried by the kind of state that Buchanan/Rawls deemed normative. Hayek thought it necessary for a return to the traditional views of government, human nature, political philosophy, and economics. He believed the Buchanan/Rawls state had the almost inevitable propensity to totalitarianism as the state seeks to maximize individual utility. People would soon be at the mercy of para-government bureaucracy of the provision-state.

Hayek cautions his readers against rashly launching into the kind of state Rawls and Buchanan conceive, saying individual choice cannot be the only determining factor in the choices of constraints, and the actual structure of the rules or constraints (the constitution) must conform to what Buchanan would label a supra-individual goal. For Hayek, liberal constitutional democracies are the best way to achieve the goal of individual freedom, equality, opportunity, and efficiency for three reasons. First, constitutions codify pre-existing (presumably efficient) law. Second, they place explicit constraints on government to prevent totalitarianism. Finally, they preserve law and order for the polis. All of this is within the framework of a moral and teleological order.

==Economic analysis of the US Constitution==

The generally accepted birth of constitutional economic analysis of US Constitution was [[Charles Austin Beard]]'s landmark 1913 book ''[[An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States]]''.&lt;ref name= "Beard1913"&gt;Beard, Charles A. (1913). ''An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States'', New York: Macmillan Publishing Co, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; While most scholars today reject Beard's overall thesis, he initiated a new method of economic and political thought that would evolve into contemporary constitutional economics analysis.&lt;ref name=voigt97&gt;Voigt, Stephan (1997). ''Positive Constitutional Economics: A Survey'', Public Choice, 90(1/4): 11–53).&lt;/ref&gt; Beard's main thesis was that the [[U.S. Constitution]] "was essentially an economic document based upon the concept that the fundamental private rights of property are anterior to government and morally beyond the reach of popular majorities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beard|first1=Charles|title=An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States|date=1935 [1913]|publisher=MacMillan|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1987 for the [[Yale Law School]], Jonathan Macey synthesizes the history of constitutional economic analysis applied to the US Constitution. Macey offers a different analysis of the US Constitution and responds critically to Beard's view of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Macey, Jonathan R. (1987). "Competing Economic Views of the Constitution," Faculty Scholarship Series, 56(50): 50–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Macey understood Beard a famous and crucial part of the Constitution, [[separation of powers]], was actually a means of allowing hegemony of resources in the hands of the rich few. Macey could not disagree more; he argues that the Constitution and separation of powers were created to hinder aggregate political and economic power. He points to [[Federalist No. 10]], [[James Madison]]'s famous description of the necessity of factions due to the truths of human nature.

=== Separation of powers ===

Macey says this conception of human nature is essentially economic. If government is not separated into distinct powers, the possibility of extensive [[rent-seeking]] threatens the efficiency of the government. Self-interested groups or individuals will lobby to political powers for their goals, possibly leading to injustice or inefficiency. In Macey's interpretation of Madison, the [[separation of powers]] channels lobbyists into the competitive, more efficient market by raising transaction costs so much that private market means are less expensive than appealing to the various separate powers of government.

Macey demonstrates how constitutional economics can be applied to constitutions. Rather than looking at the political or philosophic intentions of the founders, the constitutional economist looks at a constitution through economic eyes, considering the incentives, choices, allocations, and other economics factors within the political rules of a constitution. Traditionally, the creation of factions has been interpreted as a brilliant political move to separate power and prevent hegemony of the state. Macey agrees but adds a caveat. He maintains a real economic incentive to factions existed which compelled the Founders to separate government.

Factions and separated powers raise transaction costs of mobilizing political support beyond what interest groups can pay if they rely on private, non-governmental means. Macey even graphs the quantity of legislation on a standard supply-demand curve, where the demand is the interest groups’ desire for laws and the supply is the legislation’s provision. Separation of powers shifts the supply curve left, raising the price and decreasing the quantity of legislation. Macey admits that though the US Constitution is imperfect, he does vindicate it from the purely material accusations of Beard. He examines a political system of constraints using standard economic methods.

==Legal approach==
Judge [[Richard Posner]] emphasized the importance of a constitution for
[[economic development]]. He examines the interrelationship between a constitution and the economic growth. Posner approaches constitutional analysis mainly from the perspective of judges, who constitute a critical force for interpretation and implementation of a constitution, thus—''[[de facto]]'' in [[common law]] countries—creating the body of constitutional law. He emphasizes the importance of constitutional provisions "in setting broader outer bounds to the exercise of judicial discretion". Thus, a judge, when trying a case, is guided firstly by the spirit and letter of the constitution. The role of economics in this process is to help "identify the consequences of alternative interpretations" of the constitution.

He then explains that "economics may provide insight into questions that bear on the proper legal interpretation". In the end, as Posner emphasizes, "the limits of an economic approach to deciding constitutional cases [are] set by the Constitution". In addition, he argues that "effective protection of basic [[economic rights]] promotes economic growth".&lt;ref&gt;Posner R., 1987. "The Constitution as an Economic Document," ''George Washington Law Review'',  56(1), p [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/gwlr56&amp;div=9&amp;id=&amp;page= p. 4]–38. Reprinted in J. W. Ely, ed., 1997, ''Main Themes in the Debate over Property Rights'', pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OdVyiw1ANycC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 186–220.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrently with the rise of academic research in the field of constitutional economics in the US in the 1980s, the [[Supreme Court of India]] for almost a decade had been encouraging [[public interest litigation]] on behalf of the poor and oppressed by using a very broad interpretation of several articles of the [[Indian Constitution]]. The former Chief Justice of Indonesian Constitutional Court, Jimly Asshiddiqie, also published his book "Konstitusi Ekonomi" (2010) in promoting the idea of Economic Constitution. This is a vivid example of a ''de facto'' practical application of the methodology of constitutional economics.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Cooper, ''Poverty and Constitutional Justice'', in ''Philosophy of Law: Classic and Contemporary Readings'', edited by Larry May and Jeff Brown, Wiley-Blackwell, UK, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of the [[Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation]], [[Valery Zorkin]], made a special reference to the educational role of constitutional economics: "In Russia, the addition of such new academic disciplines as constitutional economics to the curricula of university law and economics departments becomes critically important."&lt;ref&gt;Valery Zorkin, ''Twelve Theses on Legal Reform in Russia'' in ''The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform'', edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian school==
The Russian school of constitutional economics was created in the early twenty-first century with the idea that constitutional economics allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis in the legislative (especially budgetary) process, thus helping to overcome arbitrariness in the economic and financial decision-making.  For instance, when military expenses (and the like) dwarf the budget spending on education and culture. Constitutional economics studies such issues as the proper national wealth distribution. This also includes the government spending on the [[judiciary]], which in many transitional and [[developing countries]] is completely controlled by the [[executive (government)|executive]].

The latter undermines the principle of [[checks and balances]], instrumental in the [[separation of powers]], as this creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. It is important to distinguish between the two methods of [[political corruption|corruption]] of the judiciary: the state corruption (through budget planning and various privileges being the most dangerous), and the private corruption. The former makes it almost impossible for any business to facilitate the optimal growth and development of national market economy. In the English language, the word "constitution" possesses a whole number of meanings, encompassing not only national constitutions as such but also charters of corporations, unwritten rules of various clubs, informal groups, etc.

The Russian model of constitutional economics, originally intended for transitional and developing countries, focuses entirely on the concept of constitution of a state. This model of the constitutional economics is based on the understanding that it is necessary to narrow the gap between practical enforcement of the [[economic, social and cultural rights|economic, social]], and political rights granted by the constitution and the annual (or midterm) economic policy, budget legislation and administrative policies conducted by the government. In 2006, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] officially recognized constitutional economics as a separate academic sub-discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova."[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform]", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since in many countries with transitional political and economic systems, their constitutions are often treated by the ruling elite as abstract legal documents totally disconnected from the economic policy of the state, the practice of constitutional economics becomes there a decisive prerequisite for the democratic development of both the state and society.

==Criticism==
Not all scholars embrace constitutional economics. [[Walter Block]] and [[Thomas DiLorenzo]] make a strong criticism of constitutional economics as even a possible science. They maintain that politics cannot be equated with the market and, therefore, as a study, it cannot exist.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Walter and Thomas J. DiLorenzo (2000). "Is Voluntary Government Possible? A Critique of Constitution Economics," ''Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics'' 156(4): 567–82.&lt;/ref&gt; They maintain that unlike the market, consent is not the foundation of politics, and that politics is driven by violent, historically bellicose, coercion. Therefore, they believe that the CE method only clouds the discussion of public choice and political economy. Buchanan, Voigt, Macey, and even Beard all at least implicitly assume that politics is the exchange of political "goods", a strong social contract view.

But for Block and DiLorenzo, politics is one powerful group coercing free rides from a weaker group. From the [[Roman Empire]] to the present, they trace how the state always comes from conquest and exploitation, never consent. ''[[The Calculus of Consent]]'', a foundational text for constitutional economics, bears much of their attack. If they are correct that no state has been or can be voluntary and that voluntary government is inherently contradictory, constitutional economics as a discipline cannot exist.

William Campbell explains the weakness of constitutional economics in its assumption that the goal of a regime must be efficiency, individual liberty, and libertarian rights, not morality or super-individual good.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, William (1988). “Constitutional Economics: Ancients vs. Moderns,” The Heritage Foundation, Speech given July 27, 1988. Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constitutional theory''' is an area of '''[[constitutional law]]''' that focuses on the underpinnings of constitutional government. It overlaps with [[legal theory]], [[constitutionalism]], [[philosophy of law]] and democratic theory. It is not limited by country or jurisdiction.

== United States ==

Constitutional theory in the [[United States]] is an academic discipline that focuses on the meaning of the United States [[Constitution]].  Its concerns include (but are not limited to) the historical, linguistic, sociological, ethical, and political aspects.

Much of constitutional theory is concerned with theories of [[judicial review]]. This is in part because ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', which established this judicial power in the early 19th century, has given the judiciary near-final authority on constitutional meaning.

Aside from judicial review, constitutional theory in general seeks to ask and answer the following questions:

*How should the Constitution be interpreted?
*How much weight should be given to the history of the Constitution's framing?
*How much, if any, of the Constitution's meaning can be read as implicit in the text?
*What vision of republican&lt;ref&gt;http://www.constitution.org/cons/constitu.htm#con4.4&lt;/ref&gt; government does the Constitution seek to further?
*How does constitutional meaning shift with other changes in the political structure?
*How does constitutional meaning shift with changes in cultural norms?
*What is the proper relationship between individual rights and state power?
*What is the proper relationship between the branches of government
**This question involves the power of judicial review, noted above
*What is the proper relationship between the federal government and the states?

Although constitutional theory as a discipline has its precursors in ''[[The Federalist]]'' and [[Justice Story]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Constitution]]'', modern constitutional theory began with the publication of [[Alexander Bickel]]'s ''[[The Least Dangerous Branch]]''. (The title is an allusion to ''The Federalist'' No. 78, in which [[Alexander Hamilton]] wrote that the judiciary "will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution", because it has neither the sword (like the Executive) nor the purse (like the Legislature).  The book's primary (but not sole) contribution was to introduce the idea of the "[[countermajoritarian difficulty]]."  The idea expressed by the term countermajoritarian difficulty is that there is a tension between democratic government (as he defines it democratic government is majoritarian government) and judicial power.  If the judiciary—an unelected branch of government—can overturn popular legislation, then either there is a fundamental contradiction within the democratic system, or there is a tension that must be resolved by curbing judicial power.  (One of Bickel's solutions is for the Court to exercise "the [[passive virtues]]": that is, to decline to decide more than it has to decide.)

== German Rechtsstaat==
The Rechtsstaat doctrine (Legal state, State of Right, Constitutional state, constitutional government) was introduced in the latest works of the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) after US and French constitutions were adopted in the late 18th century.  Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of a country’s written [[constitution]]. This supremacy must create guarantees for implementation of his central idea:  a permanent peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness of its people and their prosperity.  Kant was basing his doctrine on none other but [[constitutionalism]] and [[constitutional government]].

Kant had thus formulated the main problem of constitutionalism, “The constitution of a [[State (polity)|state]] is eventually based on the morals of its citizens, which, in its turns, is based on the goodness of this constitution.”  Kant’s idea is the foundation for the constitutional theory of the twenty-first century. The Legal state concept is based on the ideas, discovered by Immanuel Kant, for example, in his Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals:
“The task of establishing a universal and permanent peaceful life is not only a part of theory of law within the framework of pure reason, but per se an absolute and ultimate goal. To achieve this goal, a state must become the community of a large number of people, living provided with legislative guarantees of their property rights secured by a common constitution. The supremacy of this constitution… must be derived a priori from the considerations for achievement of the absolute ideal in the most just and fair organization of people’s life under the aegis of public law.”.&lt;ref&gt;"Immanuel Kant", ''History of [[Political Philosophy]]'', edited by Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian legal state ==
The Russian legal system, borne out of transformations in the 19th Century under the [[judicial reform of Alexander II]], is based primarily upon the German legal tradition. It was from here that Russia borrowed a doctrine of Rechtsstaat, which literally translates as Legal State. The English most close analogue is «rule of law».&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Rechtsstaat  is a concept in continental European legal thinking, originally borrowed from German legal philosophy, which can be translated as “legal state” or "state of law", or "state of rights", "constitutional state" in which the exercise of governmental power is constrained by the law.  The Russian Legal state concept adopts the written constitution as a supreme law of the country (the rule of constitution).&lt;ref&gt;The former President of the [[International Bar Association]] Francis Neate wrote about links between Russian concept of the Legal state and British approach: “The [[Rule of Law]] is an English concept.  I am told that the equivalent in Russia, and possibly in other countries, is better translated as ‘Legal State’, or ‘a state governed by law’.  If the latter phrase is acceptable then surely we are talking about the same thing... The best way to determine whether or not we are talking about the same concept is to look at the essential characteristics of the Rule of Law and to determine whether or not they are similar to the essential characteristics of the ‘Legal State’.  This is what I propose to do.”, "The Rule of Law: Perspectives from Around the Globe", Editor: Francis Neate, London, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of “legal state” (“pravovoe gosudarstvo” in Russian) is a fundamental, but undefined, principle that appears in the very first dispositive provision of Russia’s [[Constitution of Russia|post-Communist constitution]]:  “The Russian Federation – Russia – constitutes a democratic federative legal state with a republican form of governance.”  Similarly, the very first dispositive provision of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] declares: “Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, legal state.”  The effort to give meaning to definition “Legal State” is anything but theoretical.

[[Valery Zorkin]], President of the [[Constitutional Court of Russia]], wrote in 2003:
“Becoming a legal state  has long been our ultimate goal, and we have certainly made serious progress in this direction over the past several years. 
However, no one can say now that we have reached this destination.  Such a Legal state simply cannot exist without a lawful and
just society.  Here, as in no other sphere of our life, the state reflects the level of maturity reached by society.".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform]", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian concept of legal state adopted many segments of the [[constitutional economics]]. One of the founders of constitutional economics [[James M. Buchanan]], the 1986 recipient of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] argues that in the framework of constitutional government any governmental interventions and regulations have been based on three assumptions.
* First, every failure of the [[market economy]] to function smoothly and perfectly can be corrected by governmental intervention.
* Second, those holding political office and manning the bureaucracies are altruistic upholders of the public interest, unconcerned with their own personal economic well-being.
* And, third, changing the responsibilities of [[government]] towards more intervention and control will not profoundly and perversely affect the social and economic life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27345">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Daubert'' standard}}
In United States federal law, the '''''Daubert'' standard''' is a [[rule of evidence]] regarding the admissibility of [[expert witness]]es' [[testimony]]. A party may raise a '''''Daubert'' motion''', a special [[motion in limine|motion ''in limine'']] raised before or during [[trial (law)|trial]], to exclude the presentation of unqualified [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to the [[jury]]. The '''''Daubert'' trilogy''' are the three [[United States Supreme Court]] cases that articulated the Daubert standard:

*''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]]'', which held in 1993 that Rule 702 of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] did not incorporate the [[Frye test|Frye "general acceptance" test]] as a basis for assessing the admissibility of scientific expert testimony, but that the rule incorporated a flexible reliability standard instead;
*''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'',&lt;ref&gt;522 U.S. 136 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; which held in 1997 that a district court judge may exclude expert testimony when there are gaps between the evidence relied on by an expert and that person's conclusion, and that an abuse-of-discretion standard of review is the proper standard for appellate courts to use in reviewing a trial court's decision of whether it should admit expert testimony;
*''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'',&lt;ref&gt;526 U.S. 137 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; which held in 1999 that the judge's gatekeeping function identified in ''Daubert'' applies to all expert testimony, including that which is non-scientific.

Important appellate-level opinions that clarify the standard include Judge [[Alex Kozinski|Kozinski]]'s opinion in Daubert on remand ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-102.ZO.html ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'', 43 F.3d 1311 (9th Cir. 1995)]), and Judge [[Edward Roy Becker|Becker]]'s opinion in ''[[In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig.]]'', 35 F.3d 717 (3d Cir. 1994).

==Definition==
In ''Daubert'', seven members of the Court agreed on the following guidelines for admitting scientific expert testimony:
*'''Judge is gatekeeper:''' Under Rule 702, the task of "gatekeeping", or assuring that scientific expert testimony truly proceeds from "scientific knowledge", rests on the trial judge.
*'''Relevance and reliability:'''  This requires the trial judge to ensure that the expert's testimony is "relevant to the task at hand" and that it rests "on a reliable foundation". ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc.'', 509 U.S. 579, 584-587. Concerns about expert testimony cannot be simply referred to the jury as a question of weight. Furthermore, the admissibility of expert testimony is governed by Rule 104(a), not Rule 104(b); thus, the Judge must find it more likely than not that the expert's methods are reliable and reliably applied to the facts at hand.
*'''Scientific knowledge = scientific method/methodology:'''  A conclusion will qualify as ''scientific knowledge'' if the proponent can demonstrate that it is the product of sound "scientific methodology" derived from the '''[[scientific method]].'''&lt;ref&gt;Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'' (1993) 509 U.S. 579, 589.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Illustrative Factors:'''  The Court defined "scientific methodology" as the process of formulating hypotheses and then conducting experiments to prove or falsify the hypothesis, and provided a set of illustrative factors (i.e., not a "test") in determining whether these criteria are met:
:# Whether the theory or technique employed by the expert is generally accepted in the scientific community;
:# Whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication;
:# Whether it can be and has been tested;
:# Whether the known or potential rate of error is acceptable; and 
:# Whether the research was conducted independent of the particular litigation or dependent on an intention to provide the proposed testimony.&lt;ref&gt;''Daubert v. Merrel Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'' 43 F.3d 1311 (9th Cir. 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Rule 702 was amended in an attempt to codify and structure elements embodied in the "''Daubert'' trilogy."  The rule then read as follows:  
:'''Rule 702. Testimony by Experts'''  
: If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
(As amended Apr. 17, 2000, eff. Dec. 1, 2000.)

In 2011, Rule 702 was again amended to make the language clearer. The rule now reads:
: RULE 702. TESTIMONY BY EXPERT WITNESSES
: A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:
: (a)	The expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;
: (b)	The testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;
: (c)	The testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and
: (d)	The expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.
(As amended Apr. 17, 2000, eff. Dec. 1, 2000; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011)

While some federal courts still rely on pre-2000 opinions in determining the scope of ''Daubert'', as a technical legal matter any earlier judicial rulings that conflict with the language of amended Rule 702 are no longer good precedent.

==Use==
Although the Daubert standard is now the law in federal court and over half of the states, the [[Frye standard|''Frye'' standard]] remains the law in some jurisdictions including California, Illinois, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Giannelli &amp; [[Edward Imwinkelried|E. Imwinkelried]], Scientific Evidence §§ 1.06, 1.16 (4th ed. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Florida passed a bill to adopt the Daubert standard as the law governing expert witness testimony, which took effect on July 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2013/06_-_June/Florida_adopts_new_standard_for_expert_evidence/ Reuters]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Florida Supreme Court rejected the Legislature's "Daubert Amendment" to the extent it is procedural in nature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2017/sc16-181.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Although trial judges have always had the authority to exclude inappropriate testimony, prior to ''Daubert'', trial courts often preferred to let juries hear evidence proffered by both sides.&lt;ref name=Berger&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once certain evidence has been excluded by a ''Daubert'' motion because it fails to meet the relevancy and reliability standard, it will likely be challenged when introduced again in another trial. Even though a ''Daubert'' motion is not binding to other courts of law, if something was found untrustworthy by one court, other judges may choose to follow that precedent. Of course, a decision by an appellate court that a piece of evidence is inadmissible under ''Daubert'' would be binding on district courts within that court's jurisdiction.

===Daubert motion: timing===
To attack expert testimony as inadmissible, counsel may bring pretrial motions, including motions [[Motion in limine|in limine]].&lt;ref&gt;The third circuit has emphasized the importance of conducting in limine hearings under Fed. R. Evid. 104 (resolution of preliminary questions) when making reliability determinations required by Fed. R. Evid. 702 and ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'', 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993). ''See''  ''Padillas v. Stork-Gamco, Inc.'', 186 F.3d 412, 417 (3d Cir. 1999) ;  ''Voilas v. General Motors Corp.'', 73 F. Supp. 2d 452, 455 (D.N.J. 1999) (not holding hearing in this case, however). See also 1 Weinstein's Federal Evidence, Ch. 104, Preliminary Questions  (Matthew Bender 2d ed.); Edward J. Imwinkelried &amp; David A. Schlueter, Federal Evidence Tactics, Ch. 1, Article I: General Provisions, § 1.04 (Matthew Bender).&lt;/ref&gt;  The motion in limine may be brought prior to trial, although counsel may bring the motion during trial as well.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Smoot v. Mazda Motors of America, Inc., 469 F.3d 675, 676 (7th Cir. 2006) (case dismissed after plaintiff expert's testimony excluded); Curtis v. M&amp;S Petroleum, Inc., 174 F.3d 661, 667 (5th Cir. 1999) ; United States v. Nichols, 169 F.3d 1255, 1265-1266 (10th Cir. 1999 ); Heller v. Shaw Indus., Inc., 167 F.3d 146, 155, 157-158 (3d Cir. 1999) ; Ruiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola of Puerto Rico, 161 F.3d 77, 90 (1st Cir. 1998) ; Jack v. Glaxo Wellcome Inc., 239 F. Supp. 2d 1308, 1319 (D. Ga. 2002) (rejecting objection of untimeliness of motion in limine to exclude expert testimony on ground that motion in limine is not dispositive); United States v. Lester, 234 F. Supp. 2d 595, 597-598 (E.D. Va. 2002) (criminal defendant's motion to allow expert testimony regarding reliability of eyewitness testimony denied); Lentz v. Mason, 32 F. Supp. 2d 733, 737 (D.N.J. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

A motion attacking expert testimony should be brought within a reasonable time after the close of [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] if the grounds for the objection can be reasonably anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Pineda v. Ford Motor Co., 520 F.3d 237, 241-242 (3d Cir. 2008) (after deposition of plaintiff's expert, defendant filed alternative motions to exclude testimony of plaintiff's expert and for summary judgment, and motion for Daubert hearing).&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing should be made well in advance of the first time a case appears on a trial calendar.

In one case where a Daubert hearing was conducted on the day of the trial, in which the district court excluded all plaintiff's expert testimony, resulting in the dismissal of all claims, the appellate court remanded the case because of multiple irregularities and a defective record of lower court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Webster v. Fulton County, Ga., 85 F. Supp. 2d 1375, 1377 (N.D. Ga. 2000) (denying defendant's Daubert motion as untimely, when brought after court had relied on plaintiff expert's report in denying defense summary judgment motion, and within days of trial date). See also Alfred v. Caterpillar, Inc., 262 F.3d 1083, 1087 (10th Cir. 2001 ) (counsel should not ''sandbag'' Daubert concerns until close of opponent's case''; however, appellate court did not reach issue of late filing of motion because district court chose to address defendant's Daubert objections on merits, rather than deeming them waived); Pullman v. Land O'Lakes, Inc., 262 F.3d 759, 763 (8th Cir. 2001) (appellate court noted with disapproval that defendant failed to bring Daubert motion ''until shortly before the trial began''; Daubert inapplicable to experimental test evidence not presented by expert witnesses).&lt;/ref&gt;

The appellate court noted that in cases that rely heavily on expert testimony, a district court should set a discovery&lt;ref&gt;See Smith v. Ford Motor Co., 215 F.3d 713, 722 (7th Cir. 2000) . See also Goebel v. Denver and Rio Grande W. R.R., 215 F.3d 1083, 1087 (10th Cir. 2000) (district court orally denied motion to exclude expert testimony on morning of trial); McPike v. Corghi S.p.A., 87 F. Supp. 2d 890, 891 n.1 (E.D. Ark. 1999) (court telephoned attorneys with ruling denying defendant's motion to exclude plaintiff's expert testimony, because closeness of trial did not allow time for formal written memo and order at that time; court later rendered substituted memorandum and order, fully stating reasons for its decision in writing).&lt;/ref&gt; and trial schedule that realistically provides both sides with an adequate opportunity to introduce necessary evidence. The application of Federal Rule of Evidence 702 to proposed expert testimony can often be an uncertain process, and is best conducted in such a manner that litigants have a reasonable opportunity to locate experts who meet the rule's requirements.

In another case in which the defendant was apparently at fault for filing a motion to exclude expert testimony one week before the trial date, the district court denied the motion on that ground, but it advised the defendant that it might conduct its own ''[[voir dire]]'' of the expert in question before he testified. The district court preliminarily found that defendant's motion was predicated on a ruling made almost three months earlier by a district court in another state, and that defendant had shown no good cause for waiting to file the motion. The defendant ultimately lost that case, following the admission of the disputed expert testimony, and ultimately failed in its appeal.&lt;ref&gt;See Clay v. Ford Motor Co., 215 F.3d 663, 674 (6th Cir. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

An evidentiary hearing on the motion may not be necessary if the court finds that it would not assist the court in ruling on any of the matters in the motion.

==History==
Prior to ''Daubert'', relevancy in combination with the [[Frye test|''Frye'' test]] were the dominant standards for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence in Federal courts. ''Frye'' is based on a 1923 Federal Court of appeals ruling involving the admissibility of [[polygraph]] evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (DC Cir. 1923)&lt;/ref&gt;  Under ''Frye'', the Court based the admissibility of testimony regarding novel scientific evidence on whether it has "gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs." The trial court's gatekeeper role in this respect is typically described as conservative, thus helping to keep [[pseudoscience]] out of the courtroom by deferring to those in the field.

In ''Daubert'', the Supreme Court ruled that the 1923 Frye test was superseded by the 1975 [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], specifically Rule 702 governing expert testimony. Rule 702 originally stated (in its entirety),
&lt;blockquote&gt;If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Daubert'', the Court ruled that nothing in the Federal Rules of Evidence governing expert evidence "gives any indication that 'general acceptance' is a necessary precondition to the admissibility of scientific evidence. Moreover, such a rigid standard would be at odds with the Rules' liberal thrust and their general approach of relaxing the traditional barriers to 'opinion' testimony."

By requiring experts to provide relevant opinions grounded in reliable methodology, proponents of ''Daubert'' were satisfied that these standards would result in a fair and rational resolution of the scientific and technological issues which lie at the heart of product liability adjudication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Owen |first=D. G. |title=A Decade of ''Daubert'' |year=2002 |volume=80 |journal=Denver University Law Review |pages=345 |issn=0883-9409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daubert has not appeared to further the Federal Rules philosophy of admitting generally all relevant testimony, and specifically of relaxing the traditional barriers to 'opinion' testimony."  The ''Daubert'' decision has instead been heralded by some political commentators as one of the most important Supreme Court decisions in imposing higher barriers for [[toxic tort]] and [[product liability]] cases, by allegedly reducing the volume of so-called [[junk science]] in the court room.

According to a 2002 [[RAND]] study, post Daubert, the percentage of expert testimony by scientists that was excluded from the courtroom significantly rose. This rise likely contributed to a doubling in successful motions for summary judgment in which 90% were against plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, L, Gill B. Changes in the Standards for Admitting Expert Evidence in Federal Civil Cases Since the ''Daubert'' Decision. RAND Institute for Civil Justice. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond this study, there is little empirical evidence of the impact of ''Daubert''.
However, some critics argue that ''Daubert'' has disrupted the balance between plaintiffs and defendants, “The exclusion of expert testimony affects plaintiffs far more than defendants because plaintiffs may then not be able to meet their required [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]]. Furthermore, there is little point in plaintiffs going to the expense of Daubert motions to exclude defendant’s experts until they know if their case will proceed. So if more experts are now being excluded, then ''Daubert'' has undoubtedly shifted the balance between plaintiffs and defendants and made it more difficult for plaintiffs to litigate successfully.”&lt;ref name=Berger/&gt;  Similarly, ''Daubert'' hearings can be subject to various abuses by attorneys attempting to bolster a weak case. These tactics can range from simply attempting to delay the case to driving up the costs of the litigation forcing settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gutheil |first=Thomas G. |author2=Bursztajn, Harold J. |date=1 June 2005|title=Attorney Abuses of ''Daubert'' Hearings: Junk Science, Junk Law, or Just Plain Obstruction? |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law |volume=33 |issue= 2|pages=150–152 |pmid=15985655 |url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/full/33/2/150 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different pattern has emerged in criminal cases. In criminal cases, the prosecution has the burden of proof and uses a host of forensic science methods as evidence to prove their case. But, ''Daubert'' motions are rarely made by criminal defendants and when they do, they lose a majority of the challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Risinger |first=D. Michael |year=2000 |title=Navigating Expert Reliability: Are Criminal Standards of Certainty Being Left on the Dock? |journal=Albany Law Review |volume=64 |issue= |pages=99 |issn=0002-4678 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neufeld |first=P. |year=2005 |title=The (Near) Irrelevance of ''Daubert'' to Criminal Justice and Some Suggestions for Reform |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=S1 |pages=S107–S113 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.056333 |url=|pmid=16030325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of the use of unreliable science in court argue that ''Daubert'' has had beneficial effects in civil litigation, but fails to address the underlying pathologies of the forensic science system that leads to dubious verdicts in criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bernstein |first=David E. |year=2007 |title=Expert Witnesses, Adversarial Bias, and the (Partial) Failure of the ''Daubert'' Revolution |journal=Iowa Law Review |volume= |issue= |pages=  |ssrn=963461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators believe that ''Daubert'' caused judges to become—in the phrase used in former Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]]’s dissent in ''Daubert''—amateur scientists, many lacking the [[scientific literacy]] to effectively fulfill their role as gatekeeper of scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gatowski |first=S. I. |year=2001 |title=Asking the gatekeepers: A National Survey of Judges on Judging Expert Evidence in a Post-''Daubert'' world |journal=[[Law and Human Behavior]] |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=433–458 |doi=10.1023/A:1012899030937 |url= |display-authors=1 |last2=Dobbin |first2=Shirley A. |last3=Richardson |first3=James T. |last4=Ginsburg |first4=Gerald P. |last5=Merlino |first5=Mara L. |last6=Dahir |first6=Veronica}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although "science for judges" forums have emerged in the wake of ''Daubert'' in order to educate judges in a variety of scientific fields, many are still skeptical about the usefulness of the ''Daubert'' standard in discerning valid science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rothman |first=K. J. |author2=Greenland, S. |authorlink2=Sander Greenland  |year=2005 |title=Causation and Causal Inference in Epidemiology |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=S1 |pages=S144–S150 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.059204 |url=|pmid=16030331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Melnick |first=R. |year=2005 |title=A ''Daubert'' Motion: A Legal Strategy to Exclude Essential Scientific Evidence in Toxic Tort Litigation |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=S1 |pages=S30–S34 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.046250 |url=|pmid=16030335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jasanoff |first=S. |year=2005 |title=Law's Knowledge: Science for Justice in Legal Settings |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=S1 |pages=S49–S58 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.045732 |url=|pmid=16030338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibility to assess scientific relevance has shifted from highly trained expert witnesses to judges deficient in science education. The "Daubert" ruling furthermore admits the possible introduction of non-peer reviewed data and conclusions. This increasingly shifts the burden of scientific judgement onto judges who have not had an education which would enable them to properly evaluate such data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16371283 | volume=1 | issue=3 | title=The admissibility of scientific evidence in psychiatric malpractice: junk science and the Daubert case |date=December 1994 | journal=J Clin Forensic Med |author=Tancredi, Laurence R |author2=Giannini, A. James |last-author-amp=yes| pages=145–8 | doi=10.1016/1353-1131(94)90082-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pursuant to Rule 104(a), in ''Daubert'' the U.S. Supreme Court suggested that the following factors be considered:&lt;ref&gt;See (c) of the [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-102.ZS.html syllabus] of the ''Daubert'' case.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Has the technique been tested in actual field conditions (and not just in a laboratory)?
# Has the technique been subject to peer review and publication?
# What is the known or potential rate of error?
# Do standards exist for the control of the technique's operation?
# Has the technique been generally accepted within the relevant scientific community?

The Supreme Court explicitly cautioned that the Daubert list should not be regarded by judges as "a definitive checklist or test..." Yet in practice, judges have judged the admissibility of scientific evidence using the "Daubert factors" as a checklist; for example, the trial court judge in ''Kumho'' admitted to erroneously treating the factors as mandatory.&lt;ref name=Berger/&gt;

==International influence==
The [[Canadian Supreme Court]] has expressly adopted the Daubert standard in two cases.  [[R. v. Mohan]],;&lt;ref&gt;[1994] 2 S.C.R. 9&lt;/ref&gt; R. v. J.L.-J., [2000].&lt;ref&gt;2 S.C.R. 600&lt;/ref&gt; In J.L.-J., the Court took a look at the development of U.S. law in this regard, noted the U.S. Supreme Court's rejection of the Frye standard and its replacement with the Daubert Standard.  While the Court did note that:  " Daubert must be read in light of the specific text of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which differs from our own procedures," the Court also stated in the same sentence that "the U.S. Supreme Court did list a number of factors that could be helpful in evaluating the soundness of novel science."&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court then applied the Daubert standard to a decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal.  The Quebec Court had held that greater liberality should be applied by the Court in receiving pro-defense scientific evidence in a criminal case.&lt;ref&gt;[1998] R.J.Q.
2229, 130 C.C.C. (3d) 541, [1998] Q.J. No. 2493 (QL).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court rejected this decision and reinstated the defendant's conviction.

Additionally, in 2005, the [[United Kingdom House of Commons]] [[Science and Technology Committee]] recommended the creation of a Forensic Science Advisory Council to regulate forensic evidence in the [[UK]] and observed that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The absence of an agreed protocol for the validation of scientific techniques prior to their being admitted in court is entirely unsatisfactory. Judges are not well-placed to determine scientific validity without input from scientists. We recommend that one of the first tasks of the Forensic Science Advisory Council be to develop a "gate-keeping" test for expert evidence. This should be done in partnership with judges, scientists and other key players in the criminal justice system, and should build on the US ''Daubert'' test.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Science and Technology Committee (2005) ''[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmsctech/96/96i.pdf Forensic Science on Trial]'', London: The Stationery Office Limited, HC96-I, para.173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Law Commission for England and Wales has proposed a consultation paper (No.190) to adopt a criterion like the Daubert Standard to help reform the law of evidence in regards to the admissibility of scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/docs/cp190.pdf The Admissiblity of Expert Evidence in Criminal Proceedings in England and Wales] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally these decemvirs were a jury of ten men, serving under the presidency of a magistrate, but later this court became the [[magistratus minores]], or lower judiciary of the [[Roman Republic]], and was included among the [[vigintisexviri]], or twenty-six magistrates elected by the ''[[Tribal Assembly|comitia tributa]]''.  According to [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]], [[Augustus]] assigned the presidency of the court of the [[centumviri]] to the decemviri stlitibus judicandis.

'''Dividing territories''' (also '''market division''') is an agreement by two companies to stay out of each other's way and reduce competition in the agreed-upon territories. The process known as geographic market allocation is one of several [[anti-competitive practices]] outlawed under [[United States antitrust law]]s. The term is generally understood to include dividing customers as well.

For example, in 1984, [[FMC Corp.]] and Asahi Chemical agreed to divide territories for the sale of [[microcrystalline cellulose]], and later FMC attempted to eliminate all vestiges of competition by inviting smaller rivals also to collude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2000/12/fmc.htm|title=FTC Order Settles Charges that FMC Corp. and Japan's Asahi Chemical Co.

'''Emphyteusis''' is a right, susceptible of assignment and of descent, charged on productive [[real estate]], the right being coupled with the enjoyment of the property on condition of taking care of the estate and paying [[tax]]es and sometimes a small [[renting|rent]].

It started in the early [[Roman Empire]] and was initially granted by the state for the purposes of [[agriculture]] or building on land. In essence it was a long-term lease of an imperial domain of private land for a rental in kind. The title existing before emphyteusis was ''ius in agro vectigali''. The emphyteusis gave the lease-holder (emphyteuta) rights similar to those of a proprietor, although the real owner remained the person to whom the rent (''canon'' or ''pensio'') was paid. Nevertheless,  the tenant gained most of the rights of the owner. Accordingly, he could maintain ''actio vectigalis in rem'' against any one to recover possession of the land thus leased to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Institutes of Roman Law by Gaius|last=Poste|first=Edward|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1904|isbn=|location=|pages=430}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under certain circumstances, the land returned to the owner (as in the case of the death of the emphyteuta without an heir, non-payment of the rent or taxes for three years (or 2 years in case of land held of the [[Church and state in medieval Europe|Church]]), lapse of time if a term was fixed in the original agreement, ''contractus emphyteuseos'', which was a specific contract and neither an ordinary lease nor a sale. The rights of the emphyteuta embraced the full use of the land and its products; they were alienable and transferable by testament or ''ab intestato''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law|last=Berger|first=Adolf|publisher=French University|year=1953|isbn=|location=|pages=452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Anglo-Saxon law]], an '''exclusive right''', or '''exclusivity''', is a de facto, non-tangible [[prerogative]] existing in law (that is, the [[power (sociology)|power]] or, in a wider sense, [[right]]) to perform an action or acquire a benefit and to permit or deny others the right to perform the same action or to acquire the same benefit. A "prerogative" is in effect an exclusive right. The term is restricted for use for official state or sovereign (i.e., constitutional) powers. Exclusive rights are a form of [[monopoly]].

Exclusive rights can be established by law or by contractual obligation, but the scope of enforceability will depend upon the extent to which others are bound by the instrument establishing the exclusive right; thus in the case of contractual rights, only persons that are parties to a contract will be affected by the exclusivity.

Exclusive rights may be granted in [[property law]], [[copyright law]], [[patent law]],  in relation to [[public utility|public utilities]], or, in some jurisdictions, in other ''[[sui generis]]'' legislation. Many scholars argue that such rights form the basis for the concepts of [[property (ownership right)|property]] and [[ownership]].

Privately granted rights, created by [[contract]], may occasionally appear very similar to exclusive rights, but are only enforceable against the grantee, and not the world at large.

==Types of exclusive rights==

===Property===

In relation to [[property]], an exclusive right will, for the most part, arise when something tangible is acquired; as a result, others are prevented from exercising control of that thing. For example, a person may prohibit others from entering and using their [[real property|land]], or from taking their [[personal property|personal possessions]]. However, an exclusive right is not necessarily absolute, as an [[easement]] may allow a certain level of public access to [[private land]].

===Intellectual property===

Most [[government]]s recognize a [[Bundle of Rights|bundle of exclusive rights]] in relation to works of authorship, inventions, and identifications of origin. These rights are sometimes spoken of under the [[umbrella term]] "[[intellectual property]]."

==History and arguments==

In Anglo-Saxon property law, exclusive rights have often been the codification of pre-existing [[Norm (sociology)|social norm]]s with regard to land or [[Personal property|chattel]]s.

In [[continental Europe]] there is a view that copyrights, patents, and the like are the codification of some kind of [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]], [[natural right]], or [[personamility rights|personalitlly right]]. However, such arguments can only be consistently justified through [[instrumentalism]] or [[consequentialism]], as exemplified by the reasoning inferred in [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] that copyrights and patents exist solely "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts."

The '''Feindstrafrecht''' (German for '''"Criminal Law of the Enemy"''') is a [[criminal law]] and [[civil rights]] concept outlined in 1985 by the German criminal law professor and legal philosopher [[Günther Jakobs]]. The Feindstrafrecht says that certain people, as enemies of the society (or the state), do not deserve the protections of the civil or penal law. The Feindstrafrecht allows every available means to pursue and punish those enemies.

It is worth pointing out that the Feindstrafrecht is not a law. Most notably, it means the suspension of certain laws in order to protect the society or the state from certain dangers. Jakobs writings propose the term "Criminal Law of the Citizen" ("Bürgerstrafrecht") as the counterpart of the "Criminal Law of the Enemy". The concept of the Feindstrafrecht is opposed by most scholars of penal law and legal philosophy alike. Günther Jakobs points out that he was merely describing the existing Feindstrafrecht, while critics say that he took an affirmative position in his 2004 publication.

In the latter publication, Jakobs proposes that anybody who does not respect the laws and the legal order of a state - or even wants to destroy them - should lose all rights as a citizen and as a human being, and the state should be allowed to persecute him or her with all available means. This means that a terrorist who wants to subvert the societal norms, a criminal who ignores all laws, or a [[mafia]] member who only respects the rules of his clan should be designated as "unpersons" and not deserve to be treated as a citizen anymore. Rather, such people must be treated as enemies.

Jakobs justifies the necessity of a Feindstrafrecht philosophically, and refers to the [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] [[social contract theory]] and its interpretation by [[Immanuel Kant]]. Whoever terminates that social contract by dishonoring it, leaves society and enters the lawless [[State of nature|natural state]]. Thereby, he loses his rights as a person and turns into an enemy, and as such, he has to be persecuted by the society.

== Current events ==
Although the Feindstrafrecht has been applied back by the [[Germanic peoples]] and in the [[Medieval Ages]], the German [[Nazi era]] was notorious for it. Beggars, disabled people, Jews, trade union members and other persons were designated "Volksschädlinge" ("vermin of the people"), and thus imprisoned at will by the [[Gestapo]], and quickly condemned by the [[Volksgerichtshof]].

In [[Colombia]], since 1990 a kind of Feindstrafrecht is applied against drug dealers. The accused are imprisoned without accusation, often for years, and held without access to a lawyer. The accused are then often tried based on anonymous witness evidence.

The designation of [[Al Qaida]] terrorists and [[Taliban]] fighters as "[[unlawful combatant]]" and their imprisonment at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] is also likened to the Feindstrafrecht concept, as are the [[targeted killings]] by drones of the U.S. Air Force.

== Criticism ==
Criticism is leveled by several law scholars, for example because the Feindstrafrecht in itself is not a law, but intends to disable existing laws in order to deprive people of legal protections. The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic law]] also stipulates that [[human dignity]] of all people has to be protected by the German government, not only the dignity of those who respect the law. The social philosopher [[Oskar Negt]], in his 2010 work "Der politische Mensch - Demokratie als Lebensform", summarizes some other criticism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1419">In modern U.S. usage, '''forfeiture''' is deprivation or destruction of a [[rights|right]] in consequence of the non-performance of some [[Obligation (law)|obligation]] or condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Connellan v. Federal Life &amp; Casualty Co.|vol=134|reporter=ME|opinion=104|date=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be accidental, and therefore is distinguished from [[waiver]]; ''see [[waiver and forfeiture]].''  

Historically, forfeiture of a convict’s land and other assets followed on from conviction for certain serious offences (and thus resulted from criminal activity rather than from a failure to act).  A striking illustration of the practical effects of this rule is [[Giles Corey]]’s refusal to plead, in the [[Salem Witch Trials]], instead dying under ''[[peine forte et dure]]''.  By refusing to plead he avoided the jurisdiction of the court and thus avoided conviction and the consequent forfeiture of his estate.  Instead it passed to his sons.{{citation needed |date=November 2018}}

In the early 21st century, the [[United States Government]] began to seize [[domain name]]s, on the legal theory that they were property used in [[criminal activity|criminal activities]] and thus subject to forfeiture.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7325">'''The Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse''' is a term for [[internet]] [[criminal]]s, or the [[image]]ry of internet criminals.

==Popular usage==
A play on [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], it refers to types of criminals who use the internet to facilitate crime and consequently jeopardize the rights of honest internet users. There does not appear to be an exact definition for who the Horsemen are, but they are usually described as [[Terrorism|terrorist]]s, [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]]s, [[Pedophilia|pedophile]]s, and [[organized crime]]. Other sources use slightly different descriptions but generally refer to the same types of criminals. The term was [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Timothy C. May]] in 1988, who referred to them as "child pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The term seems to be used less often in discussions about online criminal activity, but more often in discussions about the negative, or [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effects]] such activity has had on regular users' daily experiences online.
It is also used frequently to describe the political tactic "[[Think of the children]]".  A message from the [[Cypherpunk|same]] mailing list states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Examples==

In 2013, the director of the Safe Internet League (a voluntary [[Internet censorship in Russia|censorship group in Russia]]) claimed that pedophiles, perverts, drug dealers “and other creeps”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia’s FSB mulls ban on ‘Tor’ online anonymity network|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/russia-tor-anonymizer-ban-571/|website=Russia Today|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; were using the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] anonymity software, as a reason why the software should be outlawed.  This list did not mention terrorists or money-launderers directly, but did use the catch-all phrase "other creeps" that potentially includes them.

In 2015, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative party]] claimed that their proposed “new communications data legislation will strengthen our ability to disrupt terrorist plots, criminal networks and organised child grooming gangs”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gayle|first1=Damien|title=Right to privacy 'could be meaningless in 10 years under Tory and Labour plans'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/22/right-to-privacy-could-be-meaningless-in-10-years-under-tory-and-labour-plans|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoing the "child pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, etc." quote of Timothy C. May.

Later in 2015, [[Gamma Group]] released a statement claiming that their surveillance technology is used "against terrorist threats, drug cartels, other major organised crime, and paedophile rings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nick Hopkins|author2=Jake Morris|title=UK firm's surveillance kit 'used to crush Uganda opposition'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34529237|website=BBC News|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as justification for concerns that it was being used to target opposition politicians and media groups in [[Uganda]].  With money-laundering treated as a major organised crime, this quote matches very closely with the list given in the Cypherpunk FAQ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Gender empowerment''' is the [[empowerment]] of people of any [[gender]]. While conventionally being reduced to its aspect of [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], the concept stresses [[Sex and gender distinction|the distinction]] between biological [[sex]] and [[Gender role|gender as a role]], also referring to other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context.

Gender empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in regard to development and economics. Entire nations, businesses, communities, and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;Deneulin, Séverine, with Lila Shahani.  2009.  An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency.  Sterling, VA: Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2).  8 September 2000. (Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring ==
Gender empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]], or the GEM. The GEM shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. Gem is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence."&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11405">The '''Handschu agreement''' is a set of guidelines that regulate police behavior in [[New York City]] with regard to political activity.

==Background==
In 1971, 21 members of the [[Black Panther Party]] were tried for conspiracy to blow up police stations and department stores. They were acquitted of all charges after only 90 minutes of jury deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LOkYzy4t2VEC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=1971+new+york+panther+21+acquitted&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=awUaLAZn0z&amp;sig=_oyKmE0C-cSVljTz7DF9PDo56S0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1ShGUrm9E-GkyQGQyoHwAg&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q=1971%20new%20york%20panther%2021%20acquitted&amp;f=false | title =Warfare in the American Homeland: Policing and Prison in a Penal Democracy | author =Joy James | author2 =''[[Duke University]]'' | isbn =978-0822339236 | pages =74 | publisher =books.google.com | year =2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial revealed the extent to which the NYPD had infiltrated and kept dossiers on not only the Black Panthers and other radical groups, but also on [[anti-war]] groups, [[gay rights]] activists, educational reform advocates, religious groups, and civic organizations.&lt;ref name ="ApuzzoGoldberg"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UWBLg4JRmAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20panther&amp;f=false | title =Enemies Within: Inside the NYPD's Secret Spying Unit and bin Laden's Final Plot Against America | author =Matt Apuzzo, Adam Goldberg| author2 =''[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]'' | isbn =978-1476727936 | pages =44 | publisher =books.google.com | year =2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Handschu agreement, or decree, was the result of a [[class-action lawsuit]] filed against the City of New York, its Police Commissioner and the Intelligence Division of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) on behalf of [[Barbara Handschu]] and fifteen other [[plaintiffs]] affiliated with various political or ideological associations and organizations, known as ''Handschu v. Special Services Division'', 605 F.Supp. 1384, affirmed 787 F.2d 828.&lt;ref name ="HandschuNYTimes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://graphics.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20070215_nycruling.pdf | title =Handschu v. Special Services Division | author =''[[New York Times]]'' | publisher =nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs claimed that "informers and infiltrators provoked, solicited and induced members of lawful political and social groups to engage in unlawful activities"; that files were maintained with respect to "persons, places, and activities entirely unrelated to legitimate law enforcement purposes, such as those attending meetings of lawful organizations"; and that information from these files was made available to academic institutions, prospective employers, licensing agencies and others. In addition, plaintiffs protested seven types of police misconduct: (1) the use of informers; (2) infiltration; (3) interrogation; (4) overt surveillance; (5) summary punishment; (6) intelligence gathering; and (7) electronic surveillance, and alleged that these police practices which punished and repressed lawful dissent had had a "chilling effect" upon the exercise of freedom of speech, assembly and association, that they violated constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures, and that they abridged rights of privacy and due process.&lt;ref name="Arthur N. Eisenberg"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nyclu.org/content/testimony-police-surveillance-of-political-activity-history-and-current-state-of-handschu-de| author=Arthur N. Eisenberg| title=Testimony: Police Surveillance of Political Activity -- The History and Current State of the Handschu Decree| publisher=New York Civil Liberties Union| accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the court found that police surveillance of political activity violated [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] protections of [[free speech]].&lt;ref name ="HandschuNYTimes"/&gt; This ruling resulted in a [[consent decree]] which prohibited the NYPD from engaging "in any investigation of political activity except through the … Intelligence Division [of the Police Department]" and required that any "such investigations shall be conducted" only in accordance with the Guidelines incorporated into the Decree. The Guidelines further prohibited the Intelligence Division from "commencing an investigation" into the political, ideological or religious activities of an individual or group unless "specific information has been received by the Police Department that a person or group engaged in political activity is engaged in, about to engage in or has threatened to engage in conduct which constitutes a crime…."&lt;ref name="Arthur N. Eisenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/24/nypd-intelligence-chief-agents-mosque | title =NYPD intelligence chief wanted sources in every mosque within 250 miles | author =Ryan Devereaux | publisher =theguardian.com | date =February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
According to the terms of the agreement, purely political activity can only be investigated by the Public Security Section (PSS) of the NYPD's Intelligence Division, and then only when the Section suspects criminal activity. When the PSS does suspect criminal activity on the part of political groups, it must obtain a warrant from the three-person Handschu Authority, a commission made up of two deputy commissioners and a mayor-appointed civilian.

The agreement also prohibits indiscriminate police videorecording and photographing of public gatherings when there is no indication that unlawful activity is occurring.

The department is also prohibited from sharing information pertaining to political activity with other law enforcement agencies unless those agencies agree to abide by the terms of the Handschu agreement.

The court order mandates the compiling of annual, publicly available reports listing the surveillance requests made by the NYPD and the number of such requests granted.

==Current status==
In 2002, the NYPD asked federal judge [[Charles S. Haight, Jr.]], the judge who presided over the original case, to abrogate numerous provisions of the agreement, claiming that they inhibited the department's ability to prevent future [[terrorist]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The department also requested that the function of the Handschu authority be changed to investigating complaints of constitutional violations, which would take away the authority's power to oversee political investigations.

In regards to the requested changes, Police Commissioner [[Raymond W. Kelly]] said, "Today we live in a more dangerous, constantly changing world, one with challenges and threats that were never envisioned when the Handschu guidelines were written."&lt;ref name="NYT2002"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/nyregion/threats-responses-surveillance-police-ask-change-rules-ease-restrictions.html | title =THREATS AND RESPONSES: SURVEILLANCE; Police Ask to Change the Rules and Ease Restrictions on Political Investigations | author =Kevin Flynn, Jacob H. Fries | publisher =nytimes.com | date =September 26, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Dunn of the New York [[American Civil Liberties Union|Civil Liberties Union]], called the proposal "troubling," stating that the NYPD "has no legitimate reason to spy on lawful political activity."&lt;ref name="NYT2002"/&gt;

Former New York City mayor [[Ed Koch]], previously a critic of police surveillance, agreed with the proposal to rescind large portions of the Handschu agreement. "That's the necessary cost of protecting the public in these times where we're dealing with terrorism," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On February 11, 2003, Haight ruled that the NYPD should be permitted to modify the 1985 Decree, but not to the extent originally requested by the City. The judge instructed the city to adapt the [[U.S. Attorney General]]'s Guidelines on General Crimes, Racketeering Enterprise and Terrorism Enterprise Investigations, issued by Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] in May, 2002. This weakened the original decree in that a preliminary inquiry could be initiated when there is "information … which indicates the possibility of criminal activity."&lt;ref name="Arthur N. Eisenberg"/&gt;

In February 2007, [[Charles S. Haight, Jr.|Judge Haight]] ruled that the NYPD had violated the terms of the agreement by videotaping two demonstrations by advocates of the [[homeless]], one in [[Harlem]] in March 2005, the other in front of New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]'s house in December 2005. On June 13, 2007, Haight reversed the ruling, saying that attorneys for the city had provided new evidence indicating that the protestors may have been "disorderly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1171">The '''Hart–Dworkin debate''' is a debate in [[legal philosophy]] between [[H. L. A. Hart]] and [[Ronald Dworkin]]. At the heart of the debate lies a Dworkinian critique of Hartian [[legal positivism]], specifically, the theory presented in Hart's book ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.

While Hart insists that judges are within bounds to legislate on the basis of rules of law, Dworkin strives to show that in these cases, judges work from a set of 'principles' which they use to formulate judgements, and that these principles either form the basis, or can be extrapolated from the present rules.

[[Image:Quentin_Massys_-_Portrait_of_a_Man_-_National_Gallery_of_Scotland.jpg|200px|thumb|16th-century painting of a [[civil law notary]], by Flemish painter [[Quentin Massys]]. A civil law notary is roughly analogous to a common law [[solicitor]], except that, unlike solicitors, civil law notaries do not practice litigation.]]

The [[legal profession]] has its origins in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Although in Greece it was forbidden to take payment for pleading the [[Lawsuit|cause]] of another, the rule was widely flouted. After the time of [[Claudius]], lawyers (''iuris consulti'') could practise openly, although their remuneration was limited. A skilled and regulated profession developed gradually during the late Roman Empire and the [[Byzantine Empire]]: [[advocate]]s acquired more status, and a separate class of [[Notary|notaries]] (''tabelliones'') appeared.

In [[Western Europe]], the legal profession went into decline during the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]], re-emerging during the 12th and 13th centuries in the form of experts on [[canon law]]. The profession started to be regulated and to extend its reach to civil as well as ecclesiastical law.

==Ancient Greece and Rome==
The earliest people  who could be described as "lawyers" were probably the [[orators]] of ancient [[Athens]] (see [[History of Athens]]). However, Athenian orators faced serious structural obstacles. First, there was a rule that individuals were supposed to plead their own cases, which was soon bypassed by the increasing tendency of individuals to ask a "friend" for assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Bonner, ''Lawyers and Litigants in Ancient Athens: The Genesis of the Legal Profession'' (New York: Benjamin Blom, 1927), 202.&lt;/ref&gt; However, around the middle of the fourth century, the Athenians disposed of the perfunctory request for a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, a more serious obstacle, which the Athenian orators never completely overcame, was the rule that no one could take a fee to plead the cause of another. This law was widely disregarded in practice, but was never abolished, which meant that orators could ''never'' present themselves as legal professionals or experts.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; They had to uphold the [[legal fiction]] that they were merely an ordinary citizen generously helping out a friend for free, and thus they could never organize into a real profession&amp;mdash;with professional associations and titles and all the other pomp and circumstance&amp;mdash;like their modern counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if one narrows the definition to those men who could practice the legal profession openly and legally, then the first lawyers would have to be the orators of [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazard, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Crook (classicist)|John A. Crook]], ''Law and Life of Ancient Rome'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967), 90.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ban on fees was abolished by [[Claudius|Emperor Claudius]], who legalized advocacy as a profession and allowed the Roman advocates to become the first lawyers who could practice openly&amp;mdash;but he also imposed a fee ceiling of 10,000 [[sestertius|sesterces]].&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 90. Crook cites [[Tacitus]], ''Annals'' VI, 5 and 7 for this point. For more information about the complex political affair that forced Emperor Claudius to decide this issue, see ''The Annals of Tacitus'', Book VI ([[Franklin Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Franklin Center, PA]]: The Franklin Library, 1982), 208.&lt;/ref&gt; This was apparently not much money; the [[Satires of Juvenal]] complain that there was no money in working as an advocate.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Like their Greek contemporaries, early Roman advocates were trained in [[rhetoric]], not law, and the judges before whom they argued were also not law-trained.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; But very early on, unlike Athens, Rome developed a class of specialists who were learned in the law, known as jurisconsults (''iuris consulti'').&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"&gt;Crook, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisconsults were wealthy amateurs who dabbled in law as an intellectual hobby. Advocates and ordinary people also went to jurisconsults for legal opinions.&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"/&gt; Thus, the Romans were the first to have a class of people who spent their days thinking about legal problems, and this is why their law became so "precise, detailed, and technical."&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"/&gt;

During the [[Roman Republic]] and the early [[Roman Empire]], jurisconsults and advocates were unregulated, since the former were amateurs and the latter were technically illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Any citizen could call himself an advocate or a legal expert, though whether people believed him would depend upon his personal reputation. This changed once Claudius legalized the legal profession. By the start of the [[Byzantine Empire]], the legal profession had become well-established, heavily regulated, and highly stratified.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. M. Jones, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: A Social, Economic, and Administrative Survey'', vol. 1 ([[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman, OK]]: University of Oklahoma Press, 1964), 507.&lt;/ref&gt; The centralization and bureaucratization of the profession was apparently gradual at first, but accelerated during the reign of Emperor [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Schulz, ''History of Roman Legal Science'' ([[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 1946), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the jurisconsults went into decline during the imperial period.&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of Fritz Schulz, "by the fourth century things had changed in the eastern Empire: advocates now were really lawyers."&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, 268.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by the fourth century, advocates had to be enrolled on the bar of a court to argue before it, they could only be attached to one court at a time, and there were restrictions (which came and went depending upon who was emperor) on how many advocates could be enrolled at a particular court.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 508–510.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 380s, advocates were studying law in addition to rhetoric (thus reducing the need for a separate class of jurisconsults); in 460, [[Leo I the Thracian|Emperor Leo]] imposed a requirement that new advocates seeking admission had to produce testimonials from their teachers; and by the sixth century, a regular course of legal study lasting about four years was required for admission.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 512–513.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius's fee ceiling lasted all the way into the Byzantine period, though by then it was measured at 100 [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]].&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"&gt;Jones, 511.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, it was widely evaded, either through demands for maintenance and expenses or a ''sub rosa'' [[barter (economics)|barter]] transaction.&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"/&gt; The latter was cause for disbarment.&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"/&gt;

The notaries (''tabelliones'') appeared in the late Roman Empire. Like their modern-day descendants, the civil law notaries, they were responsible for drafting wills, conveyances, and contracts.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"&gt;Jones, 515.&lt;/ref&gt; They were ubiquitous and most villages had one.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"/&gt; In Roman times, notaries were widely considered to be inferior to advocates and jurisconsults.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"/&gt; Roman notaries were not law-trained; they were often barely literate, with an unfavorable reputation for wrapping simple transactions in mountains of legal jargon, since they were paid by the line.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
[[Image:Pieter Brueghel the Younger - Village Lawyer - WGA3633.jpg|300px|thumb|''Village Lawyer'' by [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], 1621 ]]

After the fall of the western Empire and the onset of the Dark Ages, the legal profession of Western Europe collapsed. As James Brundage has explained: "[by 1140], no one in Western Europe could properly be described as a professional lawyer or a professional canonist in anything like the modern sense of the term 'professional.' "&lt;ref&gt;James A. Brundage, "The Rise of the Professional Jurist in the Thirteenth Century," &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;20 Syracuse J. Int'l L. &amp; Com. 185&lt;/span&gt; (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1150 onward, a small but increasing number of men became experts in [[canon law]] but only in furtherance of other occupational goals, such as serving the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as priests.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1190 to 1230, however, there was a crucial shift in which some men began to practice canon law as a lifelong profession in itself.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The legal profession's return was marked by the renewed efforts of church and state to regulate it. In 1231 two French councils mandated that lawyers had to swear an oath of admission before practicing before the bishop's courts in their regions, and a similar oath was promulgated by the papal legate in London in 1237.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same decade, Frederick II, the emperor of the Kingdom of Sicily, imposed a similar oath in his civil courts.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1250 the nucleus of a new legal profession had clearly formed.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The new trend towards professionalization culminated in a controversial proposal at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1275 that ''all'' ecclesiastical courts should require an oath of admission.&lt;ref name="Brundage, 189"&gt;Brundage, 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not adopted by the council, it was highly influential in many such courts throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Brundage, 189"/&gt; The civil courts in England also joined the trend towards professionalization; in 1275 a statute was enacted that prescribed punishment for professional lawyers guilty of deceit, and in 1280 the mayor's court of the city of London promulgated regulations concerning admission procedures, including the administering of an oath.&lt;ref&gt;John Hamilton Baker, ''An Introduction to British Legal History'', 3rd ed. (London: Butterworths, 1990), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=May 2010}}
'''Independent media''' refers to any form of [[media (communication)|media]], such as [[radio]], [[television]], [[newspaper]]s or the [[Internet]], that is free of influence by government or corporate interests. The term has varied applications. Within the [[United States]] and other [[developed country|developed countries]], it is often used synonymously with [[alternative media]] to refer to media that specifically distinguish themselves in relation to the [[mainstream media]]. In international development, the term independent media is used in relation to the development of new media outlets, particularly in areas where there is little to no existing media presence.

==Alternative media==
{{Main|Alternative media}}
In developed countries, alternative media are media that are alternatives to the business or [[state media|government-owned]] [[mass media]]. Proponents of alternative media argue that the mainstream media are [[bias]]ed. While sources of alternative media can also be biased (sometimes proudly so), the bias tends to be significantly different than that of the mainstream media, hence "alternative". As such, [[advocacy journalism]] tends to be a component of many alternative outlets. Because the term "alternative" has connotations of self-marginalization, some media outlets now prefer the term "independent" over "alternative". An independent media means that no one should control and influence its coverage of news.

==In developing countries==
In many [[developing country|developing countries]], the only media available, particularly at the national level, are government-controlled radio and television stations and newspapers. Even if not overtly controlled by the state, outlets may have strong ties to or be influenced by the government. In such situations, it is often difficult to distinguish those outlets that are truly independent from those that are influenced by the government. For example, a newspaper may provide quality, unbiased coverage of the [[economy]], [[health]], and other issues, but still avoid reporting on the government. This issue is particularly compounded by issues of [[self-censorship]], soft censorship, and other subtle government influences.

===Self-censorship===
{{Main|Self-censorship}}
Self-censorship is the act of [[censorship|censoring]] or [[classified information|classifying]] one's own work out of fear of or deference to the sensibilities of others without an authority directly pressuring one to do so. Self-censorship is often practiced by [[film producer]]s, [[film director]]s, [[publisher]]s, [[news anchor]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[musician]]s, and other kinds of [[author]]s. In [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries, creators of artworks may remove material that their government might find controversial for fear of sanction by their governments. In [[cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries, self-censorship can also occur, particularly in order to conform to the expectations of the [[Market (economics)|market]]. For example, the editor of a periodical may consciously or unconsciously avoid topics that will anger [[advertiser]]s or the publication's [[parent company]] in order to protect their livelihood.

===Soft censorship===
Soft, or indirect, censorship is the practice of influencing news coverage by applying financial pressure on media companies that are deemed critical of a government or its policies and rewarding media outlets and individual journalists who are seen as friendly to the government.&lt;ref&gt;Center for International Media Assistance, ''Soft Censorship: How Governments Around the Globe Use Money to Manipulate the Media'', http://cima.ned.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/cima-soft_censorship-report.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem goes largely unnoticed, yet can have a dramatic impact on the reporting of media outlets that can otherwise be considered independent.

==Development==
{{Main|Media development}}
Many organizations engage in efforts to help the development of free and independent media in countries around the world. These efforts can take many forms, from funding the establishment of an entirely new media outlet to assisting an existing outlet in improving its [[Journalism#Professional_and_ethical_standards|professional capacity]]. Common efforts at independent media development include: journalist training and education; improving the legal environment for media; efforts to improve the sustainability of existing outlets; [[media literacy]] training; [[digital media]] training and integration; [[Infrastructure#Communications infrastructure|infrastructure]] development; and monitoring and evaluation efforts.

===Media development vs. media for development===
Some development organizations and experts make a distinction between media development and media for development. "Media development" refers to efforts to directly improve the media in a society through the means mentioned above. "Media for development" refers to more indirect efforts at using existing media to convey messages about specific development issues. Such efforts include many [[ICT4D|ICT for Development (ICT4D)]] projects. Media for development has been applied to education, healthcare, business, disaster relief, corruption, minority empowerment, and local community engagement, among other development goals.

===Media development organizations===
While development of the media sector is a common activity of many development organizations, there are a small number that engage in direct media development as their primary purpose. In the U.S., the three main media development implementers are [[Internews]], [[International Center for Journalists]] (ICFJ), and [[International Research &amp; Exchanges Board]] (IREX). In addition, organizations like the [[Center for International Media Assistance]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], [[Article 19]], and others monitor media development efforts and [[freedom of the press]] around the world.

[[Image:Johann Jakob Moser.jpg|thumb|Johann Jacob Moser, after a painting by Johann Georg Oechslin (1775).]]

'''Johann Jakob Moser''' (18 January 1701 – 30 September 1785) was a German jurist, publicist and researcher, whose work earned him the title "The Father of German [[Constitutional Law]]" and whose political commitment to the principles of Liberalism caused him to lose academic positions and spend years as a [[political prisoner]].

==Early life==
Johann Jacob Moser was a member of the Moser family of Filseck, an old and respectable Württemberg family. They were devout Protestants with a history of service as civil servants to the Duchy of Württemberg. Moser's father was Johann Jacob Moser of Filseck (born 1660 in Stuttgart, died 1716), and his mother was Helene Catharine ''née'' Misler (born 1672 in Stade, died 1741 in Stuttgart).

Moser was born and died in [[Stuttgart]]. He had six brothers and sisters but his parents managed to fund his pursuit of an academic career. After attending [[Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Wojak | first =Irmtrud | title =Fritz Bauer 1903–1968: eine Biographie | publisher=C.H.Beck | year =2009 | location =Munich | pages =54 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=jP0uMZLuN0wC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=%22Berthold+Auerbach%22+Eberhard-Ludwigs-gymnasium| isbn =978-3-406-58154-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Moser studied state journalism at the [[University of Tübingen]]. He was mostly self-taught and at 18 years of age he became a professor of the law faculty. However he found his income insufficient, and he so that it had to look around for other possibilities. he studied at the [[University of Tübingen]], and was brilliant enough to be already at the age of 19 appointed a professor of Law in the same university.

In 1721 Moser married Friederike Rosine Vischer, daughter of a Württembergian Upper Council President. Their oldest son, [[Friedrich Karl von Moser]], was born on 18 December 1723 in Stuttgart, and became a jurist, political writer and a statesman.

From 1721-1726 he worked in Vienna. In 1724 he became an adviser to the state vice-chancellor Count Schönborn. Moser was not able to pursue a career in the imperial service, because he refused to convert to Catholicism. Soon afterwards he entered the civil service of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and was appointed as a "state adviser" in the Imperial Court. In 1726 Moser returned to Stuttgart as a government advisor. In 1727 he was appointed professor at the Tübingen Collegium. The job conflicted with his role as a government advisor and he quit (which job?) in 1732. He held a long series of administrative appointments, giving him a thorough knowledge of political and constitutional issues.

In 1736 he was called to head the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Frankfurt (Oder)]], but had to leave after three years due to his thoroughly Liberal ideas which were disliked by King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]]. Between 1739 and 1751, he had various jobs.

He spent the years 1739 to 1747 at [[Ebersdorf, Saalburg-Ebersdorf|Ebersdorf]], mainly concerned with completing the monumental 53 volumes of his ''Deutsches Staatsrecht'' ("German Constitutional Law"), a pioneering research analysing the named subject matter more systematically than ever done before, and based on a through study of the sources.

In 1751 Moser became a consultant on land reform to the [[Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg]]. He came into conflict with the Duke by opposing the Duke's [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] tendencies. In July 1759 he was arrested and imprisoned without judicial procedure in solitary confinement in the fortress [[Hohentwiel]], on the charge of authoring subversive writings. He completed his five-year detention with his mental and physical health and his faith in god unbroken. In order to meet his desire to write, without writing materials, he wrote religious songs on the walls with soot from the fireplace on the walls. In 1764, aged 63, he was released, in part due to the intercession of Friedrich the Great of Prussia, and was rehabilitated and restored to his position, rank and titles.

In 1764 he was released, due in part to the intercession of [[Friedrich the Great]] of Prussia (son of the king who had hounded Moser in 1739). He was rehabilitated and restored to his position, rank and titles. He retired on 16 July 1770 aged 69. During the next 15 years, he wrote many books. Over his entire life he wrote 500-600 books. This prolific output led sometimes to careless representations of the facts in his works.

==Legacy==
Johann Jacob Moser wrote the first description of the German state based not on abstract principles but on concrete legal rules and judicial decisions. He collected material and organised it systematically. Thus he argued against the deductive systems of natural law advocated by [[Christian Thomasius]] (1655-1728) and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679-1754). He gave the same treatment to international law, describing how it was actually practiced, rather than attempting to derive it from nature. Moser is considered as laying the foundations for the modern German state and positive international law. He defended the traditional order by defending actual legal rules.

Apart from his work on state law, he was also interested in the local law of the numerous territories of the state. However, because of their great variety, he was not able to describe them with the same comprehensiveness.

Among his important later works can be mentioned ''Neues deutsches Staatsrecht'', ("New German Constitutional Law"), published in 24 volumes between 1766 and 1782. His overall ouvre includes about 500 works, on law as well as [[theology]].

The '''''Journal of Law and Religion''''' is a peer-reviewed, interdisciplinary journal published through [[Cambridge University Press]] and edited by the [[Center for the Study of Law and Religion]] at [[Emory University School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-and-religion|title=Journal of Law and Religion|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary interests include topics related to the relationship between religion and law, including subjects related to theological [[jurisprudence]] and [[political theology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The journal was founded at [[Hamline University School of Law]] by the Harvard Law professor [[Harold J. Berman]] in 1982 along with Stephen B.Young, then Dean of the law school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamline.edu/HUNewsDetail.aspx?id=2110|title=Journal of Law &amp; Religion Salutes 25 Years of "Building Community and Deepening Understanding"|last=|first=|date=|website=Hamline University Law School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council on Religion and Law and Harvard Divinity School Professor [[James Luther Adams]] were also instrumental in starting the Journal. The goal of the Journal was to provide multiple frameworks of analysis for the study and discussion of structures of positive law. The Journal moved to the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at [[Emory University School of Law|Emory]] in 2013, two years prior to Hamline's merger with [[William Mitchell College of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationaljurist.com/national-jurist-magazine/journal-law-and-religion-moves-hamline-emory|title=Journal of Law and Religion moves from Hamline to Emory|last=|first=|date=8 August 2013|website=The National Jurist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of jury sentencing argue that since sentencing involves fact-finding (a task traditionally within the purview of juries), and since the [[original intent]] of the founders was to have juries check judges' power, it is the proper role of juries to participate in sentencing.&lt;ref name=booker/&gt; Opponents argue that judges' training and experience with the use of [[presentence report]]s and [[sentencing guidelines]], as well as the fact that [[jury control procedures]] typically deprive juries of the opportunity to hear information about the defendant's background during the trial, make it more practical to have judges sentence defendants.&lt;ref name=statutory/&gt;

==History==
===Rise of jury sentencing===
The impetus for introducing jury sentencing was that in the late 18th century, punishment options expanded beyond [[Public humiliation|shaming]] sanctions and the mandatory [[death penalty]] and came to include various ranges and modes of imprisonment, creating more room for case-by-case decisionmaking to which juries were thought to be well-suited.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Virginia was the first state to adopt jury sentencing. [[Constitution_of_Virginia#1776|The state's first constitution]] was enacted in 1776, and shortly thereafter, in 1779, [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] a revised criminal code that would have eliminated [[pardon]]s and [[benefit of clergy]], abolished capital punishment for most offenses, and allowed juries to decide punishments when the penalty was discretionary. This bill failed, however, both in 1779 and 1786, after [[James Madison]] had reintroduced it while [[Thomas_Jefferson#Minister_to_France|Jefferson was in France]].&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

Sentencing by jury was, however, successfully enacted in Virginia's 1796 penal code, which like the 1779 bill replaced capital punishment with terms of imprisonment for most felony offenses. Kentucky adopted a penal reform bill introduced by [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckenridge]] that implemented sentencing by jury in 1798. While in Virginia, magistrates continued to have misdemeanor sentencing power (possibly because of the political influence of magistrates who served in the General Assembly), in Kentucky, this power was given to juries. Kentucky juries tried and sentenced slaves and free blacks, and even decided cases involving [[prison discipline]], imposing punishments such as [[flagellation]] or [[solitary confinement]] for infractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Any convict commencing a quarrel with another should "suffer such punishment (within the prison) as should be awarded by an impartial jury, but not over four lashes, or 10 hours of solitary confinement.|title=The development of American prisons and prison customs, 1776-1845|author=Lewis, O.F.|date=1922|publisher=Prison Association of New York|url=https://archive.org/details/developmentofame00lewirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia and Tennessee adopted sentencing by jury in 1816 and 1829, respectively.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In contrast, northern states such as [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] allowed judges to determine penalties, with Pennsylvania also allowing judges to pardon prisoners who, in their view, had evidenced sincere reformation. One hypothesis is that Virginia opted for jury sentencing because [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]s like [[George Keith Taylor]] distrusted the Republican district court judges; while in Pennsylvania, the Constitutionalists sought (over the objections of Republicans) to put sentencing power in the hands of the judges because the bench was populated by Constitutionalists. [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]], which did not establish penitentiaries until after the [[American Civil War]], also left sentencing to judges' discretion.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

The adoption of jury sentencing happened at the same time that the movement for an elective judiciary gathered speed, with at least four states, Alabama, Mississippi, Montana, and North Dakota switching to [[judicial election]]s around the same time that they adopted jury sentencing. Both reforms may have been due to a mistrust of unelected judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

During the ten years of the [[Republic of Texas]], judges determined sentences. The 
change to jury determination of the penalty was brought about by one of the first laws passed by the first legislature of the State of Texas in 1846, which empowered the jury to sentence the defendant in all criminal cases except capital cases and cases for which punishment was fixed by law.&lt;ref name=grab/&gt;

Indiana, Illinois, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and West Virginia adopted jury sentencing later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

===Decline of jury sentencing===
The 1895 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Sparf v. United States]]'' reflected growing concern that letting juries decide whether or how the law should be applied in particular cases could be detrimental to the [[rule of law]]. By 1910, the role of juries in determining penalties was being eroded by the professionalization of sentencing, as many states passed laws that created [[parole]] and [[probation]] systems.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

These systems were based on a [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] philosophy that it would be more useful for society to focus on finding ways to prevent future crime than on fixing blame for crime that had occurred in the past. Criminal behavior was viewed as the result of such factors as [[heredity]], social circumstances, random breeding, and [[Darwinian struggle]], rather than an abuse of divinely-granted [[free will]]. [[Psychology]] and [[sociology]] would determine the causes of crime and what social reforms and treatment programs would correct them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The changing purposes of criminal punishment: A retrospective on the past century and some thoughts about the next|author=Alschuler, Albert|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=70|number=1|pages=1-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Probation officer]]s gathered and analyzed information about the defendant's character and prepared a presentence report that served as the basis for the ultimate sentence. Probation provided opportunities for treatment in the community for juveniles and adults. In the prison system, [[parole commission]]ers, trained in penology and insulated from political pressures, determined when prisoners had been rehabilitated and could be reintegrated into society.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

The process of preparing a presentence report, which takes weeks, only begins after the defendant is convicted, since if he/she were to be acquitted, the effort that went into preparing the report would be wasted. It would, therefore, not be possible for juries to sentence the defendant at the time of conviction, if the jury needed to rely on a presentence report in making its sentencing decision; rather, the jury would need to be broken up and reassembled later, which could be unworkable if the delay between verdict and sentencing is substantial.&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

Furthermore, jury control procedures typically provide that during the trial, information about the defendant's background that is not relevant to the issue of guilt is not to be presented in the presence of the jury, lest it prejudice him. The assumptions that presentence reports would be more informative than presentence hearings, and that training and experience were required to intelligently consider the data and assess sanctions, militated in favor of having a judge rather than a jury do the sentencing.&lt;ref name=statutory&gt;{{cite journal|title=Statutory Structures for Sentencing Felons to Prison|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=1 December 1960|volume=60|number=8|pages=1134-1172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''[[McKeiver v Pennsylvania]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that alleged juvenile delinquents have no right to a jury trial, with [[Harry Blackmun]] and three other Justices opining that an adversarial system would put an end to the prospect of a intimate, informal protective proceeding focused on rehabilitation.

Georgia and Tennessee both had periods (from 1937-1939, and from 1913-1923, respectively) in which they briefly abandoned jury sentencing while experimenting with [[indeterminate sentencing]]. By 1919, fourteen states gave juries sentencing powers in non-capital cases, although by 1960, that number had dropped to thirteen.&lt;ref name=democratic&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing as Democratic Practice|author=Iontcheva, Jenia|journal=Virginia Law Review|volume=89|number=2|date=April 2003|pages=311-383|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3202435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s and 1980s, [[determinate sentencing]], a new intellectual current that repudiated the [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitative]] model with its focus on using mathematical models and grids to determine sentences, had made inroads, making jury sentencing seem like more of an anachronism.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; Georgia permanently abandoned jury sentencing in 1974 and Tennessee did the same in 1982.&lt;ref name=origins&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, Nancy J.|title=The Origins of Felony Jury Sentencing in the United States|volume=78|journal=Chi.-Kent L. Rev.|number=937|date=2003|url=https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cklawreview/vol78/iss3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, and North Dakota had also abandoned jury sentencing, and Mississippi was using jury sentencing only in rape and statutory rape cases. Oklahoma abolished jury sentencing but reinstated it in 1999.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

===Possible revival of jury sentencing===
According to some commentators, the time is ripe for a revival of jury sentencing, because flaws in the determinate sentencing systems are becoming increasingly apparent. Lawmakers drafting legislation such as the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] have had difficulty mustering the political will to make clear choices among opposing moral and ideological viewpoints, instead delegating these decisions to agencies that lack the representativeness and democratic origin of legislatures. Prosecutors have routinely circumvented the sentencing guidelines through their charging and plea bargaining decisions, creating a new set of disparities, despite the intent of the guidelines to curtail disparities.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; Determinate sentencing has also failed to reduce racial disparity in sentencing.&lt;ref name=idea&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing in Noncapital Cases: An Idea Whose Time Has Come (Again)?|author=Lanni, Adriaan|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=1 May 1999|volume=108|number=7|pages=1775-1803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, some juries have been acquitting guilty defendants to save them from what they regard as overly harsh [[mandatory minimum sentence]]s, such as those imposed by the [[Rockefeller Drug Laws]] and California's [[three-strikes law]]. There have been movements to abolish sentencing commissions and guideline systems and inform jurors of their right to nullify. Decisions like ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find any facts that would increase a defendant's maximum sentence) and ''[[Ring v. Arizona]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find whether there are aggravating factors justifying capital punishment) have also signaled a willingness by the judiciary to expand the role of the jury in the legal process.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Jury sentencing has been seen as a way to in many cases render moot the questions raised by ''Apprendi'' and related cases such as ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'' and ''[[United States v. Booker]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bibas, Stephanos and Klein, Susan R.|title=The Sixth Amendment and Criminal Sentencing|date=2008|journal=Faculty Scholarship|number=921|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/921}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the differences between [[Element (criminal law)|elements of an offense]] and sentencing factors by letting the jury decide all the facts.&lt;ref name=applying&gt;{{cite journal|title=Applying Apprendi to jury sentencing: why state felony jury sentencing threatens the right to a jury trial|author=Carrington, Melissa|journal=University of Illinois Law Review|date=Fall 2011|volume=2011|number=4|pages=1359-1385|url=http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2011/4/Carrington.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases such as ''[[Miller v. Alabama]]'' and ''[[Graham v. Florida]]'' (banning mandatory life imprisonment without parole, and life imprisonment without parole in non-homicide cases, respectively, for juveniles, as contrary to the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]'s prohibition of [[cruel and unusual punishment]]) also raise a question of whether the Supreme Court logically should allow only a jury, rather than a judge, to determine a juvenile should receive such a sentence, given the parallels between adult capital punishment case law and juvenile life imprisonment with parole case law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Russell, Sarah F.|title=Jury Sentencing and Juveniles: Eighth Amendment Limits and Sixth Amendment Rights|volume=56|journal=B.C.L. Rev.|number=553|date=2015|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/bclr/vol56/iss2/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plea bargains, judicial override, and juror access to information==
In Virginia, under the 1796 act, capital punishment remained mandatory for [[first-degree murder]], but the penalty for [[second-degree murder]] was any term between five and eighteen years in the penitentiary. The 1796 act gave the court in murder cases the authority to "determine the degree of the crime, and to give sentence accordingly" when a defendant was "convicted by confession." The judge's discretion to set sentences in cases of confession did not exist in Kentucky.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In Missouri, informing juries of sentences of defendants in similar cases or the sentences of co-participants in the crime on trial is strictly prohibited under the rules of evidence." Similarly, the Kentucky [[truth in sentencing]] statute, which generally increases the information available to sentencing juries, does not provide for sentencing guidelines and statistics. Kentucky courts have also held parole eligibility statistics inadmissible. The military at one time provided [[United States military jury|jurors]] with sentencing statistics and guidelines was the military, but this practice ended in the late 1950s as the military's judicial philosophy shifted its emphasis away from sentencing uniformity and towards individualized judgments. The [[United States Court of Military Appeals]] held that jurors were not to consider sentences in similar cases or to consult the sentencing manual.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Under Virginia's current system, jurors are controversially not allowed access to the Commonwealth's [[sentencing guidelines]] or to information about whether sentences will run consecutively or concurrently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-20120401-2012-04-01-dp-nws-crime-notebook-0401-20120331-story.html|date=1 April 2012|title=Virginia judges rarely question juries' sentencing recommendations|publisher=Daily Press|author=Kelly, Ashley and Dujardin, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until 2000 were also not informed that parole had been abolished in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/va_md_dc/virginia-eyes-new-sentences-after-juries-didn-t-get-key/article_1008cc74-de6f-5b77-bdd0-61c099dd9400.html|title=Virginia eyes new sentences after juries didn't get key fact|author=Durkin, Alana|publisher=Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star|date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A judge must justify any departure from the jury's recommendation in writing to the [[Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission]]. Less than one-quarter of jury-recommended sentences are modified by judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Caleb R.|title=Sentencing Roulette: How Virginia’s Criminal Sentencing System is Imposing an Unconstitutional Trial Penalty That Suppresses the Rights of Criminal Defendants to a Jury Trial|volume=23|journal=Wm.&amp; Mary Bill Rts. J.|number=559|date=2014|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmborj/vol23/iss2/10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to concerns about juries' imposing higher sentences than what the sentencing guidelines would suggest, many defendants opt either for [[bench trial]]s or [[plea bargain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Number of juried trials slumps both in Va., nationwide |url=https://www.dailyprogress.com/newsvirginian/news/number-of-juried-trials-slumps-both-in-va-nationwide/article_d2dbfd5c-34cc-5d9c-b999-a9c6641783f9.html|author=Green, Frank|publisher=Daily Progress|date=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States with jury sentencing have often allowed judges to intervene in the sentencing process, e.g. by reducing the sentence imposed by the jury, imposing hard labor or solitary confinement in addition to the jury's assessment of fines, or determining the place of confinement imposed by the jury.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; In Alabama, judges were allowed to override juries' recommendations of life imprisonment and impose capital punishment instead, until a 2017 law took that power away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2017/07/death_penalty_judicial_overrid.html|title=Did judicial override end in Alabama? Some say judges can still overrule jury over death penalty|date=21 July 2017|publisher=AL.com|author=Remkus, Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; All jury sentencing states except Texas allow the judge to fix the punishment in case the jury fails to agree on a sentence,&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; making it impossible for there to be a mistrial due to a [[hung jury]] at sentencing.&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

==Arguments for and against jury sentencing==
Arguments that have been raised for sentencing by jury are that judges can be arbitrary (depending, e.g., on their mood at the time of sentencing) and partisan, and that putting the same person in charge of both deciding sentences and extending leniency (e.g. through pardons) centralizes too much power in one person. Also, different judges may be inconsistent in the judgments they render. Another argument in favor of jury sentencing is that the punishment equitably due is best determined by the particular circumstances of the case, rather than by legal technicalities; and that a jury is well-equipped for this purpose.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt; Also, if juries have power to give a lenient sentence, they may be less likely to engage in [[jury nullification]] by acquitting a guilty defendant whom they believe is undeserving of severe punishment.&lt;ref name=idea/&gt;

An argument based on the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth]] and [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendments to the United States Constitution]] is that criminal and civil juries have similar societal functions, including checking the abuse of governmental power, injecting community values into legal decisions, and aiding public acceptance of legal determinations; and therefore the criminal system should have juries decide sentences much as the civil system has juries decide judgments.&lt;ref name=booker&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kirgis, Paul F.|title=The Right to a Jury Decision on Sentencing Facts after Booker: What the Seventh Amendment Can Teach the Sixth|volume=39|journal=Ga. L. Rev.|number=897|date=2005|url=http://scholarship.law.umt.edu/faculty_lawreviews/131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments that have been raised against sentencing by jury are that juries are not as accountable as judges; that putting them in charge of determining both guilt and the sentence concentrates too much power in one body; and that different juries may differ widely in the sentences they impose. Counterarguments are that the lack of accountability of jurors to a higher authority preserves their [[judicial independence]], and that judges are also capable of differing from other judges in the sentences they impose. Judges may even deviate from their own usual sentencing practices if the case is high-profile or a judicial election is coming up. Also, disparities are not always a sign of arbitrariness; sometimes they may reflect geographical differences in public attitudes toward a given crime, or a jury's taking proper account of the individual circumstances of each offender.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

It is sometimes argued that an unreasonable juror may force the rest of the jury into an undesirable compromise to find the defendant guilty but impose an overly light sentence. A counter-argument is that whether this is bad or good is a matter of perception since "one juror's principled holdout is another juror's irrational nullification. One jury's 'compromise' is another jury's perfectly appropriate give-and-take deliberations."&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1185&amp;context=dlj|title=The Case for Jury Sentencing|author=Hoffman, Morris B.|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=52|number=951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to University of Chicago Law School lecturer Jenia Iontcheva, sentencing decisions are well-suited to being made through a process of [[deliberative democracy]] rather than by experts such as judges, since they involve deeply contested moral and political issues rather than scientific or technical issues. She argues that since sentencing requires individualized, case-by-case assessments, sentences should be decided through small-scale deliberation by juries, as opposed to having lawmakers codify general policies for mechanical application by judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

An advantage Iontcheva cites of having juries come together to deliberate on sentences is that the jurors may alter their preferences in the light of new perspectives. She argues that the hearing and consideration of diverse opinions will give the sentencing decisions greater legitimacy, and that engaging ordinary citizens in government through this process of deliberative democracy will give these citizens confidence about their ability to influence political decisions and thus increase their willingness to participate in politics even after the end of their jury service. Racial and other minorities may also benefit from having greater representation among jurors than among judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

In jurisdictions that do not have any statutory provisions formally allowing jury sentencing, judges have sometimes consulted with the jury on sentencing anyway. At the federal level, the practice of polling the jury and using their input in sentencing was upheld on appeal by the [[6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2016/06/federal_appeals_court_upholds.html|title=Federal appeals court upholds judge's lowest possible sentence in child-porn case|author=Heisig, Eric|publisher=Cleveland.com|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentencing is said to be more time-consuming for jurors than the relatively easy task of ascertaining guilt or innocence,&lt;ref name=grab&gt;{{cite journal|author=Webster, Charles W.|title=Jury Sentencing - Grab-Bag Justice|volume=14|journal=Sw L.J.|number=221|date=1960|url=https://scholar.smu.edu/smulr/vol14/iss2/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means an increase in jury fees and in the amount of productivity lost to jury duty.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; In [[New South Wales]], a 2007 proposal by Chief Justice [[Jim Spigelman]] to involve juries in sentencing was rejected after District Court Chief Judge [[Reg Blanch]] cited "an expected wide difference of views between jurors about questions relating to sentence". Concerns about [[jury tampering]] through intimidation by defendants were also raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/keep-juries-away-from-sentencing-say-judges-20070427-gdq067.html|title=Keep juries away from sentencing, say judges|author=Pearlman, Jonathan|date=27 April 2007|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]] and many other [[continental Europe]]an countries have a system in which professional judges and [[Judiciary_of_Germany#Lay_judges|lay judges]] deliberate together at both the trial and sentencing stages; such systems have been praised as a superior alternative because the mixed court dispenses with most of the time‐consuming practices of jury control that characterize Anglo‐American trial procedure, yet serves the purposes of a jury trial better than plea bargaining and bench trials, which have displaced the jury from routine American practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mixed Court and Jury Court: Could the Continental Alternative Fill the American Need?|author=Langbein, John H.|date=January 1981|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-4469.1981.tb00426.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable jury sentences==
Civil rights leader [[James Bevel]] was sentenced to 15 years in prison pursuant to the recommendation of a Virginia jury that found him guilty of having sex with his teenage daughter in the 1990s when they lived in Leesburg. The sentencing range had been 5 to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=43768|title=Civil Rights Leader Convicted of Incest|author=Barakat, Matthew|publisher=Associated Press|date=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lawmaking''' is the process of crafting legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lawmaking|title=Lawmaking definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its purest sense, it is the basis of [[governance]].  
This form of law making is also applied in India. It is a process which works in India on the basis of Indian Constitution.
Lawmaking in modern [[democracy|democracies]] is the work of [[legislature]]s, which exist at the local, regional, and national levels and make such laws as are appropriate to their level, and binding over those under their jurisdictions.  These bodies are influenced by [[lobbyist]]s, [[pressure group]]s, sometimes partisan considerations, but ultimately by the voters who elected them and to which they are responsible, if the system is working as intended.  Even the expenditure of governmental funds is an aspect of lawmaking, as in most jurisdictions the [[budget]] is a matter of law.

In [[dictator|dictatorships]] and absolute [[monarchy|monarchies]] the leader can make law essentially by the stroke of a pen, one of the main objections to such an arrangement.  However, a seemingly-analogous event can occur even in a democracy where the [[executive (government)|executive]] can make [[executive order]]s which have the force of law.  In some instance, even regulations issued by executive departments can have the force of law.  [[Libertarian]]s, in particular, are known for denouncing such actions as being anti-democratic, but they have become such a salient feature of modern governance that it is hard to picture a system in which they no longer exist, because it is hard to picture the time involved in every regulation being debated prior to becoming law.  That, say libertarians, is precisely the point: if such executive orders and regulations do not stand up to legislative scrutiny, they should never be implemented.  In response to this, limits on regulatory authority have been made legislatively, and libertarians still contend for, if not the abolition of executive orders altogether, then their automatic [[sunset]] after a fixed period if not legislatively reviewed and confirmed; this policy has been adopted in some jurisdictions.

:The [[American Library Association]] defines [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] as "the study of the [[structure]] and [[properties]] of [[information]], as well as the application of [[technology]] to the [[Categorization|organization]], [[archive|storage]], [[information retrieval|retrieval]], and dissemination of information." Legal informatics therefore, pertains to the application of informatics within the context of the legal environment and as such involves [[law]]-related [[organization]]s (e.g., law offices, [[court]]s, and [[law school]]s) and [[User (computing)|user]]s of information and [[information technology|information technologies]] within these organizations.

==Delivery of legal services==
Advances in [[technology]] and legal informatics have led to new models for the delivery of legal services. Legal services have traditionally been a "bespoke" product created by a professional [[Lawyer|attorney]] on an individual basis for each client.&lt;ref name="SusskindArticle"&gt;Richard Susskind, From Bespoke to Commodity, LEGAL TECH. J., 2006, at 4, 4–7. {{cite web |url=http://www.legaltechnologyjournal.co.uk/content/view/21/51/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129134550/http://www.legaltechnologyjournal.co.uk//content//view//21//51// |archivedate=2011-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to work more efficiently, parts of these services will move sequentially from (1) bespoke to (2) standardized, (3) systematized, (4) packaged, and (5) commoditized.&lt;ref name="SusskindArticle"/&gt; Moving from one stage to the next will require embracing different technologies and knowledge systems.&lt;ref name="SusskindArticle"/&gt;

===Cloud computing and legal services===
The widespread introduction of [[cloud computing]] provides several benefits in delivering legal services. Legal service providers can use the [[Software as a Service]] model to earn a profit by charging customers a per-use or subscription fee. This model has several benefits over traditional bespoke services.
* Software as a service is much more [[scalable]]. Traditional bespoke models require an attorney to spend more of a limited resource (their time) on each additional client. Using Software as a Service, a legal service provider can put in effort once to develop the product and then use a much less limited resource (cloud computing power) to provide service to each additional customer.
* Software as a service can be used to complement traditional bespoke services by handling routine tasks, leaving an attorney free to concentrate on bespoke work.
* Software as a service can be delivered more conveniently because it does not require the legal service provider to be available at the same time as the customer.

Software as a service also complicates the attorney-client relationship in a way that may have implications for [[attorney-client privilege]].  The traditional delivery model makes it easy to create delineations of when attorney-client privilege attaches and when it does not. But in more complex models of legal service delivery other actors or automated processes may moderate the relationship between a client and their attorney making it difficult to tell which communications should be [[Privilege (evidence)|legally privileged]].&lt;ref name="Johnsonarticle"&gt;Chris Johnson, Leveraging Technology to Deliver Legal Services, 23 HARV. J.L. &amp; TECH.259, 279 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latent markets===
Because the traditional model for delivery services demanded all legal work to be done in a bespoke manner the supply of legal services is generally [[inelastic]]. Households that are ineligible for [[legal aid]] but are not able to easily afford bespoke legal services are effectively underserved by the traditional model. A report by the [[American Bar Association]] Standing Committee on the Delivery of Legal Services found that "among moderate-income households, 39% used the legal system to attempt resolution of their legal problems, 23% attempted resolution without legal help, and 26% took no action."&lt;ref name="DeliveryReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/legalservices/delivery/deltech.html|title=Standing Committee on the Delivery of Legal Services - Standing Committee / Delivery of Legal Services|author=|date=|work=abanet.org|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New organizations seek to access this under-served [[latent market]] by using technology to reduce prices and make services more available.&lt;ref&gt;Lawbots.info.

===Online legal services===
{{See also|Document automation#In Legal Services|l1=Document automation in legal services}}

The spread of the Internet and development of legal technology and informatics are extending legal services to individuals and small-medium companies.

====United States====
In 1995, [[FindLaw]] started its online legal information service, where users can search lawyers, discuss legal topics in open forum, and purchase legal forms. In 1999, [[LegalMatch]] started its online legal matching service, where users answer questions online, LegalMatch identify the service required and notifies relevant lawyers, and users receives responses from the lawyers and can decide whom to hire. In 2001, [[LegalZoom]] started its online legal documentation service.  At LegalZoom, users can create legal documents for personal and business use by answering a questionnaire online and purchase the completed document.  In 2008, [[Rocket Lawyer]] started its online legal service, where users can receive legal documentation service and the on-call service to consult lawyers for personal and business needs at monthly or annual subscription fee. In 2012, [[Shake (company)|Shake]] started its mobile legal documentation service, with which users can create simple legal agreements via a mobile app.

====Japan====
In 2005, Taichiro Motoe, an attorney at law qualified in Japan, founded Authense Group, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.authense.co.jp&lt;/ref&gt; and started its online legal service, Bengoshi.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bengo4.com|title=弁護士ドットコム-無料法律相談・弁護士/法律相談事務所検索ポータル|author=|date=|work=bengo4.com|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At Bengoshi.com, users can search lawyers, ask legal questions and receive answers from lawyers in open forum, request estimate for attorney fees, and consult lawyers for personal and business needs.

===Regulatory barriers to delivery of legal services===
{{Original research|section|date=December 2016}}
Currently available legal technologies and processes cannot be implemented due to various regulations on the practice of law put into place by [[state bar association]]s and state statutes. There is controversy over whether these regulations remain in place due to economic interests by attorneys or out of genuine concern for potential harms to customers. Regulations which pose obstacles to widespread adoption of new legal technologies and processes include [[Unauthorized practice of law#Unauthorized practice of law|unauthorized practice of law]] statutes, ethical rules restricting alternative business structures for law firms, and professional rules which make practicing law in multiple jurisdictions difficult.

====Unauthorized practice of law====
{{Main|Unauthorized_practice_of_law#Unauthorized_practice_of_law}}
[[Layperson|Lay]] organizations seeking to provide legal services must be careful to avoid committing unauthorized practice of law or face exposure to litigation from consumers and regulators. The definition of what constitutes unauthorized practice of law is nebulous and has been criticized as a potentially [[unconstitutional]] restriction on free speech.&lt;ref name="LanctotArticle"&gt;Catherine J Lanctot, "Does LegalZoom have First Amendment Rights? Some Thoughts About Freedom of Speech and the Unauthorized Practice of Law", Villanova Univ. Sch. of L. Public Law &amp; Legal Theory Working Paper No. 2011-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative business structures====
{{main|Law_firm#Restrictions_on_ownership_interests}}
In the United States a complete bar to nonlawyer ownership has been adopted by the [[American Bar Association]] as paragraph (d) of Rule 5.4 of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] and has been codified in one form or another in all U.S. jurisdictions,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_5_4_professional_independence_of_a_lawyer.html Rule 5.4 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/selling_law_on_an_open_market/ |title=Selling Law on an Open Market |first=Jason |last=Krause |publisher=''[[ABA Journal]]'' |date=July 1, 2007 |accessdate=October 4, 2010}} See also: [[American Bar Association]] Commission on Multidisciplinary Practices, Final Report, Appendix C, Reporter's notes, July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; except the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.dcbar.org/for_lawyers/ethics/legal_ethics/rules_of_professional_conduct/amended_rules/rule_five/rule05_04.cfm Rule 5.4 of the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these rules, law firms face additional difficulties in raising equity capital to finance development of their own legal technologies and additional regulatory requirements compared to layperson organizations. Outside of the United States there are several countries which have allowed nonlawyer ownership of law firms ranging from limitations on percentage ownership combined with a "fit to own" test&lt;ref name="ABSMemo"&gt;ABA Commission on Ethics 20/20, Memorandum Re: For Comment: Issues Paper Concerning Alternative Business Structures, 17-19 (April 5, 2011)[http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/ethics_2020/abs_issues_paper.authcheckdam.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; (as in the [[United Kingdom]]) to allowing passive equity investment in law firms&lt;ref name="ABSMemo"/&gt; (as in [[Australia]]).

====Multijurisdictional practice====
Rule 5.5 of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] requires that attorneys who maintain a "systematic and continuous practice" in a jurisdiction be admitted to practice in that jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="ModelRule5.5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_5_5_unauthorized_practice_of_law_multijurisdictional_practice_of_law.html|title=Rule 5.5: Unauthorized Practice of Law; Multijurisdictional Practice of Law - The Center for Professional Responsibility|author=|date=|work=americanbar.org|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For law firms that wish to provide legal services over online delivery platforms, this phrase is unclear as to what types of activities within a state require licensing in that state.&lt;ref name="KimbroSlice"&gt;Staphanie L. Kimbro, Regulatory Barriers to the Growth of Multijurisdictional Virtual Law Firms and Potential First Steps to Their Removal, 13 N.C.J.L. &amp; TECH. ON. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; This difficulty is especially acute for [[virtual law firm]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Use of technology for legal access==

===Access to legal information===
From the mid-1990s onwards, lawyers, developers and publishers began to make the law available via the world wide web. Particularly influential{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} was the [[Free Access to Law Movement]] which by 2014 had 54 national and regional member organizations. In 2002, FALM adopted the Declaration on Free Access to Law. The goal of the movement has been to ensure that legal information is freely available to everyone. The declaration declared public legal information to be the common heritage of mankind.

The member organizations of FALM, primarily through the Internet, engaged in widespread publication of primary and secondary legal information. Early examples include the [[Legal Information Institute]] at Cornell University Law School and the [[Australasian Legal Information Institute]] based at the University of Technology and the University of New South Wales. The latter involved early adoption of hypertext technology to represent laws as a network of nodes, each representing a section.&lt;ref name="nyulawglobal.org"&gt;[http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Legal_Information_Institutes.htm Legal_Information_Institutes.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="austlii.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/austlii/articles/libs_paper.html|title=AustLII - Publications: AustLII - Libs Paper|author=|date=|work=austlii.edu.au|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work of the open access to law movement is now published through the ''Journal of Open Access to Law'', which was established in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ojs.law.cornell.edu/index.php/joal|title=Journal of Open Access to Law|author=|date=|work=cornell.edu|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the movement provided a catalyst for increasing official open access publication of legal information online by government agencies themselves.&lt;ref name="nyulawglobal.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="austlii.edu.au"/&gt;

===Access to justice===
Lawyers, designers, and computers scientists have considered ways to use technology to improve non-lawyers' access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;See CodeX Techindex. Stanford Law School, n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://techindex.law.stanford.edu/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Lawbots.info. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://www.lawbots.info/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (IIT's) Institute of Design and the [[Chicago–Kent College of Law|Chicago-Kent College of Law]] collaborated on a multi-year redesign of self-represented litigants' court experience. Their 2002 report documented their investigation of current assistance systems, creation of a new design protocol, and plan for a new system design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/Documents/Institutes%20and%20Centers/CAJT/access-to-justice-meeting-the-needs.pdf Charles L. Owen, Edward B. Pedwell, and Ronald W. Staudt, "Access to Justice: Meeting the Needs of Self-Represented Litigants", 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; The report also puts forward a number of concept designs, reimagining how the court system may work and people may access it. Some of their proposals include:
* "CourtNet", a network inside the court building, to link together judicial staff and the public;
* "Interactive Translator", a software tool that can be used in interviewing and court exchanges, able to translate verbal and text communications into different languages;
* "Archetypes", a diagnosis platform that models users' legal problems, classifies them, and offers referral services; 
* "Pursuit Evaluator", an online tool to allow potential litigants evaluate whether pursuing a case would be worth their time, money, and effort
* "Complaint Formulator", an electronic interface to let litigants extract data from their problem situation and assemble it into various legal documents;
* "Informer", software that uses sample cases to help litigants model their own forms and teaches them how to file correctly; and
* "Case Tracker", an interactive searchable archive of a litigant's case history, that provides a clear timeline and reference to past actions.

The [[Berkman Center]] at Harvard Law School has been working with Massachusetts housing court judge Dina Fein to design access to civil justice in the state for pro se litigants, low-income people, litigants who aren't proficient in English, and people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/6853|title=Technology and Access to Justice - Berkman Klein Center|author=|date=|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CodeX, the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics, hosts projects such as [[Legal.io]] and [[Ravel Law]], addressing the application of legal informatics to access to justice issues, and convenes a community bringing researchers, lawyers, entrepreneurs and technologists together to work side-by-side to advance the frontier of legal technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.stanford.edu/codex-the-stanford-center-for-legal-informatics/|title=CodeX {{!}} Stanford Law School|last=School|first=Stanford Law|website=Stanford Law School|access-date=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and policy==
Law and policy issues in legal informatics stem from the use of informational technologies in the implementation of law, such as the use of [[subpoenas]] for information found in email, search queries, and social networks. Policy approaches to legal informatics issues vary throughout the world; for example, European countries tend to require destruction or anonymization of data so that it cannot be used for discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dolin | first1 = Ron A | year = | title = Search Query Privacy: The Problem of Anonymization | url = | journal = Hastings Science &amp; Technology Law Journal | volume = 2010 | issue = | page = 137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital rights management and copyright law===
Copyright holders make use of [[digital rights management]] (DRM) technology to limit the use and distribution of digital content. In the United States, the [[anti-circumvention]] provision of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) criminalizes attempts to circumvent DRM, even in cases where the circumvention is merely to facilitate non-infringing uses of the content. Along with the anti-circumvention provision, DRM can override substantive rights, such as [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;"Restoring the Public Library Ethos: Copyright, E-Licensing, and the Future of Librarianship". William M. Cross. ''Law Library Journal'' Vol. 104:2 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal informatics in legal practice===
Within the practice issues conceptual area, progress continues to be made on both litigation and transaction focused technologies. In particular, technology including predictive coding has the potential to effect substantial efficiency gains in law practice. Though predictive coding has largely been applied in the litigation space, it is beginning to make inroads in transaction practice, where it is being used to improve document review in mergers and acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbar.org/about/communications/nc-lawyer/2012-nc-lawyer-editions/may-2012/predictivecoding.aspx|title=NC Lawyer by NC Bar Association - NC Bar Association's NC Lawyer|author=|date=|work=ncbar.org|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other advances, including XML coding in transaction contracts, and increasingly advanced document preparation systems demonstrate the importance of legal informatics in the transactional law space.&lt;ref&gt;Darryl Mountain, XML E-Contracts: Documents that Describe Themselves, 11(3) INT'L J.L. &amp; TECH. 274 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hunziker |first1=R |date=Feb 2017 |title=New Invention Disclosure Standard – Why Would I Care? |url=http://www.ipo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/New_Invention_Disclosure_Standard.pdf |journal=IPO Law Journal |publisher=[[Intellectual Property Owners Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial intelligence==

{{main|Applications of artificial intelligence to legal informatics}}

Artificial intelligence is already employed in  [[online dispute resolution]] platforms that use optimization algorithms and blind-bidding, and may be employed extensively in the future.&lt;ref&gt;David Allen Larson, "Brother, Can You Spare A Dime?" Technology Can Reduce Dispute Resolution Costs When Times Are Tough and Improve Outcomes, 11 Nev. L.J. 523, 550 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial intelligence is also frequently employed in modeling the legal [[ontology]], "an explicit, formal, and general specification of a conceptualization of properties of and relations between objects in a given domain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wyner | first1 = A. | year = | title = An Ontology in OWL for Legal Case-Based Reasoning | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence and Law | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 361–387 | doi=10.1007/s10506-008-9070-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantitative legal prediction==
Both academic and proprietary quantitative legal prediction models exist. One of the earliest examples of a working quantitative legal prediction model occurred in the form of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] forecasting project. The Supreme Court forecasting model attempted to predict the results of all the cases on the 2002 term of the Supreme Court. The model predicted 75% of cases correctly compared to experts who only predicted 59.1% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/4099370 Theodore W. Ruger, Pauline T. Kim, Andrew D. Martin, &amp; Kevin M. Quinn, "The Supreme Court Forecasting Project: Legal and Political Science Approaches to Predicting Supreme Court Decisionmaking" ''Columbia Law Review'' Volume 104 May 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
Another example of an academic quantitative legal prediction models is a 2012 model that predicted the result of Federal Securities class action lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01260.x | volume=9 | title=Predicting Securities Fraud Settlements and Amounts: A Hierarchical Bayesian Model of Federal Securities Class Action Lawsuits | year=2012 | journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies | pages=482–510 | last1 = McShane | first1 = Blakeley B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also there are legal technology startups that are attempting to create proprietary models to predict case outcomes; one example is Lex Machina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lexmachina.com/|title=Legal Analytics by Lex Machina|author=|date=|work=lexmachina.com|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a company that provides [[intellectual property]] data and analytics.

==Criminal law==
In 1995, Peter W. Martin's paper for the NCAIR Sponsored Program on the Future of Legal Information Technology, entitled "Digital Law: Some Speculations on the Future of Legal Information Technology", wondered how innovations in technology were shaping—and would shape—legal information flow, storage, and organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/papers/fut95fnl.htm|title=Digital Law|author=|date=|work=cornell.edu|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Martin was wondering how technology would change the fundamental nature and practice of the legal field in the United States. Martin wrote that "There is a powerful (but infrequently noticed) linkage between ways societies think about law and the technology they use in operation and distribution of it (law that is)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was writing shortly after launching the Legal Information Institute at Cornell, the first law server on the Internet. LEXIS had pioneered putting digital legal content on computers twenty-four years prior, and digital content then accounted for more than 50% of the legal information market.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Martin asked readers to suspend their disbelief as he proposed relatively rapid shifts in the ratio of paper-based legal information to digital legal information; the power wielded by the information-seeking public vs. high-priced gatekeepers of legal information; and a shift away from the private sector as a means to basic legal data and towards more higher-level skill sets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Martin suggested "fuller" bodies of data, pointing to a case in which the court thoroughly discussed a restaurant's trademark decor without ever showing a picture of the decor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Martin also highlights the Penalty Statistics Database in use in sentencing in New South Wales, and comparing it to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines of the United States.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The South Wales model, launched in 1990, allows judges access not only to both more traditional legal data, including statutory provisions and appellate decisions but also to the availability of alternate facilities (such as drug rehabilitation programs).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The "Penalty Statistics Database" furthermore gives judges access to a pre-analyzed data pool of sentencing decisions made by other sentencing officers in New South Wales, as well as full offense and offender information.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In this suggestion, too, Martin emphasizes the Penalty Statistics Database's use of graphical display to make the information it is transmitting to judges easier to access and utilize.

Treating legal informatics as a field as a serious tool for changing the way people interact with the law may pave the way for radical innovations in areas of law that are seen as inherently static, top-down, and bureaucratic.

==In corporate legal departments==
{{Original research|section|date=December 2016}}Today's corporate legal departments are entities which can be as large as the biggest law firms. As such, the usage of different legal informatics technologies is important for their success. Legal departments use among other: various technology aids to manage their document databases, and more advanced assets such as patent portfolios. Some legal departments are also experimenting with the automation of certain types of tasks performed by in-house attorneys in their day-to-day practice. These tasks include: preparation of documents, editing and customization of these documents and the management of signatures.

==Corporate governance==
The prevailing [[corporate governance]] [[paradigm]], especially when [[public company|public companies]] are concerned, is largely based on the notion of the relative [[efficiency]] of separating ownership and control in managing business [[corporation]]s.&lt;ref name="Bainbridge"&gt;''See'' Stephen M. Bainbridge, ''The Case for Limited Shareholder Voting Rights'', 53 UCLA L. Rev 601 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[technological change]] can affect the [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] of optimal governance structure for individual [[firm]]s. For instance, by lowering the cost of both disseminating [[information]] to [[shareholder]]s and gathering [[data]] about their [[preference]]s, developments in [[communication technology]] can potentially make it preferable for some firms to organize the [[management]] of the firm in a manner more similar to, for example, [[direct democracy]], with features such as [[two-way communication]] between the company's [[senior management]] and its [[investor]]s. The study of such questions thus applies legal informatics to analyzing the relationship between [[technology]] and [[corporate governance]] structures.

'''Legislation''' (or "[[statutory law]]") is law which has been [[promulgation|promulgated]] (or "[[enactment of a bill|enacted]]") by a [[legislature]] or other [[Government|governing body]] or the process of making it.&lt;ref&gt;See Article 289(3) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]&lt;/ref&gt; Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]], and may be broadly referred to as "legislation", while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business. Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to outlaw, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare or to restrict. It may be contrasted with a non-legislative act which is adopted by an [[Executive (government)|executive]] or administrative body under the authority of a legislative act or for implementing a legislative act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is the European Legislator after Lisbon a real Legislature?  |author=Wim Voermans |journal=Legislacao Cadernos de Ciencia de Legislacao |volume=50 |pages=391–413 [402] |date=December 2009  |quote=Within the category of legal acts provided for by the TFEU, a distinction is made between legislative acts and non-legislative acts. Legislative acts are decisions adopted under the ordinary or special legislative procedure (Article 289(3) of the TFEU) and non-legislative acts are decisions that are adopted pursuant to delegation or for the purpose of implementing a legislative act (Articles 35 See Article 288 of the TFEU, last 290 and 291 of the TFEU)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Westminster system]], an item of primary legislation is known as an [[Act of Parliament]] after enactment.

Legislation is usually proposed by a member of the legislature (e.g. a member of Congress or Parliament), or by the executive, whereupon it is debated by members of the legislature and is often amended before [[passage (legislature)|passage]]. Most large legislatures enact only a small fraction of the bills proposed in a given [[Session (parliamentary procedure)|session]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/two_column_table/Resumes.htm Senate.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a given bill will be proposed and is generally a matter of the legislative priorities of government.

Legislation is regarded as one of the three main functions of government, which are often distinguished under the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]]. Those who have the formal power to ''create'' legislation are known as [[legislator]]s; a [[judiciary|judicial branch]] of government will have the formal power to ''interpret'' legislation (see [[statutory interpretation]]); the [[executive branch]] of government can act only within the powers and limits set by the law.

== Latest revision ==
The function and procedures are primarily the responsibility of the legislature. However, there are situations where legislation is made by other bodies or means, such as when [[constitutional law]] or [[secondary legislation]] is enacted. Such other forms of law-making include [[referendum]]s, [[Order in Council|orders in council]] or [[regulations]]. The term ''legislation'' is sometimes used to include these situations, or the term ''[[primary legislation]]'' may be used to exclude these other forms.

==Dead letter==
{{Expand section|date=September 2016}}
The phrase "dead letter" refers to legislation that has not been revoked, but that has become inapplicable or obsolete or is no longer enforced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/dead-letter Dead Letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Polish Sejm 1622.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sejm session at the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw]], 1622]]
The '''''liberum veto''''' ([[Latin]] for "free veto") was a parliamentary device in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It was a form of unanimity voting rule that allowed any member of the [[Sejm]] (legislature) to force an immediate end to the current session and to nullify any legislation that had already been passed at the session by shouting, '''Sisto activitatem!''' (Latin: "I stop the activity!") or '''Nie pozwalam!''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: "I do not allow!"). The rule was in place from the mid-17th century to the late 18th century in the Sejm's parliamentary deliberations. It was based on the premise that since all Polish noblemen were equal, every measure that came before the Sejm had to be passed unanimously. The ''liberum veto'' was a key part of the political system of the Commonwealth, strengthening democratic elements and checking royal power and went against the European-wide trend of having a strong executive ([[absolute monarchy]]).

Many historians hold that the ''liberum veto'' was a major cause of the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system, particularly in the 18th century, when foreign powers bribed Sejm members to paralyze its proceedings, and the Commonwealth's eventual destruction in the [[partitions of Poland]] and foreign occupation, dominance and manipulation of Poland for the next 200 years or so. [[Piotr Stefan Wandycz]] wrote that the "''liberum veto'' had become the sinister symbol of old Polish anarchy". In the period of 1573–1763, about 150 sejms were held, about a third failing to pass any legislation, mostly because of the ''liberum veto''. The expression ''[[Polish parliament (expression)|Polish parliament]]'' in many European languages originated from the apparent paralysis.

==Origin==
The rule evolved from the principle of unanimous consent, which derived from the traditions of decision-making in the Kingdom of Poland, and it developed under the federative character of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="bardach220-221"/&gt; Each deputy to a Sejm was elected at a [[sejmik]] (the local ''sejm'' for a region) and represented the entire region. He thus assumed responsibility to his sejmik for all decisions taken at the Sejm.&lt;ref name="bardach220-221"/&gt; Since all noblemen were considered equal, a decision taken by a majority against the will of a minority (even if only one sejmik) was considered a violation of the principle of political equality.&lt;ref name="bardach220-221"/&gt;

At first, the dissenting deputies were often convinced or cowed back to withdraw their objections.&lt;ref name="bardach220-221"/&gt; Also, at first, the rule was used to strike down only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and throw out all measures passed.&lt;ref name="Czaplinski-29"/&gt; For example, as historian [[Władysław Czapliński]] describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed.&lt;ref name=Czaplinski-29/&gt; From the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.&lt;ref name="bardach223"/&gt;

It is commonly and erroneously, believed that a Sejm was first disrupted by the ''liberum veto'' by a [[Trakai]] deputy, [[Władysław Siciński]], in 1652.&lt;ref name="Jasienica"/&gt; In reality, he vetoed only the continuation of the Sejm's deliberations beyond the statutory time limit.&lt;ref name="bardach223"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carsten1961"/&gt; He had, however, set up a dangerous precedent.&lt;ref name="Carsten1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-117-119"/&gt; Over the proceedings of the next few sejms, the veto was still occasionally overruled, but it became gradually more accepted.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-117-119"/&gt; Before 20 years had passed, in 1669 in [[Kraków]], the entire Sejm was prematurely disrupted on the strength of the ''liberum veto'' before it had finished its deliberations&lt;ref name="bardach223"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carsten1961"/&gt; by the [[Kiev]] deputy, [[Adam Olizar]].&lt;ref name="Korzon1898"/&gt; The practice spiraled out of control, and in 1688, the Sejm was dissolved even before the proceedings had begun or the [[Marshal of the Sejm]] was elected.&lt;ref name="bardach223"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carsten1961"/&gt;

==Zenith==
During the reign of [[John III Sobieski]] (1674–1696), half of Sejm proceedings were scuttled by the veto.&lt;ref name="Carsten1961"/&gt; The practice also spread from the national Sejm to local sejmik proceedings.&lt;ref name="Carsten1961"/&gt; In the first half of the 18th century, it became increasingly common for Sejm sessions to be broken up by the ''liberum veto'', as the Commonwealth's neighbours, chiefly [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Prussia]], found it to be a useful tool to frustrate attempts at reforming and strengthening the Commonwealth. By bribing deputies to exercise their vetoes, Poland's neighbours could derail any measures not to their liking.&lt;ref name="bardach223"/&gt; The Commonwealth deteriorated from a European power into a state of anarchy.&lt;ref name="obywatelskiego"/&gt; Only a few Sejms were able to meet during the reign of the [[House of Saxony]] in Poland (1696–1763), the last one in 1736.&lt;ref name="bardach223"/&gt; Only 8 out of the 18 Sejm sessions during the reign of Augustus II (1697–1733) passed legislation.&lt;ref name="Wandycz2001-103-104"/&gt; For a period of 30 years around the reign of Augustus III, only one session was able to pass legislation (1734–1763).&lt;ref name="Davies1998"/&gt; The government was near collapse, giving rise to the term "Polish anarchy", and the country was managed by provincial assemblies and magnates.&lt;ref name="Davies1998"/&gt;

Disruption of the Commonwealth governance caused by the liberum veto was highly significant. From 1573 to 1763, about 150 Sejms where held, of which 53 failed to pass any legislation.&lt;ref name="bardach223"/&gt; Historian [[Jacek Jędruch]] notes that out of the 53 disrupted Sejms, 32 were disrupted by the ''liberum veto''.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-128"/&gt;

==Final years==
The 18th century saw an institution known as a "[[confederated sejm]]" evolve.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; It was a parliament session that operated under the rules of a confederation.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; Its primary purpose was to avoid disruption by the ''liberum veto'', unlike the national Sejm, which was being paralyzed by the veto.&lt;ref name=bardach/&gt; On some occasions, a confederated sejm was formed of the whole membership of the national Sejm so that the ''liberum veto'' would not operate.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-136-138"/&gt;

The second half of the 18th century, marking the age of the [[Enlightenment in Poland]], also witnessed an increased trend aiming at the reform of the inefficient governance of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="bardach284-287"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bardach289"/&gt; Reforms of 1764–1766 improved the proceedings of the Sejm.&lt;ref name="bardach293-294"/&gt; Majority voting for non-crucial items, including most economic and tax matters, was introduced, with binding instructions from sejmiks being outlawed.&lt;ref name="bardach293-294"/&gt; The road to reform was not easy, as conservatives, supported by foreign powers, opposed most of the changes and attempted to defend the ''liberum veto'' and other elements perpetuating the inefficient governance, most notably by the [[Cardinal Laws]] of 1768.&lt;ref name="bardach297-298"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2005-391"/&gt;

The ''liberum veto'' was finally abolished by the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], adopted by a confederated sejm, which permanently established the principle of majority rule.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt; The achievements of that constitution, however, which historian [[Norman Davies]] called "the first constitution of its kind in Europe",&lt;ref name="Europe: A History"/&gt; were undone by another confederated sejm, meeting at [[Grodno]] in 1793. That Sejm, under duress from Russia and Prussia, ratified the [[Second Partition of Poland]], anticipating the [[Third Partition of Poland]], the final disappearance of the Polish-Lithuanian state just two years later.&lt;ref name="Davies2005-405"/&gt;

==Significance==
Harvard political scientist [[Grzegorz Ekiert]], assessing the history of the ''liberum veto'' in Poland, concludes:
: The principle of the liberum veto preserved the feudal features of Poland's political system, weakened the role of the monarchy, led to anarchy in political life, and contributed to the economic and political decline of the Polish state. Such a situation made the country vulnerable to foreign invasions and ultimately led to its collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Grzegorz Ekiert, “Veto, Liberum,” in  Seymour Martin Lipset, ed. ‘’The Encyclopedia of Democracy’’ (1998) 4:1341&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist [[Dalibor Roháč]] noted that the "principle of ''liberum veto'' played an important role in [the] emergence of the unique Polish form of [[constitutionalism]]" and acted as a significant constraint on the powers of the monarch by making the "rule of law, religious tolerance and limited constitutional government... the norm in Poland in times when the rest of Europe was being devastated by religious hatred and despotism."&lt;ref name="Rohac2008"/&gt; It was seen as one of the key principles of the Commonwealth political system and culture, the [[Golden Liberty]].&lt;ref name="bardach248-249"/&gt;

At the same time, historians hold that the principle of ''liberum veto'' was a major cause of the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system and Commonwealth's eventual downfall.&lt;ref name=Jasienica/&gt; Deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powers, or simply content to believe they were living in some kind of "Golden Age", for over a century paralysed the Commonwealth's government, stemming any attempts at reform.&lt;ref name="BullittSempa2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AdamsCarey2000"/&gt; [[Piotr Stefan Wandycz]] wrote that the "''liberum veto'' had become the sinister symbol of old Polish anarchy."&lt;ref name="Wandycz1980"/&gt; Wagner echoed him thus: "Certainly, there was no other institution of old Poland which has been more sharply criticized in more recent times than this one.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=W.J.|title=May 3, 1791, and the Polish constitutional tradition|journal=The Polish Review|date=1992|volume=36|issue=4|pages=383–395|jstor=25778591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern parallels and popular culture==
A 2004 Polish [[collectible card game]], ''[[Veto (game)|Veto]]'', set in the background of a [[royal election in Poland|royal election]] during an [[general sejm|election sejm]], is named after this procedure.&lt;ref name="boardgamegeek"/&gt;

Until the early 1990s, [[IBM]] had a decision-making process called "non-concur" in which any department head could veto a company-wide strategy if it did not fit in with his department's outlook. That effectively turned IBM into several independent [[fiefdom]]s. "Non-concur" was eliminated by CEO [[Louis Gerstner]], who was brought in to revive the declining company.&lt;ref name="An executive dressing down"/&gt;

== Current methods ==
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! '''Method''' !! Description
|-
| align="center" | [[Hanging]]||One of the most common methods of execution, still in use in many countries, usually with a calculated drop to cause neck fracture and instant loss of consciousness. Notably used by [[Capital punishment in India|India]], [[Capital punishment in Japan|Japan]], and [[Capital punishment in Singapore|Singapore]].
|-
| align="center" | [[Execution_by_shooting|Shooting]]|| Also a very common method. Can be applied:

* By a [[execution by shooting|single shot]] (such as the neck shot, as in [[Capital punishment in China|China]], and by various means in [[Capital_punishment_in_Russia#Procedure|Russia]] before Russia abolished capital punishment);
* By [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] (as in [[Capital punishment in Indonesia|Indonesia]]). 
* By excessively powerful weaponry such as anti-aircraft guns, according to various media sources (CNN, Fox News, The Independent, etc.), practiced in North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/22/north-korea-dictator-kim-jong-uns-executions-anti-aircraft-guns-flamethrowers-mortars.html|title=North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un's executions: anti-aircraft guns, flamethrowers, mortars|author=|date=22 September 2017|website=foxnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korea-defector-anti-aircraft-guns-execution-kim-jong-un-killed-sex-slaves-pyongyang-porn-film-a7959851.html|title=North Korean defector reveals horror of Kim Jong-un's teenage sex slaves|author=|date=21 September 2017|website=independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/28/asia/north-korea-officials-executed/index.html|title=N.

|-
| align="center" | [[Lethal injection]]|| First used in the [[Capital punishment in the United States|United States]] in 1982, lethal injection has been used by five other countries since then, which are China, Taiwan, Thailand, Guatemala, and Vietnam.
|-
| align="center" | [[Electric chair|Electrocution]]|| Only the United States and the [[Capital punishment in the Philippines|Philippines]] have ever used this method. Now legal in some U.S. states only to replace injection at the request of the prisoner or if injection is impractical.
|-
| align="center" | [[Gas chamber|Gas inhalation]]||Only the United States and [[Capital punishment in Lithuania|Lithuania]] have ever used this as a capital punishment method. Now legal in some U.S. states only to replace injection at the request of the prisoner or if injection is impractical. Also used in Nazi Germany during World War 2 as a weapon for [[The Holocaust|mass murder]]. It has been recently proposed to use [[nitrogen hypoxia]] to replace injection.
|-
| align="center" | [[Beheading]]|| Has been used at various points in history in many countries. One of the most famous forms is execution by [[guillotine]]. Now used only in [[Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] with a sword.
|-
| align="center" | [[Stoning]]|| The condemned is pummeled by stones thrown by a group of people with the totality of the injuries suffered leading to eventual death.
|-
| align="center" | [[Crucifixion]]|| Roping or nailing to a wooden cross or similar apparatus (such as a tree) and allowing to perish.{{Where|date= November 2018|talk=yes}}

|-
! '''Method''' !! Description
|-
| align="center" | [[Animal]]s ||
* [[Execution by elephant|Crushing by elephant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2007/05/29/this-wont-hurt-a-bit-a-painlessly-short-and-incomplete-evolution-of-execution/|title=This Won't Hurt a Bit: A Painlessly Short (and Incomplete) Evolution of Execution.|author=|date=|website=neatorama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Devouring by animals, as in ''[[damnatio ad bestias]]'' (i.e., as in the [[cliché]], "being thrown to the lions"), as well as by [[alligator]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[piranha]] and [[shark]]s.
* Stings from scorpions and bites by snakes, spiders, etc. (e.g. the "[[Snake pit]]" of Germanic legend){{Dubious|date=September 2012}}&lt;!--We should have at least one non-legendary account in which a person is *sentenced to death* by venomous bite. Otherwise this entry ought to be removed, and sooner than in two years from now.--&gt;
* Tearing apart by horses (''e.g.'', in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe and [[History of China#Imperial era|Imperial China]], with four horses; or "[[Hanged, drawn and quartered|quartering]]", with four horses, as in ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' and ''[[Child Owlet]]'').
* Trampling by horses (example: [[Al-Musta'sim]], the last [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] in [[Baghdad]]).
|-
| align="center" | Back-breaking || A [[Mongolia]]n method of execution that avoided the spilling of blood on the ground&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nFx3OlrBMpQC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Back+broken+mongol|title=The History of the Mongol Conquests|first=J. J.|last=Saunders|date=1 March 2001|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|via=Google Books|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; (example: the Mongolian leader [[Jamukha]] was probably executed this way in 1206).&lt;ref&gt;''The Secret History of the Mongols'', book 8, chapter 201.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| align="center" | [[Blowing from a gun]]||Tied to the mouth of a cannon, which is then fired.
|-
| align="center" | [[Blood Eagle]]||Cutting the skin of the victim by the spine, breaking the ribs so they resembled blood-stained wings, and pulling the lungs out through the wounds in the victim's back. Used by the [[Vikings]].
|-
| align="center" | [[Boiling to death]]||This penalty was carried out using a large cauldron filled with water, oil, tar, tallow, or even molten lead.
|-
| align="center" | [[Brazen bull]]||Pushed inside an iron bull statue and then cooked alive after a fire is lit under it.
|-
| align="center" | [[Breaking wheel]]||Also known as the Catherine wheel, after a [[Saint Catherine of Alexandria|saint]] who was allegedly sentenced to be executed by this method.
|-
| align="center" | [[Premature burial|Buried alive]]||Traditional [[punishment]] for [[Vestal virgins]] who had broken their vows.
|-
| align="center" | [[Execution by burning|Burning]]||Most infamous as a method of execution for [[Heresy|heretics]] and [[Witchcraft|witches]]. A slower method of applying single pieces of burning wood was used by [[Indigenous peoples of North America|Native Americans]] in torturing their captives to death.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Drimmer (ed.) ''"Captured by the Indians - 15 Firsthand Accounts, 1750-1870"'', Dover Publications, Mineola, N.Y., 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| align="center" | [[Crushing (execution)|Crushing]]|| By a weight, abruptly or as a slow ordeal.
|-
| align="center" | [[Disembowelment]]||Often employed as a preliminary stage to the actual execution, e.g. by beheading; an integral part of ''[[seppuku]]'' (''harakiri''), which was sometimes used as a form of capital punishment.
|-
| align="center" | [[Dismemberment]]|| Being [[drawn and quartered]] sometimes resulted in dismemberment.  Note: has been used in combination, such as [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]
|-
| align="center" | [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|Drawing and quartering]]||English method of executing those found guilty of [[high treason]].
|-
| align="center" | [[Falling (execution)|Falling]]||The victim is thrown off a height or into a hollow (example: the ''Barathron'' in Athens, into which the Athenian generals condemned for their part in the [[battle of Arginusae]] were cast).&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''"Hellenica"'', book I, chapter VII.&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina during the [[Dirty War]], those [[forced disappearance|secretly abducted]] were later drugged and [[Death flights|thrown from an airplane into the ocean]].
|-
| align="center" | [[Flaying]]||The skin is removed from the body.
|-
| align="center" | [[Garrote]]||Used most commonly in [[Spain]] and in former Spanish colonies (e.g. the [[Philippines]]), used to strangle or choke someone.
|-
| align="center" | [[Gibbeting]]||The act of gibbeting refers to the use of a gallows-type structure from which the victim was usually placed within a cage which is then hung in a public location and the victim left to die to deter other existing or potential criminals.
|-
| align="center" | [[Immurement]]||The confinement of a person by walling off any exits; since they were usually kept alive through an opening, this was more a form of [[imprisonment for life]] than of capital punishment (example: the countess [[Elisabeth Báthory]], who lived for four more years after having been immured).
|-
| align="center" | [[Impalement]]||The penetration of a human by an object such as a stake, pole, spear, or hook, often by complete or partial perforation of the torso.
|-
|align="center" | [[Keelhauling]]||European maritime punishment.
|-
| align="center" | [[Poena cullei]]||Documented used during the Roman empire. The condemned is stuffed into a sack together with a number of animals and thrown into a body of water.
|-
| align="center" | [[Poisoning]] || Before modern times, sayak (사약, 賜藥) was the method of capital punishment of nobles (''[[yangban]]'') and members of the royal family during the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in [[Korea]] due to the [[Confucianist]] belief that one may kill a [[seonbi]] but may not insult him (사가살불가욕, 士可殺不可辱). Poisoning by drinking an infusion of [[Conium maculatum|hemlock]] was used as a method of execution in ancient Greece.
|-
| align="center" | [[Pendulum (torture device)|Pendulum]]&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Melville (1905), "The Use and Forms of Judicial Torture in England and Scotland," ''The Scottish Historical Review'', vol. 2, p. 228; Geoffrey Abbott (2006) ''Execution: the guillotine, the Pendulum, the Thousand Cuts, the Spanish Donkey, and 66 Other Ways of Putting Someone to Death'', MacMillan, {{ISBN|0-312-35222-0}}, p. 213.  Both of these refer to the use of the pendulum (''pendola'')by inquisitorial tribunals.  Melville, however, refers only to its use as a torture method, while Abbott suggests that the device was purposely allowed to kill the victim if he refused to confess.&lt;/ref&gt; || A type of machine with an axe head for a weight that slices closer to the victim's torso over time. (''Of disputed historicity.'')
|-
| align="center" | [[Sawing (torture)|Sawing]]||(''Of disputed historicity.'')
|-
| align="center" | [[Scaphism]]|| An Ancient [[Persian Empire|Persian]] method of execution in which the condemned was placed in between two boats, force fed a mixture of honey and milk, and left floating in a stagnant pond. The victim would then suffer from severe diarrhea, which would attract insects that would burrow, nest, and feed on the victim. The victim would eventually die from [[septic shock]].  
|-
| align="center" | [[Slow slicing]]||Methodically removing portions of the body over an extended period of time, typically with a knife, eventually resulting in death.
|-
| align="center" | [[Asphyxia#Smothering|Smothering (Asphyxia)]]|| [[Suffocation in ash]]

This is a list of official [[minimum wage]] rates of the 193 [[United Nations member states]] and former members of the [[United Nations]], and also includes the following territories and states with limited recognition: [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Northern Cyprus]], [[Kosovo]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and other independent countries. Some countries may have a very complicated minimum wage system; for example, India has more than 1202 minimum wage rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paycheck.in/main/salary/minimumwages |title=Minimum Wage in India 2013 |publisher=PayCheck.in |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Methodology ==
The minimum wages listed refer to a [[gross income|gross]] amount, that is before [[tax deduction|deduction of taxes]] and [[social security]] contributions, which vary from one country to another. Also excluded from calculations are regulated paid days off, including public holidays, sick pay, annual leave and [[social insurance]] contributions paid by the employer.

For the sake of comparison, an annual wage column is provided in [[Geary–Khamis dollar|international dollars]], a hypothetical unit of [[currency]] calculated based on the [[purchasing power parity]] of [[household final consumption expenditure]]. For calculating the annual wage, the lowest general minimum wage was used.

'''''Monitor Polski''''' ({{lang-en|Official Gazette of the Republic of Poland}}, abbreviated '''M. P.''' or '''MP''') is a publication of the [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland]]. It publishes legal acts in [[Polish law]] that are not a source of new laws, and various public decisions that are required to be made public. Unlike [[Dziennik Ustaw]], acts published in Monitor are not a source of laws or obligations on the part of Polish citizens.

There is also 'Monitor Polski B' which publishes financial statements of the Republic of [[Poland]].

Ouster clauses seek to exclude courts from reviewing actions and decisions of the [[executive (government)|executive branch of government]].]]
{{Administrative law}}

An '''ouster clause''' or '''privative clause''' is, in countries with [[common law]] legal systems, a clause or provision included in a piece of [[legislation]] by a [[legislature|legislative body]] to exclude [[judicial review]] of acts and decisions of the [[executive (government)|executive]] by stripping the courts of their supervisory judicial function. According to the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]], one of the important functions of the [[judiciary]] is to keep the executive in check by ensuring that its acts comply with the law, including, where applicable, the [[constitution]]. Ouster clauses prevent courts from carrying out this function, but may be justified on the ground that they preserve the powers of the executive and promote the finality of its acts and decisions.

Ouster clauses may be divided into two species&amp;nbsp;– total ouster clauses and partial ouster clauses. In the United Kingdom, the effectiveness of total ouster clauses is fairly limited. In the case of ''[[Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission|Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Committee]]'' (1968), the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that ouster clauses cannot prevent the courts from examining an executive decision that, due to an error of law, is a nullity. Subsequent cases held that ''Anisminic'' had abolished the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law. Thus, although prior to ''Anisminic'' an ouster clause was effective in preventing judicial review where only a non-jurisdictional error of law was involved, following that case ouster clauses do not prevent courts from dealing with both jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law, except in a number of limited situations.

The [[High Court of Australia]] has held that the [[Constitution of Australia]] restricts the ability of legislatures to insulate administrative tribunals from judicial review using privative clauses. Similarly, in India ouster clauses are almost always ineffective because judicial review is regarded as part of the [[basic structure doctrine|basic structure]] of the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] that cannot be excluded. The position in Singapore is unclear. Two cases decided after ''Anisminic'' have maintained the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law, and it is not yet known whether the courts will eventually adopt the legal position in the United Kingdom. The [[Chief Justice of Singapore]], [[Chan Sek Keong]], suggested in a 2010 lecture that ouster clauses may be inconsistent with Article 93 of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]], which vests judicial power in the courts, and may thus be void. However, he emphasized that he was not expressing a concluded view on the matter.

In contrast with total ouster clauses, courts in the United Kingdom have affirmed the validity of partial ouster clauses that specify a time period after which aggrieved persons can no longer apply to court for a remedy.

==Background==
[[File:Red and green traffic signals, Stamford Road, Singapore - 20111210.jpg|thumb|upright|Traffic signals along [[Stamford Road]], Singapore. The effectiveness of an ouster clause may depend on whether a particular jurisdiction adopts the red-light or green-light theory of [[administrative law]].]]

According to the [[A. V. Dicey|Diceyan]] model of [[separation of powers]], the executive of a state governs according to a framework of general rules in society established by the legislature, and the judiciary ensures that the executive acts within the confines of these rules through [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name="Leyland 5"&gt;{{citation|author=Peter Leyland|author2=Gordon Anthony|chapter=Introduction, Theory and History|title=Textbook on Administrative Law|edition=6th|location=Oxford; New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|pages=1–16 at 5|isbn=978-0-19-921776-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, under both [[constitutional law|constitutional]] and [[administrative law]], the courts possess supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power. When carrying out [[judicial review#Judicial review of administrative acts|judicial review of administrative action]], the court scrutinizes the legality and not the substantive merits of an act or decision made by a public authority under the three broad headings of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service|link=Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service|court=UKHL|year=1983|num=6|parallelcite=[1985] A.C. 374 at 410|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In jurisdictions which have a written constitution, the courts also [[judicial review#Judicial review of primary legislation|assess the constitutionality of legislation]], executive actions and governmental policy. Therefore, part of the role of the judiciary is to ensure that public authorities act lawfully and to serve as a check and balance on the government's power. However, the legislature may attempt to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts by the inclusion of ouster clauses in the statutes empowering public authorities to act and make decisions. These ouster clauses may be total or partial.&lt;ref name="Leyland 392"&gt;{{citation|author=Peter Leyland|author2=Gordon Anthony|chapter=Express and Implied Limits on Judicial Review: Ouster and Time Limit Clauses, the Prerogative Power, Public Interest Immunity|url=http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/extracts/9780199217762_leyland.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GVZ0nNUg|archivedate=10 May 2013|title=Textbook on Administrative Law|edition=6th|location=Oxford; New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|pages=392–437 at 392|isbn=978-0-19-921776-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are some examples of ouster clauses:
*'''Singapore'''. Section 47 of the Industrial Relations Act:&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Industrial Relations Act|cap=136|ed=2004}} (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; "(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, an award shall be final and conclusive. (2) No award or decision or order of a Court or the President or a referee shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in question in any court and shall not be subject to any Quashing Order, Prohibiting Order, Mandatory Order or injunction in any court on any account."
*'''United Kingdom'''. Section 4(4) of the Foreign Compensation Act:&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Compensation Act 1950 ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/14/12/contents 1950 c. 12], UK). Section 4(4) has since been [[repeal]]ed.&lt;/ref&gt; "The determination by the Commission of any application made to them under this Act shall not be called into question in any court of law."

If an ouster clause achieves its desired effect in preventing the courts from exercising judicial review, it will serve as a clear signal to the decision-maker that it may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage.&lt;ref name="Leyland 392"/&gt; However, ouster clauses have traditionally been viewed with suspicion by the courts.&lt;ref name="Gilmore"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Medical Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Gilmore|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1957|num=1|parallelcite=[1957] 1 Q.B. 574|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 19th-century ''[[laissez-faire]]'' theory championed by [[A. V. Dicey]], which [[Carol Harlow]] and Richard Rawlings termed as the "red-light approach" in their 1984 book ''Law and Administration'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Carol Harlow|author2=Richard Rawlings|title=Law and Administration|location=London|publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0-297-78239-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; there should be a deep-rooted suspicion of governmental power and a desire to minimize the encroachment of the state on the rights of the individuals.&lt;ref name="Leyland 5"/&gt; Therefore, the executive, which is envisaged as capable of arbitrary encroachment on the rights of individual citizens, is subjected to political control by Parliament and to legal control by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Harlow &amp; Rawlings, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other end of the spectrum, there is the green-light approach derived from the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] school of thought associated with legal philosophers such as [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. The green-light approach regards state involvement as an effective means to facilitate the delivery of communitarian goals.&lt;ref&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, "Introduction, Theory and History", p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, ouster clauses are regarded as useful devices to keep a conservatively inclined judiciary at bay. One such communitarian goal achieved by ouster clauses is that it results in consistency and finality in the implementation of policy considerations by encouraging specialist bodies to act as adjudicators in certain areas of administration.&lt;ref name="Leyland 393"&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, "Express and Implied Limits on Judicial Review", p.&amp;nbsp;393.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Total ouster clauses==
===In the United Kingdom===
Total ouster clauses, also known as finality clauses, seek to completely exclude the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts. In the United Kingdom, before the seminal decision of ''[[Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission|Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission]]'' (1968),&lt;ref name="Anisminic"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Committee|link=Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission|court=UKHL|year=1968|num=6|parallelcite=[1969] 2 A.C. 147|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the law drew a distinction between situations where the public body was acting within the powers conferred on it by law but committed an error of law (a "non-jurisdictional error of law"), and situations where the commission of the error of law meant that the public body did not in fact have power to act (a "jurisdictional error of law"). In the former situation, a total ouster clause precluded the courts from exercising their supervisory function and issuing any [[prerogative writ|prerogative orders]] to quash the erroneous action. The courts could only step in if the error of law affected the jurisdiction of the public body to act, for example, if the public body erroneously interpreted the scope of the powers conferred upon it, and thus made a decision which it had no power to make.&lt;ref name="Leyland 393"/&gt;

In ''R. v. Medical Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Gilmore'' (1957),&lt;ref name="Gilmore"/&gt; the legality of the total ouster clause in section 36(3) of the [[National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946]]&lt;ref&gt;[[National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946]] (9 &amp; 10 Geo. VI, c. 62, UK).&lt;/ref&gt; was doubted by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]], which issued a ''[[certiorari]]'' against the Medical Appeal Tribunal for an error of law on the face of the record. [[Lord Justice of Appeal]] [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Alfred Denning]] stated that the words "any decision of a claim or question ... shall be final" only excluded an appeal but not judicial review:&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Gilmore'', p. 583.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I find it very well settled that the remedy by ''certiorari'' is never to be taken away by any statute except by the most clear and explicit words. The word "final" is not enough. That only means "without appeal." It does not mean "without recourse to ''certiorari''." It makes the decision final on the facts, but not final on the law. Notwithstanding that the decision is by a statute made "final," ''certiorari'' can still issue for excess of jurisdiction or for error of law on the face of the record.}}

In ''Anisminic'', the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] effectively held that any error of law made by a public body will render its decision a nullity, and an ouster clause does not oust the courts' jurisdiction in judicial review unless it clearly states so.&lt;ref&gt;''Anisminic'', p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[list of tribunals in the United Kingdom#Foreign Compensation Commission|Foreign Compensation Commission]] had misinterpreted certain [[delegated legislation|subsidiary legislation]], with the effect that almost all claims for foreign compensation would be defeated. Their Lordships held that this misconstruction of the legislation rendered the decision ''[[ultra vires]]'', and since the Parliament could not have intended for the ouster clause to protect an ''ultra vires'' determination, judicial review was not precluded. Though ''Anisminic'' did not expressly abolish the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law, in ''R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page'' (1992)&lt;ref name=Page&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page|court=UKHL|year=1992|num=12|parallelcite=[1993] A.C. 682|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords noted that:&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Page'', p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[T]he decision in [''Anisminic''] rendered obsolete the distinction between errors of law on the face of the record and other errors of law by extending the doctrine of ''ultra vires''. Thenceforward it was to be taken that Parliament had only conferred the decision-making power on the basis that it was to be exercised on the correct legal basis: a misdirection in law in making the decision therefore rendered the decision ultra vires.}}

Thus, in [[English law]] all errors of law are now to be considered as jurisdictional and ''ultra vires'' in a broad sense of the term. This implies that ouster clauses should not be effective against any error of law. The ''Anisminic'' principle was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] in ''R. (on the application of Cart) v. Upper Tribunal'' (2011)&lt;ref name=Cart&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. (on the application of Cart) v. Upper Tribunal|court=UKSC|year=2011|num=28|parallelcite=[2012] 1 A.C. 663|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so that the [[rule of law]] is promoted, among other reasons. Since it is practically immaterial to the victim of an error of law whether it is a jurisdictional error or otherwise, it would be manifestly unjust if judicial review was precluded when a non-jurisdictional error was egregious and obvious, but allowed for a small jurisdictional error.&lt;ref&gt;''Cart'', p. 142, para. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exceptions====
Though the scope of judicial review has been expanded considerably following ''Anisminic'', there are still a number of exceptions where total ouster clauses preclude courts from exercising their supervisory function in a judicial review.

=====Courts of law=====
The ''Anisminic'' principle applies only to public bodies exercising executive functions, over which the courts can exercise their supervisory role and have the power to decide [[question of law|questions of law]]. However, superior courts do not have any supervisory function in relation to inferior courts of law, because Parliament is deemed to have intended that such courts are to be final arbiters of questions of law. Whether the decision of a court of law is final and not subject to judicial review depends on a construction of the statute defining the jurisdiction and powers of the court. In ''Re Racal Communications Ltd.'' (1980),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Re Racal Communications Ltd.|court=UKHL|year=1980|num=5|parallelcite=[1981] A.C. 374|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] noted that if a statute provides that the court's decision should be final and conclusive, the "subtle distinctions formerly drawn between errors of law which go to jurisdiction and errors of law which do not" survive. Hence, any non-jurisdictional errors of law made by a court can be only corrected by appeal if the statute provides for it.&lt;ref&gt;''Racal'', pp. 382–383.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Internal regulations=====
It was held in ''ex parte Page''&lt;ref name="Page"/&gt; that if a decision-maker is applying some "domestic law" or internal regulations instead of a general law of the land, then an ouster clause is effective in excluding judicial review unless the decision-maker acts outside his or her jurisdiction (that is, he or she has no power to enter into the adjudication of the dispute), abuses power, or acts in breach of [[natural justice]]. In the case, the House of Lords held that a university [[visitor]] (overseer) appointed by the founder of a charitable institution to regulate its internal affairs has exclusive jurisdiction to decide disputes arising under the domestic law of the university that has been laid down by the founder in the constitutive documents establishing the university.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Page'', p. 702.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Comprehensive tribunal system to correct errors of law=====
[[File:Field House, London, UK - 20130627-06.JPG|thumb|Field House at 15 Bream's Buildings, London, where the [[Upper Tribunal]] is based. In a 2011 judgment, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]] held that not all decisions of the Upper Tribunal are subject to judicial review.]]

Another exception can be found in the ''Cart''&lt;ref name=Cart/&gt; judgment. [[John Dyson, Lord Dyson|Lord Dyson]] emphasized that "the scope of judicial review should be no more (as well as no less) than is proportionate and necessary for the maintaining of the rule of law".&lt;ref&gt;''Cart'', p. 145, para. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; On the facts of the case, he found it was neither proportionate nor necessary for the maintenance of the rule of law to require unrestricted judicial review. By enacting the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]] ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/15/contents 2007 c. 15], UK).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] had rationalized the system of administrative tribunals and had created the [[Upper Tribunal]] to hear appeals from lower tribunals, thus avoiding the ordinary courts from being overwhelmed by judicial review applications. As the system of tribunals provided ample opportunity for the correction of errors of law, this substantive policy reason precluded the need for all decisions of the Upper Tribunal to be subject to judicial review. Thus, judicial review would only be permitted from an Upper Tribunal decision if it would "raise some important point of principle or practice" or there was "some other compelling reason".&lt;ref&gt;''Cart'', pp. 145–148, paras. 123–133 (the quoted phrases are from p. 147, para. 129).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other jurisdictions===
As the United Kingdom does not have a written [[constitution]] and observes the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty|parliamentary supremacy]], the courts there could not render an ouster clause ineffective due to inconsistency with a constitutional provision, but instead excluded its application in some cases under the [[common law]] doctrine of the rule of law. However, in jurisdictions with a written constitution and hence constitutional supremacy, the courts can exclude the application of ouster clauses by pronouncing that the provision is unconstitutional and thus null and void.

====Australia====
The [[High Court of Australia]] has shown resistance to privative clauses, holding that the ability of legislatures to insulate administrative tribunals from judicial review by means of such clauses is restricted by the [[Constitution of Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Richard Walter Pty. Ltd.|court=HCA|year=1995|num=23|parallelcite=(1995) 183 C.L.R. 168 at 194|courtname=auto}}; {{cite AustLII|litigants=Re Refugee Review Tribunal, ex parte Aala|court=HCA|year=2000|num=57|parallelcite=(2000) 204 C.L.R. 82|courtname=H.C.|juris=Australia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly section&amp;nbsp;75(v) which states: "In all matters&amp;nbsp;... in which a writ of [[Mandamus]] or [[writ of prohibition|prohibition]] or an [[injunction]] is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth&amp;nbsp;... the High Court shall have [[original jurisdiction]]." There is a further presumption in construing privative clauses that Parliament did not intend to limit access to the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Hockey. v. Yellend|court=HCA|year=1984|num=72|parallelcite=(1984) 157 C.L.R. 124|courtname=H.C.|juris=Australia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the High Court decision ''R. v. Hickman, ex parte Fox'' (1945),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=R. v. Hickman, ex parte Fox|court=HCA|year=1945|num=53|parallelcite=(1945) 70 C.L.R. 598|courtname=H.C.|juris=Australia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Owen Dixon]] said:&lt;ref name="Fox 615"&gt;''Ex parte Fox'', p. 615.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|They [privative clauses] are not interpreted as meaning to set at large the courts or other judicial bodies to whose decision they relate. Such a clause is interpreted as meaning that no decision which is in fact given by the body concerned shall be invalidated on the ground that it has not conformed to the requirements governing its proceedings or the exercise of its authority or has not confined its acts within the limits laid down by the instrument giving it authority, provided always that its decision is a bona fide attempt to exercise its power, that it relates to the subject matter of the legislation, and that it is reasonably capable of reference to the power given to the body.}}

Thus, a privative clause does not prevent the High Court from exercising judicial review if an authority has failed to exercise power in a ''bona fide'' manner, or if the action taken or decision made is irrelevant to the subject manner of the legislation or does not come within the power conferred on the authority.&lt;ref name="Fox 615"/&gt; While a statutory clause will be inconsistent with section&amp;nbsp;75(v) if it purports to prevent the Court from determining whether a Commonwealth officer has engaged "in unlawful or unauthorized conduct" or acted "on the basis that an invalid decision is valid and enforceable",&lt;ref name="Richard Walter 6"&gt;''Richard Walter Pty. Ltd.'', para.&amp;nbsp;6 (Justices [[William Deane]] and [[Mary Gaudron]]).&lt;/ref&gt; a clause will not be unconstitutional if it has the effect of altering the procedural or substantive law that the Court must apply&lt;ref name="Richard Walter 6"/&gt; to ensure that "the impugned decision or conduct is in fact valid or lawful".&lt;ref&gt;''Richard Walter Pty. Ltd.'', para.&amp;nbsp;3 (Justices Deane and Gaudron).&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
[[File:Supreme Court of India - 200705 (edited).jpg|thumb|The [[Supreme Court of India]] held in a 1980 case that [[judicial review]] is part of the [[basic structure doctrine|basic structure]] of the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]]]]

India embraces the [[basic structure doctrine]], which states that the basic structure or features of the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] may not be amended. Judicial review has been regarded as a basic feature since the case of ''[[Minerva Mills v. Union of India]]'' (1980),&lt;ref name="Minerva"&gt;{{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India|link=Minerva Mills v. Union of India|court=INSC|year=1980|num=141|parallelcite=A.I.R. 1980 S.C. 1789, 1981 (1) S.C.R. 206|courtname=auto}}, affirmed by {{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=S.

{{quote|The power of the judicial review is an integral part of our constitutional system and without it, there will be no Government of Laws and the rule of law would become a teasing illusion and a promise of unreality. If there is one feature of our Constitution which, more than any other, is basic and fundamental to the maintenance of democracy and the rule of law, it is the power of judicial review and it is unquestionably a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.}}

The Parliament's "power to destroy is not a power to amend",&lt;ref&gt;''Minerva Mills'', 1981 (1) S.C.R. at p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; and hence the power of judicial review may not be abrogated either by the ordinary process of legislation or through the procedure of constitutional amendment. Therefore, it might be argued that ouster clauses, which are intended to make decisions by public authorities and other decision-makers final and unchallengeable before the courts, should be held void and ineffective as they deprive the aggrieved party of an avenue of seeking judicial review. However, it was held in ''A. B. C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. v. A. P. Agencies, Salem'' (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=A. B. C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. v. A. P. Agencies, Salem|court=INSC|year=1989|num=85|parallelcite=A.I.R. 1989 S.C. 1239, 1989 (2) S.C.R. 1|courtname=S.C.|juris=India}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that where there are two or more courts with jurisdiction over a matter, and an ouster clause merely limits the jurisdiction to one particular court, the ouster clause is valid as the aggrieved party is still left with an avenue to proceed with his or her claim:&lt;ref&gt;''A. B. C. Laminart'', 1989 (2) S.C.R. at p. 12. See also {{citation|author=Rosy Kumar|title=A Question of Jurisdiction|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jurisdiction-issue-consumer-protection-and-trade-practices/1/165951.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230041354/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jurisdiction-issue-consumer-protection-and-trade-practices/1/165951.html|archivedate=30 December 2011|magazine=[[India Today]]|date=26 December 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[W]here such an ouster clause occurs, it is pertinent to see whether there is ouster of jurisdiction of other Courts. When the clause is clear, unambiguous and specific accepted notions of contract would bind the parties and unless the absence of [[meeting of the minds|ad idem]] can be shown, the other Courts should avoid exercising jurisdiction. As regards construction of the ouster clause when words like 'alone', 'only', 'exclusive' and the like have been used there may be no difficulty. ... In such a case mention of one thing may imply exclusion of another.}}

{{Main|Exclusion of judicial review in Singapore law}}
[[File:Old and New Supreme Courts.jpg|thumb|The new and old [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] buildings in Singapore. The effectiveness of ouster clauses in this jurisdiction is still unclear.]]

In Singapore, the state of the law regarding the effectiveness of ouster clauses is still unclear. Whereas in the United Kingdom the courts have abolished the distinction between non-jurisdictional and jurisdictional errors of law and affirmed that in general ouster clauses are ineffective against errors of law, Singapore cases seem to adopt the traditional pre-''Anisminic'' approach. The distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law and the effectiveness of ouster clauses against non-jurisdictional errors of law is exemplified by the cases of ''Re Application by Yee Yut Ee'' (1978),&lt;ref&gt;''Re Application by Yee Yut Ee'' [1977–1978] S.L.R.(R.) [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 490, [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Stansfield Business International Pte. Ltd. v. Minister for Manpower'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;''Stansfield Business International Pte. Ltd. v. Minister of Manpower'' [1999] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 866, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Yee Yut Ee'', the High Court neither expressly rejected nor affirmed the abolition of the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law in ''Anisminic'' and its effect on the effectiveness of ouster clauses. Instead, the Court cited UK authorities holding that ouster clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Hurst, ex parte Smith'' [1960] 2 Q.B. 133 at 142, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] (England and Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; or an excess of jurisdiction on the part of the decision-maker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Medical Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Gilmore|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1957|num=1|parallelcite=[1957] 1 Q.B. 574 at 586|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was the legal position prior to ''Anisminic''.&lt;ref&gt;''Yee Yut Ee'', p. 495, para. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Court did refer to ''Anisminic'', it did so only to observe that the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all. Ultimately, the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration Court because it contained an error of law which had caused that court to exceed its jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;''Yee Yut Ee'', pp. 496–497, paras. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Stansfield'', an employee of the plaintiff alleged that he had been [[unfair dismissal|dismissed from his employment without just cause]], and made representations to the [[Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)|Minister of Manpower]] to be reinstated. The Minister agreed with the employee and recommended that the plaintiff provide him with monetary compensation. Even though section&amp;nbsp;14(5) of the Employment Act&lt;ref&gt;Employment Act (Cap. 91, 1996 Rev. Ed.), now {{Singapore legislation|cap=91|ed=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that any decision of the Minister is "final and conclusive, and shall not be challenged in any court of law", the plaintiff challenged the decision by applying to the High Court for judicial review by way of ''certiorari''.&lt;ref&gt;''Stansfield'', p. 873, paras. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of its judgment, the Court cited the following passage from ''South East Asia Fire Bricks Sdn. Bhd. v. Non-Metallic Mineral Products Manufacturing Employees Union'' (1980):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=South East Asia Fire Bricks Sdn. Bhd. v. Non-Metallic Mineral Products Manufacturing Employees Union|court=UKPC|year=1980|num=21|format=1|parallelcite=[1981] A.C. 363 at 370|courtname=auto|juris=Malaysia}}, cited in ''Stansfield'', p. 874, para. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[W]hen words in a statute oust the power of the High Court to review decisions of an inferior tribunal by ''certiorari'', they must be construed strictly... they will not have the effect of ousting that power if the inferior tribunal has acted without jurisdiction or "if it has done or failed to do something in the course of the inquiry which is of such a nature that its decision is a nullity": ''per'' Lord Reid at p.&amp;nbsp;171 [of ''Anisminic'']. But if the inferior tribunal has merely made an error of law which does not affect its jurisdiction, and if its decision is not a nullity for some reason such as breach of the rules of natural justice, then the ouster will be effective.}}

It is presently not known whether Singapore courts will eventually adopt the current legal position in the United Kingdom. [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] [[Chan Sek Keong]] observed during a 2010 lecture that what the High Court said about ''Anisminic'' in ''Stansfield'' was ''[[obiter dictum|obiter dicta]]'' because the actual decision was "based on a breach of natural justice and not the doctrine of error of law".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Chan Sek Keong|authorlink=Chan Sek Keong|title=Judicial Review – From Angst to Empathy: A Lecture to Singapore Management University Second Year Law Students|url=http://www.sal.org.sg/digitallibrary/Lists/SAL%20Journal/Attachments/516/%282010%29%2022%20SAcLJ%20469-489_Chan%20CJ.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63bXAGCt7|archivedate=1 December 2011|journal=Singapore Academy of Law Journal|date=September 2010|volume=22|pages=469–489 at 476, para. 17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court had concluded that the ouster clause was ineffective in preventing judicial review of the Minister's decision, as the plaintiff had not been given a fair opportunity to present its case with knowledge of the opponent's allegations.&lt;ref&gt;''Stansfield'', pp. 875–877, paras. 26–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice Chan also advanced an academic argument that ouster clauses might be viewed as being contrary to Article 93 of the [[Constitution of Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|ed=1985|rep=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which vests the judicial power of Singapore in the courts, because ouster clauses strip the [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] of its supervisory jurisdiction over inferior tribunals and other public authorities. If the argument that the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts cannot be ousted holds, there is no need to distinguish between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law. However, he made it clear that he was not expressing an opinion on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, p. 477, para. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Indian example, it might be argued that judicial review is a basic feature of the Constitution and cannot be removed through the use of ouster clauses. However, the basic features doctrine was rejected by the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] in ''[[Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs]]'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs#High Court judgment|Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs]]'' [1989] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 461 at 479, para. 47, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; On appeal, the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] found it unnecessary to rule on whether the position taken by the High Court is correct or not.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs#Court of Appeal judgment|Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs]]'' [1990] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 347 at 367–368, para. 44, [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial ouster clauses==
Unlike a total ouster clause which seeks to preclude judicial review entirely, a partial ouster clause specifies a restricted period of time after which no remedy will be available. However, if the issue of whether a public authority has acted in [[bad faith]] arises, the authority's act or decision is not immune to judicial review notwithstanding the lapse of time.&lt;ref&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, "Express and Implied Limits on Judicial Review", pp.&amp;nbsp;399–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United Kingdom===
In ''Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council'' (1956),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council|court=UKHL|year=1956|num=2|parallelcite=[1956] A.C. 736|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords concluded by a majority that it could not impugn a partial ouster clause because, according to [[Gavin Simonds, 1st Viscount Simonds|Viscount Simonds]], "plain words must be given their plain meaning", regardless of an allegation of fraud on the part of the public authority.&lt;ref&gt;''Smith'', p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt; The consequences of such a narrow approach were recognized in the [[dissenting opinion|dissenting judgement]] by [[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]], in which he doubted whether an ouster clause could protect an order that had been obtained by corrupt or fraudulent means from being questioned in court. He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;''Smith'', p. 765.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In every class of case that I can think of the courts have always held that general words are not to be read as enabling a deliberate wrongdoer to take advantage of his own dishonesty.}}

The decision in ''Anisminic'', which held that total ouster clauses do not safeguard decisions affected by errors of law from judicial review, poses a challenge to the judgment in ''Smith'', but the latter was affirmed by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in ''R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Ostler'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Ostler|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1976|num=6|parallelcite=[1977] Q.B. 122|courtname=C.A.|juris=England and Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held that a distinction could be drawn between a total ouster clause and a partial ouster such as the one in question, which gave the applicants six weeks to challenge the decision. Lord Denning, the [[Master of the Rolls]], explained that the rationale for upholding time limit clauses is that it is in the public interest to promote certainty of the executive's actions. If the courts were to allow plaintiffs to come to them for remedies long after the time limit for doing so has expired, the acts or decisions of authorities would be held up or delayed.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Ostler'', pp. 128–130 and 133.&lt;/ref&gt; As Lord Justice of Appeal Michael Mann explained in ''R. v. Cornwall County Council, ex parte Huntington'' (1992):&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Cornwall County Council, ex parte Huntington'' [1992] 3 All E.R. 566 at 575, [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] (England and Wales), cited with approval by Lord Justice of Appeal [[Simon Brown, Baron Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood|Simon Brown]] in ''R. v. Cornwall County Council, ex parte Huntington'' [1994] 1 All E.R. 694 at 698, C.A. (England and Wales).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The intention of Parliament when it uses an ''Anisminic'' clause is that questions as to validity are not excluded. When paragraphs such as those considered in ''ex p. Ostler'' are used, then the legislative intention is that questions as to invalidity may be raised on the specified grounds in the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner, but that otherwise the jurisdiction of the court is excluded in the interests of certainty.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8282">A '''parliamentary leader''' is a political title or a descriptive term used in various countries to the person leading a [[caucus]] (or [[parliamentary group]]) in a legislative body, whether it be a national or sub-national legislature. A [[party leader]] may be the same person as the parliamentary leader, or the roles may be separated.

==Terminology==
In many countries, the position of [[party leader|leader of a political party]] (that is, the organisational leader) and leader of a parliamentary group are separate positions, and while they are often held by the same person,&lt;ref name="Pilet–Cross"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pilet|first1=Jean-Benoit|last2=Cross|first2=William|title=The Selection of Political Party Leaders in Contemporary Parliamentary Democracies: A Comparative Study|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317929451|page=190|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_2mvBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is not always or automatically the case. If the party leader is a member of the government, holds a different political office outside the parliamentary body in question, or no political office at all, the position of parliamentary leader is frequently held by a different person.&lt;ref name="Heidar"/&gt;

In English, the leader may be referred to as a "parliamentary chairman", "group leader"&lt;ref name="europarl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of the leaders of Parliament's political groups|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+IM-PRESS+20090710FCS58034+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en|date=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "parliamentary leader", among other names.

==Examples==
{{expand section|date=August 2017}}
===Canada===
{{See also|Interim leader (Canada)}}
A parliamentary leader is chosen in [[politics of Canada|Canadian politics]] to lead their [[caucus]] in a legislative body, whether it be the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] or a provincial legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffrey|first1=Brooke|title=Divided Loyalties: The Liberal Party of Canada, 1984-2008|date=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802038487|page=604|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BGdYR_ZTyRAC&amp;pg=PA604|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They serve as interim legislative leaders, when a party leader either has no seat in the legislative body, during a transition period preceding, or following a leadership contest.

===European Parliament===
Each of the seven [[political groups of the European Parliament]] has its own group leader. The groups within the European Parliament are often very broad, so the position of the group leader is a unifying one—they may help to consolidate MEPs with similar outlooks ahead of important votes.&lt;ref name="europarl"/&gt; The groups are organisationally separate from a [[European political party]], and multiple parties often ally as a single group, thus the distinction between a party and a parliamentary leader is usually strict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political groups in the European Parliament.

In German politics, leaders of the major parties have often been heads of government of the various states rather than members of the national parliament.&lt;ref name="Heidar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidar|first1=Knut|last2=Koole|first2=Ruud|title=Parliamentary Party Groups in European Democracies: Political Parties Behind Closed Doors|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134594764|page=33–34|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rgGDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the position of parliamentary leader in the [[Bundestag|federal parliament]] (Germany also has 16 state parliaments) is often occupied by a different person. The parliamentary leader has the supreme responsibility for coordinating the work of the MPs representing his or her party. Even when the party leader is a member of the national parliament, the parliamentary leader can be a different person. For instance,
[[Friedrich Merz]] was parliamentary leader while [[Angela Merkel]] was party leader for some years while the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] was in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geis|first1=Matthias|last2=Hildebrandt|first2=Tina|title=Angela Merkel: Not Our Ms. Merkel|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-09/angela-merkel-refugees-politics-germany-cdu/komplettansicht|work=[[Die Zeit]]|date=26 September 2015|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the party leader is the [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] or a member of the government, another person always is the parliamentary leader.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===United Kingdom===
In [[politics of the United Kingdom|British politics]], the leader of a party is typically the same person as the parliamentary leader. The leader may not fully control the party bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Leach–Coxall–Robins"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leach|first1=Robert|last2=Coxall|first2=Bill|last3=Robins|first3=Lynton|title=British Politics|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230344228|page=102|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l6McBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader may be chosen by [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] from among their number, or elected by the wider party membership at a [[party conference]], but once elected must retain the support of the parliamentary party.&lt;ref name="Leach–Coxall–Robins"/&gt; Similarly, the position of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] may be given to the parliamentary leader (viz. party leader) of the largest political party in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]], with the expectation they will be able secure and retain the [[confidence and supply|confidence]] of a majority of MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government and Opposition roles|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leyland|first1=Peter|title=The Constitution of the United Kingdom: A Contextual Analysis|date=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781849469081|page=121|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V-8cDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT121|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some smaller parties have parliamentary leaders in the national parliament (in Westminster) who are separate from the party leaders—the party leader may hold office in a [[devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] (sub-national) parliament or assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leonard|first1=Ian|title=Why does Nicola Sturgeon not have a seat in Westminster?|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nicola-sturgeon-not-seat-westminster-5665836|accessdate=17 August 2017|work=Daily Mirror|date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williamson|first1=David|title=Liz Saville Roberts is Plaid Cymru's new Westminster leader|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/liz-saville-roberts-plaid-cymrus-13186885|accessdate=17 August 2017|work=Wales Online|date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia and New Zealand===
In [[Politics of Australia|Australian]] and [[New Zealand politics]], the party figure commonly described as "leader" is usually an MP responsible for managing the party's business within parliament. Party constitutions will typically distinguish between the parliamentary leader and the organisational leader (who typically is outside of parliament), with the latter often termed a "federal president" or "party president".&lt;ref name="Pilet–Cross"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Labour Party Constitution and Rules|url=https://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/Labour_Party_Rules_1.pdf|website=www.elections.org.nz|publisher=New Zealand Labour Party|accessdate=17 August 2017|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two roles are organisationally distinct even if close cooperation is expected.&lt;ref name="Pilet–Cross"/&gt;

'''Perpetual copyright''' can refer to a [[copyright]] without a finite [[copyright term|term]], or to a copyright whose finite term is perpetually extended.  Perpetual copyright in the former sense is highly uncommon, as the current laws of all countries with copyright statutes set a standard limit on the duration, based either on the date of creation/publication, or on the date of the creator's death.  (See [[List of countries' copyright lengths]].)  Exceptions have sometimes been made, however, for unpublished works. Usually, special legislation is required, granting a perpetual copyright to a specific work. 

In many countries, [[moral rights]], which may be covered under the copyright law, can last perpetually.

== Copyright philosophy ==
The basic philosophical argument employed by proponents of perpetual copyright presupposes that [[intellectual property]] ownership rights are analogous to other property rights such as those associated with material goods.  Proponents such as [[Samuel Clemens]]&lt;ref&gt;"Remarks of Samuel Langhorne Clemens Before the Congressional Joint Committee on Patents (December 1906)."  Quoted in LaForge, William N. (2010).  ''Testifying Before Congress.'' p. 199. TheCapitol.Net. {{ISBN|9781587331725}}.  Clemens stated in testimony before Congress, "So if I could have convinced that gentleman that a book which does consist solely of ideas, from the base to the summit, then that would have been the best argument in the world that it is property, like any other property, and should not be put under the ban of any restriction, but that it should be the property of that man and his heirs forever and ever, just as a butcher shop would be, or--I don't care--anything, I don't care what it is. It all has the same basis. The law should recognize the right of perpetuity in this and every other kind of property."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jack Valenti]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Patry| first = William |title = Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 110 | year = 2009| ISBN = 9780195385649}} Valenti stated before a congressional committee that "Creative property owners must be accorded the same rights and protection resident in all other property owners in the nation."&lt;/ref&gt;  have stated that owners of intellectual property should have the same perpetual right to retain and bequeath this property to their descendants that owners of material goods already possess. [[Jonathan Zittrain]], a faculty co-director at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]], illustrated this argument using the analogy:  "[It] makes no sense to imagine somebody after a certain time coming in and taking your rug or your chair and saying 'Sorry, your ownership expired.'"&lt;ref&gt;Wentworth, Donna. [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/mickey.htm "Mickey Rattles the Bars: the Supreme Court Hearing of Eldred v. Ashcroft"], [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]], Harvard, 9 October 2002.  Retrieved on 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an op-ed published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', author [[Mark Helprin]] argues that it is unjust for a government to strip copyright holders of their exclusive rights after a set period of time.&lt;ref name = "Helprin"&gt;Helprin, Mark. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/opinion/20helprin.html?pagewanted=all "A Great Idea Lives Forever. Shouldn’t Its Copyright?"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', New York, 20 May 2007.  Retrieved on 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also writes that copyright expiration transfers wealth from private copyright holders to corporations:

{{quote|"'Freeing' a literary work into the public domain is less a public benefit than a transfer of wealth from the families of American writers to the executives and stockholders of various businesses who will continue to profit from, for example, ''[[The Garden Party (short story collection)|The Garden Party]]'', while the descendants of [[Katherine Mansfield]] will not."&lt;ref name = "Helprin"/&gt;}}

Calls for perpetual copyright have been widely criticized.  [[Lawrence Lessig]] organized a community response to Helprin's editorial.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, Lawrence.  [http://wiki.lessig.org/index.php/Against_perpetual_copyright "Against Perpetual Copyright"], The Lessig Wiki.  Retrieved on 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Public Knowledge]] issued a response which argued that copyright expiration ultimately provides a net benefit to society.&lt;ref name="Sherwin"&gt;Siy, Sherwin.  [http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/958 "Why Copyrights Must Expire: a reply to Mark Helprin"] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120107202004/http%3A//www.publicknowledge.org/node/958 |date=7 January 2012 }}, [[Public Knowledge]], 21 May 2007.  Retrieved on 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  It distinguishes intellectual property rights from those associated with material goods; the latter "are scarce and rivalrous: [they] cannot be created anew, and only a limited number of people can occupy and use a space at any one time.  Copyrighted works are neither scarce nor rivalrous: books are created anew, by specific authors, and can be read by five million people as easily as by five dozen, depriving none of them, nor the author, of the ability to use the work."&lt;ref name = "Sherwin"/&gt;  Critics state that copyright expiration does not deprive a creator's heirs of the right to continue to appreciate and use the works of that creator as though a government had legally confiscated their physical possessions after a set period of time.   Society as a whole is granted the same right to appreciate and exploit the property that once was under the exclusive control of a single family or corporate entity.  This wider potential for the creative exploitation of works formerly under the exclusive control of a copyright owner promotes learning.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell QC, Iain G (2009) [http://www.ifosslr.org/ifosslr/article/view/23 'Back to the Future: Hinton v Donaldson, Wood and Meurose (Court of Session, Scotland, 28 July 1773)'], ''International Free and Open Source Software Law Review'', 1(2), 111 – 122.  The British judge Lord Kames wrote that "...if the monopoly of [book printing] was to be perpetual, it would be a sad case for learned men, and for the interest of learning in general: it would enhance the price of books far beyond the reach of ordinary readers."&lt;/ref&gt;  Public Knowledge and other critics wrote that existing [[copyright terms]] already provide more than sufficient compensation for creators of intellectual property. It has also been argued that copyright should not become a [[welfare]] system used to benefit remote descendants who happen to come into possession of a valuable copyright through the [[lottery of birth]], and that society is a "quite important heir" to copyrighted works.&lt;ref&gt;Desai, Deven R., Copyright's Hidden Assumption: A Critical Analysis of the Foundations of Descendible Copyright (27 April 2009). Thomas Jefferson School of Law Research Paper No. 1353746. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1353746&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of perpetual copyright also point out that creative activity often involves the creation of [[derivative works]] that recast or build upon previous material.  If this prior material were perpetually copyrighted, their respective copyright holders would have the indefinite right to license their intellectual property or deny its use as they see fit.  Many new derivative works could not be produced if the interested parties were denied permission or could not afford the licensing fees.  Moreover, the longer copyright persists, the more copyrighted material falls into the category of [[orphan works]].&lt;ref&gt;Varian, Hal R., Copyright Term Extension and Orphan Works (December 2006). Industrial and Corporate Change, Vol. 15, Issue 6, pp. 965-980, 2006. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1116430 or {{doi|10.1093/icc/dtl026}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anyone seeking to create derivative works based upon orphan works faces the risk of copyright infringement if the copyright holders were to come forward at some later time to enforce their rights.  Perpetual copyright would create a significant disincentive to the creation of new literary or artistic works which build upon older material.

== Battle of the booksellers ==
When the statutory [[copyright term]] provided for by the [[Statute of Anne]], the first [[copyright]] statute, began to expire in 1731 London booksellers fought to defend their dominant position by seeking [[injunction]]s from the [[Court of Chancery]] for works by authors that fell outside the statute's protection. At the same time the London booksellers lobbied parliament to extend the copyright term provided by the Statute of Anne. Eventually, in a case known as ''Midwinter v. Hamilton'' (1743–1748), the London booksellers turned to [[common law]] and started a 30-year period known as the ''battle of the booksellers''. The battle of the booksellers saw London booksellers locking horns with the newly emerging Scottish book trade over the right to reprint works falling outside the protection of the Statute of Anne. The Scottish booksellers argued that no [[common law copyright]] existed in an author's work. The London booksellers argued that the Statute of Anne only supplemented and supported a pre-existing common law copyright. The dispute was argued out in a number of notable cases, including Millar v. Kincaid (1749–1751) and Tonson v. Collins (1761–1762).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| pages = 14| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-282-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A debate raged on whether printed ideas could be owned and London booksellers and other supporters of perpetual copyright argued that without it scholarship would cease to exist and that authors would have no incentive to continue creating works of enduring value if they could not inherit the property rights to their descendants. Opponents of perpetual copyright argued that it amounted to a [[monopoly]], which inflated the price of books, making them less affordable and therefore prevented the spread of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. London booksellers were attacked for using rights of authors to mask their greed and self-interest in controlling the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Van Horn Melton| first = James| title = The rise of the public in Enlightenment Europe| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2001| pages =139| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QZovusQ1SjYC&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-0-521-46969-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Keen | first = Paul| title = Revolutions in Romantic literature: an anthology of print culture 1780-1832 | publisher = Broadview Press| year = 2004| pages =80| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qVBvcohS5v0C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-1-55111-352-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''[[Donaldson v Beckett]]'' reached the [[House of Lords]] in 1774 [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]] was most strident in his rejection of the common law copyright, warning the Lords that should they vote in favour of common law copyright, effectively a perpetual copyright, "all our learning will be locked up in the hands of the Tonsons and the Lintots of the age". Moreover, he warned that booksellers would then set upon books whatever price they pleased "till the public became as much their slaves, as their own hackney compilers are". He declared that "Knowledge and science are not things to be bound in such cobweb chains."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| pages = 19| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-282-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its ruling the House of Lords established that copyright was a "creature of statute", and that the rights and responsibilities in copyright were determined by legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rimmer| first = Matthew| title = Digital copyright and the consumer revolution: hands off my iPod | publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing | year = 2007| pages = 4| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=1ONyncVruj8C&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright+scotland&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-948-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By confirming that the [[copyright term]] (that is the length of time a work is in copyright) did expire according to statute, the Lords also affirmed the [[public domain]]. The ''Donaldson v Beckett'' ruling confirmed that a large number of works and books first published in Britain were in the public domain, either because the copyright term granted by statute had expired, or because they were first published before the [[Statute of Anne]] was enacted in 1709. This opened the market for cheap reprints of works from [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Milton]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], works now considered classics. The expansion of the public domain in books broke the dominance of the London booksellers and allowed for competition, with the number of London booksellers and publishers rising threefold from 111 to 308 between 1772 and 1802.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Van Horn Melton| first = James| title = The rise of the public in Enlightenment Europe| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2001| pages =140–141| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QZovusQ1SjYC&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-0-521-46969-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, calls for perpetual copyright continued in Britain and France until the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Torremans| first = Paul| title = Copyright law: a handbook of contemporary research| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2007| pages = 154| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wHJBemWuPT4C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common law copyright ===
After ''Donaldson v Beckett'', disagreement continued over whether the House of Lords affirmed the existence of [[common law copyright]] before it was superseded by the Statute of Anne. The Lords had traditionally been hostile to the booksellers' monopoly and were aware of how the doctrine of [[common law copyright]], promoted by the booksellers, was used to support their case for a perpetual copyright. The Lords clearly voted against perpetual copyright,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Marshall| first = Lee| title = Bootlegging: romanticism and copyright in the music industry| publisher = Sage| year = 2006| pages = 15| url =https://www.google.com/books?id=25luX89BlA0C&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright+scotland&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-7619-4490-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually an understanding was established whereby authors had a pre-existing common law copyright over their work, but that with the Statute of Anne parliament had limited these natural rights in order to strike a more appropriate balance between the interests of the author and the wider social good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| pages = 24| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-282-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Patterson and Livingston there remains confusion about the nature of copyright ever since. Copyright has come to be viewed both as a natural law right of the author and as the statutory grant of a limited [[monopoly]]. One theory holds that copyright's origin occurs at the creation of a work, the other that its origin exists only through the copyright statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jonathan| first = Rosenoer| title = Cyberlaw: the law of the internet| publisher = Springer| year = 1997| pages = 34–35| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=HlG2esMIm7kC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-387-94832-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] ruled in [[Wheaton v. Peters]], a case similar to the British [[Donaldson v Beckett]] of 1774, that although the author of an unpublished work had a [[common law copyright|common law right]] to control the first publication of that work, the author did not have a common law right to control reproduction following the first publication of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| editor-last = Yu| editor-first = Peter K.| title = Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2007| pages = 143| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-275-98883-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
The Copyright Act of 1775 established a type of perpetual copyright which allowed "the Two Universities in England, the Four Universities in Scotland, and the several colleges of Eton, Westminster, and Winchester to hold in Perpetuity their Copy Right in Books given to or bequeathed to the said Universities and Colleges for the advancement of useful learning and other purposes of education."&lt;ref&gt;Macgillivary, E.J. (1902). [https://archive.org/details/treatiseuponlawo00macguoft ''A Treatise Upon the Law of Copyright''], p.358.  John Murray. London.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of this Act,{{fact|reason=Do we have a source that it is THIS Act?  The Wikipedia article on King James Version seems to have a slightly different narrative.|date=October 2018}} the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized or King James Version of the Bible]] was allowed to be printed only by the Royal printer and by the printers of the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. All provisions granting copyright in perpetuity were abolished by the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 but under transitional arrangements these printing rights do not fully expire until 2039.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48 |title=Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 |quote=Schedule 1, Section 13 (1): The rights conferred on universities and colleges by the Copyright Act 1775 shall continue to subsist until the end of the period of 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the new copyright provisions come into force and shall then expire.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. M. Barrie]]'s [[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]] (including the play ''Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up'' and its novelisation ''Peter and Wendy'') is covered by special legislation granting [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] a right to royalties in perpetuity from commercial exploitation of the story on stage, in publication, and in broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48|title=Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (c. 48, s. 301)|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]], [[United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not a perpetual copyright because the hospital does not retain creative control over the work, which entered the public domain in the UK in 2008, 70 years after the author's death. This legislation does not apply to other works which feature Peter Pan such as ''[[The Little White Bird]]'' or ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'', which are also in the public domain.

== United States ==

In the [[United States]], perpetual copyright is prohibited by its [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], which provides that copyright is "for limited times". However, it neither specifies how long that term can be, nor does it impose any restriction on the number of times the term may be extended. Indeed, since the enactment of the [[Copyright Act of 1790]], copyright term has been successively extended by [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] on four occasions, retroactively extending the terms of any copyrights still in force.  Following the enactment of the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] in 1998, a coalition of plaintiffs led by publisher [[Eric Eldred]] argued that this act and a [[Copyright Act of 1976|previous extension of the copyright term]] in the 1970s had created a ''de facto'' "perpetual copyright on the installment plan".  This argument was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'', which held that there was no limit to how many times the term of copyright may be extended by Congress, so long as it is still a limited term at the time of each extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft|title=Eldred v. Ashcroft|year=2003|publisher=[[Supreme Court of the United States]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act''', commonly referred to as the '''RICO Act''' or simply '''RICO''', is a [[United States federal law]] that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil [[cause of action]] for acts performed as part of an ongoing [[criminal organization]]. The RICO Act focuses specifically on [[racketeering]] and allows the ''leaders'' of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes they ''[[Dirty hands|ordered]]'' others to do [[Enmund v. Florida|or assisted them in doing]], closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally.&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S. Code § 1962(c); see also [http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/rico.pdf Criminal RICO Prosecutors Manual], elaborating that "A Defendant May Be Liable for a RICO Conspiracy Offense Even if the Defendant Did Not Participate In the Operation or Management of the Enterprise"&lt;/ref&gt;

RICO was enacted by section 901(a) of the [[Organized Crime Control Act]] of 1970 ({{USStatute|91|452|84|922|1970|10|15}}) and is codified at {{usctc|18|96}} as {{usc|18|1961|1968}}. [[G. Robert Blakey]], an adviser to the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|United States Senate Government Operations Committee]], drafted the law under the close supervision of the committee's chairman, Senator [[John Little McClellan]].  It was enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, and signed into law by [[Richard Nixon|Richard M. Nixon]]. While its original use in the 1970s was to prosecute the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] as well as others who were actively engaged in organized crime, its later application has been more widespread.

Beginning in 1972, 33 states adopted state RICO laws to be able to prosecute similar conduct.

==Summary==
Under RICO, a person who has committed "at least two acts of racketeering activity" drawn from a list of 35 crimes—27 [[Federal crime in the United States|federal crimes]] and 8 [[State law in the United States|state crimes]]—within a 10-year period can be charged with [[racketeering]] if such acts are related in one of four specified ways to an "enterprise". {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Those found guilty of racketeering can be fined up to $25,000 and sentenced to 20 years in prison per racketeering count. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In addition, the racketeer must forfeit all ill-gotten gains and interest in any business gained through a pattern of "racketeering activity." {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

When the [[U.S. Attorney]] decides to indict someone under RICO, they have the option of seeking a pre-trial [[restraining order]] or injunction to temporarily seize a defendant's assets and prevent the transfer of potentially forfeitable property, as well as require the defendant to put up a [[performance bond]]. This provision was placed in the law because the owners of [[Mafia]]-related [[shell corporation]]s often absconded with the assets. An injunction and/or performance bond ensures that there is something to seize in the event of a guilty verdict.

In many cases, the threat of a RICO indictment can force defendants to plead guilty to lesser charges, in part because the seizure of assets would make it difficult to pay a defense [[Lawyer|attorney]]. Despite its harsh provisions, a RICO-related charge is considered easy to prove in court since it focuses on patterns of behavior as opposed to criminal acts.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958402-1,00.html |title= Law: Showdown At Gucci |last1= Sanders |first1 = Alain |last2= Painton |first2= Priscilla |journal= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= August 21, 1989 |accessdate= September 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RICO also permits a private individual "damaged in his business or property" by a "racketeer" to file a [[civil suit]]. The plaintiff must prove the existence of an "enterprise". The defendant(s) are not the enterprise; in other words, the defendant(s) and the enterprise are not one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Anti-Corruption Handbook: How to Protect Your Business in the Global Marketplace |first= William P. |last=Olsen, |publisher= Wiley |location= Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; There must be one of four specified relationships between the defendant(s) and the enterprise: either the defendant(s) invested the proceeds of the pattern of racketeering activity into the enterprise (18 U.S.C. § 1962(a)); or the defendant(s) acquired or maintained an interest in, or control of, the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity (subsection (b)); or the defendant(s) conducted or participated in the affairs of the enterprise "through" the pattern of racketeering activity (subsection (c)); or the defendant(s) conspired to do one of the above (subsection (d)).&lt;ref&gt;18 USC § 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the enterprise is either the 'prize,' 'instrument,' 'victim,' or 'perpetrator' of the racketeers.&lt;ref&gt;"As the Supreme Court noted in ''National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler'', 510 U.S. 249, 259 n.5 (1994), one commentator has used "the terms 'prize,' 'instrument,' 'victim,' and 'perpetrator' to describe the four separate roles the enterprise may play in § 1962." (citing [[G. Robert Blakey]], The RICO Civil Fraud Action in Context: Reflections on Bennett v. Berg, 58 Notre Dame L. Rev. 237, 307-25 (1982). See page 32 of RICO State by State: A Guide to Litigation under the State Racketeering Statutes, John E. Floyd, Section of Antitrust Law, American Bar Association, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 97-70903, {{ISBN|1-57073-396-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A civil RICO action can be filed in state or [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dealer-magazine.com/index.asp?article=481 |journal=Dealer Magazine |title=Can You Be Subject to a RICO Claim? |last=Van Over |first=Gil |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014073823/http://www.dealer-magazine.com/index.asp?article=481 |archivedate=October 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the criminal and civil components allow the recovery of [[treble damages]] (damages in triple the amount of actual/compensatory damages).

Although its primary intent was to deal with [[organized crime]], Blakey said that Congress never intended it to merely apply to the Mob. He once told ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]],'' "We don't want one set of rules for people whose collars are blue or whose names end in vowels, and another set for those whose collars are white and have [[Ivy League]] diplomas."&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

Initially, prosecutors were skeptical of using RICO, mainly because it was unproven. The RICO Act was first used by the US Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York on September 18, 1979, in the United States v. Scotto. Scotto, who was convicted on charges of racketeering, accepting unlawful labor payments, and income tax evasion,  headed the International Longshoreman's Association. During the 1980s and 1990s, federal prosecutors used the law to bring charges against several Mafia figures.  The second major success was the [[Mafia Commission Trial]], which resulted in several top leaders of New York City's [[Five Families]] getting what amounted to life sentences. By the turn of the century, RICO cases resulted in virtually all of the top leaders of the New York Mafia being sent to prison.

==State laws==
Beginning in 1972, 33 states, as well as Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, adopted state RICO laws to cover additional state offenses under a similar scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.americanbar.org/publications/gpsolo_ereport/2012/november_2012/introduction_rico_state_by_state.html |title= Introduction: RICO State by State: A Guide to Litigation Under the State Racketeering Statutes, Second Edition |author= Solo, Small Firm and General Practice Division |publisher= American Bar Association |accessdate= February 15, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140222015455/http://www.americanbar.org/publications/gpsolo_ereport/2012/november_2012/introduction_rico_state_by_state.html |archive-date= February 22, 2014 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RICO predicate offenses==
Under the law, the meaning of '''racketeering activity''' is set out at {{usc|18|1961}}. As currently amended it includes:

*Any violation of state statutes against [[gambling]], [[murder]], [[kidnapping]], [[extortion]], [[arson]], [[robbery]], [[bribery]], dealing in [[Obscenity|obscene matter]], or dealing in a controlled substance or listed chemical (as defined in the [[Controlled Substances Act]]);
*Any act of [[bribery]], [[counterfeiting]], [[theft]], [[embezzlement]], [[fraud]], dealing in obscene matter, [[obstruction of justice]], [[slavery]], [[racketeering]], [[gambling]], [[money laundering]], commission of [[murder-for-hire]], and many other offenses covered under the Federal criminal code ([[Title 18 of the United States Code|Title 18]]);
*[[Embezzlement]] of [[Trade union|union]] funds;
*[[Bankruptcy in the United States|Bankruptcy]] fraud or [[securities fraud]];
*[[Drug trafficking]]; long-term and elaborate drug networks can also be prosecuted using the [[Continuing Criminal Enterprise|Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute]];
*Criminal [[copyright infringement]];
*[[Money laundering]] and related offenses;
*Bringing in, aiding or assisting [[Alien (law)|aliens]] in illegally entering the country (if the action was for financial gain);
*Acts of [[terrorism]].

'''Pattern of racketeering activity''' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] has instructed federal courts to follow the continuity-plus-relationship test in order to determine whether the facts of a specific case give rise to an established pattern. Predicate acts are related if they "have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events." (''[[H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.]]'') Continuity is both a closed and open ended concept, referring to either a closed period of conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.

==Application of RICO laws==
{{Original research|section|date=August 2009}}
Although some of the RICO predicate acts are [[extortion]] and [[blackmail]], one of the most successful applications of the RICO laws has been the ability to indict and or sanction individuals for their behavior and actions committed against witnesses and victims in alleged retaliation or retribution for cooperating with federal law enforcement or intelligence agencies.

Violations of the RICO laws can be alleged in civil lawsuit cases or for criminal charges. In these instances, charges can be brought against individuals or corporations in retaliation for said individuals or corporations working with law enforcement. Further, charges can also be brought against individuals or corporations who have sued or filed criminal charges against a defendant.

Anti-SLAPP ([[strategic lawsuit against public participation]]) laws can be applied in an attempt to curb alleged [[Barratry (common law)|abuses of the legal system]] by individuals or corporations who use the courts as a weapon to retaliate against [[whistle blowers]] or victims or to silence another's speech. RICO could be alleged if it can be shown that lawyers and/or their clients conspired and collaborated to concoct fictitious legal complaints solely in retribution and retaliation for themselves having been brought before the courts.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Although the RICO laws may cover drug trafficking crimes in addition to other more traditional RICO predicate acts such as extortion, blackmail, and racketeering, large-scale and organized drug networks are now commonly prosecuted under the [[Continuing Criminal Enterprise|Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute]], also known as the "Kingpin Statute". The CCE laws target only traffickers who are responsible for long-term and elaborate conspiracies, whereas the RICO law covers a variety of organized criminal behaviors.&lt;ref name="NCJRS"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Carlson |first= K |year= 1993 |title= Prosecuting Criminal Enterprises |journal= National Criminal Justice Reference Series |publisher= Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report |location= United States |page= 12 |url= http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=142524 |accessdate= December 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil Provisions===
The RICO statute contains a provision that allows for the commencement of a [[civil action]] by a private party to recover damages sustained as a result of the commission of a RICO predicate offense.&lt;ref&gt;Title 18, United States Code, Section 1964(c) (18 U.S.C. 1964[c])- https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1964&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/rico/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous cases==

===Nine Trey Gangsters===
In November 2018, rapper [[6ix9ine]], birth name Daniel Hernandez, and four members of the [[Nine Trey Gangsters]] were charged with racketeering related to operating a criminal enterprise, conspiracy to murder, robbery, extortion and drug distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brooklyn rapper 6ix9ine arrested on racketeering charges |url=https://www.apnews.com/2ae2d334712a4f5792420084bc1e39f6 |website=APNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hells Angels Motorcycle Club===
In 1979, the United States Federal Government went after [[Sonny Barger]] and several members and associates of the [[Oakland]] chapter of the [[Hells Angels]] using RICO. In ''United States vs. Barger'', the prosecution team attempted to demonstrate a pattern of behavior to convict Barger and other members of the club of RICO offenses related to guns and illegal drugs. The jury acquitted Barger on the RICO charges with a [[hung jury]] on the predicate acts: "There was no proof it was part of club policy, and as much as they tried, the government could not come up with any incriminating minutes from any of our meetings mentioning drugs and guns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Hell's Angel: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and The Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club |first1= Ralph 'Sonny' |last1= Barger |first2= Keith |last2= Zimmerman |first3= Kent |last3= Zimmerman |year= 2000}}{{full citation needed|date= October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.organized-crime.de/revbar01sonnybarger.htm| title=Organized Crime Research| publisher=Klaus von Lampe| year=2000| accessdate=December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin Kings===
On August 20, 2006, in [[Tampa, Florida]], most of the state leadership members of [[street gang]] the [[Latin Kings (gang)|Latin Kings]] were arrested in connection with RICO conspiracy charges to engage in racketeering and currently await trial. The operation, called "Broken Crown", targeted statewide leadership of the Latin Kings. The raid occurred at the Caribbean American Club. Along with [[Hillsborough County, Florida Sheriff's Office|Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office]], [[Tampa Police Department]], the State Attorney's Office, the [[FBI]], [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], and the federal [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] were involved in the operation. Included in the arrest were leader Gilberto Santana from Brooklyn NY, Captain Luis Hernandez from Miami FL, Affiliate Celina Hernandez, Affiliate Michael Rocca, Affiliate Jessica Ramirez, Affiliate Reinaldo Arroyo, Affiliate Samual Alvarado, Omari Tolbert, Edwin DeLeon, and many others, totaling 39.

===Catholic sex abuse cases===
In some jurisdictions, RICO suits have been filed against Catholic [[diocese]]s, using anti-racketeering laws to prosecute the highers-up in the [[episcopacy]] for abuses committed by those under their authority.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} E.g. a Cleveland grand jury cleared two bishops of racketeering charges, finding that their mishandling of sex abuse claims did not amount to criminal racketeering.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Notably, a similar suit was not filed against Cardinal [[Bernard Law]], then Archbishop/Emeritus of Boston, prior to his assignment to [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weigel |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2075831/ |title=But Why Isn't Bernard Law in Jail?

===Gil Dozier===

[[Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry|Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry]] [[Gil Dozier]], in office from 1976 to 1980, faced [[indictment]] with violations of both the [[Hobbs Act|Hobbs]] and the RICO laws. He was accused of compelling companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf. On September 23, 1980, the [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]-based [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana]] convicted Dozier of five counts of [[extortion]] and [[racketeering]]. The sentence of ten years imprisonment, later upgraded to eighteen when other offenses were determined, and a $25,000 fine was suspended pending appeal, and Dozier remained free on [[bail]].&lt;ref name=justia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/707/862/230224/|title=707 F.2d 862: United States vs. Dozier |publisher=law.justia.com|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually served nearly four years until a presidential [[commutation of sentence|commutation]] freed him in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=Gilbert&amp;Middle=&amp;LastName=Dozier&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=U&amp;Age=79&amp;x=120&amp;y=15

===Key West, Florida Police Department===
Around June 1984, the [[Key West Police Department]] located in [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]], Florida, was declared a criminal enterprise under the [[Federal Government of the United States|federal]] RICO statutes after a lengthy [[United States Department of Justice]] investigation. Several high-ranking officers of the department, including Deputy Police Chief Raymond Cassamayor, were arrested on federal charges of running a [[protection racket]] for illegal [[cocaine]] smugglers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E4D71539F932A35754C0A962948260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fF%2fFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation%20 | title= Key West Police Department Called a 'Criminal Enterprise'|work= The New York Times | date=July 1, 1984 |accessdate=September 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[trial]], a witness testified he routinely delivered bags of cocaine to the Deputy Chief's office at City Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livableoldtown.com/from_wrecking_to_smuggling_to_de.htm|title=From wrecking to smuggling to development, corruption, investigations have long history|last=Klingener|first=Nancy|date=May 22, 2005|work=Key West Citizen|accessdate=September 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320075248/http://www.livableoldtown.com/from_wrecking_to_smuggling_to_de.htm|archivedate=March 20, 2007}}&lt;!-- Actual Key West Citizen URL requires a fee to get to the article [http://secure.floridakeys.com/keysnews/archives/index.cfm?searchtext=NANCY%20KLINGENER&amp;searchtype=basic&amp;searchbool=ALL&amp;searchstory=1&amp;searchtitle=1&amp;startdate=0&amp;enddate=0&amp;orderby=0&amp;searchpub=0&amp;searchauth=&amp;preview=1&amp;page=16&amp;displayrows=10&amp;cache=1] and [javascript:ClickThru('article.cfm?article_id=39990&amp;searchtext=NANCY%20KLINGENER&amp;searchtype=basic&amp;searchbool=ALL&amp;searchstory=1&amp;searchtitle=1&amp;startdate=0&amp;enddate=0&amp;orderby=0&amp;searchpub=0&amp;searchauth=&amp;preview=1&amp;page=16&amp;displayrows=10&amp;cache=1')] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael Milken===
On 29 March 1989 [[United States|American]] financier [[Michael Milken]] was indicted on 98 counts of racketeering and fraud relating to an investigation into an allegation of [[insider trading]] and other offenses. Milken was accused of using a wide-ranging network of contacts to manipulate stock and bond prices. It was one of the first occasions that a RICO indictment was brought against an individual with no ties to organized crime. Milken pleaded guilty to six lesser felonies of securities fraud and tax evasion rather than risk spending the rest of his life in prison and ended up serving 22 months in prison. Milken was also ordered banned for life from the securities industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gerber|first=Jurg |last2= Jensen|first2=Eric L.|date=2007 |title=Encyclopedia of White-collar Crime |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tumxfktlYFAC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=March+29,+1989+michael+milken&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YL2UU1JVZu&amp;sig=_Kt8Je-B1nFMrYrcfM91o9xLtsI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2YjvU7-xC8X-yQT8_YLYCQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=March%2029%2C%201989%20michael%20milken&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |page= |isbn=9780313335242|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7, 1988, Milken's employer, [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]], was threatened with RICO charges ''[[respondeat superior]]'', the legal doctrine that corporations are responsible for their employees' crimes. Drexel avoided RICO charges by entering an [[Alford plea]] to lesser felonies of stock parking and stock manipulation. In a carefully worded plea, Drexel said it was "not in a position to dispute the allegations" made by the Government. If Drexel had been indicted under RICO statutes, it would have had to post a performance bond of up to $1 billion to avoid having its assets frozen. This would have taken precedence over all of the firm's other obligations—including the loans that provided 96 percent of its capital base. If the bond ever had to be paid, its shareholders would have been practically wiped out. Since banks will not extend credit to a firm indicted under RICO, an indictment would have likely put Drexel out of business.&lt;ref name="April Fools"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stone |first=Dan G. |title=April Fools:  An Insider's Account of the Rise and Collapse of Drexel Burnham |year=1990 |publisher=Donald I.

===Major League Baseball===
In 2002, the former minority owners of the [[Montreal Expos]] baseball team filed charges under the RICO Act against [[Major League Baseball]] commissioner [[Bud Selig]] and former Expos owner [[Jeffrey Loria]], claiming that Selig and Loria deliberately conspired to [[devalue]] the team for personal benefit in preparation for a move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/17/sports/baseball-a-group-s-racketeering-suit-brings-baseball-to-full-bristle.html |last = Chass | first = Murray |work = The New York Times | date=July 17, 2002 | accessdate = September 30, 2009 | title = Baseball: A Group's Racketeering Suit Brings Baseball to Full Bristle}}&lt;/ref&gt; If found liable, Major League Baseball could have been responsible for up to $300 million in [[punitive damages]]. The case lasted two years, successfully stalling the Expos' move to [[Washington Nationals|Washington]] or contraction during that time. It was eventually sent to [[arbitration]], where the arbiters ruled in favor of Major League Baseball,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1923417 | title = Ruling clears way for move to D.C. | date =January 15, 2004 | accessdate = September 30, 2009 | publisher = ESPN.com |agency= [[Associated Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; permitting the move to Washington to take place.

===Pro-life activists===
RICO laws were successfully cited in ''[[NOW v. Scheidler]]'', 510 U.S. 249, 114 S. Ct. 798, 127 L.Ed. 2d 99 (1994), a suit in which certain parties, including the [[National Organization for Women]], sought damages and an injunction against pro-life activists who physically block access to [[abortion]] clinics. The Court held that a RICO enterprise does not need an economic motive and that the Pro-Life Action Network could therefore qualify as a RICO enterprise. The Court remanded for consideration of whether PLAN committed the requisite acts in a pattern of racketeering activity.

===Los Angeles Police Department===
In April 2000, federal judge William J. Rea in Los Angeles, ruling in one [[Rampart scandal]] case, said that the plaintiffs could pursue RICO claims against the LAPD, an unprecedented finding. The idea that a police organization could be characterized as a racketeering enterprise shook up City Hall and further damaged the already-tarnished image of the LAPD. However, in July 2001, US District Judge Gary A. Feess said that the plaintiffs do not have standing to sue the LAPD under RICO because they are alleging personal injuries rather than economic or property damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jul/13/local/me-21842|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=Use of RICO Law in Rampart Cases Weakened|last=Weinstein|first= Henry|date=July 13, 2001|accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mohawk Industries===
On April 26, 2006, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] heard ''Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Williams'', {{ussc|547|516|2006|docket=05-465}}, which concerned what sort of corporations fell under the scope of RICO. Mohawk Industries had allegedly hired [[illegal aliens]], in violation of RICO. The court was asked to decide whether Mohawk Industries, along with recruiting agencies, constitutes an "enterprise" that can be prosecuted under RICO, but in June of that year dismissed the case and remanded it to Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-465.pdf|title=Mohawk Industries, Inc. v.

===Gambino crime family===
Also in Tampa, on October 16, 2006, four members of the [[Gambino crime family]] ([[Caporegime|Capo]] [[Ronnie Trucchio|Ronald Trucchio]], Terry Scaglione, Steven Catallono, and Anthony Mucciarone and associate Kevin McMahon) were tried under RICO statutes, found guilty, and sentenced to [[life in prison]].

===Lucchese Crime Family===
In the mid-1990s, prosecuting attorneys [[Gregory O'Connell]] and Charles Rose used RICO charges to bring down the [[Lucchese family]] within an 18-month period. Dismantling the Lucchese family had a profound financial impact on previously Mafia held businesses such as construction, garment, and garbage hauling. Here they dominated and extorted money through taxes, dues, and fees. An example of this extortion was through the garbage business. Hauling of garbage from the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] cost the building owners $1.2 million per year to be removed when the Mafia monopolized the business, as compared to $150,000 per year when competitive bids could be sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Volkman|first=Ernest|title=Gangbusters: The Destruction of America's Last Mafia Dynasty|year=1998|publisher=Faber and Faber, Inc.|location=53 Shore Road, Winchester, MA 01890|isbn=0-571-19942-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five defendants were convicted of RICO violations and other crimes. Six pleaded guilty, two died before trial and one was too sick to be tried.

===Michael Conahan and Mark Ciavarella===
A federal grand jury in the Middle District of Pennsylvania handed down a 48-count indictment against former [[Luzerne County]] Court of Common Pleas Judges [[Michael Conahan]] and [[Mark Ciavarella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Indictment: ''United States v.

The judges were accused of taking [[bribery|kickback]]s for housing juveniles, that the judges convicted of mostly petty crimes, at a private detention center.  The incident was dubbed by many local and national newspapers as the "[[Kids for cash scandal]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Morgan-Besecker | first= Terrie | date = September 10, 2009|title=Ex-judges hit with 48 counts|work= Times Leader| url= http://www.timesleader.com/news/Ex-judges_hit_with_48_counts_09-10-2009.html | accessdate = September 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 18, 2011, a federal jury found Michael Ciavarella guilty of racketeering because of his involvement in accepting illegal payments from Robert Mericle, the developer of PA Child Care, and Attorney Robert Powell, a co-owner of the facility.

===Scott W. Rothstein===
[[Scott W. Rothstein]] is a disbarred lawyer and the former managing shareholder, chairman, and [[chief executive officer]] of the now-defunct '''Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler''' law firm. He was accused of funding his philanthropy, political contributions, law firm salaries, and an extravagant lifestyle with a massive 1.2 billion dollar [[Ponzi scheme]]. On December 1, 2009, Rothstein turned himself in to federal authorities and was subsequently arrested on charges related to RICO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/23448019/Scott-Rothstein-Charging-Document |title=Scott Rothstein Charging Document |publisher=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his arraignment plea was not guilty, Rothstein cooperated with the government and reversed his plea to guilty of five federal crimes on January 27, 2010.

The defendants include many current and former high-ranking officers of FIFA and its affiliate [[CONCACAF]]. The defendants had allegedly used the enterprise as a front to collect millions of dollars in bribes, which may have influenced Russia and Qatar's winning bids to host the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = May 27, 2015|title=Nine FIFA Officials and Five Corporate Executives Indicted for Racketeering Conspiracy and Corruption|work= United States Department of Justice| url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and | accessdate = May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International equivalents to RICO==
The US RICO legislation has other equivalents in the rest of the world. In spite of [[Interpol]] having a standardized definition of RICO-like crimes, the interpretation and national implementation in legislation (and enforcement) widely varies. Most nations cooperate with the US on RICO enforcement only where their own related laws are specifically broken, but this is in line with the Interpol protocols for such matters.

By nation, alphabetically:
* In Australia the [[Australian Crime Commission]] has powers based on similar legislation and regulations.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
* In Canada, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and the [[Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions]] enforce rules and regulations{{which|date=September 2016}} that cumulatively are equivalent to RICO.
* In Ireland the [[Criminal Assets Bureau]] has powers to seize assets likely to have been the proceeds of criminality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |chapter=  |page=21 |title=The Confiscation of Criminal Assets: Tackling Organised Crime Through a 'Middleground' System of Justice |type= Ph.D. |last=King |accessdate=9 November 2018 |url=http://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/handle/10344/1614/2010_King%2cC.pdf?sequence=6 |date=June 2010 |publisher=[[University of Limerick]] |first=Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Jamaica, the Major Organised Crime and Anti-Corruption Agency (MOCA) was founded in 2012 to combat organised financial crimes and bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://moca.gov.jm|title=Major Organised Crime and Anti-Corruption Agency|publisher=MOCA|accessdate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.moca.gov.jm/publications/message-minister-national-security-extracted-mocas-corporate-strategy|title=Message from the Minister of National Security|publisher=MOCA|accessdate=August 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913175518/http://www.moca.gov.jm/publications/message-minister-national-security-extracted-mocas-corporate-strategy|archive-date=September 13, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* New Zealand has a similar arrangement and commission to Australia, in the form of the [[Organised and Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand]] (OFCANZ).
Without other nations enforcing similar legislation to RICO, many cross border RICO cases would not be possible. In the overall body of RICO cases that went to trial, at least 50% have had some non-US enforcement component to them. The offshoring of money away from the US finance system as part racketeering (and especially money laundering) is typically a major contributing factor to this.

However, other countries have laws that enable the government to seize property with unlawful origins. Colombia and Mexico both have specific laws that define the participation in criminal organizations as a separate crime&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title= Ley Federal contra la Delincuencia Organizada|number= |language= Spanish|date= 28 October 1996|article= |url= http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/101.pdf|accessdate= |deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100801120008/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/101.pdf|archivedate= August 1, 2010|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as separate laws that allow the seizure of goods related to these crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title= Ley de Extinción de Dominio|number= |language= Spanish|date= 30 April 2009|article= |url= http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/LFED.pdf|accessdate= |deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091229152411/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/LFED.pdf|archivedate= December 29, 2009|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter provides a specific chapter titled "International Cooperation", which instructs Mexican authorities to cooperate with foreign authorities with respect to organized crime assets within Mexico, and provides the framework by which Mexican authorities may politely request the cooperation of foreign authorities with respect to assets located outside of Mexico, in terms of any international instruments they may be party to.

Arguably, this may be construed as allowing the application of the RICO Act in Mexico, provided the relevant international agreements exist among Mexico and countries with RICO or RICO-equivalent provisions.

[[File:Diverse torture instruments.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|A variety of torture instruments. Many, including the large [[Iron Maiden of Nuremberg]], were never used for torture.]]
'''Torture''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''tortus'': to twist, to torment) is the act of deliberately inflicting severe physical or psychological [[suffering]] on someone by another as a punishment or in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or force some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a [[mens rea|knowing and intentional act]]; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict suffering or pain, without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture.&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/23038/9-insane-torture-techniques&lt;/ref&gt;
Torture has been carried out or sanctioned by individuals, groups, and states throughout history from ancient times to modern day, and forms of torture can vary greatly in duration from only a few minutes to several days or longer. Reasons for torture can include [[punishment]], [[revenge]], political [[Brainwashing|re-education]], [[deterrence (legal)|deterrence]], [[coercion]] of the victim or a third party, [[interrogation]] to extract information or a [[confession]] irrespective of whether it is [[false confession|false]], or simply the [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] gratification of those carrying out or observing the torture. Alternatively, some forms of torture are designed to inflict [[Psychological torture|psychological pain]] or leave as little physical injury or evidence as possible while achieving the same psychological devastation. The torturer may or may not kill or injure the victim, but torture may result in a [[murder|deliberate death]] and serves as a form of [[capital punishment]]. Depending on the aim, even a form of torture that is intentionally fatal may be prolonged to allow the victim to suffer as long as possible (such as [[half-hanging]]). In other cases, the torturer may be indifferent to the condition of the victim.

Although torture is sanctioned by some states, it is prohibited under [[international law]] and the [[domestic laws]] of most countries. Although widely illegal and reviled, there is an ongoing debate as to what exactly is and is not legally defined as torture. It is a serious violation of [[human rights]], and is declared to be unacceptable (but not illegal) by Article 5 of the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Signatories of the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and the [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of 8 June 1977 officially agree not to torture captured persons in [[armed conflicts]], whether international or internal. Torture is also prohibited for the signatories of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], which has 163 state parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title= United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National and international legal prohibitions on torture derive from a consensus that torture and similar ill-treatment are immoral, as well as impractical, and information obtained by torture is far less reliable than that obtained by other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/014/2005/en |title=Torture and Ill-Treatment in the 'War on Terror' |date=1 November 2005 |accessdate=22 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=general/&gt;&lt;ref name=reckoning/&gt; Despite these findings and international conventions, organizations that monitor abuses of human rights (e.g., [[Amnesty International]], the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]], [[Freedom from Torture]], etc.) report widespread use condoned by states in many regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]] [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol10/001/2005/en/ Report 2005]  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070317170847/http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/2af-summary-eng Report 2006] &lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International estimates that at least 81 world governments currently practice torture, some of them openly.&lt;ref name="Amnesty08"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |title=Report 08: At a Glance |year=2008 |accessdate=22 October 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708202906/http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |archivedate = 8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

===International level===

====UN Convention Against Torture====
The [[United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]], which is currently in force since 26 June 1987, provides a broad definition of torture. Article 1.1 of the UN Convention Against Torture reads:
{{blockquote|For the purpose of this Convention, the term "torture" means any act by which severe [[pain]] or [[suffering]], whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him, or a third person, information or a [[Confession (law)|confession]], punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or [[intimidating]] or [[Coercion|coercing]] him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a [[public official]] or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/39/a39r046.htm|title=A/RES/39/46. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|website=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This definition was restricted to apply only to nations and to government-sponsored torture and clearly limits the torture to that perpetrated, directly or indirectly, by those acting in an official capacity, such as [[government agency|government personnel]], [[law enforcement officers|law enforcement personnel]], [[medical personnel]], [[military personnel]], or [[politicians]]. It appears to exclude:
# torture perpetrated by [[gang]]s, [[hate group]]s, [[rebellion|rebel]]s, or [[terrorist]]s who ignore national or international mandates;
# random violence during war; and
# punishment allowed by national laws, even if the punishment uses techniques similar to those used by torturers such as [[mutilation]], [[flagellation|whipping]], or [[corporal punishment]] when practiced as [[criminal justice|lawful punishment]]. Some professionals in the torture rehabilitation field believe that this definition is too restrictive and that the definition of politically motivated torture should be broadened to include all acts of organized violence.&lt;ref&gt;James Jaranson, "The Science and Politics of Rehabilitating Torture Survivors," in ''Caring for Victims of Torture,'' edited by Michael K. Popkin, Amer Psychiatric Pub Inc.1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Declaration of Tokyo====

An even broader definition was used in the 1975 [[Declaration of Tokyo]] regarding the participation of medical professionals in acts of torture:

:For the purpose of this Declaration, torture is defined as the deliberate, systematic or wanton infliction of physical or mental suffering by one or more persons acting alone or on the orders of any authority, to force another person to yield information, to make a confession, or for any other reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/index.html World Medical Association, ''Declaration of Tokyo,'' 1975.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218203758/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/index.html |date=18 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition includes torture as part of [[domestic violence]] or ritualistic abuse, as well as in criminal activities.

====Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court====
The [[Rome Statute]] is the [[treaty]] that set up the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC). The treaty was adopted at a diplomatic conference in Rome on 17 July 1998 and went into effect on 1 July 2002. The Rome Statute provides a simplest definition of torture regarding the prosecution of [[war criminals]] by the International Criminal Court. Paragraph 1 under Article 7(e) of the Rome Statute provides that:

{{quote|"Torture" means the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm ROME STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT], INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, 17 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture====

The [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]], which is in force since 28 February 1987, defines torture more expansively than the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Article 2 of the Inter-American Convention reads:

{{quote|For the purposes of this Convention, torture shall be understood to be any act intentionally performed whereby physical or mental pain or suffering is inflicted on a person for purposes of criminal investigation, as a means of intimidation, as personal punishment, as a preventive measure, as a penalty, or for any other purpose. Torture shall also be understood to be the use of methods upon a person intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish.

The concept of torture shall not include physical or mental pain or suffering that is inherent in or solely the consequence of lawful measures, provided that they do not include the performance of the acts or use of the methods referred to in this article.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/English/Treaties/a-51.html Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture], Organization of American States, 9 December 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Amnesty International====

Since 1973, [[Amnesty International]] has adopted the simplest, broadest definition of torture. It reads:

:Torture is the systematic and deliberate infliction of acute pain by one person on another, or on a third person, in order to accomplish the purpose of the former against the will of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act40/001/1984/en/ Amnesty International, (1973) ''Torture in the Eighties.'' USA Edition. Amnesty International Publication.] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal level===

====United States====

=====U.S. Code § 2340=====
[[Title 18 of the United States Code]] contains the definition of torture in 18 U.S.C. § 2340, which is only applicable to persons committing or attempting to commit torture outside of the United States.&lt;ref name="LGT"&gt;{{USC|18|2340A}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It reads:
{{quote|As used in this chapter—
:(1) “torture” means an act committed by a person acting under the [[color of law]] specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control;
:(2) “severe mental pain or suffering” means the prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from—
:: (A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering;
:: (B) the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;
:: (C) the threat of imminent death; or
:: (D) the threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality; and
: (3) “United States” means the several [[U.S. state|states]] of the United States, the [[District of Columbia]], and the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealths]], [[Territories of the United States|territories, and possessions of the United States]].}}

In order for the United States to assume control over this jurisdiction, the alleged offender must be a U.S. national or the alleged offender must be present in the United States, irrespective of the nationality of the victim or alleged offender. Any person who conspires to commit an offense shall be subject to the same penalties (other than the penalty of death) as the penalties prescribed for an actual act or attempting to commit an act, the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.&lt;ref name="LGT"/&gt;

=====Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991=====
The [[Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991]] provides remedies to individuals who are victims of torture by persons acting in an official capacity of any foreign nation. The definition is similar to the U.S. Code § 2340, which reads:
{{quote|(b) TORTURE.—For the purposes of this Act—
:(1) the term "torture" means any act, directed against an individual in the offender's custody or physical control, by which severe pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering arising only from or inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions), whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on that individual for such purposes as obtaining from that individual or a third person information or a confession, punishing that individual for an act that individual or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, intimidating or coercing that individual or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind; and
:2) mental pain or suffering refers to prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from—
::(A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering;
::(B) the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;
::(C) the threat of imminent death; or
::(D) the threat that another individual will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-106/pdf/STATUTE-106-Pg73.pdf|title=PUBLIC LAW 102-256 — MAR. 12, 1992|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
{{Further information|History of human rights}}
In the study of the history of torture, some authorities rigidly divide the history of torture ''per se'' from the history of capital punishment, while noting that most forms of capital punishment are extremely painful. Torture grew into an ornate discipline, where calibrated violence served two functions: to investigate and produce confessions and to attack the body as a form of punishment. Entire populaces of towns would show up to witness an execution by torture in the public square. Those who had been "spared" torture were commonly locked barefooted into the stocks, where children took delight in rubbing feces into their hair and mouths.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Scott, ''A History of Torture'' (London: Merchant, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberately painful methods of torture and execution for severe crimes were taken for granted as part of justice until the development of [[Humanism]] in [[17th century philosophy]], and "[[cruel and unusual punishment]]" came to be denounced in the [[English Bill of Rights]] of 1689. The [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the [[western world]] further developed the idea of universal [[human rights]]. The adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 marks the recognition at least nominally of a general ban of torture by all UN member states.

Its effect in practice is limited, however, as the Declaration is not ratified officially and does not have legally binding character in international law, but is rather considered part of [[customary international law]]. Several countries still practice torture today. Some countries have legally codified it, and others have claimed that it is not practiced, while maintaining the use of torture in secret.&lt;ref&gt;"Nigeria's Torture Chambers Exposed in New Report." ''Amnesty''. September. 2014. Accessed 20 July. 2017. https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/09/nigeria-s-torture-chambers-exposed-new-report/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the days when Roman law prevailed throughout Europe, torture has been regarded as subtending three ''classes'' or ''degrees'' of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;A. Hirsch, ''ed.'', ''The Book of Torture and Executions'' (Toronto: Golden Books, 1944).&lt;/ref&gt; ''First-degree'' torture typically took the forms of whipping and beating but did not mutilate the body. The most prevalent modern example is [[bastinado]], a technique of beating or whipping the soles of the bare feet. ''Second-degree'' torture consisted almost entirely of crushing devices and procedures, including exceptionally clever screw presses or "bone vises" that crushed thumbs, toes, knees, feet, even teeth and skulls in a wide variety of ways. A wide array of [[Boot (torture)|"boots"]]—-machines variously and ingeniously designed to slowly crush feet—-are quite representative. Finally, ''third-degree'' tortures savagely mutilated the body in numerous dreadful ways, incorporating spikes, blades, boiling oil, and extremely carefully controlled fire. The serrated iron tongue shredder; the red-hot copper basin for destroying eyesight ([[abacination]], ''q.v.''); and the stocks that forcibly held the prisoner's naked feet, glistening with lard, directly over red-hot coals ([[foot roasting]], ''q.v.'') until the skin and foot muscles were burnt black and the bones fell to ashes are examples of torture in the third degree.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

[[File:Flaying of rebels.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Assyria]]ns skinning or flaying their prisoners alive]]
Judicial torture was probably first applied in Persia. Over time torture has been used as a means of reform, inducing public terror, interrogation, spectacle, and sadistic pleasure. The [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] used torture for interrogation. Until the 2nd century AD, torture was used only on [[slave]]s (with a few exceptions).&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger. ''Epistulae'' : X.96.5: "''Hunc abstinentia sanctitate, quoad viridis aetas, vicit et fregit; novissime cum senectute ingravescentem viribus animi sustinebat, cum quidem incredibiles cruciatus et indignissima tormenta pateretur.''"&lt;/ref&gt; After this point it began to be extended to all members of the [[Proletariat|lower classes]].&lt;ref&gt;de Ste. Croix, Geoffrey Ernst Maurice. ''Christian Persecution, Martyrdom, and Orthodoxy''. 2006. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A slave's testimony was admissible ''only'' if extracted by torture, on the assumption that slaves could not be trusted to reveal the truth voluntarily. This torture occurred to break the bond between a master and his slave. Slaves were thought to be incapable of lying under torture.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Edward. Torture. New York: Basil Blackwell Inc., 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===

[[File:DublinTrinityCollegeMSEi40LifeAlbanFol45rMartyrdomAmphibalus.jpg|thumb|Torture of [[Christian martyrs]]]]
Medieval and early modern European courts used torture, depending on the crime of the accused and his or her social status. Torture was deemed a legitimate means to extract confessions or to obtain the names of accomplices or other information about a crime, although many confessions were greatly invalid due to the victim being forced to confess under great agony and pressure. It was permitted by law only if there was already [[half-proof]] against the accused.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001, 26-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Torture was used in continental Europe to obtain [[corroborating evidence]] in the form of a confession when other evidence already existed.&lt;ref&gt;Langbein, John H., "Torture and Plea Bargaining" (1978). ''Faculty Scholarship Series''. Paper 543.
http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/543&lt;/ref&gt; Often, defendants already sentenced to death would be tortured to force them to disclose the names of accomplices. Torture in the [[Medieval Inquisition]] began in 1252 with a papal bull [[Ad extirpanda|Ad Extirpanda]] and ended in 1816 when another [[papal bull]] forbade its use.

A highly esteemed torture in the times of the Inquisition as a good means of interrogating "taciturn" heretics and wizards was the interrogation chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com/#portfolio|title=Please visit our colleagues in Bruges!|website=torturemuseumamsterdam.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133744/http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com/#portfolio|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture was usually conducted in secret, in underground dungeons. By contrast, torturous executions were typically public, and woodcuts of English prisoners being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] show large crowds of spectators, as do paintings of Spanish [[auto-da-fé]] executions, in which heretics were burned at the stake. Torture was also used during this time period as a means of reform, spectacle, to induce fear into the public, and most popularly as a punishment for treason.

Medieval torture devices were varied. One old English chronicle from the Early Medieval period reads, "They hanged them by the thumbs, or by the head, and hung fires on their feet; they put knotted strings about their heads, and writhed them so that it went to the brain ... Some they put in a chest that was short, and narrow, and shallow, and put sharp stones therein, and pressed the man therein, so that they broke all his limbs ... I neither can nor may tell all the wounds or all the tortures which they inflicted on wretched men in this land." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bately|first= Janet M.|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition.

Limb-smashing and drowning were also popular medieval tortures. Specific devices were also created and used during this time, including the rack, the Pear (also mentioned in Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1811) as "Choak [''sic.''] Pears," and described as being "formerly used in Holland."), [[thumbscrew (torture)|thumbscrew]]s, animals like rats, the [[iron chair]], and the [[cat o nine tails]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5402/5402.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern period===
[[File:Lingchi (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Lingchi]] – execution by [[slow slicing]] – in Beijing around 1904.]]

During the early modern period, the [[torture of witches]] took place. In 1613, [[Anton Praetorius]] described the situation of the prisoners in the dungeons in his book ''Gründlicher Bericht Von Zauberey und Zauberern'' (''Thorough Report about Sorcery and Sorcerers''). He was one of the first to protest against all means of torture.

While secular courts often treated suspects ferociously, [[Will Durant|Will]] and Ariel Durant argued in ''The Age of Faith'' that many of the most vicious procedures were inflicted upon pious [[heresy|heretics]] by even more pious friars. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] gained a reputation as some of the most fearsomely innovative torturers in medieval Spain.

Torture was continued by [[Protestants]] during the [[Renaissance]] against teachers who they viewed as [[Heresy|heretics]]. In 1547 [[John Calvin]] had [[Jacques Gruet]] arrested in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. Under torture he confessed to several crimes including writing an anonymous letter left in the pulpit which threatened death to Calvin and his associates.&lt;ref name=Monter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monter|first=E.

In England the trial by [[jury]] developed considerable freedom in evaluating evidence and condemning on [[circumstantial evidence]], making torture to extort confessions unnecessary. For this reason in England a regularized system of judicial torture never existed and its use was limited to political cases. Torture was in theory not permitted under English law, but in [[Tudors|Tudor]] and early [[Stuarts|Stuart]] times, under certain conditions, torture was used in England. For example, the confession of [[Marc Smeaton]] at the trial of [[Anne Boleyn]] was presented in written form only, either to hide from the court that Smeaton had been tortured on [[Rack (torture)|the rack]] for four hours, or because [[Thomas Cromwell]] was worried that he would recant his confession if cross-examined. When [[Guy Fawkes]] was arrested for his role in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605 he was tortured until he revealed all he knew about the plot. This was not so much to extract a confession, which was not needed to prove his guilt, but to extract from him the names of his fellow conspirators. By this time torture was not routine in England and a special warrant from King [[James I of England|James I]] was needed before he could be tortured. The wording of the warrant shows some concerns for humanitarian considerations, specifying that the severity of the methods of interrogation were to be increased only gradually until the interrogators were sure that Fawkes had told all he knew. In the end this did not help Fawkes much as he was broken on the only rack in England, which was in the [[Tower of London]].

The [[privy council]] attempted to have [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]] who stabbed [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] to death in 1628 questioned under torture on the rack, but the judges resisted, unanimously declaring its use to be contrary to the [[English law|laws of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jardine|first=David|authorlink=David Jardine (barrister)|title=A Reading on the Use of Torture in the Criminal Law of England|publisher=Baldwin and Cradock|location=London|year=1837|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torture was abolished in England around 1640 (except ''[[peine forte et dure]]'', which was abolished in 1772).

In [[Colonial America]], women were sentenced to the [[stocks]] with wooden clips on their tongues or subjected to the "[[dunking stool]]" for the gender-specific crime of talking too much.&lt;ref&gt;Brizendine, Louann ''The Female Brain'' Broadway Books. New York. 2006 pg 36&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Native American peoples, especially in the area that later became the eastern half of the United States, engaged in the sacrificial torture of war captives.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Captives in American Indian Wars]]&lt;/ref&gt; And Spanish colonial officials in what is today the southwestern United States and northern Mexico often resorted to torture to extract confessions from rebellious Native Americans, as evidenced by the case of the Pima leader Joseph Romero 'Canito' in 1686.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/553394 |title=Torture in Colonial Spain's Northwestern Frontier: The Case of Joseph Romero "Canito," 1686 |journal=Journal of the Southwest |volume=56 |issue=2 |last=Daughters |first=Anton |date=2014-08-28|pages=233–251 |doi=10.1353/jsw.2014.0009 |access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 17th century the number of incidents of judicial torture decreased in many European regions. [[Johann Graefe]] in 1624 published ''Tribunal Reformation'', a case against torture. [[Cesare Beccaria]], an Italian lawyer, published in 1764 "An Essay on Crimes and Punishments", in which he argued that torture unjustly punished the innocent and should be unnecessary in proving guilt. [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) also fiercely condemned torture in some of his essays.

While in Egypt in 1798, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] wrote to Major-General Berthier regarding the validity of torture as an interrogation tool:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The barbarous custom of whipping men suspected of having important secrets to reveal must be abolished. It has always been recognized that this method of interrogation, by putting men to the torture, is useless. The wretches say whatever comes into their heads and whatever they think one wants to believe. Consequently, the Commander-in-Chief forbids the use of a method which is contrary to reason and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte, ''Letters and Documents of Napoleon, Volume I: The Rise to Power'', selected and translated by John Eldred Howard (London: The Cresset Press, 1961), 274.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

European states abolished torture from their statutory law in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. England abolished torture in about 1640 (except [[peine forte et dure]], which England only abolished in 1772), Scotland in 1708, [[Prussia]] in 1740, Denmark around 1770, Russia in 1774, [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1776, Italy &lt;!--anachronism; Italy, as a unified state, didn't exist until 1861--&gt; in 1786, France in 1789, and [[Baden]] in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/hcc4/htm/i.vi.viii.htm History of the Christian Church, Volume IV: Mediaeval Christianity.

The last European jurisdictions to abolish legal torture were Portugal (1828) and the canton of [[Glarus]] in Switzerland (1851).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=O-Y6kc3Fr-MC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Russia+torture+1801#v=onepage&amp;q=Russia%20torture%201801&amp;f=false%7ctitle=Torture%7cwork=google.com|title=Torture|website=google.com|isbn=978-0812215991|last1=Peters|first1=Edward|date=October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of torture===
[[File:Modocs Scalping and Torturing Prisoners.jpg|thumb|[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] [[scalping]] and torturing prisoners, published in May 1873]]
Tortures included the chevalet, in which an accused witch sat on a pointed metal horse with weights strung from her feet.&lt;ref name="Naish p27"&gt;Camille Naish, ''Death Comes To The Maiden: Sex and Execution 1431-1933'' (London: Routledge, 1991), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual humiliation torture included forced sitting on red-hot stools.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Charles Lea, ''Witchcraft'', pg 236 as quoted in Camille Naish, ''Death Comes To The Maiden: Sex and Execution 1431-1933'' (London: Routledge, 1991), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Gresillons, also called pennywinkis in Scotland, or pilliwinks, crushed the tips of fingers and toes in a vise-like device.&lt;ref name="HRTR p120"&gt;H.R. Trevor-Roper, ''The European Witch-Craze of The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries and Other Essays,'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1969), 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish Boot, or "leg-screw", used mostly in Germany and Scotland, was a steel boot that was placed over the leg of the accused and was tightened. The pressure from the squeezing of the boot would break the shin bone in pieces. An anonymous Scotsman called it "The most severe and cruel pain in the world".&lt;ref name="HRTR p121"&gt;H.R. Trevor-Roper, ''The European Witch-Craze of The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries and Other Essays,'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1969), 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Ingenious variants of the Spanish boot were also designed to slowly crush feet between iron plates armed with terrifying spikes. The echelle more commonly known as the "ladder" or "rack" was a long table that the accused would lie upon and be stretched violently. The torture was used so intensely that on many occasions the victim's limbs would be pulled out of the socket and, at times, the limbs would even be torn from the body entirely. On some special occasions a tortillon was used in conjunction with the ladder which would severely squeeze and mutilate the genitals at the same time as the stretching was occurring.&lt;ref name="HRTR p120"/&gt; Similar to the ladder was the "lift". It too stretched the limbs of the accused; in this instance however the victim's feet were strapped to the ground and their arms were tied behind their back before a rope was tied to their hands and lifted upwards. This caused the arms to break before the portion of the stretching began.&lt;ref name="HRTR p121"/&gt; Finally, the judicial system of King James favored the use of the turkas, an ingenious and savage iron instrument for destroying the nails of the fingers and toes. The sharp point of the instrument was first pushed under the nail to the root, splitting the nail down the centerline. Pincers then grabbed either edge of the destroyed nail and slowly tore it away from the nail bed.  Other common tortures included the strappado, a system of weights and pulleys with which the prisoner was trussed up and jerked in order to dislocate his limbs; the water torture, by which he was maintained at the very edge of drowning; and the so-called torture by fire, in which the bare feet, immobilized in an iron stocks and smeared with lard, were slowly barbecued over red-hot coals.

===Since 1948===

{{Main article|Use of torture since 1948}}

Modern sensibilities have been shaped by a profound reaction to the [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] committed by the [[Axis Powers]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] in the [[Second World War]], which have led to a sweeping international rejection of most if not all aspects of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Elihu Lauterpacht, C. J. Greenwood ''International Law Reports'', Cambridge University Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0-521-66122-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-66122-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=_mutsUVLw7gC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139 p. 139 section 189]&lt;/ref&gt; Even as many states engage in torture, few wish to be described as doing so, either to their own citizens or to the international community. A variety of devices bridge this gap, including state [[plausible deniability|denial]], "[[secret police]]", "[[need to know]]", a denial that given treatments are torturous in nature, appeal to various laws (national or international), the use of [[judicial jurisdiction|jurisdictional argument]] and the claim of "overriding need". Throughout history and today, many states have engaged in torture, albeit unofficially. Torture ranges from physical, psychological, political, interrogations techniques, and also includes rape of anyone outside of law enforcement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Broken Spirits: The Treatment of Traumatized Asylum Seekers, Refugees, War ...

According to scholar [[Ervand Abrahamian]], although there were several decades of prohibition of torture that spread from Europe to most parts of the world, by the 1980s, the taboo against torture was broken and torture "returned with a vengeance," propelled in part by television and an opportunity to break political prisoners and broadcast the resulting public recantations of their political beliefs for "ideological warfare, political mobilization, and the need to win 'hearts and minds.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Tortured+confessions+%22hearts+and+minds%22&amp;safe=active#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Tortured+confessions+abrahamian+%22hearts+and+minds%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=e169c8353451e3d9 Tortured confessions: prisons and public recantations in modern Iran] - Page 3
&lt;/ref&gt;
In the years 2004 and 2005, over 16 countries were documented using torture.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/|title=Human Rights Watch - Defending Human Rights Worldwide|website=hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to bring global awareness, Human Rights Watch, has created an internet site to alert people to news and multimedia publications about torture occurring worldwide.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt; The International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims [IRCT] made a global analysis of torture based on [Amnesty International, 2001], [Human Rights Watch, 2003], [United Nations, 2002], [U.S. Department of State, 2002] yearly human rights reports. These reports showed that torture and ill treatment are consistently report based on all four sources in 32 countries. At least two reports the use of torture and ill treatment in at least 80 countries. These reports confirm the assumption that torture occurs in a quarter of the world's countries on a regular basis. This global prevalence of torture is estimated on the magnitude of particular high-risk groups and the amount of torture used by these groups. "Such groups comprise refugees and persons who are or have been under torture." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
According to professor Darius Rejali, although dictatorships may have used tortured "more, and more indiscriminately", it was modern democracies, "the United States, Britain, and France" who "pioneered and exported techniques that have become the lingua franca of modern torture: methods that leave no marks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2007/12/16/torture_american_style/?page=1|title=Torture, American style|website=Boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of torture used as the oppression against political opponents or could be a part of criminal investigation or interrogation techniques in order to obtain the desired information and keep law enforcement empowered over everyday citizens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The modern concept of torture methods that leave no physical evidence is noted in 1995 by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [[DSM-IV]] within the changing definition of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder [[PTSD]]. This revised definition included psychological torture stating: "Expresses concern that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders definition of posttraumatic stress disorder does not include those forms of psychological torture in which the physical integrity of a person is not threatened. It is suggested that any diagnostic criterion that characterizes the traumatic stressors leading to PTSD should be expressed in such a way that psychological forms of torture are included."&lt;ref&gt;[Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV-TR.. 4th ed. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1995, the sweeping definition of changes from 'any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether ''mental'' or ''physical'', is intentionally inflicted on a person' to including the terms ''psychological torture'' and including examples such as, interrogation techniques range from sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, fear and humiliation to severe sexual and cultural humiliation and use of threats and phobias to induce fear of death or injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reyes|first=Hernan|title=The Worst Scars are in the Mind: Psychological Torture|journal=The International Review of the Red Cross|year=2007|volume=89|issue=867|pages=591–617|doi=10.1017/s1816383107001300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AbuGhraibAbuse-standing-on-box.jpg|thumb|[[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]].]]
Torture still occurs in a small number{{cn|date=November 2018}} of liberal democracies despite several international treaties such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[UN Convention Against Torture]] making torture illegal. Despite such international conventions, torture cases continue to arise such as the 2004 [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal committed by personnel of the [[United States Army]]. The [[U.S. Constitution]] and [[U.S. law]] prohibits the use of torture, yet such human rights violations occurred during the [[War on Terror]] under the euphemism [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|Enhanced interrogation]]. The United States revised the previous torture policy in 2009 under the Obama Administration. This revision revokes the Executive Order 13440 of 20 July 2007, under which the incident at Abu Ghraib and prisoner abuse occurred. Executive Order 13491 of 22 January 2009 further defines United States policy on torture and interrogation techniques in an attempt to further prevent another torture incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations|title=Executive Order 13491 -- Ensuring Lawful Interrogations|website=The White House|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218212240/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet apparently the practice continues, albeit outsourced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apnews.com/4925f7f0fa654853bd6f2f57174179fe In Yemen's secret prisons, UAE tortures and US interrogates] Associated Press, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the findings of Dr. Christian Davenport of the [[University of Notre Dame]], Professor William Moore of [[Florida State University]], and David Armstrong of [[Oxford University]] during their torture research, evidence suggests that non-governmental organizations have played the most determinant factor for stopping torture once it gets started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davenport|first=Christian|title=Helsinki Commission Hearing|url=http://www.csce.gov/index.cfm?Fuseaction=ContentRecords.ViewWitness&amp;ContentRecord_id=907&amp;ContentType=D&amp;ContentRecordType=D&amp;ParentType=H&amp;CFID=5892559&amp;CFTOKEN=28254175|website=Hearing: "Is It Torture Yet?"|publisher=US Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|accessdate=21 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118231903/http://www.csce.gov/index.cfm?Fuseaction=ContentRecords.ViewWitness&amp;ContentRecord_id=907&amp;ContentType=D&amp;ContentRecordType=D&amp;ParentType=H&amp;CFID=5892559&amp;CFTOKEN=28254175|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary research suggests that it is civil society, not government institutions, that can stop torture once it has begun. This inability to control abuse and torture in society creates an imperfect Democracy non-compliant with internationally agreed upon standards for civil and political rights.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many organizations serve to expose widespread human rights violations and hold individuals accountable to the [[international community]].

===Historical methods of execution and capital punishment===
{{Main article|List of methods of capital punishment}}
{{See also|Execution}}

For most of recorded history, capital punishments were often cruel and inhumane. Severe historical penalties include [[breaking wheel]], [[boiling to death]], [[flaying]], [[slow slicing]], [[disembowelment]], [[crucifixion]], [[impalement]], [[Crushing (execution)|crushing]], [[stoning]], [[execution by burning]], [[dismemberment]], [[sawing (torture)|sawing]], [[decapitation]], [[scaphism]], or [[necklacing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950826,00.html|title=The Death Penalty :Revenge Is the Mother of Invention|date=24 January 1983|website=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Slow slicing'', or ''death by/of a thousand cuts'', was a form of [[execution]] used in China from roughly 900 AD to its abolition in 1905. According to apocryphal lore, ''líng che'' began when the torturer, wielding an extremely sharp knife, began by putting out the eyes, rendering the condemned incapable of seeing the remainder of the torture and, presumably, adding considerably to the psychological terror of the procedure. Successive rather minor cuts chopped off ears, nose, tongue, fingers, toes, and such before proceeding to grosser cuts that removed large collops of flesh from more sizable parts, e.g., thighs and shoulders. The entire process was said to last three days, and to total 3,600 cuts. The heavily carved bodies of the deceased were then put on a parade for a show in the public. More typical was to bribe the executioner to administer hasty death to the victim after a small number of dramatic slices inflicted for showmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|title=Death by a Thousand Cuts at Chinese Arts Centre until 23rd March|website=manchestereventsguide.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418031632/http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|archivedate=18 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, H. (1927). ''Genghis Khan: Emperor of all men''. (New York: American Reprint Co.)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Impalement'' was a method of torture and [[execution (legal)|execution]] whereby a person is pierced with a long stake. The penetration can be through the sides, from the [[rectum]], or through the [[Human mouth|mouth]] or [[vagina]]. This method would lead to slow, painful, death. Often, the victim was hoisted into the air after partial impalement. Gravity and the victim's own struggles would cause him to slide down the pole. Death could take many days. Impalement was frequently practiced in Asia and Europe throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Vlad III Dracula]] and [[Ivan the Terrible]] have passed into legend as major users of the method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9382120/Dracula Dracula - Britannica Concise] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''breaking wheel'' was a torturous [[capital punishment]] device used in the [[Middle Ages]] and early modern times for public execution by [[Club (weapon)|cudgeling]] to death, especially in France and Germany. In France the condemned were placed on a cart-wheel with their limbs stretched out along the spokes over two sturdy wooden beams. The wheel was made to slowly revolve. Through the openings between the spokes, the executioner hit the victim with an iron hammer that could easily break the victim's bones. This process was repeated several times per limb. Once his bones were broken, he was left on the wheel to die. It could take hours, even days, before shock and dehydration caused death. The punishment was abolished in Germany as late as 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Wheel, Breaking on the |volume=28 |page=586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The word 'torture' comes from the French ''torture'', originating in the [[Late Latin]] ''tortura'' and ultimately deriving the [[past participle]] of ''torquere'' meaning 'to twist'.&lt;ref name="isbn0877797137 "&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary, 10th Edition |publisher=Merriam-Webster |location=Springfield, Mass |year=1999 |page= 1246|isbn=978-0-87779-713-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The word is also used loosely to describe more ordinary discomforts that would be accurately described as tedious rather than painful; for example, "making this spreadsheet was torture!"

According to Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', torture was also referred to as "the question" in seventeenth century France. This term is derived from torture's use in criminal cases: as the accused is tortured, the torturers would typically ask questions to the accused in an effort to learn more about the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.891 | title = Question or Torture | accessdate = 1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious perspectives==

===Roman Catholic Church===
{{main article|Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition|Medieval Inquisition}}
{{see also|Christian views on Hell#Roman Catholicism}}

Throughout the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Catholic Church]] generally opposed the use of torture during criminal proceedings. This is evident from a letter sent by Pope [[Pope Nicholas I|Saint Nicholas]] the Great to [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Khan Boris]] of the Bulgars in AD 866, delivered in response to a series of questions from the former and concerned with the ongoing [[Christianization of Bulgaria|Christianisation of Bulgaria]]. ''Ad Consulta Vestra'' (as entitled in Latin) declared judicial torture to be a practice that was fundamentally contrary to [[divine law]].&lt;ref name="legacy.fordham.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Responses of Pope Nicholas I to the Questions of the Bulgars, 866|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/866nicholas-bulgar.asp=27}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pontiff made it a point of incontrovertible truth that, in his own words: "confession [to a crime] should be spontaneous, not compelled, and should not be elicited with violence but rather proferred voluntarily". He argued for an alternative and more humane procedure, in which the accused person would be required to swear an oath of innocence upon the "holy Gospel that he did not commit [the crime] which is laid against him and from that moment on the matter is [to be put] at an end".&lt;ref name="legacy.fordham.edu"/&gt; Nicholas likewise stressed in the same letter that "those who refuse to receive the good of Christianity and sacrifice and bend their knees to idols" were to be moved towards accepting the true faith "by warnings, exhortations, and reason rather than by force," emphasising to this end that "violence should by no means be inflicted upon them to make them believe. For everything which is not voluntary, cannot be good".&lt;ref name="legacy.fordham.edu"/&gt;

In the High Middle Ages the Church became increasingly concerned with the perceived threat posed to its existence by resurgent heresy, in particular that attributed to a purported sect known as the [[Cathars]]. Catharism had its roots in the Paulician movement in Armenia and eastern Byzantine Anatolia and the [[Bogomils]] of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. Consequently, the Church began to enjoin secular rulers to extirpate heresy (lest the ruler’s Catholic subjects be absolved from their allegiance), and in order to coerce heretics or witnesses "into confessing their errors and accusing others," decided to sanction the use of methods of torture, already utilized by secular governments in other criminal procedures due to the [[Medieval Roman law|recovery of Roman Law]], in the medieval inquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canons of the Fourth Lateran Council, 1215|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.asp|website=canon 3|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SS Innocentius IV – Bulla 'Ad_Extirpanda'|url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/01p/1252-05-15,_SS_Innocentius_IV,_Bulla_%27Ad_Extirpanda%27,_EN.pdf|website=1252|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pope Innocent IV, in the Bull [[Ad extirpanda]] (15 May 1252), stipulated that the inquisitors were to "stop short of danger to life or limb".&lt;ref&gt;''Ad extirpanda'', quoted at [http://www.rtforum.org/lt/lt119.html ''The Roman Theological Forum'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Church's views regarding torture have changed drastically, largely reverting to the earlier stance. In 1953, in an address to the 6th International Congress of Penal Law, Pope Pius XII approvingly reiterated the position of Pope Nicholas the Great over a thousand years before him, when his predecessor had unilaterally opposed the use of judicial torture, stating: {{quotation|
Preliminary juridical proceedings must exclude physical and psychological torture and the use of drugs: first of all because they violate a natural right, even if the accused is indeed guilty, and secondly because all too often they give rise to erroneous results...About eleven hundred years ago, in 866, the great Pope Nicholas I replied in the following way to a question posed by a people which had just come into contact with Christianity...Who would not wish that, during the long period of time elapsed since then, justice had never laid this rule aside! The need to recall the warning given eleven hundred years ago is a sad sign of the miscarriages of juridical practice in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pope Pius XII: 6th International Congress of Penal Law |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gyIgwz_lDGkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=torture+pius+xii+nicholas#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|website=1252|isbn=9789287145147|last1=Carpentier|first1=Jean|last2=Council For Cultural Co-Operation|first2=Council of Europe|date=2001-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus, the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (published in 1994) condemns the use of torture as a grave violation of [[Human Rights]]. In No. 2297-2298 it states:

{{quotation|
Torture, which uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions, punish the guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary to respect for the person and for human dignity... In times past, cruel practices were commonly used by legitimate governments to maintain law and order, often without protest from the Pastors of the Church, who themselves adopted in their own tribunals the prescriptions of Roman law concerning torture. Regrettable as these facts are, the Church always taught the duty of clemency and mercy. She forbade clerics to shed blood. In recent times it has become evident that these cruel practices were neither necessary for public order, nor in conformity with the legitimate rights of the human person. On the contrary, these practices led to ones even more degrading. It is necessary to work for their abolition. We must pray for the victims and their tormentors. }}

===Sharia law===
The prevalent view among jurists of [[sharia law]] is that torture is permissible only for the maintenance of law and order.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Violations in some stricter jurisdictions include acts of public indecency or immorality, which can result in floggings. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Other sharia-derived punishments that might overlap with widely held notions of torture include the various forms of [[hudud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banchoff|first1=Thomas|title=Democracy and the New Religious Pluralism|date=2007|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Judaism===
Torture has no presence within [[halakha]]. There did once exist a system of [[capital and corporal punishment in Judaism]], as well as a [[Flagellation#Judaism|flagellation]] statute for non-capital offences, but it was all abolished by the [[Sanhedrin]] during the [[Second Temple period]].

[[Maimonides]] issued a ruling in the case of a man who was ordered by a [[Beth Din]] to divorce his wife and refuses, that "we coerce him until he states 'I want to.'"&lt;ref&gt;Maimoides; ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' Hilkhot Gerushin 2:20&lt;/ref&gt; This is only true in cases where specific grounds for the verdict exist.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowitz, Chaim;[http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/getart3.html "The New York State Get Bill and its Halachic Ramifications"]; ''Jewish Law Articles''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some activist rabbis had interpreted this statement to mean that torture could be applied against husbands in troubled marriages in order to force them into granting religious divorces to their wives.&lt;ref&gt;Samaha, Albert (4 December 2013) [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/bad-rabbi-tales-of-extortion-and-torture-depict-a-divorce-brokers-brutal-grip-on-the-orthodox-community-6440276 "Bad Rabbi: Tales of Extortion and Torture Depict a Divorce Broker's Brutal Grip on the Orthodox Community"], ''Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt; These rabbis were later implicated in the [[2013 New York divorce torture plot]].&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Reuven (22 April 2015) [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/orthodox-rabbi-guilty-kidnapping-beating-jewish-husbands-article-1.2193597/ "N.J.

==Laws against torture==
On 10 December 1948, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR). Article 5 states, "No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html Universal Declaration of Human Rights], United Nations, 10 December 1948&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, a number of other international treaties have been adopted to prevent the use of torture. The most notable treaties relating to torture are the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] and the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and their [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of 8 June 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/faq/torture-law-2011-06-24.htm |title=What does the law say about torture? |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations Convention Against Torture===
The [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] came into force in June 1987. The most relevant articles are Articles 1, 2, 3, and 16.

{{quotation|Article 1&lt;br /&gt;
1. For the purposes of this Convention, the word "torture" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.&lt;br /&gt;
2. This article is without prejudice to any international instrument or national legislation which does or may contain provisions of wider application.}}

{{quotation|Article 2&lt;br /&gt;
1. Each State Party shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territory under its jurisdiction.&lt;br /&gt;
2. No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of [[war]] or a threat of war, internal [[Failed state|political instability]] or any other [[State of emergency|public emergency]], may be invoked as a justification of torture.&lt;br /&gt;
3. An [[Superior Orders|order from a superior officer or a public authority]] may not be invoked as a justification of torture.}}

{{quotation|Article 3&lt;br /&gt;
1. No State Party shall expel, return ("refouler") or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.&lt;br /&gt;
2. For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights.}}

{{quotation|Article 16&lt;br /&gt;
1. Each State Party shall undertake to prevent in any territory under its jurisdiction other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture as defined in article I, when such acts are committed by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. In particular, the obligations contained in articles 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall apply with the substitution for references to torture of references to other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&lt;br /&gt;
2. The provisions of this Convention are without prejudice to the provisions of any other international instrument or national law which prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or which relates to extradition or expulsion.}}

{{Main article|International Criminal Court}}

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]], which established the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), provides for criminal prosecution of individuals responsible for [[genocide]], [[war crime]]s, and [[crimes against humanity]]. The statute defines torture as "intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions". Under Article 7 of the statute, torture may be considered a crime against humanity "when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack".&lt;ref&gt;Article 7 of the [http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm Rome Statute].

===Geneva Conventions===
The four [[Geneva Conventions]] provide protection for people who fall into enemy hands.
The conventions do not clearly divide people into [[combatant]] and [[non-combatant]] roles. The conventions refer to:
* "wounded and sick combatants or non-combatants"
* "civilian persons who take no part in hostilities, and who, while they reside in the zones, perform no work of a military character"&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention]], Article 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Members of the [[armed forces]] of a Party to the conflict as well as members of [[militias]] or [[Military volunteer|volunteer corps]] forming part of such armed forces"
* "Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized [[resistance movements]] belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this [[Military occupation|territory is occupied]]"
* "Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power"
* "Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of [[military aircraft]] crews, [[war correspondent]]s, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces"
* "Members of crews, including masters, pilots and apprentices, of the [[merchant marine]] and the crews of [[civil aircraft]] of the Parties to the conflict"
* "Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Third Geneva Convention|Third Geneva Convention]], Article 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[first Geneva Convention|first]] (GCI), [[second Geneva Convention|second]] (GCII), [[third Geneva Convention|third]] (GCIII), and [[fourth Geneva Convention|fourth]] (GCIV) Geneva Conventions are the four most relevant for the treatment of the victims of conflicts. All treaties states in Article 3, in similar wording, that in a non-international armed conflict, "Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms... shall in all circumstances be treated humanely." The treaty also states that there must not be any "violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, [[mutilation]], cruel treatment and torture" or "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:First Geneva Convention|First Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Second Geneva Convention|Second Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Third Geneva Convention|Third Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

GCI covers wounded combatants in an international armed conflict. Under Article 12, members of the armed forces who are sick or wounded "shall be respected and protected in all circumstances. They shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Party to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments".

GCII covers shipwreck survivors at sea in an international armed conflict. Under Article 12, persons "who are at sea and who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances, it being understood that the term "shipwreck" means shipwreck from any cause and includes forced landings at sea by or from aircraft. Such persons shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Parties to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments".

GCIII covers the treatment of [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) in an international armed conflict. In particular, Article 17 says that "No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind." POW status under GCIII has far fewer exemptions than "Protected Person" status under GCIV. Captured combatants in an international armed conflict automatically have the protection of GCIII and are POWs under GCIII unless they are determined by a competent tribunal to not be a POW (GCIII Article 5).

GCIV covers most [[civilian]]s in an international armed conflict, and says they are usually "Protected Persons" (see exemptions section immediately after this for those who are not). Under Article 32, civilians have the right to protection from "murder, torture, corporal punishments, mutilation and medical or scientific experiments...but also to any other measures of brutality whether applied by civilian or military agents."

====Geneva Convention IV exemptions====
GCIV provides an important exemption:
{{quotation|Where in the territory of a Party to the conflict, the latter is satisfied that an individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State, such individual person shall not be entitled to claim such rights and privileges under the present Convention [ie GCIV] as would ... be prejudicial to the security of such State ... In each case, such persons shall nevertheless be treated with humanity (GCIV Article 5)}}

Also, nationals of a State not bound by the Convention are not protected by it, and nationals of a neutral State in the territory of a combatant State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, cannot claim the protection of GCIV if their home state has normal diplomatic representation in the State that holds them (Article 4), as their diplomatic representatives can take steps to protect them. The requirement to treat persons with "humanity" implies that it is still prohibited to torture individuals not protected by the Convention.

The [[George W. Bush administration]] afforded fewer protections, under GCIII, to detainees in the "[[War on Terror]]" by codifying the legal status of an "[[unlawful combatant]]". If there is a question of whether a person is a lawful combatant, he (or she) must be treated as a POW "until their status has been determined by a competent tribunal" (GCIII Article 5). If the tribunal decides that he is an unlawful combatant, he is not considered a protected person under GCIII. However, if he is a protected person under GCIV he still has some protection under GCIV, and must be "treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present Convention" (GCIV Article 5).&lt;ref group=nb&gt;
"Every person in enemy hands must have some status under international law: he is either a prisoner of war and, as such, covered by the Third Convention, a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention, or again, a member of the medical personnel of the armed forces who is covered by the First Convention. ''There is no'' intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law. We feel that this is a satisfactory solution – not only satisfying to the mind, but also, and above all, satisfactory from the humanitarian point of view.", because in the opinion of the ICRC "If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered 'unlawful' or 'unprivileged' combatants or belligerents (the treaties of humanitarian law do not expressly contain these terms). They may be prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action" ([[Jean Pictet]] (ed.) – [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600007?OpenDocument Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (1958)] – 1994 reprint edition).

====Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions====
There are two additional protocols to the Geneva Convention: [[Protocol I]] (1977), relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts and [[Protocol II]] (1977), relating to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts. These clarify and extend the definitions in some areas, but to date many countries, including the United States, have either not signed them or have not ratified them.

[[Protocol I]] does not mention torture but it does affect the treatment of POWs and Protected Persons. In Article 5, the protocol explicitly involves "the appointment of Protecting Powers and of their substitute" to monitor that the Parties to the conflict are enforcing the Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080410223403/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol1.htm Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol 1)], Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol also broadens the definition of a lawful combatant in wars against "alien occupation, colonial domination and racist regimes" to include those who carry arms openly but are not wearing uniforms, so that they are now [[lawful combatant]]s and protected by the Geneva Conventions—although only if the Occupying Power has ratified Protocol I. Under the original conventions, combatants without a recognizable insignia could be treated as war criminals, and potentially be executed. It also mentions spies, and defines who is a mercenary. Mercenaries and spies are considered an unlawful combatant, and not protected by the same conventions.

[[Protocol II]] "develops and supplements Article 3 [relating to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts] common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 without modifying its existing conditions of application" (Article 1). Any person who does not take part in or ceased to take part in hostilities is entitled to humane treatment. Among the acts prohibited against these persons are, "Violence to the life, health and physical or mental well-being of persons, in particular murder as well as cruel treatment such as torture, mutilation or any form of corporal punishment" (Article 4.a), "Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, rape, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault" (Article 4.e), and "Threats to commit any of the foregoing acts" (Article 4.h).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080612085204/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol2.htm Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II)], Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Clauses in other articles implore humane treatment of enemy personnel in an internal conflict. These have a bearing on torture, but no other clauses explicitly mention torture.

===Other conventions===
In accordance with the optional [[UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]] (1955), ''"[[corporal punishment]], punishment by placing in a dark cell, and all cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments shall be completely prohibited as punishments for disciplinary offences."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080718003225/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_comp34.htm Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners], United Nations, Geneva, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], (16 December 1966), explicitly prohibits torture and ''"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment"'' by signatories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] United Nations, 16 December 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

;European agreements
[[File:10CFREU-Article4.jpg|right|thumb|Article 4 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] prohibits torture.]]

In 1950 during the [[Cold War]], the participating member states of the [[Council of Europe]] signed the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The treaty was based on the [[UDHR]]. It included the provision for a court to interpret the treaty, and Article 3 '''"Prohibition of torture"''' stated; ''"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm European Convention on Human Rights], 4 November 1950(with later protocols).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the [[five techniques]] of "[[sensory deprivation]]" were not torture as laid out in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, but were "''inhuman or degrading treatment''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/1.html Ireland v. United Kingdom, 1977]. (Case No. 5310/71)&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Uses of torture in recent times#United Kingdom|Accusations of use of torture by United Kingdom]] for details). This case occurred nine years before the United Nations Convention Against Torture came into force and had an influence on thinking about what constitutes torture ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Michael John Garcia (Legislative Attorney American Law Division) [http://www.ilw.com/immigdaily/news/2005,1223-crs.pdf U.N. Convention Against Torture (CAT):Overview and Application to Interrogation Techniques] [http://www.ilw.com/ CRS Report for Congress] 7 November 2005. pp. 13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 1987, the member states of the [[Council of Europe]], meeting at [[Strasbourg]], adopted the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] (ECPT). Two additional Protocols amended the Convention, which entered into force on 1 March 2002. The Convention set up the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] to oversee compliance with its provisions.

;Inter-American Convention
The [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]], currently ratified by 18 nations of the [[Americas]] and in force since 28 February 1987, defines torture more expansively than the United Nations Convention Against Torture.

{{quotation|For the purposes of this Convention, torture shall be understood to be any act intentionally performed whereby physical or mental pain or suffering is inflicted on a person for purposes of criminal investigation, as a means of intimidation, as personal punishment, as a preventive measure, as a penalty, or for any other purpose. Torture shall also be understood to be the use of methods upon a person intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish.

The concept of torture shall not include physical or mental pain or suffering that is inherent in or solely the consequence of lawful measures, provided that they do not include the performance of the acts or use of the methods referred to in this article.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"/&gt;}}

===Supervision of anti-torture treaties===
The [[Istanbul Protocol]], an official UN document, is the first set of international guidelines for documentation of torture and its consequences. It became a United Nations official document in 1999.

Under the provisions of [[OPCAT]] that entered into force on 22 June 2006 independent international and national bodies regularly visit places where people are deprived of their liberty, to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Each state that ratified the OPCAT, according to Article 17, is responsible for creating or maintaining at least one independent national preventative mechanism for torture prevention at the domestic level.

The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, citing Article 1 of the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture]], states that it will, "by means of visits, examine the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty with a view to strengthening, if necessary, the protection of such persons from torture and from inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/about.htm|title=About the CPT|website=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In times of armed conflict between a signatory of the Geneva Conventions and another party, delegates of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) monitor the compliance of signatories to the Geneva Conventions, which includes monitoring the use of torture. Human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]], the [[World Organization Against Torture]], and [[Association for the Prevention of Torture]] work actively to stop the use of torture throughout the world and publish reports on any activities they consider to be torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apt.ch/|title=Association for the Prevention of Torture|website=apt.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal law===
[[Sovereign state|States]] that ratified the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] have a treaty obligation to include the provisions into [[municipal law]]. The laws of many states therefore formally prohibit torture. However, such ''[[de jure]]'' legal provisions are by no means a proof that, ''[[de facto]]'', the signatory country does not use torture. To prevent torture, many legal systems have a [[right against self-incrimination]] or explicitly prohibit undue force when dealing with suspects.

The French 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], of constitutional value, prohibits submitting suspects to any hardship not necessary to secure his or her person.

The [[U.S. Constitution]] and [[U.S. law]] prohibits the use of unwarranted force or coercion against any person who is subject to interrogation, detention, or arrest. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] includes protection against [[self-incrimination]], which states that "[n]o person...shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself". This serves as the basis of the [[Miranda warning]], which [[Law enforcement in the United States|U.S. law enforcement personnel]] issue to individuals upon their arrest. Additionally, the U.S. Constitution's [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] forbids the use of "[[cruel and unusual punishments]]," which is widely interpreted as prohibiting torture. Finally, 18 U.S.C. § 2340&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|2340}} ''et seq.''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''et seq.'' define and forbid torture committed by U.S. nationals outside the United States or non-U.S. nationals who are present in the United States. As the United States recognizes [[customary international law]], or the [[law of nations]], the U.S. [[Alien Tort Claims Act]] and the [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] also provides legal remedies for victims of torture outside of the United States. Specifically, the status of torturers under the law of the United States, as determined by a famous legal decision in 1980, ''[[Filártiga v. Peña-Irala]]'', 630 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 876 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2d Cir.]] 1980), is that, "the torturer has become, like the [[maritime piracy|pirate]] and the [[slave trade]]r before him, [[hostis humani generis]], an enemy of all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Filártiga v. Peña-Irala |vol=630 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=876 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=1980 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/630/876/238132/ |accessdate=2017-01-06 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusion of evidence obtained under torture===

====International law====
Article 15 of the 1984 [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] specify that:

{{quotation|Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.}}

A similar provision is also found in Article 10 of the 1985 [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]]:

{{quotation|No statement that is verified as having been obtained through torture shall be admissible as evidence in a legal proceeding, except in a legal action taken against a person or persons accused of having elicited it through acts of torture, and only as evidence that the accused obtained such statement by such means.}}

These provisions have the double dissuasive effect of nullifying any utility in using torture with the purpose of eliciting confession, as well as confirming that should a person extract statements by torture, this can be used against him or her in criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Rights in Times of Conflict and Terrorism |author=Louise Doswald-Beck |page=220 |date=21 March 2011 |publisher=Praeger; 1 edition |isbn=978-0-1995-7894-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is because experience has shown that under torture, or even under a threat of torture, a person will say or do anything solely to avoid the pain. As a result, there is no way to know whether or not the resulting statement is actually correct. If any court relies on any evidence obtained from torture regardless of validity, it provides an incentive for state officials to force a confession, creating a marketplace for torture, both domestically and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apt.ch/en/evidence-obtained-through-torture/ |title=Exclusion of evidence obtained through torture |publisher=[[Association for the Prevention of Torture]] |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Within national borders====
Most states have prohibit their legal systems from accepting evidence that is extracted by torture. The question of the use of evidence obtained under torture has arisen in connection with prosecutions during the [[War on Terror]] in the United Kingdom and the United States.

=====United Kingdom=====
In 2003, the United Kingdom's Ambassador to [[Uzbekistan]], [[Craig Murray]], suggested that it was "wrong to use information gleaned from torture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1474852/The-envoy-silenced-after-telling-undiplomatic-truths.html|title=The envoy silenced after telling undiplomatic truths|last=Gedye|first=Robin|date=23 October 2004|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|quote=Murray fired off a memorandum to the Foreign Office last July suggesting that Britain's intelligence services were wrong to use information gleaned from torture victims|accessdate=26 August 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The unanimous [[House of Lords Judicial Committee|Law Lords]] judgment on 8 December 2005 confirmed this position. They ruled that, under English law tradition, "torture and its fruits" could not be used in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,15935,1662107,00.html Torture evidence inadmissible in UK courts, Lords rules],''[[The Guardian]]'', 8 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; But the information thus obtained could be used by the British police and security services as "it would be ludicrous for them to disregard information about a ticking bomb if it had been procured by torture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4510866.stm Torture ruling's international impact] by Jon Silverman [[BBC]] 8 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray's accusations did not lead to any investigation by his employer, the FCO, and he resigned after disciplinary action was taken against him in 2004. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office itself is being investigated by the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] because of accusations that it has victimized, bullied and intimidated its own staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1533100,00.html Foreign Office faces probe into 'manipulation'], Robert Winnett,''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', 20 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray later stated that he felt that he had unwittingly stumbled upon what has been called "torture by proxy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/content/?050214on_onlineonly01 Q &amp; A: Torture by Proxy] Jane Mayer answers question asked by Amy Davidson [[The New Yorker]] on 14 February 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709140152/http://www.newyorker.com/online/content/?050214on_onlineonly01 |date=9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that Western countries moved people to regimes and nations where it was known that information would be extracted by torture, and made available to them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Murray states that he was aware from August 2002 "that the CIA were bringing in detainees to [[Tashkent]] from [[Bagram Air Base|Bagram airport Afghanistan]], who were handed over to the [[Uzbek security services]] (SNB). I presumed at the time that these were all Uzbek nationals—that may have been a false presumption. I knew that the CIA were obtaining intelligence from their subsequent interrogation by the SNB." He goes on to say that he did not know at the time that any non-Uzbek nationals were flown to Uzbekistan and although he has studied the reports by several journalists and finds their reports credible he is not a firsthand authority on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/archives/2005/07/extraordinary_r_1.html Extraordinary Rendition] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728095612/http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/archives/2005/07/extraordinary_r_1.html |date=28 July 2012 }} on [http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/ Craig Murray's website], 11 July 2005 {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate on 7 July 2009, MP [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] accused the UK government of outsourcing torture, by allowing [[Rangzieb Ahmed]] to leave the country (even though they had evidence against him upon which he was later convicted for terrorism) to Pakistan, where it is said the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] was given the go ahead by the British intelligence agencies to torture Ahmed. Davis further accused the government of trying to gag Ahmed, stopping him coming forward with his accusations, after he had been imprisoned back in the UK. He said, there was "an alleged request to drop his allegations of torture: if he did that, they could get his sentence cut and possibly give him some money. If this request to drop the torture case is true, it is frankly monstrous. It would at the very least be a criminal misuse of the powers and funds under the Government's Contest strategy, and at worst a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Business&gt;Publications and Records &gt; Commons Publications &gt; Commons Hansard &gt; Daily Hansard -Debate|publisher=Parliament.uk|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/debtext/90707-0020.htm|accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States=====
In May 2008, [[Susan J. Crawford]], the [[Convening authority (court-martial)|official overseeing prosecutions]] before the [[Guantanamo military commissions]], declined to refer for trial the case of [[Mohammed al-Qahtani]] because she said, "we tortured [him]."&lt;ref name = "Qahtani Tortured"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5134328.stm Q&amp;A: Guantanamo detentions] BBC News, 22 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qhatani remains imprisoned at Guantanamo. Woodward, Bob [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/13/AR2009011303372.html Detainee Tortured, Says U.S. Official] Washington Post, 14 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford said that a combination of techniques with clear medical consequences amounted to the legal definition of torture, and that torture "tainted everything going forward."&lt;ref name = "Qahtani Tortured"/&gt;

On 28 October 2008, Guantanamo military judge [[Stephen R. Henley]] ruled that the government cannot use statements made as a result of torture in the military commission case against Afghan national [[Mohammed Jawad]]. The judge held that Jawad's alleged confession to throwing a grenade at two U.S. service members and an Afghan interpreter was obtained after armed Afghan officials on 17 December 2002,&lt;ref name=usatoday13Jan2009&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-01-13-torture-hearings_N.htm| title=Court hears arguments over detainee's confession| newspaper=USA Today | agency=Associated Press| date=13 January 2009 | accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; threatened to kill Jawad and his family. The government had previously told the judge that Jawad's alleged confession while in Afghan custody was central to the case against him. Hina Shamsi, staff attorney with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] National Security Project stated: "We welcome the judge's decision that death threats constitute torture and that evidence obtained as a result must be excluded from trial. Unfortunately, evidence obtained through torture and coercion is pervasive in military commission cases that, by design, disregard the most fundamental due process rights, and no single decision can cure that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yubanet.com/usa/Guantanamo-Judge-Rejects-Evidence-Obtained-Through-Torture-In-Jawad-Case.php#.VRJHGI56LLs|title=Guantanamo Judge Rejects Evidence Obtained Through Torture In Jawad Case|website=yubanet.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160011/http://yubanet.com/usa/Guantanamo-Judge-Rejects-Evidence-Obtained-Through-Torture-In-Jawad-Case.php#.VRJHGI56LLs|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, on 19 November, the judge again rejected evidence gathered through coercive interrogations in the military commission case against Afghan national Mohammed Jawad, holding that the evidence collected while Jawad was in U.S. custody on 17–18 December 2002, cannot be admitted in his trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/national-security/guantanamo-judge-throws-out-more-evidence-obtained-through-torture-jawad-case|title=Guantánamo Judge Throws Out More Evidence Obtained Through Torture In Jawad Case|website=American Civil Liberties Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because the U.S. interrogator had blindfolded and hooded Jawad in order to frighten him.&lt;ref&gt;usatoday13Jan2009&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 New York trial of [[Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani]] who was accused of complicity in the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya]], Judge [[Lewis A.

Torture has been criticized on humanitarian and moral grounds, on the grounds that evidence extracted by torture is unreliable, and because torture corrupts institutions that tolerate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/torture/ethics/wrong_2.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213004811/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/torture/ethics/wrong_2.shtml|archivedate=13 December 2007|title=Consequentialist reasons why torture is wrong|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides degrading the victim, torture debases the torturer: American advisors alarmed at torture by their South Vietnamese allies early in the [[Vietnam War]] concluded that "if a commander allowed his officers and men to fall in to these vices [they] would pursue them for their own sake, for the perverse pleasure they drew from them."&lt;ref name = "Bright Shining Lie"&gt;{{cite book| last =Sheehan| first = Neil| title =A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam| publisher =Random House | edition =first| year =1988| pages= 104, 105| isbn =978-0-394-48447-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequent degeneracy destroyed discipline and morale: "[a] soldier had to learn that he existed to uphold law and order, not to undermine it."&lt;ref name = "Bright Shining Lie"/&gt;

Organizations like [[Amnesty International]] argue that the universal legal prohibition is based on a universal philosophical consensus that torture and ill-treatment are repugnant, abhorrent, and immoral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Amnesty International|authorlink=Amnesty International|url=http://web.amnesty.org/pages/stoptorture-arguments-eng#question1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205141017/http://web.amnesty.org/pages/stoptorture-arguments-eng|archivedate=5 December 2007|title=Torture and ill-treatment: the arguments: 1.

The [[ticking time bomb scenario]], a [[thought experiment]], asks what to do to a captured terrorist who has placed a [[nuclear bomb]] in a populated area. If the terrorist is tortured, he may explain how to defuse the bomb. The scenario asks if it is ethical to torture the terrorist. A 2006 [[BBC]] poll held in 25 nations gauged support for each of the following positions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm|title=One third support some torture|publisher=BBC News|date=19 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Terrorists pose such an extreme threat that governments should be allowed to use some degree of torture if it may gain information that saves innocent lives.
*Clear rules against torture should be maintained because any use of torture is immoral and will weaken international human rights.
An average of 59% of people worldwide rejected torture. However, there was a clear divide between those countries with strong rejection of torture (such as Italy, where only 14% supported torture) and nations where rejection was less strong. Often this lessened rejection is found in countries severely and frequently threatened by terrorist attacks. E.g., Israel, despite its Supreme Court outlawing torture in 1999, showed 43% supporting torture, but 48% opposing, India showed 37% supporting torture and only 23% opposing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm ''Ibid'']: "''Israel has the largest percentage of those polled endorsing the use of a degree of torture on prisoners, with 43% saying they agreed that some degree of torture should be allowed.''" On the Israeli Supreme Court decision outlawing torture, see Judgment Concerning the Legality of the General Security Service’s Interrogation Methods, Supreme Court of Israel, 38 I.L.M. 1471 (1999), and other references at [http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss14/nagan.shtml#Heading300 law.harvard.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430213030/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm |date=30 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within nations there is a clear divide between the positions of members of different ethnic groups, religions, and political affiliations, sometimes reflecting distinctions between groups considering themselves threatened or victimized by terror acts and those from the alleged perpetrator groups. For example, the study found that among Jews in Israel 53% favored some degree of torture and only 39% wanted strong rules against torture while Muslims in Israel were overwhelmingly against any use of torture, unlike Muslims polled elsewhere. Differences in general political views also can matter. In one 2006 survey by the Scripps Center at Ohio University, 66% of Americans who identified themselves as strongly Republican supported torture, compared to 24% of those who identified themselves as strongly Democratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newspolls.org/articles/19606|title=New XHTML 1.0 Transitional Compliant Page|website=newspolls.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514083035/http://www.newspolls.org/articles/19606|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 U.S. survey 72% of American Catholics supported the use of torture in some circumstances compared to 51% of American secularists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/032406/032406h.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612093225/http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/032406/032406h.htm|title=Nation: Americans, especially Catholics, approve of torture|archivedate=12 June 2008|website=ncronline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Pew survey in 2009 similarly found that the religiously unaffiliated are the least likely (40 percent) to support torture, and that the more a person claims to attend church, the more likely he or she is to condone torture; among racial/religious groups, white evangelical Protestants were far and away the most likely (62 percent) to support inflicting pain as a tool of interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, Leonard (7 May 2009).

There are also different attitudes as to what constitutes torture, as revealed in an ABC News/Washington Post poll, where more than half of the Americans polled thought that techniques such as [[sleep deprivation]] were not torture.&lt;ref&gt;David Morris and Gary Langer ''[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=90051 Poll: Torture Methods Opposed]'' ABCNEWS.com 27 May 2004 "Americans by nearly 2-to-1 oppose torturing terrorism suspects — but half believe the U.S. government, as a matter of policy, is doing it anyway. And even more think the government is employing physical abuse that falls short of torture in some cases."&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, so-called "enhanced interrogation" techniques were employed by the CIA in situations that did not involve the "ticking time bomb" scenario that has been the subject of opinion polls and public debate. In April 2009 a former senior U.S. intelligence official and a former Army psychiatrist stated that the Bush administration applied pressure on interrogators to use the "enhanced interrogation" techniques on detainees to find evidence of cooperation between al Qaida and the late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's regime.&lt;ref&gt;Landay, Jonathan (21 April 2009).

On 14 February 2010, in an appearance on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]], Vice-President [[Dick Cheney]] reiterated his support of [[waterboarding]] and "[[enhanced interrogation]]" techniques for captured terrorist suspects, saying, "I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program."&lt;ref name=ABCTW20100214&gt;

Pressed by the BBC in 2010 on his personal view of waterboarding, Presidential Advisor [[Karl Rove]] said: "I'm proud that we kept the world safer than it was, by the use of these techniques. They’re appropriate, they're in conformity with our international requirements and with US law."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk, 13 March 2010, "Karl Rove says water torture is justified - and a source of pride" by Giles Whittell&lt;/ref&gt;

A 15-month investigation by the Guardian and BBC Arabic, published on March 2013, disclosed that "the US sent a veteran of the ''[[dirty war]]s'' in [[Central America]] to oversee Iraqi [[commando]] units involved in acts of torture during the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|American-led occupation]]. These American citizens could theoretically be tried by the [[International Criminal Court]] even though the US is not a signatory. But it would have to be referred by the [[UN security council]] and, given that the US has a [[veto]] on the council, this hypothesis is very improbable." [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] Legal Director Kat Craig said: "This latest exposé of [[human rights abuses]] shows that torture is [[endemic]] to [[US foreign policy]]; these are considered and deliberate acts, not only sanctioned but developed by the highest echelons of [[United States Department of Defense|US security service]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/07/pentagon-investigating-link-military-torture Pentagon investigating link between US military and torture centres in Iraq.

===Effectiveness===
{{main|Effectiveness of torture for interrogation}}
There is a strong [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] argument against torture; namely, that it is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-rsquo-ve-known-for-400-years-that-torture-doesn-rsquo-t-work/|title=On Witches and Terrorists|first=Michael|last=Shermer|journal=Scientific American|volume=316|issue=5|pages=77|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0517-77|pmid=28437416|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information supporting the ineffectiveness of torture goes back centuries. For example, during [[witch trial]]s torture was routinely used to try to force subjects to admit their guilt and to identify other witches. It was found that subjects would make up stories if it meant the torture would cease.

There is no scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h4q565424126068h/|title=A utilitarian argument against torture interrogation of terrorists|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics |year=2004 |volume=10 |number=3 |page=543 |author=Jean Maria Arrigo |doi=10.1007/s11948-004-0011-y|citeseerx=10.1.1.470.9264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of scientific basis for the effectiveness of torture as an interrogation techniques is summarized in a 2006 Intelligence Science Board report titled "EDUCING INFORMATION, Interrogation: Science and Art, Foundations for the Future".&lt;ref name="Educing"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/dni/educing.pdf|title=Educing Information: Interrogation: Science and Art—Foundations for the Future|date=December 2006|publisher=National Defense Intelligence College|accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some have pointed to some specific cases where torture has elicited true information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/torturecardozo.pdf|title=J. Franklin, Evidence gained from torture: wishful thinking, checkability and extreme circumstances|year=2009|journal=Cardozo Journal of International and Comparative Law |volume= 17 |issue=2|accessdate=28 December 2009 |pages= 281–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection===
A famous example of rejection of the use of torture was cited by the Argentine [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] in whose report, Italian general [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] was reputed to have said in connection with the investigation of the disappearance of prime minister [[Aldo Moro]], "Italy can survive the loss of Aldo Moro. It would not survive the introduction of torture."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012004601/http://nuncamas.org/english/library/nevagain/nevagain_002.htm Report of Conadep (National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons): Prologue] - 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secrecy===
Before the emergence of modern policing, torture was an important aspect of policing and the use of it was openly sanctioned and acknowledged by the authority. The Economist magazine proposed that one of the reasons torture endures is that torture does indeed work in some instances to extract information/confession, if those who are being tortured are indeed guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9832909 | work=The Economist | title=Is torture ever justified? | date=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the culture, torture has at times been carried on in silence (official silence &lt;ref&gt;Bakir, V. Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles. Farnham: Ashgate (2013). Available at: http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781472402554&lt;/ref&gt;), semi-silence (known but not spoken about), or openly acknowledged in public (to instill fear and obedience).

In the 21st century, even when states sanction their interrogation methods, torturers often work outside the law. For this reason, some prefer methods that, while unpleasant, leave victims alive and unmarked. A victim with no visible damage may lack credibility when telling tales of torture, whereas a person missing fingernails or eyes can easily prove claims of torture. Mental torture, however can leave scars just as deep and long-lasting as physical torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2004a/5e.html Abu Ghraib and the ISA: What's the difference?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520150425/http://aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2004a/5e.html |date=20 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional torturers in some countries have used techniques such as electrical shock, asphyxiation, heat, cold, noise, and sleep deprivation, which leave little evidence, although in other contexts torture frequently results in horrific mutilation or death. However the most common and prevalent form of torture worldwide in both developed and under-developed countries is beating.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act40/016/2000/en/ Amnesty.org] &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|List of methods of torture}}

[[List of torture methods and devices#Psychological torture methods|Psychological torture]] uses non-physical methods that cause psychological [[suffering]]. Its effects are not immediately apparent unless they alter the [[behavior]] of the tortured person. Since there is no international political consensus on what constitutes psychological torture, it is often overlooked, denied, and referred to by different names.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Psychological torture is less well known than physical torture and tends to be subtle and much easier to conceal. In practice the distinctions between physical and psychological torture are often blurred.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Physical torture is the inflicting of severe pain or suffering on a person. In contrast, psychological torture is directed at the psyche with calculated violations of psychological needs, along with deep damage to psychological structures and the breakage of beliefs underpinning normal [[sanity]]. Torturers often inflict both types of torture in combination to compound the associated effects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Psychological torture also includes deliberate use of extreme [[psychological stress|stressors]] and situations such as [[mock execution]], [[shunning]], violation of deep-seated social or [[sexual norm]]s and [[taboo]]s, or extended [[solitary confinement]]. Because psychological torture needs no physical violence to be effective, it is possible to induce severe psychological pain, suffering, and [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] with no externally visible effects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

[[Rape]] and other forms of [[sexual abuse]] are often used as methods of torture for interrogative or punitive purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Nooria | last=Mehraby | url=http://www.startts.org.au/default.aspx?id=201 | title=Refugee Women: The Authentic Heroines | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830113952/http://www.startts.org.au/default.aspx?id=201 |archivedate=30 August 2007 }} &lt;!-- Must be a more reliable source than this! --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medical torture]], medical practitioners use torture to judge what victims can endure, to apply treatments that enhance torture, or act as torturers in their own right. [[Josef Mengele]] and [[Shirō Ishii]] were infamous during and after [[World War II]] for their involvement in medical torture and murder. In recent years, however, there has been a push to end medical complicity in torture through both international and state-based legal strategies, as well as litigations against individual physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hoffman | first = S.

== Murder ==

{{original research|section|date=February 2017}}
{{Main|Torture murder}}

Torture murder involves torture to the point of murder. [[Murderer]]s might also torture their victims to death for sadistic reasons. [[Al-Qaida|Some terrorist groups]] torture—typically commencing with the forcible extraction of all ten fingernails, all ten toenails, and all thirty-two teeth—before executing the victim by such barbaric techniques as slow decapitation via butcher knife.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Ancient conceptual forerunners of torture murder include [[drawing and quartering]] and [[flaying]].

==Effects==
The consequences of torture reach far beyond immediate pain. Many victims suffer from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), which includes symptoms such as flashbacks (or intrusive thoughts), severe anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, depression and memory lapses. Torture victims often feel guilt and shame, triggered by the humiliation they have endured. Many feel that they have betrayed themselves or their friends and family. All such symptoms are normal human responses to abnormal and inhuman treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irct.org/what-is-torture/defining-torture.aspx |title= What is torture? |publisher=IRCT |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations like [[Freedom from Torture]] and the [[Center for Victims of Torture]] try to help survivors of torture obtain medical treatment and to gain [[forensic]] medical [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to obtain [[refugee|political asylum]] in a safe country or to prosecute the perpetrators.

Torture is often difficult to prove, particularly when some time has passed between the event and a medical examination, or when the torturers are immune from prosecution. Many torturers around the world use methods designed to have a maximum psychological impact while leaving only minimal physical traces. Medical and Human Rights Organizations worldwide have collaborated to produce the [[Istanbul Protocol]], a document designed to outline common torture methods, consequences of torture, and medico-legal examination techniques. Typically deaths due to torture are shown in an autopsy as being due to "natural causes" like heart attack, inflammation, or [[embolism]] due to extreme [[stress (medicine)|stress]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

For survivors, torture often leads to lasting [[mental health|mental]] and physical health problems.

Physical problems can be wide-ranging, e.g. [[sexually transmitted diseases]], musculo-skeletal problems, [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]], post-traumatic [[epilepsy]] and [[dementia]] or chronic pain syndromes.

On 19 August 2007, the [[American Psychology Association]] (APA) voted to bar participation, to intervene to stop, and to report involvement in a wide variety of interrogation techniques as torture, including "using [[mock execution]]s, simulated drowning, sexual and religious humiliation, stress positions or sleep deprivation", as well as "the exploitation of prisoners' phobias, the use of mind-altering drugs, [[hooding]], forced nakedness, the use of dogs to frighten detainees, exposing prisoners to extreme heat and cold, physical assault and threatening the use of such techniques against a prisoner or a prisoner's family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/19/AR2007081901513.html|title=APA Rules on Interrogation Abuse|website=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the APA rejected a stronger resolution that sought to prohibit "all psychologist involvement, either direct or indirect, in any interrogations at U.S. detention centers for foreign detainees or citizens detained outside normal legal channels." That resolution would have placed the APA alongside the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association in limiting professional involvement in such settings to direct patient care. The APA echoed the Bush administration by condemning isolation, sleep deprivation, and sensory deprivation or over-stimulation only when they are likely to cause lasting harm.

Psychiatric treatment of torture-related medical problems might require a wide range of expertise and often specialized experience. Common treatments are [[psychotropic]] [[medication]], e.g. [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] [[antidepressants]], [[counseling]], [[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy]], [[family systems therapy]] and [[physiotherapy]].

:''See [[Psychology of torture]] for psychological impact, and aftermath, of torture.''

==Rehabilitation==

The aim of rehabilitation is to empower the torture victim to resume as full a life as possible. Rebuilding the life of someone whose dignity has been destroyed takes time and as a result long-term material, medical, psychological and social support is needed.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rehabilitation|url=http://www.irct.org/what-is-torture/rehabilitation.aspx|website=What is torture?|publisher=International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT)|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment must be a coordinated effort that covers both physical and psychological aspects. It is important to take into consideration the patients' needs, problems, expectations, views and cultural references.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

The consequences of torture are likely to be influenced by many internal and external factors. Therefore, rehabilitation needs to employ different treatment approaches, taking into account the victims' individual needs, as well as the cultural, social and political environment.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

Rehabilitation centres around the world, notably the members of the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]], commonly offer multi-disciplinary support and counselling, including:
*medical attention / psychotherapeutic treatment
*psychosocial support / trauma treatment
*legal services and redress
*social reintegration.
In the case of asylum seekers and refugees, the services may also include assisting in documentation of torture for the asylum decision, language classes and help in finding somewhere to live and work.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

===Rehabilitation of secondary survivors===
In the worst case, torture can affect several generations. The physical and mental after-effects of torture often place great strain on the entire family and society. Children are particularly vulnerable. They often suffer from feelings of guilt or personal responsibility for what has happened. Therefore, other members of the survivor’s family – in particular the spouse and children – are also offered treatment and counselling.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

===Broken societies===
In some instances, whole societies can be more or less traumatized where torture has been used in a systematic and widespread manner. In general, after years of [[Social repression|repression]], [[wikt:conflict|conflict]] and [[war]], regular support networks and structures have often been broken or destroyed.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

Providing [[peer support|psychosocial support]] and [[redress]] to survivors of torture and trauma can help reconstruct broken societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.rct.dk/media/1195332/fieldmanual_ver1.pdf|title=Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims: Field Manual on Rehabilitation (2007)|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Rehabilitation centres therefore play a key role in promoting democracy, co-existence and respect for human rights. They provide support and hope, and act as a symbol of triumph over the manmade terror of torture which can hold back the development of democracy of entire societies."&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

'''''Viacom International, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc.''''', No. 07 Civ. 2103, is a [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]] case in which [[Viacom]] [[lawsuit|sued]] [[YouTube]], a video-sharing site owned by [[Google]], alleging that YouTube had engaged in "brazen" and "massive" [[copyright infringement]] by allowing users to upload and view hundreds of thousands of videos owned by Viacom without permission.&lt;ref name=initial-Complaint&gt;{{cite web|title=Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Damages by Viacom against Google|url=https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/New_York_Southern_District_Court/1--07-cv-02103/Viacom_International_Inc_et_al_v_Youtube_Inc_et_al/1/|publisher=Docket Alarm, Inc.|accessdate=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A motion for [[summary judgment]] seeking dismissal was filed by Google and was granted in 2010 on the grounds that the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]'s "[[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]]" provisions shielded Google from Viacom's copyright infringement claims.&lt;ref name=2010Opinion&gt;{{cite web|title=Opinion and Order Granting Summary Judgment that Defendant YouTube Qualifies for Protection of 17 U.

==Background==
On March 13, 2007, Viacom filed a US $1 billion [[lawsuit]] against [[Google]] and [[YouTube]] alleging that the site had engaged in "brazen" [[copyright infringement]] by allowing users to upload and view copyrighted material owned by Viacom.&lt;ref name=Complaint-via-WSJ&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/ViacomYouTubeComplaint3-12-07.pdf] Text of complaint&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint stated that over 150,000 unauthorized clips of Viacom's programming, such as ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[The Daily Show]]'', had been made available on YouTube, and that these clips had collectively been viewed more than 1.5 billion times.

Viacom claimed that YouTube had infringed on its copyrights by performing, displaying, and reproducing Viacom's copyrighted works. Furthermore, the complaint contended that the defendants "engage in, promote and induce" the infringement, and that they had deliberately built up a library of infringing works in order to increase the site's traffic (and advertising revenue).&lt;ref name=Complaint-via-WSJ/&gt; In total, Viacom claimed three counts of direct infringement, and three counts of [[secondary liability|indirect infringement]], specifically [[inducement]], [[contributory liability|contributory infringement]] and [[vicarious liability|vicarious infringement]].&lt;ref name=VerSteeg&gt;VerSteeg, Russ. [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ncjl9&amp;div=6&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals Viacom v. YouTube: Preliminary Observations], North Carolina Journal of Law and Technology, Volume 9, Issue 1, Fall 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Viacom did not seek damages for any actions after Google put its Content ID filtering system in place in early 2008.&lt;ref name=ruling_nyt&gt;{{Cite news|title=Judge Sides With Google in Viacom Video Suit|author=Helft, Miguel|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/technology/24google.html|date=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was later merged with similar complaints being pursued by the [[Premier League|English Premier League]] and other copyright holders.&lt;ref name=ruling_afp&gt;{{Cite news|title=US judge tosses out Viacom copyright suit against YouTube|author=Lefkow, Chris|publisher=AFP|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h_AfErLSMMGD417l8aR0CYib0aNQ|accessdate=June 24, 2010|date=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==District Court proceedings==
In July 2008, during the pre-trial [[Discovery (law)|discovery phase]], Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over data detailing the viewing habits of every user who had ever watched videos on the site. The move led to concerns that the viewing habits of individual users could be identified through a combination of their [[Internet protocol|IP]] addresses and usernames. The decision was criticized by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], which called the court ruling "a setback to privacy rights,"&lt;ref name=privacy_afp&gt;{{Cite news|title=Judge orders Google to give YouTube user data to Viacom |date=July 4, 2008 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvFPgT3MNrzaN7r-Y37eFI-qv4bA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702111029/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvFPgT3MNrzaN7r-Y37eFI-qv4bA |archivedate=2 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and privacy advocates such as [[Simon Davies (privacy advocate)|Simon Davies]], who stated that the privacy of millions of YouTube users was threatened.&lt;ref name=privacy_bbc&gt;{{Cite news|title=Google must divulge YouTube Log|date=July 3, 2008|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7488009.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Louis Stanton]] dismissed the privacy concerns as "speculative", and ordered YouTube to hand over documents totaling around 12 terabytes of data.&lt;ref name=privacy_nyt&gt;{{Cite news|title=Google Told to Turn Over User Data of YouTube|last=Helft|first=Miguel|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/04/technology/04youtube.html|date=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Stanton held that because YouTube is not a "videotape service provider" as defined in the [[Video Privacy Protection Act]], its users' data was not protected under the act. However, Judge Stanton rejected Viacom's request that YouTube hand over the [[source code]] of its [[search engine (computing)|search engine]], saying that it was a "[[trade secret]]". As a result of the data handover, many users began posting videos under the group name "Viacom Sucks!", often containing large amounts of [[profanity]].&lt;ref name=privacy_bbc/&gt;

However, in July 2008, Google and Viacom agreed that Google could anonymize all the data before giving it to Viacom.&lt;ref name=privacy_guardian&gt;{{Cite news|title=Google and Viacom reach deal over YouTube user data|last=Sweeney|first=Mark|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/15/googlethemedia.digitalmedia|date=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privacy deal also applied to other litigants including the English Premier League, the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] Organization and the [[Scottish Premier League]].&lt;ref name=privacy_reuters&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lawyers in YouTube lawsuit reach user privacy deal|last=Auchard|first=Eric|publisher=[[Reuters]]|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSSP21085220080715|date=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the deal exempted employees of both the defendants and the plaintiffs, whose de-anonymized data was provided separately.

The employee data was later used in filings by both sides. Viacom cited internal e-mails sent among YouTube's founders discussing how to deal with clips uploaded to YouTube that were obviously the property of major media conglomerates. Google stated that Viacom itself had "hired no fewer than 18 different marketing agencies to upload its content to the site".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/03/broadcast-yourself.html|title=Broadcast Yourself|author=Zahavah Levine|date=March 18, 2010|work=The Official YouTube Blog|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google argued that since Viacom and its lawyers were "unable to recognize that dozens of the clips alleged as infringements in this case were uploaded to YouTube with Viacom's express authorization, "it was unreasonable to expect Google's employees to know which videos were uploaded without permission."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Viacom Says YouTube Ignored Copyright|author=Helft, Miguel| newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/technology/19youtube.html|date=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's chief counsel later publicly elaborated on the allegations:

{{quote|For years, Viacom continuously and secretly uploaded its content to YouTube, even while publicly complaining about its presence there. It hired no fewer than 18 different marketing agencies to upload its content to the site. It deliberately "roughed up" the videos to make them look stolen or leaked. It opened YouTube accounts using phony email addresses. It even sent employees to Kinko's to upload clips from computers that couldn't be traced to Viacom. And in an effort to promote its own shows, as a matter of company policy Viacom routinely left up clips from shows that had been uploaded to YouTube by ordinary users. Executives as high up as the president of Comedy Central and the head of MTV Networks felt "very strongly" that clips from shows like The Daily Show and The Colbert Report should remain on YouTube. Viacom's efforts to disguise its promotional use of YouTube worked so well that even its own employees could not keep track of everything it was posting or leaving up on the site. As a result, on countless occasions Viacom demanded the removal of clips that it had uploaded to YouTube, only to return later to sheepishly ask for their reinstatement. In fact, some of the very clips that Viacom is suing us over were actually uploaded by Viacom itself.|Zahavah Levine, Chief Counsel, YouTube|4=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/03/broadcast-yourself.html|title=Broadcast Yourself|date=March 18, 2010|last=Levine|first=Zahavah|accessdate=August 22, 2013|work=YouTube Official Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==2010 District Court ruling==
On June 23, 2010, Judge [[Louis Stanton|Stanton]] granted Google's motion for summary judgment, holding that Google was protected by provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], notwithstanding evidence of intentional copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=2010Opinion/&gt;&lt;ref name=ruling_afp/&gt; The judge held that while the company undeniably had general knowledge that some copyrighted material had been uploaded by users, it did not know which clips had been uploaded with permission and which had not.&lt;ref name=ruling_nyt/&gt; He said that mandating video-sharing sites to proactively police every uploaded video "would contravene the structure and operation of the D.M.C.A."&lt;ref name=ruling_nyt/&gt; As evidence that the [[OCILLA|notification regime specified by the DMCA]] was effective, Stanton noted that YouTube had successfully addressed a mass take-down notice issued by Viacom in 2007. The judge rejected Viacom's comparisons between YouTube and other Internet-based, media-sharing companies, such as [[Grokster]], that had previously been found guilty of indirect copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=ruling_nyt/&gt; The ruling also reversed the court order issued in July 2008.

Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling.&lt;ref name=ruling_afp/&gt;

==2012 Appellate Court ruling==
The appeal was argued before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] in August 2011, and the decision was issued on April 5, 2012.&lt;ref name=appeal2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/ad840309-cbc2-47e1-95bb-73e8784e413c/1/doc/10-3270_10-3342_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/ad840309-cbc2-47e1-95bb-73e8784e413c/1/hilite/|format=PDF|title=10-3270, 10-3342 Viacom Int'l, Inc., Football Ass'n Premier League Ltd. v.

Judges [[José A. Cabranes|Cabranes]] and [[Debra Ann Livingston|Livingston]] reversed Judge Stanton's grant of summary judgment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viacom wins second round of copyright battle against YouTube|work=CNet|author=Greg Sandoval|date=April 5, 2012|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-57409924-261/viacom-wins-second-round-of-copyright-battle-against-youtube/}}&lt;/ref&gt; holding that "a reasonable jury could find that YouTube had actual knowledge or awareness of specific infringing activity on its website"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/appeals-court-revives-viacom-suit-against-youtube/|title=Appeals Court Revives Viacom Suit Against YouTube|author=Brian Stelter|work=New York Times|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, contrary to the Ninth Circuit's dismissal of the [[Veoh]] case (''[[UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Shelter Capital Partners LLC|UMG v. Shelter Partners]]''), that the right and ability to control infringing activity need not require knowledge of specific infringements.&lt;ref name=appeal2012/&gt; Thus, the case was again eligible for a jury trial.&lt;ref name=goldman/&gt;

However, the court upheld one aspect of Stanton's ruling. The plaintiffs had argued that four of YouTube's software functions relating to user uploads disqualified the service from safe harbor protection, but the appeals court agreed with the lower court in that three of the functions—transcoding, playback, and related-video thumbnails&lt;ref name=goldman/&gt;— were within the scope of safe harbor.&lt;ref name=appeal2012/&gt; The fourth function, syndication,&lt;ref name=goldman/&gt; was remanded for further fact-finding.&lt;ref name=appeal2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viacom's Copyright Suit Against Google's YouTube Reinstated|work=Bloomberg L.P.|date=April 5, 2012|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-05/google-s-youtube-must-defend-viacom-suit-appeals-court-says-1-.html|author=David Glovin|author2=Don Jeffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 District Court ruling==
On April 18, 2013, Judge Stanton issued another order granting summary judgment in favor of YouTube.&lt;ref name=April18SJOrder/&gt; Following the remand from the Second Circuit court of appeals, Stanton ruled on four issues in his decision:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(A) Whether … YouTube had knowledge or awareness of any specific infringements … ; 
(B) Whether … YouTube willfully blinded itself …;
(C) Whether YouTube had the "right and ability to control" infringing activity …; and
(D) Whether any clips … were syndicated ….
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Judge Stanton ruled in favor of YouTube on all four issues finding that YouTube had no actual knowledge of any specific instance of infringement of Viacom's works, and therefore could not have "willfully blinded itself". He also ruled that YouTube did not have the "right and ability to control" infringing activity because "there is no evidence that YouTube induced its users to submit infringing videos, provided users with detailed instructions about what content to upload or edited their content, prescreened submissions for quality, steered users to infringing videos, or otherwise interacted with infringing users to a point where it might be said to have participated in their activity."&lt;ref name=April18SJOrder/&gt; This ruling came despite statements made by YouTube employees that "[we should grow] as aggressively as we can through whatever tactics, however evil.… [the site is] out of control with copyrighted material  … [if we remove] the obviously copyright infringing stuff … site traffic [would] drop to maybe 20% … steal it!"&lt;ref name=Viacom2013OpptoMotion&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment|url=https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/New_York_Southern_District_Court/1--07-cv-02103/Viacom_International_Inc_et_al_v_Youtube_Inc_et_al/446/|publisher=Docket Alarm, Inc.|author=Black Entertainment Television, LLC, Comedy Partners, Country Music Television, Inc., Paramount Pictures Corporation, Viacom International, Inc.|date=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All quotations were argued to be taken out of context. The ruling was entered as final on April 29, 2013.&lt;ref name=docket/&gt;

An appeal was begun, but the week before the parties were to appear in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a settlement was announced, and it was reported that no money changed hands.&lt;ref name=Reuters20140318&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/us-google-viacom-lawsuit-idUSBREA2H11220140318|date=March 18, 2014|last=Stempel|first=Jonathan|publisher=Reuters|title=Google, Viacom settle landmark YouTube lawsuit}}&lt;/ref&gt;
